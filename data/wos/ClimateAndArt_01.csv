A key question is how these changes can be achieved, by regulation or shifts of consciousness on the parts of individuals. Among the means by which a shift of awareness might occur is cultural work - including the production and reception of art and literature. But does art which represents climate change distance or normalize the problem, or can new kinds of art construct new ways in which to see or intervene in the conditions and systems which produce global warming? The article considers recent exhibitions of art dealing with environmental and climate change issues in the UK and USA. Before that, the article summarizes aspects of recent relevant work on art by geographers. Looking at cases of environmentalist art, the article initially differentiates art representing climate change in dramatic images from an emerging tendency to practical intervention. It argues that art may contribute to a shift in attitudes, but wonders whether intervention-as-art is in its way another form of representation, and whether art inevitably distances whatever problems it addresses. This is an insoluble difficulty: the real is always mediated and distanced in culture, yet art may still draw attention to conditions and to the inherent contradictions they contain.","Univ Plymouth, Sch Art & Media, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England",University of Plymouth,"Miles, M (corresponding author), Univ Plymouth, Sch Art & Media, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England.",M.F.Miles@plymouth.ac.uk,,,,,,,50,42,42,3,25,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1474-4740,1477-0881,,CULT GEOGR,Cult.

Artists can act as buffers between the public and scientific data as well as motivate a more enriching dialogue through the impact of art that addresses climate change. In other words, artists play an increasingly significant role in both raising awareness of and engaging the public on the issue of climate. Artists can turn their works into an effective tool for climate communication thanks to a number of psychological qualities that artwork provides. The message conveyed by a work of climate change art transcends mere intellectual communication because it appeals to the viewer's emotions, invites them to contemplate and interiorize the reality of climate, inspires them and makes them aspire to make decisions and take actions that might change the future of our planet.","[Chen, Mei-Hsin] Univ Navarra, Pamplona, Spain",University of Navarra,"Chen, MH (corresponding author), Univ Navarra, Pamplona, Spain.",mchen@unav.es,"Chen, Mei-Hsin/K-2867-2017","Chen, Mei-Hsin/0000-0002-2378-2821",,,,,101,0,0,5,5,"UNIV COSTA RICA, EDITORIAL",SAN JOSE,"SEDE RODRIGO FACIO BRENES, MONTES DE OCA, SAN JOSE, 00000, COSTA RICA",2215-2253,2215-3934,,R HUMANIDAD,R.

Aiming to initiate a climate-centered dialogue, a hybrid team of scientists and artists collected local narratives within the Kerourien neighbourhood, in the city of Brest in Brittany, France. Kerourien is a place known for its stigmatizing crime, poverty, marginalization and state of disrepair. Social work is higher on the agenda than climate action. The team thus acknowledged that local narratives might not make much mention of climate change, and recognized part of the work might be to shift awareness to the actual or potential, current or future, connections between everyday non-climate concerns and climate issues. Such a shift called for a practical intervention, centered on local culture. The narrative collection process was dovetailed with preparing the neighbourhood's 50th anniversary celebration and establishing a series of art performances to celebrate the neighbourhood and its residents. Non-climate and quasi-climate stories were collected, documented, and turned into art forms. The elements of climate service co-production in this process are twofold. First, they point to the ways in which non-climate change related local concerns may be mapped out in relation to climate change adaptation, showing how non-climate change concerns call for climate information. Secondly, they show how the co-production of climate services may go beyond the provision of climate information by generating procedural benefits such as local empowerment - thus generating capacities that may be mobilized to face climate change. We conclude by stressing that place-based climate service co-production for action may require questioning the nature of the services rendered, questioning the nature of place, and questioning what action entails. We offer leads for addressing these questions in ways that help realise empowerment and greater social justice.","[Baztan, Juan; Vanderlinden, Jean-Paul; Zhu, Zhiwei] Univ Paris Saclay, CEARC, UVSQ, F-78280 Guyancourt, France; [Jaffres, Lionel] Le Grain, F-29200 Brest, France; [Jorgensen, Bethany] Cornell Univ, Civ Ecol Lab, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA",UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; Cornell University,"Baztan, J (corresponding author), Univ Paris Saclay, CEARC, UVSQ, F-78280 Guyancourt, France.",juan.baztan@uvsq.fr,,"Jorgensen, Bethany/0000-0002-8216-1398",FORMAS (SE); BELSPO (BE); BMBF (DE); BMWFW (AT); IFD (DK); MINECO (ES); ANR (FR); European Union [690462],FORMAS (SE); BELSPO (BE); BMBF (DE)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); BMWFW (AT); IFD (DK); MINECO (ES)(Spanish Government); ANR (FR)(French National Research Agency (ANR)); European Union(European Commission),"Thanks to All the Kerourien inhabitants for their kindness.

This article makes two key contributions.. First, it analyses the literature across social psychology and participatory arts to demonstrate why participatory, climate change based arts interventions could hold the key to more effective approaches to engaging multiple publics in climate compatible behaviour change. Second, using a small sample of participants in an arts based climate change intervention, in the Inner Hebrides, Scotland, it demonstrates the potential value of combining social science techniques (in this case Q Methodology) with participatory arts interventions to better understand and learn from the ways in which climate based arts interventions achieve affective public engagement with climate change.

It documents artists' and scientists' imaginations of their encounter and analyses them drawing on the concepts of boundary object and boundary work. Conceptually, the paper argues to broaden the idea of boundary objects to include inhibitory boundary objects that hinder rather than facilitate communication across boundaries. This focus on failures to link social worlds brings the boundary object concept closer to Gieryn's boundary work and allows for a co-application of the two concepts in the analysis of cross-boundary communication. Empirically, the paper provides an in-depth ethnographic description of an art-science project as a resource for future practice. In conclusion, the art-science encounter included meeting points as well as multiple levels of boundary work which engaged the artists in a different way than as illustrators of scientific representations of climate change. The closer they got to the research practice the more the public and policy construct of climate change disappeared. Rather than political activism, the approach triggered explorations of the scientific context, including affirmative as well as critical re-imaginations of research practices. Artists and scientists acted as publics for one another, as resources to draw on for reflection and self-identification. But instead of cutting back or renegotiating standards of one's own practice, especially the artists engaged in boundary work creating space to produce a piece of art according to their own criteria of quality and relevance.","[Roedder, Simone] Univ Hamburg, Inst Sociol, Dept Social Sci, Grindelberg 5, D-20144 Hamburg, Germany",University of Hamburg,"Rodder, S (corresponding author), Univ Hamburg, Inst Sociol, Dept Social Sci, Grindelberg 5, D-20144 Hamburg, Germany.",simone.roedder@uni-hamburg.de,,,German-Research-Foundation (DFG) [DFG EXC 177 CliSAP]; Fulbright,German-Research-Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Fulbright,"The visiting artist researcher project was supported by the German-Research-Foundation (DFG)-funded Cluster of Excellence Integrated Climate System Analysis and Prediction at the University of Hamburg (DFG EXC 177 CliSAP).

However, empowering young people to be systems changers is not straightforward. It is particularly challenging within educational systems that prioritize instrumental learning over critical thinking and creative actions. History has shown that by creating novel spaces for reflexivity and experimentation, the arts have played a role in shifting mindsets and opening up new political horizons. In this paper, we explore the role of art as a driver for societal transformation in a changing climate and consider how an experiment with change can facilitate reflection on relationships between individual change and systems change. Following a review of the literature on transformations, transformative learning and the role of art, we describe an experiment with change carried out with students at an Art High School in Lisbon, Portugal, which involved choosing one sustainable behavior and adopting it for 30 days. A transformative program encouraged regular reflection and group discussions. During the experiment, students started developing an art project about his or her experience with change. The results show that a transformative learning approach that engages students with art can support critical thinking and climate change awareness, new perspectives and a sense of empowerment. Experiential, arts-based approaches also have the potential to create direct and indirect effects beyond the involved participants. We conclude that climate-related art projects can serve as more than a form of science communication. They represent a process of opening up imaginative spaces where audiences can move more freely and reconsider the role of humans as responsible beings with agency and a stake in sustainability transformations.","[Bentz, Julia] Univ Lisbon, Fac Sci, Ctr Ecol Evolut & Environm Changes Ce3c, Lisbon, Portugal; [O'Brien, Karen] Univ Oslo, Dept Sociol & Human Geog, Oslo, Norway",Universidade de Lisboa; University of Oslo,"Bentz, J (corresponding author), Univ Lisbon, Fac Sci, Ctr Ecol Evolut & Environm Changes Ce3c, Lisbon, Portugal.",jhbentz@fc.ul.pt,"Bentz, Julia/M-3774-2015","Bentz, Julia/0000-0001-5120-9371","Research Council of Norway; University of Oslo through the Adaptation CONNECTS project [250434]; Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology, FCT [SFRH/BPD/115656/2016]","Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway); University of Oslo through the Adaptation CONNECTS project; Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology, FCT(Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology)","This paper has been supported through funding from the Research Council of Norway, the University of Oslo through the Adaptation CONNECTS project (Project 250434) and the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology, FCT (reference SFRH/BPD/115656/2016).",,112,14,14,4,28,UNIV CALIFORNIA PRESS,OAKLAND,"155 GRAND AVE, SUITE 400, OAKLAND, CA 94612-3758 USA",2325-1026,,,ELEMENTA-SCI ANTHROP,Elementa-Sci.

Arts-sciences discourses are one area in which increasing numbers of practitioners and researchers are exploring ways in which interdisciplinarity may provide a space for reconsidering the role of cultural and creative responses to environmental change. Yet what new perspectives does the arts-science intersection offer for rethinking climate change? Which historic conjunctions of arts-sciences are most useful to consider in relation to present-day practices, or in what ways do these previous alignments significantly shift in response to climate change? The uncertainty, contingency, and experimentation necessarily characteristic of climate change may generate emergent forms of practice that require new approaches-not just to arts and sciences, but also at the new thresholds, or 'meetings and mutations' that these practices cross. Thresholds-narrated here through the figure of 'zero degrees'-offer a way to bring together sites of encounter, transformations, uncertainties, future scenarios, material conditions and political practices in relation to climate change. Such shifting thresholds and relations lead not to fundamental redefinitions or demarcations of arts and sciences, arguably, but rather to shared encounters with politics. Drawing on philosophies of aesthetics and sciences elaborated by Jacques Ranciere and Isabelle Stengers, we point to the ways in which political possibility is entangled with aesthetic-material conditions and practices, and how recognition of these interrelations might enable 'collective experimentation' within both creative practices and climate sciences.","[Gabrys, Jennifer] Univ London, Dept Design, London SE14 6NW, England; [Yusoff, Kathryn] Univ Lancaster, Lancaster Environm Ctr, Lancaster, England",University of London; Lancaster University,"Gabrys, J (corresponding author), Univ London, Dept Design, 13 Laurie Grove, London SE14 6NW, England.",j.gabrys@gold.ac.uk,,"Gabrys, Jennifer/0000-0001-5545-2459",Natural Environment Research Council [ceh010010] Funding Source: researchfish,Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),,,75,67,67,1,31,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0950-5431,,,SCI CULT-UK,Sci.

We use the UK Climate Projections 2018 as an example of such information. Their probabilistic, global, and regional land projections exemplify some of the key methodologies that are at the forefront of constructing regional climate information for decision support in adapting to a changing climate. We assess the quality of the evidence and the methodology used to support their statements about future regional climate along six quality dimensions: transparency; theory; independence, number, and comprehensiveness of evidence; and historical empirical adequacy. The assessment produced two major insights. First, a major issue that taints the quality of UKCP18 is the lack of transparency, which is particularly problematic since the information is directed towards non-expert users who would need to develop technical skills to evaluate the quality and epistemic reliability of this information. Second, the probabilistic projections are of lower quality than the global projections because the former lack both transparency and a theory underpinning the method used to produce quantified uncertainty estimates about future climate. The assessment also shows how different dimensions are satisfied depending on the evidence used, the methodology chosen to analyze the evidence, and the type of statements that are constructed in the different strands of UKCP18. This research highlights the importance of knowledge quality assessment of regional climate information that intends to support climate change adaptation decisions.","[Pacchetti, Marina Baldissera; Dessai, Suraje] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Pacchetti, Marina Baldissera; Dessai, Suraje; Bradley, Seamus] Univ Leeds, ESRC Ctr Climate Change Econ & Policy, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Stainforth, David A.] London Sch Econ, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, London, England; [Stainforth, David A.] London Sch Econ, ESRC Ctr Climate Change Econ & Policy, London, England; [Stainforth, David A.] Univ Warwick, Dept Phys, Coventry, W Midlands, England; [Bradley, Seamus] Univ Leeds, Sch Philosophy Relig & Hist Sci, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England",University of Leeds; UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC); University of Leeds; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC); University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of Warwick; University of Leeds,"Pacchetti, MB (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England.;Pacchetti, MB (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, ESRC Ctr Climate Change Econ & Policy, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England.",m.baldisserapacchetti@leeds.ac.uk; s.dessai@leeds.ac.uk; d.a.stainforth@lse.ac.uk; s.c.bradley@leeds.ac.uk,"Dessai, Suraje/D-4219-2009","Dessai, Suraje/0000-0002-7879-9364; Stainforth, David/0000-0001-6476-733X; Baldissera Pacchetti, Marina/0000-0002-5867-6893","U.K. Economic and Social Research Council Centre for Climate Change, Economics and Policy (CCCEP) [ES/R009708/1]; Research England QR-SPF at the University of Leeds","U.K. Economic and Social Research Council Centre for Climate Change, Economics and Policy (CCCEP); Research England QR-SPF at the University of Leeds","This research was supported by the U.K. Economic and Social Research Council (ES/R009708/1) Centre for Climate Change, Economics and Policy (CCCEP) and Research England QR-SPF at the University of Leeds.",,61,0,0,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

What are the roles of public space? How do artworks intervene in urban public space? How can public art contribute to sustainability issues? I have argued that the intervention of art in urban public space offers effective ways of developing climate change art, which is understood to be an educator. Public space can be categorized into three different types: everyday, social, and symbolic spaces. These can be used as a platform for opening discussion and learning about the increased issues of the global crisis in contemporary society. I have drawn upon the representative case studies about climate change to explore how they intervene in urban public space and how they engage viewers to spread awareness, which is one of the fundamental aspects of this paper. It also stimulates viewers' perceptions and awareness of a more sustainable future through phenomenological and emotional experiences. Thus, this paper contributes to the understanding and knowledge of the relationship between art and public space with respect to raising awareness about climate change and considering how art intervenes in urban public space to create an eco-didactic platform.","[Lee, Keunhye] Gachon Univ, Dept Interior Architecture, Seongnam Si 13120, South Korea",Gachon University,"Lee, K (corresponding author), Gachon Univ, Dept Interior Architecture, Seongnam Si 13120, South Korea.",narykh.lee@gmail.com,,"Lee, Keunhye/0000-0003-2598-0853",,,,,62,1,1,7,24,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,MAR,2021,5,,,,,,2915,10.3390/su13052915,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13052915,,,17,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,QW5DU,,"Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000628671100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

There is a growing recognition that education needs to change in order to address climate change, yet the question remains how? How does one engage young people with a topic that is perceived as abstract, distant, and complex, and which at the same time is contributing to growing feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and anxiety among them? In this paper, I argue that although the important contributions that the arts and humanities can make to this challenge are widely discussed, they remain an untapped or underutilized potential. I then present a novel framework and demonstrate its use in schools. Findings from a high school in Portugal point to the central place that art can play in climate change education and engagement more general, with avenues for greater depth of learning and transformative potential. The paper provides guidance for involvementin,with, andthroughart and makes suggestions to create links between disciplines to support meaning-making, create new images, and metaphors and bring in a wider solution space for climate change. Going beyond the stereotypes of art as communication and mainstream climate change education, it offers teachers, facilitators, and researchers a wider portfolio for climate change engagement that makes use of the multiple potentials of the arts.","[Bentz, Julia] Univ Lisbon, Fac Sci, Ctr Ecol Evolut & Environm Changes Ce3c, Bldg C1,4th Floor,Room 38, P-1749016 Lisbon, Portugal; [Bentz, Julia] Univ Nova Lisboa, CICS NOVA Interdisciplinary Ctr Social Sci, Campus Campolide, P-1070312 Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade de Lisboa; Universidade Nova de Lisboa,"Bentz, J (corresponding author), Univ Lisbon, Fac Sci, Ctr Ecol Evolut & Environm Changes Ce3c, Bldg C1,4th Floor,Room 38, P-1749016 Lisbon, Portugal.;Bentz, J (corresponding author), Univ Nova Lisboa, CICS NOVA Interdisciplinary Ctr Social Sci, Campus Campolide, P-1070312 Lisbon, Portugal.",jhbentz@fc.ul.pt,"Bentz, Julia/M-3774-2015","Bentz, Julia/0000-0001-5120-9371","FCT - Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia [UIDB/00329/2020]; CICS.NOVA - Interdisciplinary Centre of Social Sciences of the Universidade Nova de Lisboa [UID/SOC/04647/2019]; BPD grant [SFRH/BPD/115656/2016]; FCT/MCTES through National funds; project AdaptationCONNECTS, University of Oslo","FCT - Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia(Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology); CICS.NOVA - Interdisciplinary Centre of Social Sciences of the Universidade Nova de Lisboa; BPD grant; FCT/MCTES through National funds(Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology); project AdaptationCONNECTS, University of Oslo","This work was funded by national funds through FCT - Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia in the frame of the project UIDB/00329/2020 and with the support of CICS.NOVA - Interdisciplinary Centre of Social Sciences of the Universidade Nova de Lisboa, UID/SOC/04647/2019.

Community action has become a key part of UK government policy as it has sought to address climate change. There is, however, limited empirical research that community initiatives work; this study contributes to filling that gap. Applying some key concepts from critical realism and drawing extensively on Margaret Archer's notion of the internal conversation, the study monitors the influence of a change-oriented intervention - in this case a community arts programme - designed to engage people with climate change. Although only exploratory, it finds evidence that the programme had prompted the internal conversation; enabled some participants to take action; and generated a more collective conversation with practical consequences.","[Evans, Eleri] Swansea Univ, Swansea, W Glam, Wales",Swansea University,"Evans, E (corresponding author), Swansea Univ, Dept Geog, Singleton Pk, Swansea, W Glam, Wales.",eleri.evans@talk21.com,,,Knowledge Economy Skills Scholarships (KESS); Bangor University; Welsh Government's European Social Fund (ESF) convergence programme,Knowledge Economy Skills Scholarships (KESS); Bangor University; Welsh Government's European Social Fund (ESF) convergence programme,"I would like to thank the two anonymous reviewers and the co-editors of this special edition for their helpful comments.

Quantitative methods leave out important ethical considerations such as justice, fairness, autonomy and legitimacy. We argue that emotions and art can play an important role in ethical deliberation about geoengineering. Emotions can point out what morally matters. We also examine the role that works of art can play. Recently, artists have become involved with risky technologies. We argue that such artworks can contribute to emotional-moral reflection and public deliberation on geoengineering, by making abstract problems more concrete, letting us broaden narrow personal perspectives, exploring new scenarios, and challenging our imagination.","[Roeser, Sabine; Taebi, Behnam; Doorn, Neelke] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Technol Policy & Management, Dept Values Technol & Innovat, Eth & Philosophy Technol Sect, Delft, Netherlands",Delft University of Technology,"Roeser, S (corresponding author), Delft Univ Technol, Fac Technol Policy & Management, Dept Values Technol & Innovat, Eth & Philosophy Technol Sect, Delft, Netherlands.",S.Roeser@tudelft.nl,,"Doorn, Neelke/0000-0002-1090-579X",,,,,79,5,5,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-8230,1743-8772,,CRIT REV INT SOC POL,Crit.

Interior environment in museums is defined by two important requirements: the preservation of works of art, and the comfort of visitors or individuals who work in these buildings. The research problem under investigation originates in the fact that some works of art on display have hygrothermal needs that in most cases do not correspond to the environmental comfort conditions required by visitors and those who work in exhibition spaces. This article presents standards and ranges of conflict in interior climate in museums, and measures these requirements using environmental records and visitor surveys. The methodology employed was based on the Simultaneousness Index proposed in Italy in 2008, and was extended to museums located in different climatic zones. Using this method, the conditions in three contemporary art museums concentrated in the humid subtropical climate of Brazil were reviewed in order to examine the required environmental parameters, verify the simultaneity of artwork-visitor hygrothermal satisfaction, and discuss formal characteristics in relation to energy demands. The cases studied were the FIC (Porto Alegre), the MON (Curitiba), and the MUBE (Sao Paulo). The results show the performance of environmental compatibility for winter and summer, and suggest the influence of architectural strategies on thermal comfort satisfaction and energy demand.","[Cenci, Laline; Garcia Alvarado, Rodrigo; Jofre Munoz, Jaime] Univ Bio Bio, Concepcion, Chile",Universidad del Bio-Bio,"Cenci, L (corresponding author), Univ Bio Bio, Avda Collao 1202, Concepcion, Chile.",lalinecenci@gmail.com; rgarcia@ubiobio.cl; jjofrem.arq@gmail.com,,,,,,,22,0,0,0,8,EDITORA UNISINOS,SAO LEOPOLDO,"DIVISAO DE PERIODICIOS, CAIXA POSTAL 275, SAO LEOPOLDO, RS, BRAZIL",1808-5741,,,ARQUITETURA REV,Arquitetura Rev.,JUL-DEC,2013,2,,,,112,124,,10.4013/arq.2013.92.04,http://dx.doi.org/10.4013/arq.2013.92.04,,,13,Architecture,Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;HCI),Architecture,AA4ZL,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000331105100005,View Full Record in Web of Science

The data were collected by using an adapted version of Peter-Szarka et al. questionnaire, which measures creative climate. The results reveal that gifted students found enriched classes more creative than regular classes.

These responses encompass multiple media and diverse philosophical and emotional forms, from grief and resignation to resistance, hope, and poignant celebration of spiritual value and natural beauty. Rejecting much of the terminology of current theory, the author considers the artworks in relation to interrelated and arguably unjustly discredited aesthetic and theological categories, namely, the sublime and the beautiful as well as the via negativa, the latter adapted from Thomas Aquinas by theologian Matthew Fox. Art's power is seen largely as the ability to humanize the science by rendering it emotionally, psychologically, and spiritually relatable to individuals. The broken relationship between humanity and nature seems related to the need for a renewed religious sense of integration with, and belonging to, the cosmos.

Environmental art is presented in this paper as a new genre to describe works of art that are not only directly representational of the environment (e.g., Constable's Cloud Series or Monet's London Series) but also works of art that are clearly nonrepresentational and performative, such as Long's A Line Made by Walking or Turrell's Skyspaces. The need for in overarching new genre to describe nonrepresentational performative environmental art is more obvious because there has been a host of labels given to this type of art since the late 1960s, such as land art, earthworks, site-specific art, destination art, ecological art, eco-art, and environmental sculpture. The review is also concerned with the potential of environmental art for communicating climate change.","Univ Birmingham, Sch Geog Earth & Environm Sci, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England",University of Birmingham,"Thornes, JE (corresponding author), Univ Birmingham, Sch Geog Earth & Environm Sci, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England.",j.e.thornes@bham.ac.uk,,,,,,,87,20,21,6,51,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0139 USA",1543-5938,,,ANNU REV ENV RESOUR,Annu.

Joining this challenge, the immersive artwork Pollution Pods (PPs) was created through a synthesis of knowledge from the fields of environmental psychology, empirical aesthetics, and activist art. This study summarizes the scientific process in this transdisciplinary project and reports the findings from a questionnaire study (N = 2662) evaluating the effect of the PPs on visitors. Data were collected at the first two exhibitions of the installation, one in a public park in Trondheim, Norway, and one at Somerset House, London, UK. Intentions to act were strong and slightly increased after visiting the art installation. Individual changes in intentions were positively associated with self-reported emotions of sadness, helplessness, and anger and self-reported cognitive assessment their awareness of the environmental consequences of their action, their willingness to take responsibility for their consequences, and belief in the relevance of environmental problems for daily life. Education and age were negatively associated with intentions. Despite favorable intentions, however, taking advantage of an actual behavioral opportunity to track one's climate change emissions behavior after visiting the PPs could not be detected. We conclude that environmental art can be useful for environmental communication and give recommendations for communicators on how to best make use of it. We emphasize the potential benefits of art that encourages personal responsibility and the need for valid behavior measures in environmental psychological research.","[Sommer, Laura Kim; Klockner, Christian Andreas] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Psychol, NTNU Dragvoll, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway; [Swim, Janet Kay] Penn State Univ, Dept Psychol, 140 Moore Bldg, University Pk, PA 16801 USA; [Keller, Ellis] Darmstadt Univ Appl Sci, Dept Social & Cultural Sci & Social Work, Haardtring 100, D-64295 Darmstadt, Germany",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Hochschule Darmstadt,"Sommer, LK (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Psychol, NTNU Dragvoll, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway.",laura.sommer@ntnu.no; jks4@psu.edu; anna.keller@h-da.de; christian.kloclaier@ntnu.no,"Keller, Ellis/AAK-5709-2021","Keller, Ellis/0000-0003-4478-0400; Swim, Janet/0000-0002-3279-1308",Norwegian Research Council [235223],Norwegian Research Council(Research Council of NorwayEuropean Commission),This work was supported by the Norwegian Research Council under Grant 235223 - Climart project.,,69,14,14,3,29,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0959-3780,1872-9495,,GLOBAL ENVIRON CHANG,Glob.

Eight hundred seventy-four spectators responded to a questionnaire on their perception of 37 selected artworks. In an explorative study using cluster analysis, characteristics of the artworks were connected with emotional and cognitive audience responses. The analysis of the artworks assigned them to four clusters: the comforting utopia, the challenging dystopia, the mediocre mythology, and the awesome solution. As suggested by the name, the awesome solution was the cluster of artworks that caused the highest emotional and cognitive activation. Artists and environmental campaigners can use the commonalities of the artworks in this cluster in their own creative work and contribute to our understanding of the impact of activist art.","[Sommer, Laura Kim; Kloeckner, Christian Andreas] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Inst Psychol, Edvard Bulls Veg 1, N-7048 Trondheim, Norway",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Sommer, LK (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Inst Psychol, Edvard Bulls Veg 1, N-7048 Trondheim, Norway.",laura.sommer@ntnu.no,,,,,,,64,13,13,2,14,EDUCATIONAL PUBLISHING FOUNDATION-AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST, NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",1931-3896,1931-390X,,PSYCHOL AESTHET CREA,Psychol.

The energy cycle estimates are based on 30 years of 6-hourly data obtained at pressure levels of all models. The models energetics are compared to those obtained from three reanalysis datasets (ERA-40, JRA-25 and NCEP-R2). The results show that the distributions of the energetics integrands and the shape of the various wave number spectra are reasonably well simulated. Many important features can be found in most models, namely both the upscale and downscale energy cascade for the wave-wave interactions of kinetic energy, the downscale energy cascade for the wave-wave interactions of available potential energy and the downscale energy transfer for the zonal-wave interactions of kinetic energy. However, the magnitude in the integrands distributions is generally excessive, yielding too much energy and an overactive energy cycle in the models. Accordingly, this energy excess is also reflected in the various spectra, specially but not exclusively, at the synoptic scale wave numbers for the energy conversion/transfer rates. The well known cold pole bias and the too strong tropospheric jets, along with their dislocation in some cases, still persist in the climate models. These are some of the deficiencies in the models directly implicated in the energy cycle. Apparently, simply increasing the horizontal and vertical resolutions is not enough to eliminate these deficiencies due to somewhat opposite effects achieved by refining both spatial resolutions. Therefore, more accurate physics parameterisations as well as improved numerical schemes and resolution dependence of parameterisations seem to be essential for a significant improvement in the models energetics. Moreover, efforts should be made to improve the physical processes controlling the generation of zonal available potential energy and dissipation of eddy kinetic energy, in which the synoptic scale should be fundamental, as inferred from the excessive energy conversion/transfer rates in the models spectra.","[Marques, C.

Three concepts - entanglement, hyperobjects and fabulation - are speculatively submerged into the land to analyse selected works by the three artists, additionally drawing from qualitative interviews, visual material and online news media.

In order to face HECC, imaginative practices able to support multiple ways of learning about and experiencing the future are necessary. In this article we analysed a set of arts-based activities conducted within the five-year EU-funded project IMPRESSIONS aimed at identifying transformative strategies to high-end climate change. The exploratory artistic activities were carried out alongside a science-led participatory integrated assessment process with stakeholders from the Iberian Peninsula. Our arts-based approach combined a range of performative, visual and reflexive practices with the ambition to reach out to more-than-rational but also practical elements of HECC futures. Our study suggests that the arts-based approach helped to bring out new ways of seeing, feeling and interpreting the world which may support the development of individual and collective sensibilities needed to address HECC.","[Galafassi, Diego] Stockholm Univ, Stockholm Resilience Ctr, Kraftriket 2B, Stockholm, Sweden; [Tabara, J.

Design/methodology/approach As part of an Eco Arts project carried out in Fiji, semi-structured research interviews were undertaken with artists and climate change practitioners. Findings Participants' motivations to produce art reflected their personal concerns about, and experiences of, climate change. There was an intention to use art-based approaches to raise awareness and promote action on climate change. The artwork produced drew on metaphors and storytelling to convey future climate impacts and aspects of climate change relevant to Fijian and Pacific communities. Research limitations/implications The study reports the perspectives of participants and discusses the potential uses of arts communication. Conclusions cannot be drawn from the findings regarding the effectiveness of specific artwork or of arts communication as a general approach. Practical implications The research offers suggestions for the inclusion of creative approaches to climate change communication within education and vocational training. A consideration of the perspectives of artist-practitioners has implications for the design and conduct of climate change communication. Social implications The involvement of artist-practitioners in the communication of climate change offers the potential for novel discussions and interpretations of climate change with individuals and within communities, which complement more formal or scientific communication. Originality/value The present study identifies the motivations and objectives of artist-practitioners involved in climate change communication. The authors highlight the role of personal experience and their use of artistic concepts and creative considerations pertinent to the geography and culture of the Pacific region.","[Capstick, Stuart] Cardiff Univ, Sch Psychol, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales; [Capstick, Stuart] Cardiff Univ, Tyndall Ctr Climate Change Res, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales; [Hemstock, Sarah] SPC, Suva Reg Off, Suva, Fiji; [Senikula, Ruci] Univ South Pacific, Suva, Fiji",Cardiff University; Cardiff University; University of the South Pacific,"Capstick, S (corresponding author), Cardiff Univ, Sch Psychol, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales.;Capstick, S (corresponding author), Cardiff Univ, Tyndall Ctr Climate Change Res, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales.",capsticksb@cardiff.ac.uk; sarahh@spc.int; rsenikula08@gmail.com,"Hemstock, Sarah/ABI-8503-2020; Capstick, Stuart/E-8622-2010","Capstick, Stuart/0000-0002-1934-4503; Hemstock, Sarah/0000-0003-3407-2267",University of the South Pacific; Oceania Centre for Arts Culture and Pacific Studies,University of the South Pacific; Oceania Centre for Arts Culture and Pacific Studies,"The project was enabled by a grant from the human capacity building and leadership research theme of the University of the South Pacific.

We demonstrate how art and design can activate the human imagination and promote collaboration across disciplines in a way that the post-Enlightenment scientific endeavor has historically been unable to do and can provide a framework for developing sustainable solutions to the climate crisis. Here, we describe 2 studies that involved collaboration between artists and designers and climate scientists. The first study paired a team of designers and computer scientists with climate and atmospheric scientists from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in an effort to (re)build an exploratory research interface for the Multi-Angle Spectroradiometer Plume Height Project dataset. This project not only produced an aesthetic visualization interface with highly improved functionality, but it also demonstrated how an improved interface can enable scientists to pursue more and better research hypotheses. For the second study, we worked with artists at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago to create three sonic-based art pieces that effectively communicated the science of climate change, appealed to human aesthetic judgment, and expanded the scope of our ecological awareness. We show that, while collaborations between artists and scientists are not necessarily novel, the integration of art, design, and science from a project's inception can improve both the production of knowledge and constitute an entry point for regular people to understand and engage with their rapidly changing planet.","[Tosca, Mika G.; Gilbert, Ilai; Walls, Kelvin L., II; Tyler, Grant E.] Inst Chicago, Dept Liberal Arts, Sch Art, Chicago, IL 60603 USA; [Tosca, Mika G.; Galvin, Adrian; Nastan, Abigail M.] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA",School of the Art Institute of Chicago; California Institute of Technology; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL),"Tosca, MG (corresponding author), Inst Chicago, Dept Liberal Arts, Sch Art, Chicago, IL 60603 USA.;Tosca, MG (corresponding author), CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",mtosca1@saic.edu,"Tosca, Mika/AAJ-5419-2020",,Caltech/JPL/CalArts Data [1570463]; School of the Art Institute of Chicago; Jet Propulsion Laboratory [1570463],Caltech/JPL/CalArts Data; School of the Art Institute of Chicago; Jet Propulsion Laboratory,"This work was funded, in part, by a Caltech/JPL/CalArts Data to Discovery Summer 2018 grant (https://datavis.caltech.edu/; https://datavis.caltech.edu/projects/ merlin/), a subcontract provided to M.

Methodology - A work climate survey was sent to the entire population of 341 tenured and tenure-track faculty at two small highly selective private liberal arts colleges, one formerly all male and the other formerly all female. The response rate was 70%, yielding 237 respondents. Faculty were compared by gender using t-tests and by gender and discipline using analysis of variance (ANOVA). Multiple regression was used to examine factors contributing to faculty WFC. Findings - Gender, rank, and department climate were significantly associated with WFC. In contrast, caregiving responsibilities, college of employment, and discipline did not have significant relationships with WFC. Controlling for caregiving, employment at a formerly all-male college, working in a STEM discipline, and department climate did not reduce the effect of gender on WFC. Women faculty reported more WFC than their male counterparts, while full professors reported less than their junior colleagues. Good department climate overall as well as high scores on all three subscales individually (affective, instrumental, and cognitive) reduced WFC. Research limitations - This research project is a cross-sectional, observational study, which limits the interpretation of direction of effect in most cases. Practical implications - Results suggest that more supportive department climates could reduce WFC for faculty struggling to balance their personal and professional lives.","[Berheide, Catherine White] Skidmore Coll, Dept Sociol, Saratoga Springs, NY 12866 USA; [Anderson-Hanley, Cay] Union Coll, Dept Psychol, Schenectady, NY 12308 USA",Skidmore College; Union College,"Berheide, CW (corresponding author), Skidmore Coll, Dept Sociol, Saratoga Springs, NY 12866 USA.",,"Berheide, Catherine/ABH-9721-2020",,,,,,48,5,5,0,6,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY, W YORKSHIRE BD16 1WA, ENGLAND",1529-2126,,978-1-78052-874-8,ADV GEND RES,,,2012,,,,,165,188,,10.1108/S1529-2126(2012)00000160011,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/S1529-2126(2012)00000160011,,,24,"Psychology, Social; Sociology",Book Citation Index – Social Sciences & Humanities (BKCI-SSH),Psychology; Sociology,BFI52,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000319993200008,View Full Record in Web of Science

The hierarchy of available models is mentioned, and examples are given of both the simplest process models and of state-of-the-art global climate models. The concepts of climate scenarios and climate predictability are discussed, and the methods for validating climate models are mentioned. Some of the many open questions in climate modelling are explored, focussing in particular on the issue of scale interaction: on the one hand, the need for downscaling the large-scale climate information for impact studies, using regional climate models and statistical/stochastic downscaling procedures; on the other hand, the need for upscaling the small-scale dynamics associated with surface processes to quantify their effects on regional and global climate. The general theme of the parameterization of unresolved, sub-grid scale processes such as turbulent convection is also mentioned. The specific example of climate-biosphere interaction is considered in some detail, with specific attention to the issue of climate-vegetation interaction in arid and semi-arid regions and the role of vegetation in determining albedo and moisture fluxes. The need for a deeper understanding of the fundamentals of climate dynamics is finally advocated.","Inst Atmospher Sci & Climate, I-10133 Turin, Italy",,"Provenzale, A (corresponding author), Inst Atmospher Sci & Climate, Corso Fiume 4, I-10133 Turin, Italy.",a.provenzale@isac.cnr.it,,,"Project of Interest NextData of the Italian Ministry for Education, University and Research (MIUR)","Project of Interest NextData of the Italian Ministry for Education, University and Research (MIUR)(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR))","I am grateful to Jost von Hardenberg, Elisa Palazzi, Claudia Pasquero, Antonio Parodi, Alexandre Pieri, Silvia Terzago, Luca Filippi, Paolo Davini, Donatella D'Onofrio and Marco Turco for many interesting discussions.

Regional climate models are complementary to global climate models. A typical use of regional climate models is to add further detail to global climate analyses or simulations, or to study climate processes in more detail than global models allow. The relationship between global and regional climate models is much akin to that of global and regional weather forecasting models. Over the past 20 years, the development of regional climate models has led to increased resolution, longer model runs, and steps towards regional climate system models. During recent years, community efforts have started to emerge in earnest, which can be expected to further advance the state-of-the-art in regional climate modeling. Applications of regional climate models span both the past and possible future climates, facilitating climate impact studies, information and support to climate policy, and adaptation.

Prior work in human-computer interaction (HCI) has pointed to art/science collaboration as one approach for helping to explore such questions. As an attempt to draw on this potential, our team designed and facilitated a 2-day artathon that brought together artists and scientists to create new works of art based on disaster and climate data. Reflecting on the artathon and its outcomes, we contribute two sets of findings. First, we articulate opportunities, suggested by the artwork, for expanding research and design in crisis informatics.

The rationale for the study coincides with the forthcoming 50th anniversary of the 'Spirit of '68', in which dominant ideologies across Europe were interrogated, attacked and in some cases, overturned. Integral to this historical climate were the role of students, particularly those engaged in art and design courses, who challenged and changed educational policy and the future landscape of the arts. Much like the cultural climate of the late 1960s, our own times seem to question the validity of the arts within education (particularly in relation to funding and the provision of courses) whilst promoting a distrust in a liberal elite and a de-politicised population. The aims of the workshop were twofold; to consider the ways in which Art School (and in the UK this includes Design Schools too) education had changed since the student led revolutions in 1968, and, to consider the ways in which Art School Thinking could be integral to daily life in the 21st century.","[Turney, Jo] Univ Southampton, Winchester Sch Art, Fash & Design, Southampton, Hants, England; [Franklin, Alex] Univ West England, Bristol Sch Art & Design, Bristol, Avon, England",University of Southampton; University of West England,"Turney, J (corresponding author), Univ Southampton, Winchester Sch Art, Fash & Design, Southampton, Hants, England.",J.A.Turney@soton.ac.uk,,,"Winchester School of Art, University of Southampton; University of the West of England","Winchester School of Art, University of Southampton; University of the West of England","The authors would like to thank Winchester School of Art, University of Southampton and the University of the West of England for supporting this research project.",,31,0,0,1,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1460-6925,1756-3062,,DES J,Des.

Encouraged by activists (most notably Bill McKibben), artists have appropriated climate change as a social problem and decided that they too, alongside journalists, scientists, and activists, were called upon to engage with this issue. Dozens of noteworthy exhibitions, most notably in Boulder (2007), London and Copenhagen (2009), Paris (2012), New York (2013), Boston (2014), and Melbourne (2015), have placed climate change art on the map as a new and timely genre, displaying relevant artworks both alongside climate negotiations and in dedicated gallery spaces such as the Barbican in London. I argue that much progress has been made in appropriating climate change art as an essentially artistic, rather than propagandistic or activist practice. Although caught in the net of many criticisms, climate change art plays a crucial role in allowing the public to rethink the role of human beings' everyday activities in irrevocably altering the climate system. In effect, climate change art makes the Anthropocene a cultural reality. However, the review points out a strong artistic trend toward the imagery of apocalyptic sublime, which results in art that may be poignant, but falls out of step with the self-professed motivations of artists and curators alike.

Educating students in contemporary art is essential in the 21st century classroom. In this global climate, being able to understand and translate visual data is vital to one's ability to navigate through a complex world. The ability to understand visual 'language' is a teachable skill that can empower the classroom teacher to likewise enable their students in creative and critical thinking. One of the most challenging tasks an art teacher faces in today's classroom is to explain the meaning behind art that is sometimes deemed as too vulgar, meaningless or shocking. The key is to understand the historical context of the work, appreciate the reasons for its creation, articulate their significance, participate in the art making process and thus gain confidence in their own ability. Students in this learning process should experience specialized lectures, studio work, museum visits and research based writing. Through gaining visual literacy and communication skills, contextual understanding and critical thinking skills, contemporary art in the classroom becomes an aid to encourage higher level thinking, problem solving and deep reflection. Empowered with a broad knowledge of contemporary art and culture, understanding of the link connecting prehistoric and contemporary art, and a renewed understanding of the importance of art education, they can bring their passion to teaching art to our future generations. Art in the 21st century has been through phenomenal changes. It has been criticized, debated over had its validity as art challenged, and continues to attract controversy and contention. The confusion with the seeming disappearance of older traditions and ideas in the wake of contemporary art has spilled over into the field of education and has affected the teaching of art in the classroom detrimentally. When is this art? is the first question that most viewers ask when they see a work at an art exhibition, then teachers often become unwilling to teach it as art in the classroom because they are simply not sure if what they are teaching is art. If educators are not confident about their subject matter, chances are, they will avoid teaching it, preferring to stick closer to the more prescribed traditional syllabus. Although an art education however traditional is better than no art education, a prescriptive art education could be more damaging to the creative, experimental and artistic development of a child than none at all.","[Leng, Twardzik Ching Chor] Natl Inst Educ, Singapore, Singapore",Nanyang Technological University & National Institute of Education (NIE) Singapore; Nanyang Technological University; National Institute of Education (NIE) Singapore,,chorleng.ching@nie.edu.sg,"Steg, Chaim/AAX-1615-2021","Steg, Chaim/0000-0002-4987-4564",,,,,9,0,0,5,18,IATED-INT ASSOC TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION A& DEVELOPMENT,VALENICA,"LAURI VOLPI 6, VALENICA, BURJASSOT 46100, SPAIN",2340-1117,,978-84-616-3822-2,EDULEARN PROC,,,2013,,,,,1937,1944,,,,,,8,Education & Educational Research,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Education & Educational Research,BB8LM,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000346798301146,View Full Record in Web of Science

It employs these new materialist frames of diffraction and intra-action to show how art/science intra-act through quiet activism in children's art. It argues that this work can be considered a vernacular form of STEAM education that radically re-situates, and indeed deconstructs, forms of science education proposed through outcomes-based curriculum, and extends children's sense of themselves as entangled in their environment. The data theorised in this chapter is drawn from findings from a multi-sited ethnographic project that runs in 13 sites in 6 cities. This ongoing empirical project utilises art as a research method in primary school classrooms and informal educational settings, ostensibly to explore issues of social value and community belonging. However, across the last three years working in the UK and Australia, children, unprompted, have returned repeatedly to concerns about the environment, climate change and pollution. The children are so enmeshed in their broader environment that some draw self-portraits of themselves as landscapes. The arts-making practices reported here have led children to create speculative and imaginative scientific inventions that were designed to respond to the now inevitable effects of climate change and that merge art and science in unexpected ways. In developing the concept of quiet activism as an inherently interdisciplinary art/science (STEAM) method of environmental and art education, this chapter argues for an intra-active and diffractive, interdisciplinary and speculative model of embodied pedagogy. Children's creative, quiet activism teaches us interdisciplinarity in dynamic and applied ways.","[Hickey-Moody, Anna] RMIT Univ, Media & Commun, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Hickey-Moody, Anna] Goldsmiths Coll, Ctr Arts & Learning, London, England; [Horn, Christine] RMIT Univ, Interfaith Childhoods Projects, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Willcox, Marissa] RMIT Univ, Digital Ethnog Res Ctr, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT); University of London; Goldsmiths University London; Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT); Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT),"Hickey-Moody, A (corresponding author), RMIT Univ, Media & Commun, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",,,,,,,,43,0,0,1,4,BRILL SENSE,LEIDEN,"P O BOX 9000, LEIDEN, 2300 PA, NETHERLANDS",2542-8721,2542-873X,978-90-04-42163-9; 978-90-04-42158-5; 978-90-04-39611-1,CRIT ISSU FUT LEA T,,,2020,,,,,200,228,,10.1163/9789004421585_013,http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/9789004421585_013,,,29,"Education & Educational Research; Education, Scientific Disciplines",Book Citation Index – Social Sciences & Humanities (BKCI-SSH); Book Citation Index – Science (BKCI-S),Education & Educational Research,BR6WT,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000664379200013,View Full Record in Web of Science

At the same time, in many instances, cultural stone and rock art are considered within the same conceptual framework. From a geomorphological perspective, such stone and rock art can be affected by weathering in fundamentally different ways as a result of the environment they are in and that which they generate themselves. Further, knowledge of, and data regarding mechanical weathering processes, especially under accelerated climatic change, is far from adequate. A brief attempt is made to identify the geomorphological differences between rock art and cultural stone, and to see how these may affect conservation practices at this present time. It is suggested that the weathering environments may not only be quite different but that lack of adequate (appropriate) data may be potentially deleterious to conservation practices due to the (often) Unsubstantiated assumptions regarding weathering that are adopted.","[Hall, Kevin] Univ Pretoria, Dept Geog Geoinformat & Meteorol, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa",University of Pretoria,"Hall, K (corresponding author), Univ No British Columbia, Geog Programme, Prince George, BC V2L 5P2, Canada.",hall@unbc.ca,,,,,,,42,2,2,2,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0373-6245,2151-2418,,S AFR GEOGR J,S.

Newer models do not perform better than earlier versions despite higher resolution and complexity. Differences in climate sensitivity only weakly account for differences in model performance. In the glacial, models consistently underestimate land cooling (especially in winter) and overestimate ocean surface cooling (especially in the tropics). In the mid-Holocene, models generally underestimate the precipitation increase in the northern monsoon regions, and overestimate summer warming in central Eurasia. Models generally capture large-scale gradients of climate change but have more limited ability to reproduce spatial patterns.

This article places such propositional concerns in the perspective of a different understanding of the relationships between scientific knowledge and public policy issues from the conventional 'translation' model, in which prior scientific research and understanding is communicated and translated into corresponding policies - or not, if it remains disputed and overly uncertain. Explaining some of the key contingencies and bases for uncertainty in IPCC climate projections and human influences, I show how social and technical analysis of climate science is not about denial of the scientific propositional claims at issue, but about understanding the conditional and essentially ambiguous epistemic character of any such knowledge, however technically sophisticated and robust it may be. Contrary to conventional wisdom, it is entirely plausible that existing scientific representations of climate change and its human causes may understate the risks induced by prevailing social-economic processes rather than exaggerate them. As the article shows, the public meanings given to climate science, and to 'the climate problem', and thus also the public culture which that knowledge is supposed to inform, are themselves already in key respects presumed and (attemptedly) imposed by the science and its framing. This gives rise to perverse effects on public readiness to take informed democratic responsibility for 'the global climate problem', and associated cross-cutting issues which existing scientific framings of public policy erase from view.","Univ Lancaster, ESRC Ctr Econ & Social Aspects Genom, Lancaster LA1 4YW, England",Lancaster University; UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC),"Wynne, B (corresponding author), Univ Lancaster, ESRC Ctr Econ & Social Aspects Genom, Lancaster LA1 4YW, England.",b.wynne@lancaster.ac.uk,,,,,,,38,136,142,0,48,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0263-2764,,,THEOR CULT SOC,Theory Cult.

Contrasting the skill of these models not only with each other but also with empirical models can reveal the space and time scales on which simulation models exploit their physical basis effectively and quantify their ability to add information to operational forecasts. The skill of decadal probabilistic hindcasts for annual global-mean and regional-mean temperatures from the EU Ensemble-Based Predictions of Climate Changes and Their Impacts (ENSEMBLES) project is contrasted with several empirical models. Both the ENSEMBLES models and a dynamic climatology empirical model show probabilistic skill above that of a static climatology for global-mean temperature. The dynamic climatology model, however, often outperforms the ENSEMBLES models. The fact that empirical models display skill similar to that of today's state-of-the-art simulation models suggests that empirical forecasts can improve decadal forecasts for climate services, just as in weather, medium-range, and seasonal forecasting. It is suggested that the direct comparison of simulation models with empirical models becomes a regular component of large model forecast evaluations. Doing so would clarify the extent to which state-of-the-art simulation models provide information beyond that available from simpler empirical models and clarify current limitations in using simulation forecasting for decision support. Ultimately, the skill of simulation models based on physical principles is expected to surpass that of empirical models in a changing climate; their direct comparison provides information on progress toward that goal, which is not available in model-model intercomparisons.","[Suckling, Emma B.; Smith, Leonard A.] London Sch Econ, Ctr Anal Time Series, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Suckling, EB (corresponding author), London Sch Econ, Ctr Anal Time Series, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",cats@lse.ac.uk,,,"NERC EQUIP project [NE/H003479/1]; EU Framework 6 ENSEMBLES project [GOCE-CT-2003-505539-ENSEMBLES]; LSE's Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment; ESRC Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy; Economic and Social Research Council; Munich Re; Pembroke College, Oxford; NERC [NE/H003479/1, NE/H003525/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/H003479/1, NE/H003525/1] Funding Source: researchfish","NERC EQUIP project; EU Framework 6 ENSEMBLES project; LSE's Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment; ESRC Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Munich Re; Pembroke College, Oxford; NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC))","This research was funded as part of the NERC EQUIP project (NE/H003479/1); it was also supported by the EU Framework 6 ENSEMBLES project (GOCE-CT-2003-505539-ENSEMBLES) and by both by the LSE's Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment and the ESRC Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy, funded by the Economic and Social Research Council and Munich Re.

Students subsequently worked in small groups to develop environmental communication material for public visitors. We assessed the learning activity and the communication product using pre-and post-field trip participant surveys, focus group discussions, and critiques by art and communication experts of the products. Significant changes in knowledge about climate change occurred in program participants. Incorporating artists and the arts into this activity helped engage multiple senses and emphasized social interaction, as well as providing support to participants to think creatively. The production of art helped to encourage peer learning and normalize the different views among participants in communicating about climate change impacts.

The first simulation considers the Satellite Phenology (SP) mode, the second one uses the old LAI formula and the third one uses the new LAI formula. The three simulations were designated as CLM45-SP, CLM45-CNold, and CLM45-CNnew respectively. The results showed that the simulated surface energy balance and surface climate are substantially affected by the new LAI formula. The CLM45-CNnew succeeds in reducing the high positive difference of LAI with respect to the CLM45-SP relative to the CLM45-CNold in some regions, although in other regions new differences appear. Also, the CLM45-CNnew is able to simulate the total evapotranspiration better than the CLM45-CNold in comparison with the reanalysis product and it shows a similar response relative to the CLM45-SP. Moreover, the CLM45-CNnew succeeds in reducing the cold bias relative to the CLM45-SP and CLM45-CNold against the observational dataset. For the total surface precipitation, the CLM45-CNnew shows a similar response to the CLM45-SP relative to the CLM45-CNold in comparison with the observational dataset. Overall, this study provides useful insights related to the advantage of the regional coupled RegCM4-CLM45-CNnew model and recommends its utilization for future studies on the potential roles/impacts of biosphere-atmosphere in modulating the climate of Tropical Africa.","[Anwar, Samy A.] Egyptian Meteorol Author, POB 11784, Cairo, Egypt; [Diallo, Ismaila] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Geog, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",Egyptian Meteorological Authority; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Anwar, SA (corresponding author), Egyptian Meteorol Author, POB 11784, Cairo, Egypt.",ratebsamy@yahoo.com; idiallo.work@gmail.com,,"A.

To enable more solid statements and to decrease the range of uncertainty, global general circulation models and regional climate models are evaluated based on a 2 x 2 contingency table approach to generate model weights. These weights are compared among different methodologies and their impact on probabilistic projections of temperature and precipitation changes is investigated. Simulated seasonal precipitation and temperature for both 50-year trends and climatological means are assessed at two spatial scales: in seven study regions around the globe and in eight sub-regions of the Mediterranean area. Overall, 24 models of phase 3 and 38 models of phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project altogether 159 transient simulations of precipitation and 119 of temperature from four emissions scenarios are evaluated against the ERA-20C reanalysis over the 20th century. The results show high conformity with previous model evaluation studies. The metrics reveal that mean of precipitation and both temperature mean and trend agree well with the reference dataset and indicate improvement for the more recent ensemble mean, especially for temperature. The method is highly transferrable to a variety of further applications in climate science. Overall, there are regional differences of simulation quality, however, these are less pronounced than those between the results for 50-year mean and trend. The trend results are suitable for assigning weighting factors to climate models. Yet, the implications for probabilistic climate projections is strictly dependent on the region and season.","[Ring, Christoph; Pollinger, Felix; Paeth, Heiko] Univ Wurzburg, Inst Geog & Geol, D-97074 Wurzburg, Germany; [Kaspar-Ott, Irena; Hertig, Elke; Jacobeit, Jucundus] Univ Augsburg, Inst Geog, Alter Postweg 118, D-86159 Augsburg, Germany",University of Wurzburg; University of Augsburg,"Ring, C (corresponding author), Univ Wurzburg, Inst Geog & Geol, D-97074 Wurzburg, Germany.",christoph.ring@uni-wuerzburg.de; felix.pollinger@uni-wuerzburg.de; irena.kaspar-ott@geo.uni-augsburg.de; elke.hertig@geo.uni-augsburg.de; jucundus.jacobeit@geo.uni-augsburg.de; heiko.paeth@uni-wuerzburg.de,,"Pollinger, Felix/0000-0002-9519-2433; Kaspar-Ott, Irena/0000-0002-5151-201X; Hertig, Elke/0000-0002-6934-9468",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG),Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"We thank the Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison (PCMDI) and the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) for providing the CMIP3, CMIP5 and CORDEX datasets used in this study.

Via online search we identified 278 communication formats on climate change adaptation. Based on a literature review and a consultation process with climate and communication experts from science and practise, a list of 16 success factors for adaptation communication was compiled with regard to communication content, target group adequacy, adaptation motivation and communication evaluation. Using the success factors as evaluation criteria, we analysed the 278 formats. The analysis yields 13 good practise examples that can inspire future adaptation communication. Following our discussion which of the success factors have not yet been sufficiently addressed we propose going beyond the content level and address emotions, norms and values as well as making use of trusted messengers.","[Wirth, Veronika] Dept Hlth & Environm, Munich, Germany; [Wirth, Veronika; Prutsch, Andrea] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci Vienna BOKU, Vienna, Austria; [Wirth, Veronika; Prutsch, Andrea] Environm Agcy Austria, Dept Environm Impact Assessment & Climate Change, Vienna, Austria; [Prutsch, Andrea] BOKU, San Francisco, CA USA; [Grothmann, Torsten] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res PIK, Potsdam, Germany; [Grothmann, Torsten] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Ecol Econ Inst, D-26111 Oldenburg, Germany","University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna; Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; Carl von Ossietzky Universitat Oldenburg","Wirth, V (corresponding author), Dept Hlth & Environm, Munich, Germany.",,,,Austrian Climate and Energy Funds within the Austrian Climate Research Programme (ACRP),Austrian Climate and Energy Funds within the Austrian Climate Research Programme (ACRP),"This study was part of the project CcTalk!, which received funding from the Austrian Climate and Energy Funds within the Austrian Climate Research Programme (ACRP).",,49,22,22,1,24,OEKOM VERLAG,MUNICH,"WALTHERSTR 29, MUNICH, 80337, GERMANY",0940-5550,,,GAIA,GAIA,,2014,1,,,,30,39,,10.14512/gaia.23.1.9,http://dx.doi.org/10.14512/gaia.23.1.9,,,10,Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,AE0MH,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000333659900008,View Full Record in Web of Science

More recently, John Urry (2011) contributed a rather speculative book on 'post-carbon sociology', yet sociologists continue to lag behind geographers and psychologists in contemplating the social and cultural dimensions of climate-change adaptation. The findings of the present paper suggest that the sociology of climate-change adaptation could take its lead from the work of cultural and human geographers on people-place relationships, and engage with art theory and practice to offer imaginative insights into the scope and scale of the climate-change challenge. Sociologists could also make a major contribution to current debate on the roles of community action and community engagement in climate-change adaptation, noting that the word 'community' is open to abuse and misunderstanding. Drawing on his own research on the challenges facing local communities in Australia and Sri Lanka, the author combines previously disconnected bodies of literature to identify some important points of departure for the journey towards Urry's 'post-carbon sociology'.","RMIT Univ, Globalism Res Ctr, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia",Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT),"Mulligan, MJ (corresponding author), RMIT Univ, Globalism Res Ctr, GPO Box 2476, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia.",martin.mulligan@rmit.edu.au,,,,,,,55,8,8,0,18,WHITE HORSE PRESS,ISLE OF HARRIS,"1 STROND, ISLE OF HARRIS HS5 3UD, ENGLAND",0963-2719,1752-7015,,ENVIRON VALUE,Environ.

This paper considers art in an ecological context to help us 'see anew' the potential for adopting complex ways of thinking, and 'transdisciplinary' ways of working. Challenging existing belief systems and normative ways of thinking through 'question-based learning', we may consider drawing as a means of gaining insights and practical approaches to diverse futures.

However, desecration, pollution, and other factors are threatening the survival of these iconic stone monuments. Evidence suggest that rates of panel deterioration may be increasing, although it is not clear whether this is due to local factors or wider environmental influences accelerated by environmental change. To examine this question, 18 rock art panels with varied art motifs were studied at two major panel locations at Lordenshaw and Weetwood Moor in Northumberland. A condition assessment tool was used to first quantify the level of deterioration of each panel (called staging). Stage estimates then were compared statistically with 27 geochemical and physical descriptors of local environments, such as soil moisture, salinity, pH, lichen coverage, soil anions and cation levels, and panel orientation, slope, and standing height. In parallel, climate modelling was performed using UKCP09 to assess how projected climatic conditions (to 2099) might affect the environmental descriptors most correlated with elevated stone deterioration. Only two descriptors significantly correlated (P < 0.05) with increased stage: the standing height of the panel and the exchangeable cation content of the local soils, although moisture conditions also were potentially influential at some panels. Climate modelling predicts warming temperatures, more seasonally variable precipitation, and increased wind speeds, which hint stone deterioration could accelerate in the future due to increased physiochemical weathering. We recommend key panels be targeted for immediate management intervention, focusing on reducing wind exposures, improving site drainage, and potentially immobilizing soil salts.

For each type of the examined phenomena the paper presents engineered, and architectural solutions adopted to prevent disasters and protect citizens. In all cases, the countermeasures require deeper prediction of weather and climate conditions during the service life of the infrastructure. The experience gained supports the fact that strategies adopted or designed to contrast the effects of climate change on transport infrastructures pursue three main goals: To prevent the damages, protect the structures, and monitor and communicate to users the current conditions. Indeed, the analyses show that the ongoing climate change will increase its impact on transport infrastructures, exposing people to unacceptable risks.

For climate modeling, on the other hand, specific dynamical and thermal parameterization dedicated to the exchange of water and energy between the atmosphere and the urban surfaces have to be implemented. Therefore, to fully understand how cities are impacted by climate change, it is important to have (1) simulations of the urban climate at fine spatial scales (including coastal hazards for coastal cities) integrating global climate scenarios with urban expansion and population growth scenarios and their associated uncertainty estimates, (2) urban climate observations, especially in Global South cities, and (3) spatial data of high resolution on urban structure and form, human behavior, and energy consumption.","[Hamdi, Rafiq; Caluwaerts, Steven; Duchene, Francois; Van Schaeybroek, Bert; Termonia, Piet] Royal Meteorol Inst Belgium, Brussels, Belgium; [Kusaka, Hiroyuki; Doan, Quang-Van] Univ Tsukuba, Ctr Computat Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Hamdi, Rafiq; Cai, Peng; He, Huili; Luo, Geping] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Binjiang Coll, Wuxi, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Kuang, Wenhui] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Hamdi, Rafiq; Caluwaerts, Steven; Termonia, Piet] Univ Ghent, Dept Phys & Astron, Ghent, Belgium","Royal Meteorological Institute of Belgium; University of Tsukuba; Wuxi University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Ghent University","Hamdi, R (corresponding author), Royal Meteorol Inst Belgium, Brussels, Belgium.;Hamdi, R (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Binjiang Coll, Wuxi, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.;Hamdi, R (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Dept Phys & Astron, Ghent, Belgium.",Rafiq.hamdi@meteo.be,"hamdi, Rafiq/AAA-5719-2022; Kusaka, Hiroyuki/A-9997-2014; Van Schaeybroeck, Bert/AAP-5118-2021","Van Schaeybroeck, Bert/0000-0002-9507-7929; Termonia, Piet/0000-0003-2095-0567; Hamdi, Rafiq/0000-0002-4419-5757; Caluwaerts, Steven/0000-0001-7456-3891",EU's H2020 Research and Innovation Program [690462],EU's H2020 Research and Innovation Program,"This work is supported by URCLIM, which has received funding from EU's H2020 Research and Innovation Program under Grant Agreement 690462.",,168,22,23,6,30,SPRINGER INT PUBL AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2509-9426,2509-9434,,EARTH SYST ENVIRON,Earth Syst.

The project utilized arts and humanities methods, such as storytelling, songwriting, online games, and brief research-led talks, culminating in the co-created song: Food and Resistance for Climate Resilience. The results of the project provide evidence that climate action requires arts and humanities methods to appeal to youth, as opposed to purely fact-based or scientific forms of climate communication.

This strong monsoonal regime is related to the aggregation of the Pangaean supercontinent, which by Triassic time was already completed. Climate oscillations existed within this framework. The harsh hot-house climatic conditions that characterized the Late Permian, and perhaps precipitated the end-Permian mass extinction, were probably maintained during the Early Triassic and may account for the impoverished, but distinctive, faunal and floral Lower Triassic associations. Although metazoan reef builders were probably the most affected group, carbonate production remained high at least in the western Tethys realm. The Middle Triassic was characterized locally by humid episodes, although their geographical distribution has yet to be clarified. The Carnian Pluvial Event, marks an episode of increased rainfall documented worldwide, was the most distinctive climate change within the Triassic. Different hypotheses have been proposed for its causes: changes of atmospheric or ocean circulation driven by plate tectonics; a peak of the global monsoon due to maximum continent aggregation; or triggering by the eruption of a large igneous province. Subsequently, the late Carnian and Norian seem to have been climatically stable, although minor climatic changes have recently been described even from this time period. Finally, the end-Triassic extinction event is also associated with climate change, specifically warming and increased rainfall, but this evidence comes mostly from the northern parts of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province, and the global pattern of climate change at the Triassic/Jurassic boundary has still to be resolved. Many facets of Triassic climate are intriguing and deserve further research. However, palaeoclimate studies on the Triassic have so far been carried out only locally with different proxies. Those proxies will require inter-calibration, in order to depict correctly the temporal and geographical patterns of Triassic climate. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

His human-made environments situate the human subject and human experience at their center, inviting the spectator to experience atmospheres and environments anew. Relying on the disorienting and defamiliarizing effects of enlarged scale and colored fog, Eliasson tools his art to increase the spectators' awareness both of their environment and of their position as phenomenological subjects within it. The works' emphasis on an ecology of individual encounter and feeling situate the experiencing subject at their center, providing an analogue to the human centering that marks the era of the Anthropocene. While Bruno Latour has claimed that Eliasson's attempts at climate control are not consistentwith a desire to control the elements, I argue instead that Eliasson's environments are fully orchestrated affairs that share the technologies and efforts of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries' militarization of climate control. Their phenomenological embrace, which has become a hallmark of much immersive art, relies on a stripe of self-centering that turns art into an occasion for feeling, foreclosing on critique. Eliasson's spectacles are containers for experience, refusing the possibility of a radical externality that is uncontrolled or the possibility of atmospheres that exist beyond their human witness.","[Hornby, Louise] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept English, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Hornby, L (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept English, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA.",,,,,,,,50,5,5,2,9,DUKE UNIV PRESS,DURHAM,"905 W MAIN ST, STE 18-B, DURHAM, NC 27701 USA",2201-1919,,,ENVIRON HUMANITIES,Environ.

Scientists have clearly identified categories of human-induced environmental distress, and public awareness is growing, yet science and related media reports are not affecting enough policy change to forestall our impact. Additional approaches need to be taken, and one potent vehicle for eliciting responses is art. Some visual artists have chosen to include insects in their work. Insects are diverse, abundant, ecologically and culturally important to us, and are suffering declines by our hand. These qualities, coupled with insects' uncanny ability to evoke emotional extremes, marks them as uniquely powerful subjects for artists to convey messages about our relationship with the planet. We surveyed relevant work by 73 artists and found a bias favoring insect art addressing habitat destruction or climate change, and an underrepresentation of art related to several other important categories of environmental destruction. Art favored Hymenoptera over all other insect orders, including orders containing more described species. Noting these misalignments, we see opportunities for artists to more extensively explore insect diversity and the harm we are causing, and for art to increasingly play a complementary role in affecting change in our destructive behavior. Humans are reshaping the planet in impressive, and impressively self-destructive, ways. Evidence and awareness of our environmental impact has failed to elicit meaningful change in reversing our behavior. A multifaceted approach to communicating human-induced environmental destruction is critical, and art can affect our behavior by its power to evoke emotions. Artists often use insects in their works because of our intimate and varied relationship with this diverse, abundant lineage of animals. We surveyed work by 73 artists featuring insects or insect bodily products to gauge how extensively artists are addressing anthropogenic environmental distress, and what insects they are choosing as subjects in the process. Categories often cited as contributing to species extinction are (1) habitat destruction, (2) invasive species, (3) pollution, (4) human population, and (5) overharvesting. After adding insect-specific categories of (6) decline of insect pollinators and (7) the intentional modification or extermination of insects, we categorized our surveyed works, confirming categorizations with 53 of the living artists. Forty-seven percent of the artists addressed habitat destruction or climate change, but some other categories were severely underrepresented, with almost no work explicitly addressing overpopulation or overharvesting. Artists favored Hymenoptera (62%) over potentially more species-rich orders. Recognizing these biases could alert scientists, artists, and others to more effectively communicate messages of universal importance.","[Klein, Barrett Anthony] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Biol, La Crosse, WI 54601 USA; [Brosius, Tierney] Augustana Coll, Dept Biol, Rock Isl, IL 61201 USA",University of Wisconsin System,"Klein, BA (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Biol, La Crosse, WI 54601 USA.",barrett@pupating.org; tierneybrosius@augustana.edu,,,,,,,102,1,1,3,5,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2075-4450,,INSECTS,Insects,MAY,2022,5,,,,,,448,10.3390/insects13050448,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/insects13050448,,,26,Entomology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Entomology,1R8JF,35621783,"Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000803609600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

While the global climate feedback is often assumed to be constant, its valuediagnosed from global climate modelsshows substantial time variation under transient warming. Here a reformulation of the global climate feedback in terms of its contributions from regional climate feedbacks is proposed, providing a clear physical insight into this behavior. Using (i) a state-of-the-art global climate model and (ii) a low-order energy balance model, it is shown that the global climate feedback is fundamentally linked to the geographic pattern of regional climate feedbacks and the geographic pattern of surface warming at any given time. Time variation of the global climate feedback arises naturally when the pattern of surface warming evolves, actuating feedbacks of different strengths in different regions. This result has substantial implications for the ability to constrain future climate changes from observations of past and present climate states. The regional climate feedbacks formulation also reveals fundamental biases in a widely used method for diagnosing climate sensitivity, feedbacks, and radiative forcingthe regression of the global top-of-atmosphere radiation flux on global surface temperature. Further, it suggests a clear mechanism for the efficacies of both ocean heat uptake and radiative forcing.","[Armour, Kyle C.] MIT, Dept Earth Atmospher & Planetary Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Bitz, Cecilia M.] Univ Washington, Dept Atmospher Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Roe, Gerard H.] Univ Washington, Dept Earth & Space Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Armour, KC (corresponding author), MIT, Dept Earth Atmospher & Planetary Sci, 54-1526,77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",karmour@mit.edu,"Bitz, Cecilia M/S-8423-2016","Bitz, Cecilia M/0000-0002-9477-7499","James S.

The concept of cultural justice is proposed to analyze the intersections of institutional critique and struggles over injustice. 'Liberate Tate', an artist collective, sought to redefine the oil giant BP's financial support of Tate art galleries in the United Kingdom. Rejecting the simple description of 'sponsorship', the collective worked to reframe it as a governance controversy about neoliberal agendas, cultural integrity, and compromised responses to climate change. Artistic authority and independence were reasserted through claims of injustice that disrupted corporate sponsorship narratives and made explicit the power relations that influenced environmental politics. Performances of environmental transgressions were enacted to highlight spatial, temporal, technological and embodied dimensions of climate change. Cultural justice functioned as a mode of representational politics aimed at undoing the relationship between art and oil and articulating possibilities for a climate-safe future.","[Motion, Judy] Univ New South Wales, Environm Humanities, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney,"Motion, J (corresponding author), Univ New South Wales, Environm Humanities, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",J.motion@unsw.edu.au,,,,,,,57,6,6,1,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0964-4016,1743-8934,,ENVIRON POLIT,Environ.

This research aims at gaining a better understanding of visual artists who create climate-related art and are/were located in the central art market countries of the United States of America, the United Kingdom, and Germany-countries with considerable contributions to climate change and responsibility for action. Responding to calls for the further involvement of the humanities and sociology of the arts to address socio-ecological themes, this article addresses the question: How do artists' imaginations of climate change relate to aspects of climate (in)justice? To answer this question, thirty interviews were conducted with artists who addressed climate change in their works. This study finds that the artists are, among others, driven by a desire to reduce distances (spatially, temporally, human-nature) and/or to engage with causes and impacts nearby. Many artists are concerned with climate (in)justice in various ways: with not only vulnerable, remote regions, future generations, and other species, but also nearby areas in the present. This study also shows that artists face ethical questions when engaging in climate topics. The research applies and reveals insights from the environmental humanities, emphasizing the connectedness of environmental challenges to social, cultural, and human aspects. The research is also situated within the sociology of the arts, the study of aesthetic practices in times of global inequalities, but also of hope, possibilities, and learning.

In spite of that, anthropogenic climate change is one of the most serious concerns for nature conservation in this region. One of the climatic threats is represented by shifts of the Mediterranean climate and expansion of the arid climate. In this paper, we present an assessment of changes in the spatial range of the Mediterranean climate in Europe and the conversion into arid climate under different greenhouse gas forcings, namely RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. We used 11 simulations in two future 30-year periods of state-of-the-art regional climate models from EURO-CORDEX. Our results indicate that by the end of the century under RCP8.5 the present Mediterranean climate zone is projected to contract by 16%, i.e. an area (157,000km(2)) equivalent to half the size of Italy. This compares with the less severe scenario RCP4.5 that projected only a 3% reduction. In addition, the Mediterranean climate zone is projected to expand to other zones by an area equivalent to 24 and 50% of its present extent under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively. Our study indicates that expansion of the arid zone is almost always the cause for contraction of the Mediterranean zone. Under RCP8.5 the arid zone is projected to increase by more than twice its present extent, equivalent to three times the size of Greece. Results of this study are useful for identifying (1) priority zones for biodiversity conservation, i.e. stable Mediterranean climate zones, (2) zones requiring assisted adaptation, such as establishment of new protected areas, implementation of buffer zones around protected areas and creating ecological corridors connecting stable Mediterranean zones.","[Barredo, Jose I.; Mauri, Achille; Caudullo, Giovanni] European Commiss, JRC, Bioecon Unit, TP 261, I-21027 Ispra, Italy; [Dosio, Alessandro] European Commiss, JRC, Disaster Risk Management Unit, TP 1001, I-21027 Ispra, Italy",European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site; European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site,"Barredo, JI (corresponding author), European Commiss, JRC, Bioecon Unit, TP 261, I-21027 Ispra, Italy.",jose.barredo@ec.europa.eu,"Dosio, Alessandro/U-9093-2017","Dosio, Alessandro/0000-0002-6365-9473; Caudullo, Giovanni/0000-0003-4061-1204",PESETA III Project (Projection of Economic impacts of climate change in Sectors of the European Union based on bottom-up Analysis),PESETA III Project (Projection of Economic impacts of climate change in Sectors of the European Union based on bottom-up Analysis),This study was supported by the PESETA III Project (Projection of Economic impacts of climate change in Sectors of the European Union based on bottom-up Analysis).

A common approach used by historical climatologists to convert such qualitative information into continuous quantitative proxy data is through the generation of ordinal-scale climate indices. There is, however, considerable variability in the types of phenomena reconstructed using an index approach and the practice of index development in different parts of the world. This review, written by members of the PAGES (Past Global Changes) CRIAS working group - a collective of climate historians and historical climatologists researching Climate Reconstructions and Impacts from the Archives of Societies - provides the first global synthesis of the use of the index approach in climate reconstruction. We begin by summarising the range of studies that have used indices for climate reconstruction across six continents (Europe, Asia, Africa, the Americas, and Australia) as well as the world's oceans.

This paper draws attention to the need for interpretations that foster policies and institutions with the breadth and flexibility to recognize and support a wide range of locally relevant adaptation strategies. Social scientists have argued that, in practice, the standard definition of adaptation tends to prioritize economic over other values and technical over social responses, draw attention away from underlying causes of vulnerability and from the broader context in which adaptive responses take place, and exclude discussions of inequality, justice, and transformation. In this paper, we discuss an alternate understanding of adaptation, which we label living with climate change, that emerged from an ethnographic study of how rural residents of the U.S. Southwest understand, respond to, and plan for weather and climate in their daily lives, and we consider how it might inform efforts to develop a more comprehensive definition. The discussion brings into focus several underlying features of this lay conception of adaptation, which are crucial for understanding how adaptation actually unfolds on the ground: an ontology based on nature society mutuality; an epistemology based on situated knowledge; practice based on performatively adjusting human activities to a dynamic biophysical and social environment; and a placed-based system of values. We suggest that these features help point the way toward a more comprehensive understanding of climate change adaptation, and one more fully informed by the understanding that we are living in the Anthropocene.

To address that gap, this paper offers a theoretical framework and empirical example responding to such issues. The work's theoretical foci are upon the role of the artist as interlocutor; the importance of arts practices in encouraging children to participate in climate change debates and actions; and the potential of what anthropologist Tim Ingold has called the meteorological imagination. These three matters inform a two-year praxis project - A Map of a Dream of the Future - involving methods from the geohumanities and engagement with young islanders, academics, artists and writers, community cultural development workers, and educators. Together, we worked on various activities to draw out our individual and collective ideas about islands, arts, climate change, and geopolitics. In the process were created an education kit, children's workshops and exhibitions, and a professional art installation at a major national arts festival. At the same time, new insights have been gained about how the meteorological imagination may be a significant resource by which to work with children as they come to terms with a future whose climate has changed.","[Stratford, Elaine] Univ Tasmania, Sch Geog & Environm Studies, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia",University of Tasmania,"Stratford, E (corresponding author), Univ Tasmania, Sch Geog & Environm Studies, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia.",elaine.stratford@utas.edu.au,"Stratford, Elaine/D-1057-2010","Stratford, Elaine/0000-0001-6273-493X",,,,,61,12,12,0,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1473-3285,1473-3277,,CHILD GEOGR,Child.

Today we might be experiencing a climate change of the same magnitude as the transition into an ice age caused by very rapid burning and emission to the atmosphere of a substantial part of the fossilised carbon. Whether this leads to a gradual warming or if we will experience a transition into a different climatic state is presently unknown. The present day state-of-the-art numerical climate models are capable of producing fair representations of the current climate and are as such trusted to also predict the climate changes due to increasing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases. However, the models are not presently capable of reproducing the rapid transitions from one climatic state, such as a glacial climate, into another, such as the present climate. The reason for this is unknown. The transitions are inherently 'non-linear' and thus not accessible through linear response theory. The term 'non-linear' is in this context defined as the phenomenon that the response of the system to a change in the forcing of the system is not linearly proportional to the forcing. This would happen if a threshold is reached such that the state of the system becomes unstable and the system bifurcates into a different state. There are strong indications in the geological records of this kind of behaviour for the climate. These dynamics can be understood in the context of fairly simple models of the climate.","Univ Copenhagen, Niels Bohr Inst, Ctr Ice & Climate, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark",University of Copenhagen; Niels Bohr Institute,"Ditlevsen, PD (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen, Niels Bohr Inst, Ctr Ice & Climate, Juliane Maries Vej 30, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark.",pditlev@gfy.ku.dk,,,,,,,55,8,8,2,16,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0010-7514,1366-5812,,CONTEMP PHYS,Contemp.

The consistency of these results, when obtained using independent techniques, demonstrates that past observed climate changes provide robust constraints on probable future climate changes.

A deeper understanding of the social causes and consequences of climate change is evolving in sociology, yet some of the discipline's subfields have not responded to climate change. Is this because climate change is perceived to be irrelevant or are scholars suppressing new beliefs that could disrupt the norms of their field? The sociology of the arts provides an illustrative case. This subfield has historically ignored environmental factors, but there is mounting pressure for correcting this oversight and rethinking the beliefs and norms of the field. This article argues that climate change is relevant to the sociology of the arts and that this subfield can become more aligned with the geo-ecological turn in sociology and the SSH. This turn is part of a wider epochal and existential transformation in public consciousness in response to broad changes in society and nature. Changing beliefs about the arts are therefore not explained by endogenous dynamics in the arts field. The article provides a meta-analysis of the geo-ecological turn in sociology and in interdisciplinary arts and cultural research where pioneering arguments have emerged. The analysis uses theory of disciplinary transformation in the sociology of science to analyze largely implicit sociological claims for a transformation of 'normal science' beliefs about (1) aesthetic exceptionalism, illustrated by a new conception of music as a study object, and (2) the role of the arts in economic growth. Some implications for the sociology of the arts are considered.","[Holt, Fabian] Roskilde Univ, Dept Commun & Arts, Univ Vej 1,Bldg 43, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark",Roskilde University,"Holt, F (corresponding author), Roskilde Univ, Dept Commun & Arts, Univ Vej 1,Bldg 43, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark.",fabianh@ruc.dk,,"Holt, Fabian/0000-0001-8567-7384",,,,,83,0,0,2,2,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1749-9755,1749-9763,,CULT SOCIOL-LONDON,Cult.

As these models continue to become more sophisticated, it is commonly assumed that the latest generation of climate models will provide us with better estimates of climate change. Here, we quantify the uncertainty in future climate change projections using two multi-model ensembles of climate model simulations and divide it into different components: internal, scenario and model. The contributions of these sources of uncertainty changes as a function of variable, temporal and spatial scale and especially lead time in the future. In the new models, uncertainty intervals for each of the components have increased. For temperature, importance of scenario uncertainty is the largest over low latitudes and increases nonlinearly after the mid-century. It has a small importance for precipitation simulations on all time scales, which hampers estimating the effect which any mitigation efforts might have. In line with current state-of-the-art adaptation approaches, we argue that despite these uncertainties climate models can provide useful information to support adaptation decision-making. Moreover, adaptation decisions should not be postponed in the hope that future improved scientific understanding will result in more accurate predictions of future climate change. Such simulations might not become available. On the contrary, while planning adaptation initiatives, a rational framework for decision-making under uncertainty should be employed.

Different scenarios for a respective gradual technology transition between 2015 and 2050 are provided. State-of-the-art simulations of three-dimensional (313) radiative forcing (RF) distributions are compiled and complemented for the various agents determining aviation climate impact. They are utilized to quantify the globally averaged transient climate response and respective differences between the transition scenarios. A climate impact reduction of between 15% and 50% in terms of RF is indicated for the cryoplane scenarios at the 2050 time slice, with a best estimate near 30% in case of a swift transition. The respective reduction range is between 5% and 15% in terms of surface temperature change, with a best estimate of about 10%. The environmental benefit of a cryoplane transition further increases if time horizons beyond 2050 are considered. Besides known uncertainties in quantifying aviation climate impacts, crucial limitations of our assessment are insufficient knowledge on contrail cirrus induced by cryoplanes and on the feasibility to produce large amounts of LH2 from renewable energy sources.

When this happens, socio-economic livelihoods, particularly in developing economies, would be dealt lethal blow in the wake of associated natural causes such as increased disease burden, soil nutrient destruction, desertification, food insecurity, among others. To avert imminent dangers, nations, including those from Africa, signed a legally binding universally accepted climate control protocol to propagate and regulate environmentally-friendly behaviours globally. The climate vulnerability of Africa as established by literature is concerning. Despite contributing relatively less than other continents to aggregate environmental injustice, the continent is projected to bear the most brunt of environmental degradation. This is on account of her inability to put systems and mechanisms in place to stem consequences of climate change. Hence, our resolve to use a combination of scientific and artistic models to design a response system for tackling climate challenges in Africa. Our model formulation encompasses computational model and creative arts model for drawing attention to environmentally friendly behaviours and climate adaptation and mitigation strategies. In this work, we focus on rural Africa to share experience of climate change impact on agriculture mainstay of rural African economy. We examine the carbon footprints of a rural community in Nigeria the Adum-Aiona community as case study and for industrial experience. The authors will provide operational data to substantiate claims of existential threats posed by greenhouse gas (GHG) generation on livelihoods of rural dwellers. The study will also design and test a Climate Change Response System (CCRS) that will enable people to adapt and reduce climate change impact. To achieve the research objective, the researchers will review literature, gather requirements, model the proposed system using Unified Modelling Language (UML), and test CCRS statically. We expect that the implementation of the proposed system will enable people mitigate the effects of, and adapt to, climate change-induced socio-economic realities. This is besides the fact that the empirical data provided by the study will help clear doubts about the real or perceived threats of climate change. Finally, the industrial experience and case study we share from Africa using model-driven engineering approach will scale up the repository of knowledge of both climate change research and model-driven engineering community.","[Okewu, Emmanuel] Univ Lagos, Ctr Informat Technol & Syst, Lagos, Nigeria; [Misra, Sanjay] Covenant Univ, Dept Comp & Informat Sci, Ota, Nigeria; [Misra, Sanjay] Atilim Univ, Ankara, Turkey; [Okewu, Jonathan] Fed Univ, Dept Visual & Creat Arts, Lafia, Nigeria",University of Lagos; Covenant University; Atilim University,"Okewu, E (corresponding author), Univ Lagos, Ctr Informat Technol & Syst, Lagos, Nigeria.",okewue@yahoo.com; sanjay.misra@covenantuniversity.edu.ng; jonathan.okewu@gmail.com,"Misra, Sanjay/K-2203-2014","Misra, Sanjay/0000-0002-3556-9331",,,,,58,6,6,0,10,POLITECHNIKA LUBELSKA,LUBLIN,"WYDZIAL INZYNIERII SRODOWSKA, UL NADBYSTRZYCKA 40 B, LUBLIN, 20-618, POLAND",1895-6912,,,PROBL EKOROZW,Probl.

The employed technique entails the empirical-statistical downscaling method quantile mapping (QM), which is applied in two different settings, first for bias correction and downscaling of raw climate model data to rural stations with long-term measurements and second for spatial transfer of bias-corrected and downscaled climate model data to the respective urban target site. The resulting products are daily minimum and maximum temperatures at five urban sites in Switzerland until the end of the 21st century under three emission scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP8.5). We test the second-step QM approach in an extensive evaluation framework, using long-term observational data of two exemplary weather stations in Zurich. Results indicate remarkably good skill of QM in present-day climate. Comparing the generated urban climate projections with existing climate scenarios of adjacent rural sites allows us to represent the urban heat island (UHI) effect in future temperature-based heat indices, namely tropical nights, summer days and hot days. Urban areas will be more strongly affected by rising temperatures than rural sites in terms of fixed threshold exceedances, especially during nighttime. Projections for the end of the century for Zurich, for instance, suggest more than double the number of tropical nights (Tmin above 20 degrees C) at the urban site (45 nights per year, multi-model median) compared to the rural counterpart (20 nights) under RCP8.5.","[Burgstall, Annkatrin; Kotlarski, Sven; Casanueva, Ana] Fed Off Meteorol & Climatol MeteoSwiss, Zurich, Switzerland; [Casanueva, Ana] Univ Cantabria, Dept Appl Math & Comp Sci, Meteorol Grp, Santander, Spain; [Hertig, Elke] Univ Augsburg, Fac Med Reg Climate Change & Hlth, Augsburg, Germany; [Fischer, Erich; Knutti, Reto] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, Zurich, Switzerland",Federal Office of Meteorology & Climatology (MeteoSwiss); Universidad de Cantabria; University of Augsburg; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Burgstall, A (corresponding author), Fed Off Meteorol & Climatol MeteoSwiss, Zurich, Switzerland.",annkatrin.burgstall@meteoswiss.ch,"Knutti, Reto/B-8763-2008; Fischer, Erich/B-6067-2011","Knutti, Reto/0000-0001-8303-6700; Fischer, Erich/0000-0003-1931-6737",European Commission [HEAT-SHIELD 668786]; German Research Foundation [408057478],European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre); German Research Foundation(German Research Foundation (DFG)),This research has been partly supported by the European Commission (HEAT-SHIELD 668786).

It converses with histories of writing and computation, including surrealistic 'algorithmic writing', recombinatory poems and 'electronic literature'. At the core lies a reflection about how machine learning's associative, predictive and regenerative capacities can be employed in playful, critical and contemplative goals. Our goal is not automating writing (as in product-oriented applications of AI). Instead, as poet Charles Hartman argues, 'the question isn't exactly whether a poet or a computer writes the poem, but what kinds of collaboration might be interesting' (1996, p. 5). STS scholars critique labs as future-making sites and machine learning modelling practices and, for example, describe them also as fictions. Building on these critiques and in line with 'critical technical practice' (Agre, 1997), we embed our critique of 'making the future' in how we employ machine learning to design a tool for looking ahead and telling stories on life with climate change. This has involved engaging with climate narratives and machine learning from the critical and practical perspectives of artistic research. We trained machine learning algorithms (i.e. GPT-2 and AttnGAN) using climate fiction novels (as a dataset of cultural imaginaries of the future). We prompted them to produce new climate fiction stories and images, which we edited to create a tarot-like deck and a story-book, thus also playfully engaging with machine learning's predictive associations. The tarot deck is designed to facilitate conversations about climate change. How to imagine the future beyond scenarios of resilience and the dystopian? How to aid our transition into different ways of caring for the planet and each other?","[Querubin, Natalia Sanchez] Univ Amsterdam, Media Studies, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Niederer, Sabine] Amsterdam Univ Appl Sci, Visual Methodol Collect, Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam,"Querubin, NS (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, Turfdraagsterpad 2, NL-1012 XT Amsterdam, Netherlands.",N.SanchezQuerubin@uva.nl,,,Centre of Expertise for Creative Innovation,Centre of Expertise for Creative Innovation,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.

Additionally, changes in climate are expected to increase the frequency and intensity of weather conditions that cause these construction delays. Researchers have investigated the effect of weather on several aspects of construction. Still, no previous study comprehensively (1) identifies and quantifies the risks weather imposes on construction projects, (2) categorizes modeling and simulation approaches developed, and (3) summarizes mitigation strategies and adaptation techniques to provide best management practices for the construction industry. This paper accomplishes these goals through a systematic state-of-the-art review of 3207 articles published between 1972 and October 2020. This review identified extreme temperatures, precipitation, and high winds as the most impactful weather conditions on construction. Despite the prevalence of climate-focused delay studies, existing research fails to account for future climate in the modeling and identification of delay mitigation strategies. Accordingly, planners and project managers can use this research to identify weather-vulnerable activities, account for changing climate in projects, and build administrative or organizational capacity to assist in mitigating weather delays in construction. The cumulative contribution of this review will enable sustainable construction scheduling that is robust to a changing climate.","[Schuldt, Steven J.; Nicholson, Mathew R.; Adams, Yaquarri A., II; Delorit, Justin D.] Air Force Inst Technol, Grad Sch Engn & Management, Wright Patterson AFB, OH 45433 USA",Air Force Institute of Technology; Air Force Institute of Technology Graduate School of Engineering & Management; Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT),"Schuldt, SJ (corresponding author), Air Force Inst Technol, Grad Sch Engn & Management, Wright Patterson AFB, OH 45433 USA.",steven.schuldt@afit.edu; mathew.nicholson@afit.edu; yaquarri.adams@afit.edu; justin.delorit@afit.edu,"Schuldt, Steven/T-2335-2018","Schuldt, Steven/0000-0002-4234-7454",,,,,134,7,7,7,16,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,MAR,2021,5,,,,,,2861,10.3390/su13052861,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13052861,,,25,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,QW3YE,,"Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000628588400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

These changes have been linked to human-induced climate change, while the degree to which climate change impacts an individual extreme climate event (ECE) is more difficult to quantify. Rapid progress in event attribution has recently been made through improved understanding of observed and simulated climate variability, methods for event attribution and advances in numerical modelling. Attribution for extreme temperature events is stronger compared with other event types, notably those related to the hydrological cycle. Recent advances in the understanding of ECEs, both in observations and their representation in state-of-the-art climate models, open new opportunities for assessing their effect on human and natural systems. Improved spatial resolution in global climate models and advances in statistical and dynamical downscaling now provide climatic information at appropriate spatial and temporal scales. Together with the continued development of Earth System Models that simulate biogeochemical cycles and interactions with the biosphere at increasing complexity, these make it possible to develop a mechanistic understanding of howECEs affect biological processes, ecosystem functioning and adaptation capabilities. Limitations in the observational network, both for physical climate system parameters and even more so for long-term ecological monitoring, have hampered progress in understanding bio-physical interactions across a range of scales. New opportunities for assessing how ECEs modulate ecosystem structure and functioning arise from better scientific understanding of ECEs coupled with technological advances in observing systems and instrumentation.

In this paper, we report on a survey that we conducted to evaluate the application of interactive visualization methods and to identify the problems related to establishing such methods in scientific practice. The feedback from 76 participants shows clearly that state-of-the-art techniques are rarely applied and that integrating existing solutions smoothly into the scientists workflow is problematic. We have begun to change this and present first results that illustrate how interactive visualization tools can be successfully applied to accomplish climate research tasks.

Conceptual understanding of these projected precipitation changes is difficult if only based on coupled general circulation model (CGCM) simulations, due to the complexity of these models. In this study we describe a simple deconstruction of the ensemble mean CMIP5 projections based on sensitivity simulations with the globally resolved energy balance (GREB) model. In a series of sensitivity experiments we force the GREB model with four different CMIP5 ensemble mean changes in: surface temperature, evaporation and the vertical atmospheric velocities mean and its standard deviation. The resulting response in the precipitation of the GREB model is very close to the CMIP5 ensemble mean response, suggesting that the precipitation changes can be well represented by a linear combination of these four forcings. The results further provide good insights into the drivers of precipitation change. The GREB model suggests that not one forcing alone can be seen as the main driver, but only the combination of all four changes results in the complex response pattern. However, the dominant forcings are the changes in the large-scale circulation, rather than the pure thermodynamic warming effect. Here, it is interesting to note that changes in high-frequency atmospheric variability of vertical air motion (weather), that are partly independent of the changes in the mean circulation, have a control on the pattern of the time-mean global precipitation changes. The approach presented here provides a powerful basis on which the hydrological cycles of CGCM simulations can be analysed.","[Stassen, Christian; Dommenget, Dietmar] Monash Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Climate Syst Sci, Clayton, Vic, Australia; [Dommenget, Dietmar] Monash Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Climate Extremes, Clayton, Vic, Australia; [Chadwick, Robin] Met Off Hadley Ctr, Exeter, Devon, England; [Chadwick, Robin] Univ Exeter, Global Syst Inst, Exeter, Devon, England",Monash University; Monash University; Met Office - UK; Hadley Centre; University of Exeter,"Stassen, C (corresponding author), Monash Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Climate Syst Sci, Clayton, Vic, Australia.",christian.stassen@monash.edu,"Stassen, Christian/ABC-3014-2020","Stassen, Christian/0000-0002-5407-4297",Australian Research Council (ARC); ARC Centre of Excellence in Climate System Science [CE110001028]; ARC Centre of Excellence in Climate Extremes [CE170100023]; Newton Fund through the Met Office Climate Science for Service Partnership Brazil (CSSP Brazil),Australian Research Council (ARC)(Australian Research Council); ARC Centre of Excellence in Climate System Science(Australian Research Council); ARC Centre of Excellence in Climate Extremes; Newton Fund through the Met Office Climate Science for Service Partnership Brazil (CSSP Brazil),"This study was supported by the Australian Research Council (ARC), with additional support coming via the ARC Centre of Excellence in Climate System Science (CE110001028) and the ARC Centre of Excellence in Climate Extremes (CE170100023).

Like Anna Tsing's exploration of collaborative survival, Zylinska's counterapocalypse is founded on the notion of precarity as a shared condition of life in the postindustrial world. This article focuses on art-science projects by Joaquin Fargas (Argentina) and Paul Rosero Contreras (Ecuador) that imagine environmental futures. In contrasting their projects the author asks how they endorse or subvert the anthropocentrism that often motivates the representation of climate change as reversible (humans save the planet) or, indeed, as irreversible (humans destroy the planet). Drawing on the work of Andreas Weber and several Latin American scholars, including Eduardo Gudynas and Raquel Gutierrez Aguilar, the author suggests ways in which biosemiotic and biocentric perspectives may make a valuable contribution to the counterapocalypse Zylinska proposes. The analysis of Rosero's work in particular opens up ways in which one might consider other paradigms rather than precarity as the basis for a postanthropocentric counterapocalypse, including abundance, reciprocity, collaboration, and coevolution. These are found everywhere in complex ecosystems and relate closely to the principles on which theories and practices of the commons are founded, both in Latin America and beyond.","[Page, Joanna] Univ Cambridge, Fac Modern & Medieval Languages & Linguist, Cambridge, England",University of Cambridge,"Page, J (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Fac Modern & Medieval Languages & Linguist, Cambridge, England.",,,,British Academy in the UK,British Academy in the UK,"I am grateful to the anonymous reviewers for their perceptive feedback on the first version of this article.

However, the state of the art in the current literature is that the theoretical assumptions underlying the concept of prison climate are unclear, and empirical studies on prison climate lack precision. Purpose: The aims of this paper are to provide (1) an overview of the general theoretical model, (2) a review of the empirical literature and its shortcomings in relation to the model, and (3) to test the relevant theoretical assumptions regarding the existence of shared and distinct prison climates. Methods: This is done using high-quality data from the Life in Custody Study, a nation-wide survey study among men and women imprisoned in the Netherlands (N = 4538). Results: Supporting evidence is found for the existence of a shared prison climate, which can distinguish between prisons and prison units. Yet, most variation rests with individual perceptions. Contextual effects of different dimensions of climate are identified for well-being and misconduct. Conclusions: Distinct prison climates exist for prison units, and to a lesser extent prisons, and they can be detected with sufficiently large samples. Adequate methods are required to measure prison climate, including climate consensus, and study its effects.","[van Ginneken, Esther F. J.

Departing from my fieldwork among farming artists in the Hong Kong countryside and in the Japanese satoyama - rural mountain - areas, I will, on the one hand, argue that art practices are 'cosmopolitanized' by the awareness of global risks, manifested in anticipation of the comprehensive climatic changes (in)discriminately affecting across nations and regions. At the same time, and importantly, art practices are actively attending to this 'risky' cosmopolitanization, giving aesthetic voice, form and 'visuality' to unfolding climatic issues and concerns and hereby practising what I will call an 'aesthetics of cosmopolitanization'.","[Thorsen, Line Marie] Aarhus Univ, Dept Art Hist, Inst Commun & Culture, Langelandsgade 139,Bldg 1586,313, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark",Aarhus University,"Thorsen, LM (corresponding author), Aarhus Univ, Dept Art Hist, Inst Commun & Culture, Langelandsgade 139,Bldg 1586,313, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark.",lm.thorsen@gmail.com,,,,,,,52,0,0,0,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1470-2266,1471-0374,,GLOBAL NETW,Glob.

Case study is the iconic complex, internationally known as the National Art Schools of Cuba. It consists of five buildings built in the early 1960s within a park of Habana next to the Caribbean Sea. The path of the river (Rio Quibu) crossing the estate was modified to fit the landscape design. The complex has then been exposed to the risk of flooding. The School of Ballet, located in a narrow meander of the river, slightly upstream of a bridge and partially obstructing the flow, is particularly subject to frequent flash floods from the Rio Quibu, and it needs urgent restoration. Keeping ISA Modern is a project aimed at preserving the Schools complex. Based upon in situ surveys on the Rio Quibu and local area measurements during 2019, numerical modelling, and previous work by the Cuban National Institute of Hydraulic Resources, we pursued a flood risk analysis for the area, and a preliminary analysis of available risk reduction strategies. Using HEC-RAS 2D software for hydraulic modelling, we evaluated the flooded area and the hydraulic conditions (flow depth, velocity) for floods with given return periods. Our results show that SB is a building most subject to flooding, with high levels of risk. Defense strategies as designed by Cuban authorities may include a (new) wall around the School of Ballet and widening of the river channel, with high impact and cost, although not definitive. Temporary, light, permanent, and low cost/impact flood proofing structures may be used with similar effectiveness. We demonstrate that relatively little expensive hydraulic investigation may aid flood modelling and risk assessment in support of conservation projects for historically valuable sites. This may support brainstorming and the selection of (low to high cost) adaptation and risk reduction measures in the coastal areas of Cuba in response to ever increasing extreme storms and sea level rise controlling flood dynamics under transient climate change.","[Stucchi, Leonardo; Bocchiola, Daniele; Rosso, Renzo] Politecn Milan, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Bignami, Daniele Fabrizio] Fdn Politecn Milano, L da Vinci 32, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Del Curto, Davide; Garzulino, Andrea] Politecn Milan, Dept Architecture & Urban Studies, I-20133 Milan, Italy",Polytechnic University of Milan; Polytechnic University of Milan; Polytechnic University of Milan,"Bocchiola, D (corresponding author), Politecn Milan, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, I-20133 Milan, Italy.",leonardo.stucchi@polimi.it; daniele.bignami@polimi.it; daniele.bocchiola@polimi.it; davide.delcurto@polimi.it; andrea.garzulino@polimi.it; renzo.rosso@polimi.it,,"GARZULINO, ANDREA/0000-0001-9010-1662; Rosso, Renzo/0000-0003-1062-1911; STUCCHI, LEONARDO/0000-0002-8456-7236; DEL CURTO, DAVIDE/0000-0001-6877-8554; Bocchiola, Daniele/0000-0001-8493-0894",Keeping It Modern grant by the Getty Foundation [R-ORG-201839332],Keeping It Modern grant by the Getty Foundation,This work is in partial fulfilment of the Keeping ISA Modern project 2018-2020 funded by the Keeping It Modern grant initiative by the Getty Foundation [Grant no.

Further, it has been found that in those cases where the synchronous state was followed by a steady increase in the coupling strength between the indices, the synchronous state was destroyed, after which a new climate state emerged. These shifts are associated with significant changes in global temperature trend and in El Nino/Southern Oscillation variability. Subsequently, the evidence for such type of behavior has been found to occur in three climate simulations using state-of-the-art models as well as in the observed data in the 21st century. This was the first time that this mechanism, which appears consistent with the theory of synchronized chaos, has been discovered in a physical system of the size and complexity of the climate system. Here we extend this approach to consider proxy data for climate modes going back several centuries. While noise in the proxy data in some cases masks the mechanism, we find significant coherence between both synchronization and coupling and global temperature. These results provide further support that the above mechanism for climate shifts is a robust feature of the climate system.","[Tsonis, Anastasios A.; Swanson, Kyle L.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Math Sci, Atmospher Sci Grp, Milwaukee, WI 53217 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Milwaukee,"Tsonis, AA (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Math Sci, Atmospher Sci Grp, Milwaukee, WI 53217 USA.",aatsonis@uwm.edu; kswanson@uwm.edu,,,NSF [AGS - 0902564],NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),This work is supported by NSF grant AGS - 0902564.,,32,5,5,0,13,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0218-1274,1793-6551,,INT J BIFURCAT CHAOS,Int.

This argument is based on research referred to in this article, where the author made use of dissensus to analyse how encounters with contemporary art contribute to movements in youngsters' ways of relating to artworks and the environment that surrounds them, as well as changes in the ways of relating to themselves and others - what here is called events of subjectivation. As dissensus is seen as a premise for subjectivation, the author argues for initiating dissensus by introducing students to both art and educational practices that contrast the norm and disrupt the expected. The article also discusses why dissensus as an educational strategy and an aesthetic turn in education seems to be urgent in a contemporary educational climate.","[Skregelid, Lisbet] Univ Agder, Fac Fine Arts, Dept Visual Arts & Drama, Postboks 422, Kristiansand 4604, Norway",University of Agder,"Skregelid, L (corresponding author), Univ Agder, Fac Fine Arts, Dept Visual Arts & Drama, Postboks 422, Kristiansand 4604, Norway.",Lisbet.Skregelid@uia.no,,,,,,,37,2,2,0,1,INTELLECT LTD,BRISTOL,"THE MILL, PARNALL RD, BRISTOL, BS16 3JG, ENGLAND",1743-5234,2040-090X,,INT J EDUC ART,Int.

The environmental crisis, led by climate change and the loss of biodiversity along with the end of fossil fuels, are the greatest challenges of our time. It is a crisis of our livelihoods, as well as our culture, worldview and the construction of knowledge. It requires the attention of all disciplines, sectors and agents, including the humanities, and specifically, art. This article focuses on studying one of the most recent artistic manifestations -transitional art- born in the United Kingdom (Neal, 2015) and related to the Transition Town Movement (TTM). Through a case study in Spain and the United Kingdom we seek to identify what type of art corresponds to the challenges of the Capitalocene, to later verify what characteristics of transitional art are appropriate to our time and finally to know if transitional art can respond to this global challenge.","[Sanchez Leon, Nuria] Univ Politecn Valencia, Valencia, Spain",Universitat Politecnica de Valencia,"Leon, NS (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Valencia, Valencia, Spain.",nurisanle@gmail.com,"SÁNCHEZ-LEÓN, NURIA/GYD-3873-2022; Sanchez Leon, Nuria/F-6664-2018","Sanchez Leon, Nuria/0000-0003-3537-9156",,,,,29,1,1,1,3,UNIV MURCIA,Murcia,"Edificio Pleiades Campus de Espinardo, Murcia, 30071, SPAIN",1889-979X,1989-8452,,ARTE POLIT IDENTIDAD,Arte Polit.

Here we focus on three key aspects of CMIP6: what is new in these models, how the available CMIP6 models evaluate compared to CMIP5, and their projections of the future Australian climate compared to CMIP5 focussing on the highest emissions scenario. The CMIP6 ensemble has several new features of relevance to policymakers and others, for example, the integrated matrix of socioeconomic and concentration pathways. The CMIP6 models show incremental improvements in the simulation of the climate in the Australian region, including a reduced equatorial Pacific cold tongue bias, slightly improved rainfall teleconnections with large-scale climate drivers, improved representation of atmosphere and ocean extreme heat events, as well as dynamic sea level. However, important regional biases remain, evident in the excessive rainfall over the Maritime Continent and rainfall pattern biases in the nearby tropical convergence zones. Projections of Australian temperature and rainfall from the available CMIP6 ensemble broadly agree with those from CMIP5, except for a group of CMIP6 models with higher climate sensitivity and greater warming and increase in some extremes after 2050. CMIP6 rainfall projections are similar to CMIP5, but the ensemble examined has a narrower range of rainfall change in austral summer in Northern Australia and austral winter in Southern Australia. Overall, future national projections are likely to be similar to previous versions but perhaps with some areas of improved confidence and clarity.","[Grose, M.

The article draws upon the writer's experience as head of Art and Design and upon his own research interests in the creation of performance work combining art and dance. The text begins with a specific memory of the Dartington Dance Festival and touches upon the approach to dance at the college during those years. It goes on to describe the focus of the course in Art and Social Context with its student residencies, which reflected a tradition in Dartington as a whole of promoting the arts in the wider community. Some features of the college as a centre for training in the arts are drawn out, especially its focus on creating new work and a general ethos of experiment that prevailed. A combination of this creative focus, together with a changing cultural climate, a departure from traditional forms in the arts and an emphasis on working in unpredictable settings in local communities, presented challenges for training that are discussed.","[Crickmay, Chris] Open Univ, Milton Keynes, Bucks, England; [Crickmay, Chris] Dartington Coll Arts, Falmouth, England; [Crickmay, Chris] UWE Bristol, Bristol, Avon, England",Open University - UK; University College Falmouth; University of West England,"Crickmay, C (corresponding author), Open Univ, Milton Keynes, Bucks, England.;Crickmay, C (corresponding author), Dartington Coll Arts, Falmouth, England.;Crickmay, C (corresponding author), UWE Bristol, Bristol, Avon, England.",,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1944-3927,1944-3919,,THEATR DANCE PERFORM,Theatr.

Of 1903 animal engravings, 1514 contained sufficient detail to allow identification with confidence. In addition, the stratigraphy of the engravings and the depiction of domesticates provide a broad chronological framework that allows a division into images created during the Holocene humid phase and animals represented after the onset of desert conditions. Despite the large sample size, only 16 animal species could be identified, which represents an extraordinarily narrow species spectrum. Comparison with the scarce faunal record of the Arabian Peninsula shows that all larger animals that are thought to have been present in the area were also depicted in the rock art. The contemporaneous presence of at least four large carnivores during the Holocene humid phase suggests that prey animals were abundant, and that the landscape consisted of a mosaic of habitats, potentially with thicker vegetation along the water courses of the wadis and more open vegetation in the landscape around them. Community Earth System Models (COSMOS) climate simulations show that Shuwaymis was at the northern edge of the African Summer Monsoon rainfall regime. It is therefore possible that Shuwaymis was ecologically connected with southwestern Arabia, and that an arid barrier remained in place to the north, restricting the dispersal of Levantine species into Arabia.","[Guagnin, Maria; Jennings, Richard; Eager, Heidi; Parton, Ash; Stimpson, Christopher; Groucutt, Huw S.; Petraglia, Michael D.] Univ Oxford, Res Lab Archaeol & Hist Art, Hayes House,75 George St, Oxford, England; [Drake, Nick A.] Kings Coll London, Dept Geog, London, England; [Stepanek, Christian; Pfeiffer, Madlene] Helmholtz Ctr Polar & Marine Res, Alfred Wegener Inst, Bremerhaven, Germany; [Alsharekh, Abdullah] King Saud Univ, Dept Archaeol, Riyadh 11451, Saudi Arabia","University of Oxford; University of London; King's College London; Helmholtz Association; Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar & Marine Research; King Saud University","Guagnin, M (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Res Lab Archaeol & Hist Art, Hayes House,75 George St, Oxford, England.",maria.guagnin@rlaha.ox.ac.uk,"Petraglia, Michael/ABA-9748-2021; Stepanek, Christian/ABA-9210-2021; Alsharekh, Abdullah M/AAH-3718-2019; Groucutt, Huw/GNM-5500-2022","Guagnin, Maria/0000-0002-7995-8611; Stepanek, Christian/0000-0002-3912-6271; Petraglia, Michael/0000-0003-2522-5727",European Research Council [295719],European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)European Commission),"The Palaeodeserts rock art research was funded by the European Research Council (no. 295719, to MDP).",,88,22,22,2,16,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0959-6836,1477-0911,,HOLOCENE,Holocene,NOV,2016,11,,,,1822,1834,,10.1177/0959683616645949,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683616645949,,,13,"Geography, Physical; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;HCI),Physical Geography; Geology,DZ4VW,,"Green Submitted, Green Published",,,12/21/22,WOS:000385859800008,View Full Record in Web of Science

With its Anglophone roots in the Cold War, species suicide discourse unites concerns about nuclear arsenals, so-called overpopulation, and environmental injustice across disciplines. Species suicide discourse is indebted to the US-based field of suicide prevention, which for more than half a century has analyzed suicide notes in search of effective prevention methods. Therefore, to theorize suicide prevention in relation to anthropogenic climate change, this article imagines a version of this genre that mediates between individual and collective subjects-called a species suicide note. As an example, the interdisciplinary and multimedia art project Dear Climate (2012-ongoing) by Una Chaudhuri, Oliver Kellhammer, and Marina Zurkow rewrites familiar narratives of crisis, shifting species suicide notes toward irony and unconventional techniques of hope. In analyzing these performative species suicide notes, the author complicates species suicide prevention by foregrounding narratives of irony. These notes accentuate a self-reflexive irony that works toward climate justice for vulnerable humans and more-than-human species.","[Cardon, Kristen] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept English, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Cardon, K (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept English, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA.",,,,,,,,50,0,0,0,0,DUKE UNIV PRESS,DURHAM,"905 W MAIN ST, STE 18-B, DURHAM, NC 27701 USA",2201-1919,,,ENVIRON HUMANITIES,Environ.

But how then did anyone first get the idea to make marks that depict the real world? The answer may ultimately be environmental. As humans spread out from their native warm zones they encountered new climates, which required changes in survival strategies. As they pushed further into harsher and colder frontiers, humans were forced to adopt the micro-climate strategy-thick animal hide clothing and completely enclosed animal hide tents. Our experiments with Paleolithic tent reconstructions show that random small holes in the hide covering allowed in a stream of daylight, which projected moving images of the outside world onto the interior surfaces, making an accidental but functional camera obscura.

We show how quickly rock art panels have degraded in recent decades, contending that climate-catalysed salt efflorescence is responsible for increasing exfoliation of the limestone cave surfaces that house the similar to 45 to 20-thousand-year-old paintings. These artworks are located in the world's most atmospherically dynamic region, the Australasian monsoon domain. The rising frequency and severity of El Nirio-induced droughts from anthropogenic climate change (that is, higher ambient temperatures and more consecutive dry days), combined with seasonal moisture injected via monsoonal rains retained as standing water in the rice fields and aquaculture ponds of the region, increasingly provide ideal conditions for evaporation and haloclasty, accelerating rock art deterioration.","[Huntley, J.; Aubert, M.; Oktaviana, A.

The climate system is frequently interpreted in terms of a simple energy balance model, in which it is assumed that individual feedback mechanisms are additive and act independently. Here we test these assumptions by systematically controlling, or locking, the radiative feedbacks in a state-of-the-art climate model. The method is shown to yield a near-perfect decomposition of change into partial temperature contributions pertaining to forcing and each of the feedbacks. In the studied model water vapor feedback stands for about half the temperature change, CO2-forcing about one third, while cloud and surface albedo feedback contributions are relatively small. We find a close correspondence between forcing, feedback and partial surface temperature response for the water vapor and surface albedo feedbacks, while the cloud feedback is inefficient in inducing surface temperature change. Analysis suggests that cloud-induced warming in the upper tropical troposphere, consistent with rising convective cloud anvils in a warming climate enhances the negative lapse-rate feedback, thereby offsetting some of the warming that would otherwise be attributable to this positive cloud feedback. By subsequently combining feedback mechanisms we find a positive synergy acting between the water vapor feedback and the cloud feedback; that is, the combined cloud and water vapor feedback is greater than the sum of its parts. Negative synergies surround the surface albedo feedback, as associated cloud and water vapor changes dampen the anticipated climate change induced by retreating snow and ice. Our results highlight the importance of treating the coupling between clouds, water vapor and temperature in a deepening troposphere.","[Mauritsen, Thorsten] Max Planck Inst Meteorol, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany; [Graversen, Rune G.] Stockholm Univ, Dept Meteorol, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Klocke, Daniel] European Ctr Medium Range Weather Forecasts, Reading RG2 9AX, Berks, England; [Langen, Peter L.; Stevens, Bjorn; Tomassini, Lorenzo] DMI, Copenhagen, Denmark",Max Planck Society; Stockholm University; European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF); Danish Meteorological Institute DMI,"Mauritsen, T (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Meteorol, Bundesstr 55, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany.",thorsten.mauritsen@zmaw.de,"Langen, Peter L/AAR-1120-2021; Mauritsen, Thorsten/G-5880-2013; Stevens, Bjorn/A-1757-2013; Graversen, Rune G/C-3956-2016","Langen, Peter L/0000-0003-2185-012X; Mauritsen, Thorsten/0000-0003-1418-4077; Stevens, Bjorn/0000-0003-3795-0475; Klocke, Daniel/0000-0001-7405-013X; Graversen, Rune/0000-0003-4899-553X",,,,,41,48,50,3,54,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0930-7575,1432-0894,,CLIM DYNAM,Clim.

We show that important discrepancies at large-scales exist between global and regional projections. The RCMs project at the end of the 21st century over a large area of Europe a summer warming 1.5-2 K colder, and a much smaller decrease of precipitation of 5%, versus 20% in their driving GCMs. The RCMs generally simulate a much smaller increase in shortwave radiation at surface, which directly impacts surface temperature. In addition to differences in cloud cover changes, the absence of time-varying anthropogenic aerosols in most regional simulations plays a major role in the differences of solar radiation changes. We confirm this result with twin regional simulations with and without time-varying anthropogenic aerosols. Additionally, the RCMs simulate larger increases in evapotranspiration over the Mediterranean sea and larger increases/smaller decreases over land, which contribute to smaller changes in relative humidity, with likely impacts on clouds and precipitation changes. Several potential causes of these differences in evapotranspiration changes are discussed. Overall, this work suggests that the current EURO-CORDEX RCM ensemble does not capture the upper part of the climate change uncertainty range, with important implications for impact studies and the adaptation policies that they inform.","[Boe, Julien] Univ Toulouse, CECI, CERFACS CNRS, Toulouse, France; [Somot, Samuel; Nabat, Pierre] METEO FRANCE CNRS, CNRM, Toulouse, France; [Corre, Lola] METEO FRANCE, DCSC, Toulouse, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CERFACS; Universite de Toulouse; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Meteo France; Meteo France,"Boe, J (corresponding author), Univ Toulouse, CECI, CERFACS CNRS, Toulouse, France.",boe@cerfacs.fr,"Somot, Samuel/A-7585-2008","Boe, Julien/0000-0003-2965-4721",EUCP project; European Commission through the Horizon 2020 Programme for Research and Innovation [776613],EUCP project; European Commission through the Horizon 2020 Programme for Research and Innovation,"We acknowledge the World Climate Research Programme's Working Group on Regional Climate, and the Working Group on Coupled Modelling, former coordinating body of CORDEX and responsible panel for CMIP5.

The contribution of multiple wave generation areas is considered. It is found that the projected climate change signal is effectively propagated from the winds along the extratropical storm tracks to remote locations, in the tropical and subtropical latitudes, through swell waves. The statistically significant projected changes in swell wave heights and swell predominance at the remote swell arrival locations are comparable with the ones at the wave generation areas. Furthermore, different incoming directions for swell events at remote locations are shown to often carry opposite climate change signals, propagated from different remote origins.

The study analyses Suriname's historical climate (1990-2014) and provides climate projections for three time horizons (2020-2044, 2045-2069, 2070-2094) and two emissions scenarios (intermediate/SSP2-4.5 and severe/SSP5-8.5). Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) modeling is used to analyze changes in sea level, temperature, precipitation, relative humidity, and winds. In addition, risk impact chains were produced for the country's four most important socio-economic sectors: agriculture and fisheries, forestry, water, and infrastructure. Results show the temperature is expected to increase for all regions and timeframes, reaching warming up to 6 degrees C in the southern region in the long-term future (2070-2094). Projections point towards a reduction in precipitation in the southwest and coastal regions and a rise in mean sea level. Regarding risk, Paramaribo and Wanica face the highest climate risk.

Although heterosexual students see few problems with the campus sexual orientation climate, bisexual men and women describe being challenged on the authenticity of their orientation, and lesbian and, to a greater extent, gay male students report harassment and exclusion in a number of settings. These distinct processes are influenced by broader heteronormative standards.

It is characterized by rainfall (convection) variability on multiple spatial and temporal scales. Various large-scale atmospheric, oceanic, and coupled climate systems, such as the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO), and cold surge, exert significant influences on the spatio-temporal complexity of the MC climate and climate variability. As a major tropical heat source located within the warmest oceanic area (the western Pacific warm pool), the MC has been identified as a region of great importance for climate variation on the global scale. However, prediction of climate variability over the MC and its surrounding areas and the relationships to large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns are big challenges, even for state-of-the-art climate models.

However, the staging of major tourist events has not only led to increased CO2 emissions in Austria, the events themselves have also been affected by climate change. The paper at hand is based on a data collection and review process which covered the relevant peer reviewed and grey literature. This comprehensive process was based on, and was open to, contributions by the full scientific community of relevant Austrian researchers and experts. The compilation process of the report followed quality standards such as the involvement of international partners as review editors within the review process. In addition, the literature was surveyed to integrate the international state of the art. The paper discusses the relationship between events and climate change by looking at mitigation measures on the one hand as well as adaptive strategies taken by event organizers on the other. However, a significant lack of objective information and data as well as appropriate scientific studies also became obvious in this process. Against this background main tasks and challenges for further research are identified and discussed. The paper closes with managerial implications for the organization of major events. Management implications: The literature review and the analyses of case study reports on events support the following suggestions: Climate change mitigation measures and environmental issues should be already a significant part of the call, the following application by the destination and the final decision making. The application of specific environmental and climate friendly guidelines, awards or certificates are helpful tools to motivate the branch and to achieve green events. Measures related to transportation and mobility are crucial to achieve significant savings of greenhouse emissions. Further important aspects to be considered are waste management, catering, communication, accommodation and site selection. Climate research may help to define a suitable period for the event at the desired location which is likely to avoid or reduce possible climate change related risks such as extreme heat or lack of snows.","[Burton, Anna; Fritz, Oliver] Austrian Inst Econ Res WIFO, Vienna, Austria; [Proebstl-Haider, Ulrike] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Landscape Dev Recreat & Conservat Planning I, Vienna, Austria; [Ginner, Kathrin; Formayer, Herbert] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Meteorol & Climatol, Vienna, Austria","University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna; University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna","Fritz, O (corresponding author), Austrian Inst Econ Res WIFO, Vienna, Austria.",oliver.fritz@wifo.ac.at,,"Fritz, Oliver/0000-0002-5942-8621; Formayer, Herbert/0000-0002-2126-9696",Climate and Energy Fund,Climate and Energy Fund,This project has been funded by the Climate and Energy Fund and carried out within the framework of the Austrian Climate Research Program (ACRP) -10th Call.,,103,0,0,3,9,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2213-0780,2213-0799,,J OUTDOOR REC TOUR,J.

Another Anglo-Irish writer, George Moore, underlined in his art criticism written in the 1880s and 1890s the radical transformations brought about by this pictorial movement. This article examines how George Moore responded to the disruptive nature of works by Whistler, Monet and Manet. It shows that the mutations generated by technological advances created new ways of seeing reflected in this new art. In a very insightful way announcing more recent studies, Moore's texts focus on the shock produced by Impressionism and analyze its effects on the observer's body. These writings try to transform the impression of disorientation felt in front of the pictures into an essential component of aesthetic experience. This feeling is also central to Impressionist literature and this article aims to study to what extent Moore's ideas on the epistemological uncertainties characteristic of what he called 'modern painting' influenced the field of literature at the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th.","[Gaspari, Fabienne] Univ Pau, 19th Century British Literature, Pau, France",Universite de Pau et des Pays de l'Adour,"Gaspari, F (corresponding author), Univ Pau, 19th Century British Literature, Pau, France.",,,,,,,,22,0,0,0,1,"UNIV P MONTPELLIERI III-PAUL VALERY, SERVICES PUBLICATIONS",MONTPELLIER-CEDEX 1,"ROUTE MENDE, BP 5043, 34032 MONTPELLIER-CEDEX 1, FRANCE",0220-5610,,,CAH VICTOR EDOUARD,Cah.

There has been a marked expansion of such activities and while the numerous and diverse funding streams, activities and organizations involved means that climate service development is relatively well resourced in places, there is a risk that the landscape becomes fragmented, duplicative, confusing, and inefficient. To mitigate this, the European Commission established the Climateurope project to bring coordination to Europe's climate-related knowledge base. Climateurope created a managed network to share knowledge, improve synergies and reduce fragmentation among the stakeholders. As the network evolved, we proactively strove for equality, diversity and inclusion, for example for gender, under-represented regions, and under-represented stakeholder groups. Climateurope explored and adopted innova-tive approaches to engaging the network members, including face-to-face networking events (Festivals), virtual networking events (Webstivals and webinars), use of arts, social media, expert groups, publications, and an active website. The mix and integration of the traditional communications, such as website, publications and expert groups, with more innovative and varied approaches, such as the Festivals, Webstivals, social media and arts, proved popular and successful in making the network active and attractive. We describe how the network and collaboration was established and managed, and we offer some recommendations for others based on our experiences, including consideration of equality, diversity and inclusion, consider strategies for growing, man-aging and sustaining the network, and consider a mix of virtual and physical networking events.","[Hewitt, Chris; Dunbar, Tyrone; Garrett, Natalie; New, Stacey; Newton, Paula; Parfitt, Rebecca] Met Off, Exeter, Devon, England; [Hewitt, Chris] Univ Southern Queensland, Ctr Appl Climate Sci, Toowoomba, Qld, Australia; [Bessembinder, Janette] Royal Dutch Meteorol Inst KNMI, De Bilt, Netherlands; [Buonocore, Mauro] Euro Mediterranean Ctr Climate Change, CMCC Fdn, Via Augusto Imperatore 16, I-73100 Lecce, Italy; [Kotova, Lola; Jacob, Daniela] Helmholtz Zentrum Geesthacht, Climate Serv Ctr Germany, Geesthacht, Germany; [Buontempo, Carlo; Guglielmo, Francesca] European Ctr Medium Range Weather Forecasts, Reading, Berks, England; [Doblas-Reyes, Francisco; Terrado, Marta] Ctr Nacl Supercomp BSC CNS, Barcelona Supercomp Ctr, Barcelona, Spain; [Doblas-Reyes, Francisco] Inst Catalana Recerca & Estudis Avancats ICREA, Barcelona, Spain; [Kjellstrom, Erik; Martins, Helena] Swedish Meteorol & Hydrol Inst SMHI, Norrkoping, Sweden; [Krzic, Aleksandra] Republ Hydrometeorol Serv Serbia, Belgrade, Serbia; [Pietrosanti, Alessia] European Climate Infrastruct & Environm Execut Ag, European Commiss, Brussels, Belgium",Met Office - UK; University of Southern Queensland; Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute; Centro Euro-Mediterraneo sui Cambiamenti Climatici (CMCC); Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Zentrum Geesthacht - Zentrum fur Material- und Kustenforschung; European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF); ICREA; Swedish Meteorological & Hydrological Institute,"Hewitt, C (corresponding author), Met Off, Exeter, Devon, England.",chris.hewitt@metoffice.gov.uk,"Buontempo, Carlo/GLQ-7538-2022","Buontempo, Carlo/0000-0002-1874-5380; Buonocore, Mauro/0000-0002-9051-9150; Krzic, Aleksandra/0000-0002-5871-4300; Dunbar, Tyrone/0000-0001-6221-5611; New, Stacey/0000-0001-7992-2179; Hewitt, Chris/0000-0002-4718-4009",European Union: Climateurope-Linking science and society [689029],European Union: Climateurope-Linking science and society,"This work was funded by the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme of the European Union: Climateurope-Linking science and society, Project ref. 689029.

In Europe and North America, research on the impacts of climate change on heritage, including how to mitigate against more frequent extreme weather events and how to implement efficient sustainable adaptation planning, are now key foci of heritage literature. In contrast, virtually nothing has been written about the impacts of climate change on heritage on the African continent, even though these will be significant in the coming decades. Heritage is essential for livelihoods, but also for the construction and reinforcement of identity and the psychological wellbeing of society. Here, we consider the impacts of climate change on different (connected) forms of heritage in Africa, including archaeological, historical and living heritage. We situate the implications of climate change for African heritage in recent debates around climate justice, sustainability and social wellbeing. We conclude that without significant intervention some of Africa's most important heritage will be lost as a result of the direct and indirect impacts of climate change over the coming decades. Our intention is to draw attention to the need for research into the impacts of climate change on different forms of heritage in Africa and to highlight the possible deleterious effects these losses will have on society more generally. We view this paper as a first step in developing a research agenda that will have a practical application for the management of heritage in the face of climate change in Africa.","[Brooks, Nick] Garama 3C Ltd, Sackville Pl, Norwich NR3 1JU, Norfolk, England; [Brooks, Nick] Univ East Anglia, Sch Environm Sci, Climate Res Unit, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Clarke, Joanne] Univ East Anglia, Dept Art Hist & World Art Studies, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Ngaruiya, Grace Wambui] Kenyatta Univ, Dept Plant Sci, POB 43844, Nairobi 00100, Kenya; [Wangui, Elizabeth Edna] Ohio Univ, Dept Geog, Athens, OH 45701 USA; [Wangui, Elizabeth Edna] Ohio Univ, Ctr Int Studies, Athens, OH 45701 USA",University of East Anglia; University of East Anglia; Kenyatta University; University System of Ohio; Ohio University; University System of Ohio; Ohio University,"Clarke, J (corresponding author), Univ East Anglia, Dept Art Hist & World Art Studies, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",joanne.clarke@uea.ac.uk,,"Brooks, Nick/0000-0002-5073-9386; Clarke, Joanne/0000-0002-7954-6561; Ngaruiya, Grace/0000-0002-2305-7662",,,,,201,17,17,3,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0067-270X,1945-5534,,AZANIA,Azania,2-Jul,2020,3,,,,297,328,,10.1080/0067270X.2020.1792177,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0067270X.2020.1792177,,20-Jul,32,Archaeology,Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;HCI),Archaeology,NA5KF,,Green Accepted,,,12/21/22,WOS:000551323000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this modelling study, we quantified mean and inter-annual variability of grain yield for maize Zea mays L., winter wheat Triticum spp. L. and winter canola Brassica napus L. for climatic conditions corresponding to current and doubled atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Climate scenarios with and without taking into account changes in the inter-annual variability of climate were developed from the output of a regional climate model for the time window 2071 to 2100. Climate change effects on the mean yield of maize and canola were consistently negative, but a positive impact was simulated for mean yield of winter wheat for elevated CO2 concentration. The coefficient of yield variation increased in the scenarios for maize and canola, but decreased for wheat. Higher thermal time requirements increased mean yield and reduced yield variability for all crops. Shifts in the sowing dates had a beneficial impact on the yield of maize, but not on the yield of canola and wheat. It is concluded that in the Alpine region, the potential effect of climate change is crop-specific. However, the introduction of new cultivars may provide means by which to maintain or even increase current productivity levels for most of the crops.","Agroscope Reckenholz Taenikon, Air Pollut Climate Grp, Res Stn ART, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland; Univ Geneva, CH-1227 Carouge, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Research Station Agroscope; University of Geneva,"Calanca, P (corresponding author), Agroscope Reckenholz Taenikon, Air Pollut Climate Grp, Res Stn ART, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland.",pierluigi.calanca@art.admin.ch,,"BENISTON, Martin/0000-0002-3782-5458",,,,,41,77,77,2,36,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0936-577X,1616-1572,,CLIM RES,Clim.

As inferred from landslides dated to the Late Glacial and Holocene, glacial-interglacial transitions are the major intervals of enhanced landsliding, but the length of this interval varies between distinct types of landscapes. Mass movements in non-glaciated temperate mountain ranges, arid and tropical regions, and coastal areas intensified soon after the onset of the Holocene alongside the warming and wetting of the climate, whereas large rock slides in areas within the limits of Pleistocene glaciations mostly show a millennial-scale time lag with respect to glacier withdrawal. Although the incidence of landslides was ubiquitous throughout the Holocene, the mid- to late-Holocene transition (similar to 5-4 ka) was especially favourable for the origin of landslides across distinct types of landscapes, indicating a strengthened role of mass movements during the culmination phases of interglacial climate optima. In addition, growing evidence suggests that the enhanced activity of landslides occurred during warmer interstadial conditions, which is best demonstrated in the temporal coincidence of arid-zone landslides with Quaternary pluvials. Future progress in the understanding of the relationships between landslides and Quaternary climate changes should benefit from the i) extension of datasets of dated landslides, ii) geographical expansion of dating studies to regions with a lack of chronologically determined landslides (e.g., tropics), iii) improvement of landslide-dating strategies involving the incorporation of independent palaeoclimatic prcodes and iv) wider incorporation of numerical modeling within landslide-dating studies.","[Panek, Tomas] Univ Ostrava, Fac Sci, Dept Phys Geog & Geoecol, Chittussiho 10, Ostrava 71000, Czech Republic",University of Ostrava,"Panek, T (corresponding author), Univ Ostrava, Fac Sci, Dept Phys Geog & Geoecol, Chittussiho 10, Ostrava 71000, Czech Republic.",tomas.panek@osu.cz,"Pánek, Tomáš/AAL-2897-2020","Panek, Tomas/0000-0003-2857-3727",Czech Science Foundation [17-17712S],Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),"This study was conducted within the framework of the Czech Science Foundation, project 17-17712S.

Entitled 'Post-Nature: A Museum as an Ecosystem', the biennial confronted the timely theme of environmental precarity and positioned itself as a substantive stakeholder in the public debate on climate change. It mobilized the biennial platform to marshal artists, community groups, conservationists and others to spur on new thinking and, perhaps more importantly, to create solutions. By adopting this new role as an environmental problem solver, the biennial expanded itself from the ensconced space of aesthetic inquiry and sought to generate new forms of institutional relations and to nurture in its audience an ecological consciousness. These exhibition strategies underscore many international biennials' self-assigned mandates to claim a socially relevant role and to adopt an interventionist posture. But while the biennial showcased multifaceted ecological visions of the present, it also delimited its range of critique and the possible modes of collective action. In this way, the exhibition becomes a valuable searchlight into the social and political relevance of global biennials, as well as their contention for legitimacy and significance as agents of social transformation.","[Chao, Jenifer] De Montfort Univ, Fac Comp Engn & Media, Leicester Media Sch, Clephan Bldg, Leicester LE1 9BH, Leics, England; [Kompatsiaris, Panos] Natl Res Univ Higher Sch Econ, 8-2 Maly Nyokhsvyatitelsky Pereulok,Bldg 1, Moscow 101000, Russia",De Montfort University; HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics),"Chao, J (corresponding author), De Montfort Univ, Fac Comp Engn & Media, Leicester Media Sch, Clephan Bldg, Leicester LE1 9BH, Leics, England.",jenifer.chao2@dmu.ac.uk; panoskompa@gmail.com,,"Kompatsiaris, Panagiotis/0000-0002-2452-6109",,,,,38,2,2,2,8,INTELLECT LTD,BRISTOL,"THE MILL, PARNALL RD, BRISTOL, BS16 3JG, ENGLAND",2051-7041,2051-705X,,J CONTEMP CHIN ART,J.

The first part analyzes methods to elicit how farmers perceive and predict climate events and how these perspectives relate to scientific forecasts. It addresses the long-standing question of whether and how farmers understand the probabilistic nature of climate forecasts and how they assess the credibility and accuracy of such information. The second part examines approaches to characterizing the vulnerability of decision makers and to elucidating the configuration of options and obstacles that farmers face in using climate forecasts to mitigate risk. The complexities of farmers' decisions and the difficulties of identifying the exact role that climate predictions play (and, therefore, of directly attributing impacts to them) are taken into account. Finally, the review highlights efforts to transcend the localized focus of farmer-centered approaches in order to capture interactions across sectors and scales. The review concludes by proposing that climate application research move from a 'technology-adoption' paradigm to a broader perspective on vulnerability and adaptation. This shift will entail a cross-scale, multi-sited research design and an interdisciplinary mix of interactive and structured tools and techniques. It will also require that the analytical focus be expanded to encompass local communities and their multiple action spaces as well as the higher spheres of decision-making, where policy and science are shaped.","Univ Georgia, Ctr Res Environm Decis, Athens, GA 30605 USA; Univ Georgia, SE Climate Consortium, Athens, GA 30605 USA",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; University System of Georgia; University of Georgia,"Roncoli, C (corresponding author), Univ Georgia, Ctr Res Environm Decis, Athens, GA 30605 USA.",croncoli@uga.edu,,,,,,,154,150,152,2,28,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0936-577X,1616-1572,,CLIM RES,Clim.

Oceanians have indeed borne the brunt of the age of climate change; however, not all have submitted to the colonial trope of passive victims on the frontline of global forces beyond their control. While political, legal, and cultural forms of resistance have been well documented in the scholarship of Oceania, there remains a largely unexplored field of academic inquiry concerning the role of Oceanian activist artstory. This article seeks to redress this shortfall by examining the central importance of Tongan artist Latai Taumoepeau's body-centered performance art within the settler-colonial context of Australia. Given the historical failings of successive Australian governments to address climate change, since 2013 Taumoepeau has consistently used embodiment-driven art performance to confront the apathy of Australia's leadership and settler public and to highlight the importance of Indigenous Pacific environmental stewardship and leadership in addressing these issues. Weaving talanoa-based interviews with critical analysis, I examine several of her artistic works, including i-Land X-isle (2012); Repatriate (2015); Ocean Island, Mine!

They are important reference materials for those who work in social sciences fields such as history, art history, sociology, political sciences and communication as they reflect the political, socioeconomic and cultural climate of the era. The grant holder of the Art and Literature (Sanat ve Edebiyat) gazette which follows the important matters, developments, and disputes of the era with its expert and polyphonic writer staff, was Suut Kemal Yetkin and the chief editor was Selahattin Batu until the 15th issue and Lutfi Ay afterwards. The gazette published 50 issues between January 4th and December 16th, 1947. The gazette was published once a week until the 22th issue and then it met with its readers once in two weeks due to some negativities. The articles in the gazette about different genres of literature and art such as theater, cinema, novels, poems, paintings, architecture, and music were written by prominent figures of the period such as painter, poet, writer, critic, archaeologist, politician and journalist like Suut Kemal Yetkin, Lutfi Ay, Selahattin Batu, Malik Aksel, Melahat Ozgu, Arif Kaptan, Sevket Rado, Memduh Cevdet Altar, M.

The gazette followed the developments in the art world in mainly Ankara as it was published in Ankara, and Istanbul, Turkey and it also presented news and new developments of art in other countries in addition to Turkish literature and art as well as the prestigious names of the art and literature world. The writers of the gazette shared the consensus that art, which was in the service of ideologies during the World War II and was directed especially by the totalitarian regimes, should avoid all types of propagandas and deal with its own problems and the art and artists should be free. The gazette becomes prominent among the limited number of art publications with its articles mentioning the definitions of art and artist and the roles it should assume rather than the structural problems of art. The content of art writings consisted of debates that determine the art agenda such as old-new art, representation of art, art criticism and critic, and the developments of the art environment such as the promotion of national and international exhibition news, artist meetings and dinners. However, the Art and Literature (Sanat ve Edebiyat) gazette, which could only be published for a year, assumed a role in feeling the pulse of art with its art writings/news including discussions that determined the agenda in the art environment despite its short publication period, and it undertook to raise an intellectual audience informed about the cultural and artistic developments in Turkey and in the world. All the issues of the newspaper Art and Literature (Sanat ve Edebiyat) addressed in this study were found from the National Library; especially the articles about painting in the newspaper advertised were addressed. Primarily the newspaper Art and Literature was introduced under the headings The Masthead and About the Content and then, the articles of the newspaper especially associated with painting were evaluated briefly with the title The Examination of the Art Articles in the Newspaper. These articles including topics and discussions often encountered in art and exhibition activities and having topics relevant to each other with similar content were categorized and examined under 6 titles as Free Art That Rejects Ideologies, On Criticism, The Wet-Nurse of Art: Paris, The Old-New Art Discussions, Exhibition News, Artist Meetings and Dining. The articles in question, where a detailed analysis was made, were supported in the light of the findings obtained from other periodical publications and second hand resources. Thus, the panorama of the Ankara of the era and the culture and art life of Turkey was presented.","[Koc, Esra Ozkan] Karadeniz Tech Univ, Edebiyat Fak, Sanat Tarihi Bolumu, Trabzon, Turkey",Karadeniz Technical University,"Koc, EO (corresponding author), Karadeniz Tech Univ, Edebiyat Fak, Sanat Tarihi Bolumu, Trabzon, Turkey.",esraozkan@ktu.edu.tr,"Koç, Esra Özkan/AAM-6211-2021",,,,,,93,0,0,0,7,E.U.

The artists' observation concerns not only the natural effects of climate change but also their impact on the social and cultural heritage of the inhabitants of regions of the most endangered areas. Areas most vulnerable to destruction: oceans, coral reefs and polar regions are becoming a particular subject of interest for artists. A reflection of this interest can be the increasing number of exhibitions devoted to the current state of the environment (i.e. the project Plasticity of the Planet presented in 2019 in Ujazdowski Castle Centre for Contemporary Art in Warsaw). In the article selected artistic strategies to publicize the problems of ecology will be indicated. The first strategy is the exhibition of the beauty of the natural environment and the melancholy associated with its disappearance. An example of this can be Art of the Arctic by environmental photographer Kerry Koeping who focuses the audience's attention on ocean literacy by means of affecting landscapes of the Arctic or the artistic residence in PAN Hornsund Polar Station of Janusz Oleksa. The second way is to indicate the physical and biological effects of climate change. An example would be the work of Kelly Jazvac who, in collaboration with an oceanographer Charles Moore and a geologist Patricia Corcoran, presents plastiglomerate by Agnieszka Kurant - new forms of fossils, resulting from the combination of shells and stones with plastics or artificial compounds. The third method is the presentation of the residents' experience. The examples are works of Subhankar Banerjee, who draws inspiration from ethnographic research and documentary films and Jakub Witek's documentary about Polish emigrants living in Ice-land. The artist presents the consequences of climate change for the inhabitants of the polar regions. The fourth way is to build a metaphor for the presence of a 'stranger' - a traveller, an explorer or a scientist. An example is a photographic performance entitled Polaris Summer by Kuba Bakowski conducted during a scientific expedition to Spitsbergen, or three-screen projection by John Akomfrah's showing the relationship between man and oceans in the context of exploitation of natural and human resources.

An important source of uncertainty is that climate models exhibit biases, which limits their ability to predict climate. One of the largest biases is the too warm sea surface temperature (SST) in the eastern tropical Atlantic (TA), reflecting deficient atmospheric and oceanic circulation. Here, we show that CO2-forced TA-sector climate changes simulated by state-of-the-art climate models exhibit a strong mean-state dependence. In particular, models simulating largest SST warming in the eastern TA, consistent with the warming observed since the mid-20th century, typically exhibit a more realistic mean state than models simulating largest warming in the western TA. The former models exhibit a larger climate sensitivity, and predict stronger and in part qualitatively different climate changes over the TA sector, for example in precipitation. These findings may help to reducing uncertainty in TA-climate change projections.","[Imbol Nkwinkwa, A. S.

Design/methodology/approach - A number of relevant case studies are used to establish the rationale. Findings - Objective or neutral data visualisation does not exist. Every visualisation process relies on human definitions or mediation. Based on this premise, interdisciplinary collaborators can use methods from design and art to actively design the usability of data visualisation together with their perceived aesthetic, ambiguous and imaginative dimensions in order to create a multi-layered human experience of data. Research limitations/implications - Physiological engagement in combination with rich, ambiguous experiences are no substitute for scientific data visualisation but an evocative medium for the public communication of science, such as at science centres or science museums. Practical implications - Clear support of interdisciplinary collaborations and systematic application of methods to create aesthetic experiences from scientific data. Social implications - Potentially novel, engaging and evocative sensual experiences with data visualisations around themes, such as climate change, sustainability and ecology. Originality/value - The paper suggests that systematically complementing methods from art and design in order to emotionalise intellectual experiences could be considered an unorthodox yet highly effective novel approach.","Univ Huddersfield, Sch Art Design & Architecture, Huddersfield HD1 3DH, W Yorkshire, England",University of Huddersfield,"Hohl, M (corresponding author), Univ Huddersfield, Sch Art Design & Architecture, Huddersfield HD1 3DH, W Yorkshire, England.",michaelhohl@gmail.com,,,,,,,15,4,4,1,21,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0368-492X,,,KYBERNETES,Kybernetes,,2011,8-Jul,,,,1038,1044,,10.1108/03684921111160278,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/03684921111160278,,,7,"Computer Science, Cybernetics",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,837OW,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000296214100010,View Full Record in Web of Science

The amount of emitted carbon dioxide remaining in the atmosphere is controlled by carbon cycle processes in the ocean and on land. These processes are themselves affected by climate. The resulting 'climate-carbon cycle feedback' has recently been quantified, but the policy implications have not. Using a scheme to emulate the range of state-of-the-art model results for climate feedback strength, including the modelled range of climate sensitivity and other key uncertainties, we analyse recent global targets. The G8 target of a 50% cut in emissions by 2050 leaves CO2 concentrations rising rapidly, approaching 1000 ppm by 2300. The Stern Review's proposed 25% cut in emissions by 2050, continuing to an 80% cut, does in fact approach stabilization of CO2 concentration on a policy-relevant (century) timescale, with most models projecting concentrations between 500 and 600 ppm by 2100. However concentrations continue to rise gradually. Long-term stabilization at 550 ppm CO2 requires cuts in emissions of 81 to 90% by 2300, and more beyond as a portion of the CO2 emitted persists for centuries to millennia. Reductions of other greenhouse gases cannot compensate for the long-term effects of emitting CO2.","[House, Joanna I.; Knorr, Wolfgang; Cornell, Sarah E.; Prentice, I.

The task of organizing data around specific topics or themes is a vibrant and growing effort in the biological sciences but to date this effort has not been actively pursued in the Earth sciences. In this paper, we introduce the concept of geocuration and define it as the act of searching, selecting, and synthesizing Earth science data/metadata and information from across disciplines and repositories into a single, cohesive, and useful collection. We present the Climate Data Initiative (CDI) project as a prototypical example. The CDI project is a systematic effort to manually curate and share openly available climate data from various federal agencies. CDI is a broad multi-agency effort of the U.S. government and seeks to leverage the extensive existing federal climate-relevant data to stimulate innovation and private-sector entrepreneurship to support national climate-change preparedness.

In this regard, deviations of the model-simulated climate change from observations, such as a recent pause in global warming, have received considerable attention. Such decadal mismatches between model-simulated and observed climate trends are common throughout the twentieth century, and their causes are still poorly understood. Here we show that the discrepancies between the observed and simulated climate variability on decadal and longer timescale have a coherent structure suggestive of a pronounced Global Multidecadal Oscillation. Surface temperature anomalies associated with this variability originate in the North Atlantic and spread out to the Pacific and Southern oceans and Antarctica, with Arctic following suit in about 25-35 years. While climate models exhibit various levels of decadal climate variability and some regional similarities to observations, none of the model simulations considered match the observed signal in terms of its magnitude, spatial patterns and their sequential time development. These results highlight a substantial degree of uncertainty in our interpretation of the observed climate change using current generation of climate models.","[Kravtsov, S.; Grimm, C.; Gu, S.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Math Sci, Atmospher Sci Grp, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA; [Kravtsov, S.] Russian Acad Sci, PP Shirshov Inst Oceanol, Moscow, Russia; [Gu, S.] Cty Coll Morris, Dept Math, Randolph, NJ USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Milwaukee; Russian Academy of Sciences; Shirshov Institute of Oceanology,"Kravtsov, S (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Math Sci, Atmospher Sci Grp, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA.;Kravtsov, S (corresponding author), Russian Acad Sci, PP Shirshov Inst Oceanol, Moscow, Russia.",kravtsov@uwm.edu,"Kravtsov, Sergey/ABA-2061-2020","Kravtsov, Sergey/0000-0003-3653-9596","U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science Innovative and Novel Computational Impact on Theory and Experiment (DOE INCITE) programme; Office of Biological and Environmental Research (BER); National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Climate Program Office; U.S. National Science Foundation [AGS-1408897]; Russian Ministry of Education and Science [14.W03.31.0006]; Russian Science Foundation [18-12-00231]","U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science Innovative and Novel Computational Impact on Theory and Experiment (DOE INCITE) programme(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Office of Biological and Environmental Research (BER); National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Climate Program Office(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); U.S. National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Russian Ministry of Education and Science(Ministry of Education and Science, Russian Federation); Russian Science Foundation(Russian Science Foundation (RSF))","We acknowledge the World Climate Research Programme's Working Group on Coupled Modelling, which is responsible for CMIP and thank the climate modelling groups for making their model output available.

We identify the main regions of formation of swell waves at present and during the late twenty-first century under the RCP8.5 emissions/climate change scenario. We have applied an algorithm that allows one to unequivocally differentiate the swell component from the local wind-waves for a global wave hindcast and for eight CMIP5 state-of-the-art wave model climate projections. We have identified four different regions of swell formation, two in each hemisphere, with the Southern Ocean being by far the main region of swell generation. By the end of this century, the number of swell events generated in the Northern Hemisphere is expected to decrease while the opposite is projected to occur in the Southern Hemisphere. The increase in the Southern Hemisphere is directly associated with a poleward movement and intensification of the wind belts projected by atmospheric climate models.","[Amores, Angel; Marcos, Marta] Inst Mediterraneo Estudios Avanzados UIB CSIC, Esporles, Spain; [Marcos, Marta] Univ Illes Balears, Dept Fis, Edifici Mateu Orfila, Palma De Mallorca, Spain",Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); Universitat de les Illes Balears,"Amores, A (corresponding author), Inst Mediterraneo Estudios Avanzados UIB CSIC, Esporles, Spain.",angel.amores@uib.es,"Amores, Angel/H-9535-2015","Amores, Angel/0000-0003-4139-1557","ERA4CS INSeaPTION project [690462, PCIN-2017-038]",ERA4CS INSeaPTION project,This study was supported by the ERA4CS INSeaPTION project (Grants 690462 and PCIN-2017-038).,,22,9,9,2,13,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0894-8755,1520-0442,,J CLIMATE,J.

Generally the changes we found are small. However, there are some important exceptions, such as a significant increase in all variables in the Barents Sea and a significant reduction in wind and waves north and west of Iceland. Also, there is a significant increase in wind speed in the northern North Sea and westwards in the Atlantic Ocean, and a comparable reduction southwest of the British Isles in the autumn. The same change is suggested for wave height, but this is not statistically significant. There is a significant increase in the seasonal 99 percentile of the sea level in autumn in the southwest part of the North Sea. These results are consistent with earlier studies predicting a rougher maritime climate in the northern North Sea in autumn.","Norwegian Meteorol Inst, Div Res & Dev, N-0313 Oslo, Norway",Norwegian Meteorological Institute,"Debernard, J (corresponding author), Norwegian Meteorol Inst, Div Res & Dev, POB 43, N-0313 Oslo, Norway.",jens.debernard@met.no,,,,,,,28,52,53,0,10,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0936-577X,1616-1572,,CLIM RES,Clim.

At the same time, the consecutive seasons of fieldwork conducted by the Petroglylph Unit (part of the international Dakhleh Oasis Project) have produced a great number of findings and substantially enhanced our knowledge of the petroglyphs of this area. Here, rather than focusing on interpretive aspects of the research, I wish to discuss the threats endangering the petroglyphs in the Oasis. Dakhleh has developed very intensively in the last 100 years. It is, however, the twenty-first century which seems to pose some serious threats to archaeological heritage. Hence, in this paper I wish to report on what has been done so far to document rock art in the Oasis, and try to establish the priorities for potential future work. The agricultural and infrastructural development in the area, and the uncertain political climate in the country, heavily influence the state of rock art preservation and the possibilities of research. The need for documentation and preservation of rock art is larger than ever before, because many changes in the local landscape cannot be stopped. The time is pressing, because more and more rock art is disappearing due to the reasons discussed in this paper. Threats to Egyptian rock art in general will form a background for considerations concerning petroglyphs from the Western Desert.","[Polkowski, Pawe Lech] Poznan Archaeol Museum, Rock Art Unit, Ul Wodna 27, PL-61781 Poznan, Poland",,"Polkowski, PL (corresponding author), Poznan Archaeol Museum, Rock Art Unit, Ul Wodna 27, PL-61781 Poznan, Poland.",ppolkowski@o2.pl,"Polkowski, Paweł/Q-8375-2019","Polkowski, Paweł/0000-0002-5364-6214","National Science Centre, Poland [2016/23/D/HS3/00805]","National Science Centre, Poland(National Science Centre, Poland)","This study was funded by the National Science Centre, Poland (2016/23/D/HS3/00805).

A thorough comparison with data both from satellite as well as aircraft measurement is presented to validate the simulations. In addition, the model is applied to clarify the microphysical processes occurring when introducing artificial aerosol particles into the upper troposphere with the aim of modifying cirrus clouds in the framework of climate engineering. Former modeling studies investigating the climate effect of this method were performed with simplifying assumptions and much coarser resolution, reaching partly contradicting conclusions concerning the method's effectiveness. The primary effect of seeding is found to be a reduction of ice crystal number concentrations in cirrus clouds, leading to increased outgoing longwave radiative fluxes at the top of the atmosphere, thereby creating a cooling effect. Furthermore, a secondary effect is found, as ice crystals formed from the injected seeding aerosol particles lead to enhanced riming of cloud droplets within the planetary boundary layer. This effectively reduces the coverage of mixed-phase clouds, thus generating additional cooling by increased upward longwave radiative fluxes at the surface. The efficacy of seeding cirrus clouds proves to be relatively independent from the atmospheric background conditions, scales with the number concentrations of seeding particles, and is highest for large aerosol particles.","[Gruber, Simon; Haenel, Florian; Kottmeier, Christoph; Leisner, Thomas; Vogel, Bernhard] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Karlsruhe, Germany; [Blahak, Ulrich] German Weather Serv, Offenbach, Germany; [Muskatel, Harel] Israel Meteorol Serv, Bet Dagan, Israel; [Storelvmo, Trude] Univ Oslo, Dept Geosci, Oslo, Norway",Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; Deutscher Wetterdienst; University of Oslo,"Gruber, S (corresponding author), Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Karlsruhe, Germany.",simon.gruber@kit.edu,"Kottmeier, Christoph/A-9553-2013; 1294, HALO SPP/AAA-7658-2021; Vogel, Bernhard/A-9558-2013; Leisner, Thomas K/A-2391-2013","Kottmeier, Christoph/0000-0002-2196-2052; Vogel, Bernhard/0000-0002-8894-0165; Leisner, Thomas K/0000-0001-9693-7671; Storelvmo, Trude/0000-0002-0068-2430","German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG Priority Program SPP 1294); DFG [WO 2160/1-1]","German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG Priority Program SPP 1294)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); DFG(German Research Foundation (DFG))","We acknowledge the use of CALIPSO data provided by the NASA Langley Research Center's Atmospheric Science Data Center (ASDC): Winker, D.

We test sea ice reversibility within a state-of-the-art atmosphere-ocean global climate model by increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide until the Arctic Ocean becomes ice-free throughout the year and subsequently decreasing it until the initial ice cover returns. Evidence for irreversibility in the form of hysteresis outside the envelope of natural variability is explored for the loss of summer and winter ice in both hemispheres. We find no evidence of irreversibility or multiple ice-cover states over the full range of simulated sea ice conditions between the modern climate and that with an annually ice-free Arctic Ocean. Summer sea ice area recovers as hemispheric temperature cools along a trajectory that is indistinguishable from the trajectory of summer sea ice loss, while the recovery of winter ice area appears to be slowed due to the long response times of the ocean near the modern winter ice edge. The results are discussed in the context of previous studies that assess the plausibility of sea ice tipping points by other methods. The findings serve as evidence against the existence of threshold behavior in the summer or winter ice cover in either hemisphere. Citation: Armour, K. C., I. Eisenman, E. Blanchard-Wrigglesworth, K.

The state of the art in projecting future renewable energy generation has focused on using regional climate prediction. However, regional climate prediction is characterized by inherent uncertainty due to the complexity of climate models. This work provides a comprehensive study to quantify the impact of climate uncertainties in projecting future renewable energy potential over five climate zones of Europe. Thirteen future climate scenarios, including five global climate models (GCMs) and three representative concentration pathways (RCPs), are downscaled by the RCA4 regional climate model (RCM) over 90 years (2010-2099), divided into three 30-year periods. Solar and wind energy production is projected considering short-/long-term climate variations and uncertainties in seven representative cities (Narvik, Gothenburg, Munich, Antwerp, Salzburg, Valencia, and Athens). The results showed that the uncertainty caused by GCMs has the most substantial impact on projecting renewable energy generation. The variations due to GCM selection can become even larger than long-term climate change variations over time. Climate change uncertainties lead to over 23% and 45% projection differences for solar PV and wind energy potential, respectively. While the signal of climate change in solar radiation is weak between scenarios and over time, wind energy generation is affected by 25%.","[Yang, Yuchen; Nik, Vahid M.] Lund Univ, Dept Bldg & Environm Technol, Div Bldg Phys, S-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Javanroodi, Kavan] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Solar Energy & Bldg Phys Lab LESO PB, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Nik, Vahid M.] Chalmers Univ Technol, Dept Architecture & Civil Engn, Div Bldg Technol, S-41296 Gothenburg, Sweden",Lund University; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne; Chalmers University of Technology,"Nik, VM (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Dept Bldg & Environm Technol, Div Bldg Phys, S-22100 Lund, Sweden.;Nik, VM (corresponding author), Chalmers Univ Technol, Dept Architecture & Civil Engn, Div Bldg Technol, S-41296 Gothenburg, Sweden.",yuchen.yang@byggtek.lth.se; kavan.javanroodi@epfl.ch; vahid.nik@byggtek.lth.se,"Yang, Yuchen/GZK-6062-2022; Nik, Vahid M./K-2632-2016","Nik, Vahid M./0000-0002-1497-4813; Javanroodi, Kavan/0000-0002-4989-9681","joint programming initiative 'ERA-Net Smart Energy Systems' focus initiative on Integrated, Regional Energy Systems; European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [775970, 101033683]","joint programming initiative 'ERA-Net Smart Energy Systems' focus initiative on Integrated, Regional Energy Systems; European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme","This work was partly funded by the joint programming initiative `ERA-Net Smart Energy Systems' focus initiative on Integrated, Regional Energy Systems, with support from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [775970] and the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement for the COLLECTiEF (Collective Intelligence for Energy Flexibility) project [101033683].",,47,4,4,8,22,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1996-1073,,ENERGIES,Energies,JAN,2022,1,,,,,,302,10.3390/en15010302,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en15010302,,,19,Energy & Fuels,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Energy & Fuels,YJ0WI,,"Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000744259300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Changes in equatorial stratospheric variability in historical and Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) scenario simulations are investigated in 10 models with realistic quasi-biennial oscillations (QBO). All project a weakening of the QBO throughout the stratosphere for SSP370 and SSP585 scenarios and for 1960 to 2010. The weakening is strongest in the lower stratosphere, ranging from 5.8 +/- 0.5% to 4.3 +/- 0.5% to 2.0 +/- 0.5% per decade at 50 hPa for SSP585, SSP370, and historical simulations, respectively. At 20 hPa a weakening of both westward and eastward phases contributes though the weakening eastward phase is only seen in 7 of the 10 models. Similar robust weakening occurs for the temperature QBO, but only from 30 hPa upward. In both scenarios the QBO period decreases in 7 of the 10 models. Plain Language Summary At altitudes between roughly 16 and 50 km the equatorial atmosphere is dominated by strong zonal winds that reverse sign from eastward to westward roughly every 14 months in what is referred to as the quasi-biennial oscillation. With developments in models the quasi-biennial oscillation now features in a significant number of the latest state-of-the-art climate projections. In those projections featuring the oscillation, the changing climate weakens it by up to similar to 6% per decade for the more extreme of the scenarios considered. Somewhat less certain is a shortening of the time between wind reversals in several of the projections.","[Butchart, Neal] Met Off Hadley Ctr, Exeter, Devon, England; [Anstey, James A.] Canadian Ctr Climate Modelling & Anal, Victoria, BC, Canada; [Kawatani, Yoshio] Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan; [Osprey, Scott M.] Univ Oxford, Natl Ctr Atmospher Sci, Oxford, England; [Osprey, Scott M.] Univ Oxford, Dept Phys, Oxford, England; [Richter, Jadwiga H.] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Climate & Global Atmosphere Div, Boudler, CO USA; [Wu, Tongwen] China Meteorol Adm, Beijing Climate Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China",Met Office - UK; Hadley Centre; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling & Analysis (CCCma); Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science & Technology (JAMSTEC); UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); NERC National Centre for Atmospheric Science; University of Oxford; University of Oxford; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; China Meteorological Administration,"Butchart, N (corresponding author), Met Off Hadley Ctr, Exeter, Devon, England.",neal.butchart@metoffice.gov.uk,"Osprey, Scott/S-7908-2019; Osprey, Scott/GQI-3483-2022; Kawatani, Yoshio/B-1777-2013","Osprey, Scott/0000-0002-8751-1211; Osprey, Scott/0000-0002-8751-1211; Anstey, James/0000-0001-6366-8647; Kawatani, Yoshio/0000-0003-3260-8830; Wu, Tongwen/0000-0001-5187-9121","Met Office Hadley Centre Programme - BEIS; Defra; UK China Research and Innovation Partnership Fund through the Met Office Climate Science for Service Partnership (CSSP) China, Newton Fund; JSPS KAKENHI [JP15KK0178, JP17K18816, JP18H01286]; Environment Research and Technology Development Fund of the Environmental Restoration and Conservation Agency of Japan [2-1904]; Regional and Global Model Analysis (RGMA) component of the Earth and Environmental System Modeling Program of the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Biological and Environmental Research (BER) via the National Science Foundation [IA1844590]; UK National Centre for Atmospheric Science; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/N018001/1, NE/P006779/1]; NERC [NE/P006779/1, NE/M005828/1] Funding Source: UKRI","Met Office Hadley Centre Programme - BEIS; Defra(Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA)); UK China Research and Innovation Partnership Fund through the Met Office Climate Science for Service Partnership (CSSP) China, Newton Fund; JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Environment Research and Technology Development Fund of the Environmental Restoration and Conservation Agency of Japan; Regional and Global Model Analysis (RGMA) component of the Earth and Environmental System Modeling Program of the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Biological and Environmental Research (BER) via the National Science Foundation; UK National Centre for Atmospheric Science; Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC))","This research was supported by the Met Office Hadley Centre Programme funded by BEIS and Defra.

But the relation between aesthetics and politics is oblique: Art cannot change the world, but it can contribute to changing the consciousness. of the men and women who could change the world. (p. 33). Marcuse also linked his critique of capitalism to environmentalism in the early 1970s: the violation of the Earth is a vital aspect of the counterrevolution. (Ecology and Revolution, in The New Left and the 1960s, Collected Papers 3, 2005, p. 173). This article revisits Marcuse's ideas on aesthetics and ecology, and reviews two recent art projects which engage their audiences in ecological issues: The Jetty Project (2014) by Wolfgang Weileder-which used recycled material and community participation to construct a temporary monument within a wider conservation project on the Tyne, N-E England-and Fracking Futures by HeHe (Helen Evans and Heiko Hansen)-which turned the interior of the gallery at FACT, Liverpool, into what appeared to be a fracking site. The aim is not to evaluate the projects, nor to test the efficacy of Marcuse's ideas, more to ask again whether art has a role in a shift of attitude which might contribute to dealing with the political and economic causes of climate change.

There is no consensus of the underlying dynamical mechanism of these abrupt climate changes and they are elusive in most simulations of state-of-the-art coupled climate models. There has been significant debate over whether the climate system is exhibiting self-sustained oscillations with vastly varying periods across these events, or rather noise-induced jumps in between two quasi-stable regimes. In previous studies, statistical model comparison has been employed to the NGRIP ice core record from Greenland in order to compare different classes of stochastic dynamical systems, representing different dynamical paradigms. Such model comparison studies typically rely on accurately reproducing the observed records. We aim to avoid this due to the large amount of stochasticity and uncertainty both on long and short time scales in the record. Instead, we focus on the most important qualitative features of the data, as captured by summary statistics. These are computed from the distributions of waiting times in between events and residence times in warm and cold regimes, as well as the stationary density and the autocorrelation function. We perform Bayesian inference and model comparison experiments based solely on these summary statistics via Approximate Bayesian Computation. This yields an alternative approach to existing studies that helps to reconcile and synthesize insights from Bayesian model comparison and qualitative statistical analysis.","[Lohmann, Johannes; Ditlevsen, Peter D.] Univ Copenhagen, Niels Bohr Inst, Ctr Ice & Climate, Copenhagen, Denmark",University of Copenhagen; Niels Bohr Institute,"Lohmann, J (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen, Niels Bohr Inst, Ctr Ice & Climate, Copenhagen, Denmark.",johannes.lohmann@nbi.ku.dk,,,European Unions Horizon 2020 research and innovation Programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Grant [643073],European Unions Horizon 2020 research and innovation Programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Grant,This project has received funding from the European Unions Horizon 2020 research and innovation Programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Grant agreement No 643073.,,24,6,6,1,3,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0930-7575,1432-0894,,CLIM DYNAM,Clim.

Research into the epidemiology, risk factors and preventive strategies for unintentional drowning in high-income and in low-income and middle-income countries has expanded understanding, but understanding of disaster and extreme weather-related drowning needs research focus. As nation states and researchers call for action on climate change, its impact on drowning has been largely ignored. This state-of-the-art review considers existing literature on climate change as a contributor to changes in drowning risks globally. Using selected climate change-related risks identified by the World Meteorological Organization and key risks to the Sustainable Development Goals as a framework, we consider the drowning risks associated with heat waves, hydrometeorological hazards, drought and water scarcity, damaged infrastructure, marine ecosystem collapse, displacement, and rising poverty and inequality. Although the degree of atmospheric warming remains uncertain, the impact of climate change on drowning risk is already taking place and can no longer be ignored. Greater evidence characterising the links between drowning and climate change across both high-income and low-income and middle-income contexts is required, and the implementation and evaluation of drowning interventions must reflect climate change risks at a local level, accounting for both geographical variation and the consequences of inequality. Furthermore, collaboration between the injury prevention, disaster risk reduction and climate change mitigation sectors is crucial to both prevent climate change from stalling progress on preventing drowning and further advocate for climate change mitigation as a drowning risk reduction mechanism.","[Sindall, Rebecca; Mecrow, Thomas] Royal Natl Lifeboat Inst, Int Dept, Poole, Dorset, England; [Sindall, Rebecca; Mecrow, Thomas; Queiroga, Ana Catarina; Koon, William; Peden, Amy E.] Int Drowning Prevent Researchers Alliance IDRA, Kuna, ID USA; [Queiroga, Ana Catarina] Univ Porto, ITR Lab Integrat & Translat Res Populat Hlth, Inst Publ Hlth, Porto, Portugal; [Queiroga, Ana Catarina; Peden, Amy E.] Int Lifesaving Federat, Drowning Prevent Commiss, Leuven, Belgium; [Boyer, Christopher] Univ Washington, Ctr Hlth & Global Environm, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Koon, William] Univ New South Wales Fac Sci, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Peden, Amy E.] Univ New South Wales, Sch Populat Hlth, Fac Med, Sydney, NSW, Australia",Universidade do Porto; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of New South Wales Sydney,"Sindall, R (corresponding author), Royal Natl Lifeboat Inst, Poole, Dorset, England.",becky_sindall@rnli.org.uk,,"Koon, William/0000-0003-4708-4347; Mecrow, Tom/0000-0001-7392-0172; Boyer, Christopher/0000-0002-2247-7446; Peden, Amy/0000-0002-6424-1511",Royal National Lifeboat Institution,Royal National Lifeboat Institution,"The authors have not declared a specific grant for this research from any funding agency in the public, commercial or not-for-profit sectors.

Specifically, I will present narrative and visual data of how Black college men perceive the campus racial climate and make sense of their (in)visibility at the university. Drawing upon poststructuralist theories of gender and critical race theory, I analyze the ways in which they managed race, gender and sexuality within university spaces, giving attention to their agency in performing a range of masculinities in response to and in anticipation of campus-based racism and racialized discourses. By situating their gendered performances within the context of the campus racial climate, I argue that universities are sites of racial and gender socialization where dominant ideologies of Black masculinities are imposed, and where ontological installments of gender play out in ways that can impact Black males' inclusion on campus.

Moving towards more sustainable energy solutions in the urban context by integrating renewable energy technologies supports decarbonizing the energy sector and climate change mitigation. A successful transition also needs adequate consideration of climate change including extreme events to ensure the reliable performance of energy systems in the long run. This review provides an overview of and insight into the progress achieved in the energy sector to adapt to climate change, focusing on the climate resilience of urban energy systems. The state-of-the-art methodology to assess impacts of climate change including extreme events and uncertainties on the design and performance of energy systems is described and discussed. Climate resilience is an emerging concept that is increasingly used to represent the durability and stable performance of energy systems against extreme climate events. However, it has not yet been adequately explored and widely used, as its definition has not been clearly articulated and assessment is mostly based on qualitative aspects. This study reveals that a major limitation in the state-of-the-art is the inadequacy of climate change adaptation approaches in designing and preparing urban energy systems to satisfactorily address plausible extreme climate events. Furthermore, the complexity of the climate and energy models and the mismatch between their temporal and spatial resolutions are the major limitations in linking these models. Therefore, few studies have focused on the design and operation of urban energy infrastructure in terms of climate resilience. Considering the occurrence of extreme climate events and increasing demand for implementing climate adaptation strategies, the study highlights the importance of improving energy system models to consider future climate variations including extreme events to identify climate resilient energy transition pathways.","[Nik, Vahid M.] Lund Univ, Div Bldg Phys, Dept Bldg & Environm Technol, S-22363 Lund, Sweden; [Nik, Vahid M.] Chalmers Univ Technol, Div Bldg Technol, Dept Architecture & Civil Engn, S-41258 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Nik, Vahid M.] Queensland Univ Technol QUT, Inst Future Environm IFE, Brisbane, Qld 4000, Australia; [Perera, A.

These mechanisms are particularly relevant in the North Atlantic, where the ocean circulation, related to both the Subpolar Gyre and the Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), is thought to be important for driving significant heat content anomalies. Recently, a rapid decline in observed densities in the deep Labrador Sea has pointed to an ongoing slowdown of the AMOC strength taking place since the mid 90s, a decline also hinted by in-situ observations from the RAPID array. This study explores the use of Labrador Sea densities as a precursor of the ocean circulation changes, by analysing a 300-year long simulation with the state-of-the-art coupled model HadGEM3-GC2. The major drivers of Labrador Sea density variability are investigated, and are characterised by three major contributions. First, the integrated effect of local surface heat fluxes, mainly driven by year-to-year changes in the North Atlantic Oscillation, which accounts for 62% of the total variance. Additionally, two multidecadal-to-centennial contributions from the Greenland-Scotland Ridge outflows are quantified; the first associated with freshwater exports via the East Greenland Current, and the second with density changes in the Denmark Strait Overflow. Finally, evidence is shown that decadal trends in Labrador Sea densities are followed by important atmospheric impacts. In particular, a positive winter NAO response appears to follow the negative Labrador Sea density trends, and provides a phase reversal mechanism.","[Ortega, Pablo; Robson, Jon; Sutton, Rowan T.] Univ Reading, NCAS Climate, Reading, Berks, England; [Andrews, Martin B.] Met Off Hadley Ctr, Exeter, Devon, England",UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); NERC National Centre for Atmospheric Science; University of Reading; Met Office - UK; Hadley Centre,"Ortega, P (corresponding author), Univ Reading, NCAS Climate, Reading, Berks, England.",p.ortega@reading.ac.uk,"Robson, Jon/A-7677-2012; Ortega, Pablo/ABE-7884-2020","Robson, Jon/0000-0002-3467-018X; Ortega, Pablo/0000-0002-4135-9621; Sutton, Rowan/0000-0001-8345-8583","NERC Project Dynamics and Predictability of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning and Climate Project (DYNAMOC) [NE/M005127/1]; European project 'Seasonal-to-Decadal Climate Prediction for the Improvement of European Climate Service' (SPECS) [GA 308378]; NERC via the National Centre for Atmospheric Science (NCAS); Joint UK DECC/Defra Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme [GA01101]; NERC [NE/M005127/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Natural Environment Research Council [ncas10009, NE/M005127/1] Funding Source: researchfish",NERC Project Dynamics and Predictability of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning and Climate Project (DYNAMOC); European project 'Seasonal-to-Decadal Climate Prediction for the Improvement of European Climate Service' (SPECS); NERC via the National Centre for Atmospheric Science (NCAS); Joint UK DECC/Defra Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme; NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"We thank the UK Met Office for providing the model data used in this study.

Climate model simulations and paleoclimate reconstructions have indicated that this region could also exhibit large, internally generated variability on decadal time scales. Understanding these modes of variability, their consistency across models, and the conditions in which they exist is clearly important for improving the skill of decadal predictionsparticularly when these predictions are made with the same underlying climate models. This study describes and analyzes a mode of internal variability in the NA SPG in a state-of-the-art, high-resolution, coupled climate model. This mode has a period of 17 yr and explains 15%-30% of the annual variance in related ocean indices. It arises because of the advection of heat content anomalies around the NA SPG. Anomalous circulation drives the variability in the southern half of the NA SPG, while mean circulation and anomalous temperatures are important in the northern half. A negative feedback between Labrador Sea temperatures/densities and those in the North Atlantic Current (NAC) is identified, which allows for the phase reversal. The atmosphere is found to act as a positive feedback on this mode via the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), which itself exhibits a spectral peak at 17 yr. Decadal ocean density changes associated with this mode are driven by variations in temperature rather than salinitya point which models often disagree on and which may affect the veracity of the underlying assumptions of anomaly-assimilating decadal prediction methodologies.","[Menary, Matthew B.; Wood, Richard A.] Met Off Hadley Ctr, Exeter EX1 3PB, Devon, England; [Hodson, Daniel L.

However, negotiators and policymakers lack the capability to assess the impact of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction proposals offered by the parties on warming and the climate. The climate is a complex dynamical system driven by multiple feedback processes, accumulations, time delays and nonlinearities, but research shows poor understanding of these processes is widespread, even among highly educated people with strong technical backgrounds. Existing climate models are opaque to policymakers and too slow to be effective either in the fast-paced context of policy making or as learning environments to help improve people's understanding of climate dynamics. Here we describe C-ROADS (Climate Rapid Overview And Decision Support), a transparent, intuitive policy simulation model that provides policymakers, negotiators, educators, businesses, the media, and the public with the ability to explore, for themselves, the likely consequences of GHG emissions policies. The model runs on an ordinary laptop in seconds, offers an intuitive interface and has been carefully grounded in the best available science. We describe the need for such tools, the structure of the model, and calibration to climate data and state of the art general circulation models.

Coastal zones are especially in need of climate services for adaptation, as they are increasingly threatened by sea level rise and its impacts, such as submergence, flooding, shoreline erosion, salinization and wetland change. In this paper, we examine how annual to multi-decadal sea level projections can be used within coastal climate services (CCS). To this end, we review the current state-of-the art of coastal climate services in the US, Australia and France, and identify lessons learned. More broadly, we also review current barriers in the development of CCS, and identify research and development efforts for overcoming barriers and facilitating their continued growth. The latter includes: (1) research in the field of sea level, coastal and adaptation science and (2) cross-cutting research in the area of user interactions, decision making, propagation of uncertainties and overall service architecture design. We suggest that standard approaches are required to translate relative sea level information into the forms required to inform the wide range of relevant decisions across coastal management, including coastal adaptation.","[Le Cozannet, Goneri] French Geol Survey, BRGM, F-45060 Orleans, France; [Nicholls, Robert J.] Univ Southampton, Engn & Environm, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England; [Hinkel, Jochen] Humboldt Univ, Albrecht Daniel Thaer Inst, Global Climate Forum, D-10178 Berlin, Germany; [Hinkel, Jochen] Humboldt Univ, Albrecht Daniel Thaer Inst, Div Resource Econ, D-10178 Berlin, Germany; [Hinkel, Jochen] Humboldt Univ, Berlin Workshop Inst Anal Social Ecol Syst WINS, D-10178 Berlin, Germany; [Sweet, William V.] NOAA, Ctr Operat Oceanog Prod & Serv, Silver Spring, MD 20910 USA; [McInnes, Kathleen L.] CSIRO, Aspendale, Vic 3195, Australia; [Van de Wal, Roderik S.

This is due particularly to: the inadequacy of databases both quantitatively and qualitatively; Insufficient accuracy of predictions by climate models, especially rainfall and their sensitivity to the choice of climate scenarios; Insufficient accuracy of methods for estimating groundwater recharge; the difficulty of modelling surface water/groundwater interaction over large areas. The assessment of climate change impacts on groundwater resources requires reliable predictions of climate variables; a good estimation of groundwater recharge and its spatial and temporal variability; and the master of hydrodynamic response of the aquifer to different climate change scenarios. Several research studies have shown that climate change has accentuated negative repercussions on groundwater resources in Morocco. These studies were using different approaches: experimental, numerical and statistical modelling. Many aquifer problems were investigated regarding: saline intrusion; water resources quality; recharge, shortage of water reserves. This research works has rarely treating the different process aspects involved with integrated approach.

Although climate change is considered inevitable, adaptive measures must be taken in the field of architecture to alleviate its impact. Creating an overview of the state of the art in the field of architecture as it adapts to climate change will help identify the problems and possibilities of architectural adaptation. The aim must be to create buildings that are as suitable to the current climate as they are to the climate of the future and maintain an ability to resist the impacts of climate change; this ability to resist potential change is defined as adaptive capacity. It is challenging to reconcile the energy requirements for contemporary buildings with rising temperatures and extreme weather in temperate climate zones. The literature on the subject is explored through iterative searches in scientific databases. In discussions about the possible adaptations to climate change, there needs to be a focus on human adaptation facilitated by architecture and the built environment's utilization and support of ecosystem services in adaptation strategies, since the scope of climate change reaches beyond the singular building. There are plenty of strategies and technologies from which to draw but little focus on how these should support the design of a building and its inhabitants. In the future it will be necessary to look at the adaptive capacity of a building itself and how the building can benefit its surroundings.","[Poulsen, Mikkel; Lauring, Michael; Brunsgaard, Camilla] Aalborg Univ, Dept Architecture Design & Media Technol, Aalborg, Denmark",Aalborg University,"Poulsen, M (corresponding author), Aalborg Univ, Dept Architecture Design & Media Technol, Aalborg, Denmark.",mpou@create.aau.dk,,"Brunsgaard, Camilla/0000-0002-9554-0426",,,,,66,1,1,6,16,COLLEGE PUBLISHING,GLEN ALLEN,"12309 LYNWOOD DR, GLEN ALLEN, VA 23059 USA",1552-6100,1943-4618,,J GREEN BUILD,J.

The study calls for timely and effective management of water resources using climate scenario-driven data, reliable models and policy beliefs.","[Rahaman, Md Hibjur; Masroor, Md; Rehman, Sufia; Singh, Roshani; Ahmed, Raihan; Sajjad, Haroon] Jamia Millia Islamia, Fac Nat Sci, Dept Geog, New Delhi 110025, India; [Sahana, Mehebub] Univ Manchester, Sch Environm Educ & Dev SEED, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England",Jamia Millia Islamia; University of Manchester,"Sajjad, H (corresponding author), Jamia Millia Islamia, Fac Nat Sci, Dept Geog, New Delhi 110025, India.",haroon.geog@gmail.com,,", Roshani/0000-0002-0330-4232; Rahaman, Md Hibjur/0000-0002-8999-7497",,,,,63,0,0,12,12,MAIK NAUKA/INTERPERIODICA/SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013-1578 USA",0097-8078,1608-344X,,WATER RESOUR+,Water Resour.,AUG,2022,4,,,,699,710,,10.1134/S0097807822040169,http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S0097807822040169,,,12,Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Water Resources,3A0UF,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000826980900016,View Full Record in Web of Science

In particular, the extent to which CORDEX (COordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment) adds useful details on the performance of CMIP5 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5) multimodel ensemble is investigated. Comparison of the present day simulation was performed with two precipitation observation datasets, the high-resolution TRMM (Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission) and coarse resolution GPCP (Global Precipitation Climatology Project), to evaluate models strengths and weaknesses. Eight indices generated from absolute (1mm) and percentile (95th) based thresholds as defined by the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI) are computed for seventeen CMIP5 GCMs and six CORDEX RCMs (for twelve downscaling experiments) for each year during the historical period (1975-2004). Our results suggest a good consistency between GPCP and TRMM in producing annual mean and frequency of extreme precipitation events over Africa despite few inconsistencies. However, their associated intensities largely differed from one another with GPCP data displaying drier bias. Overall, multimodel ensembles simulations overestimate the frequency of extreme precipitation events and underestimate their intensities. The results further show that CMIP5 exhibits wet bias of precipitation events and drier bias of precipitation intensity than CORDEX, and that CORDEX produces precipitation magnitude within the range of the observations and more in line with the higher-resolution TRMM data. This illustrates the added value achieved with the higher-resolution CORDEX multimodel ensemble for the simulation of such events, and points toward the use of these RCMs to study extreme precipitation for a better assessment of climate change over Africa.","[Gibba, Peter; Nikiema, Michel; Kebe, Ibourahima] Fed Univ Technol Akure, West African Sci Serv Ctr Climate Change & Adapte, Grad Res Program West African Climate Syst, Akure, Nigeria; [Gibba, Peter; Sylla, Mouhamadou Bamba] WASCAL Competence Ctr, West African Sci Serv Ctr Climate Change & Adapte, Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso; [Okogbue, Emmanuel Chilekwu] Fed Univ Technol Akure, Dept Meteorol & Climate Sci, Sch Earth & Mineral Sci, Akure, Nigeria; [Gaye, Amadou Thierno] Cheikh Anta Diop Univ, Polytech Sch, LPAO SF, Dakar, Senegal",University Cheikh Anta Diop Dakar,"Gibba, P (corresponding author), Fed Univ Technol Akure, West African Sci Serv Ctr Climate Change & Adapte, Grad Res Program West African Climate Syst, Akure, Nigeria.;Gibba, P (corresponding author), WASCAL Competence Ctr, West African Sci Serv Ctr Climate Change & Adapte, Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso.",p_gibba@yahoo.com,,,German Federal Ministry of Education and Research through the West African Science Service Center on Climate Change and Adapted Landuse (WASCAL),German Federal Ministry of Education and Research through the West African Science Service Center on Climate Change and Adapted Landuse (WASCAL),This work is supported by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research through the West African Science Service Center on Climate Change and Adapted Landuse (WASCAL).

Absurd art appears in troubled times, subverting moments of extreme contradiction in which it appears impossible to think differently. For example, Dada (1917-1923) used nonsense to reflect the nonsensical brutality of WW1. The power to unsettle in this form of art rests in disrupting the world of the viewer and positioning them as interlocutors in a new framing. Absurdity in art reveals the absurdity that is inherent in life and its institutions, breaking the illusion of control. It can help us to comprehend the 'incomprehensible' in other species and spheres of life. In the challenge of anthropogenic climate change, how might the absurd capture the strangeness of current times in which a gap is widening between the earth we live 'in' and the earth we live 'from'? This article explores qualities of the absurd in art as a possible way in which to grasp and reimagine ourselves beyond the anthropocentric, focusing on the work of the artists John Newling (b. 1952, UK) and Helen Mayer (1927-2018, US) and Newton Harrison (b. 1932, US), known as 'The Harrisons'.","[Douglas, Anne Elizabeth] Robert Gordon Univ, Grays Sch Art, Aberdeen AB10 7AQ, Scotland",Robert Gordon University,"Douglas, AE (corresponding author), Robert Gordon Univ, Grays Sch Art, Aberdeen AB10 7AQ, Scotland.",a.douglas@rgu.ac.uk,,,,,,,34,1,1,1,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-0752,,ARTS,Arts,DEC,2021,4,,,,,,81,10.3390/arts10040081,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/arts10040081,,,17,"Humanities, Multidisciplinary",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Arts & Humanities - Other Topics,YF8FE,,"Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000742035900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

We consider these cases in the context of geography's recent interest in active experimentations and anticipatory interventions in the face of the challenges posed by the environmental and social uncertainties of the Anthropocene. We propose two dimensions to the force of art with respect to these concerns. First, it provides a site and set of practices from which scientists, artists, and communities can come to recognize as well as transform relations between humans and nonhumans. Second, it encourages an accounting of the constitutive force of matter and things with implications for politics and knowledge production. Through these two dimensions, we explore how the arts can enable forms of socioecological transformation and, further, how things might be different in the future, enabling us to explore who and what might play a part in defining and moving toward such a future.","[Hawkins, Harriet] Royal Holloway Univ london, Dept Geog, London, England; [Marston, Sallie A.; Ingram, Mrill] Univ Arizona, Sch Geog & Dev, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Straughan, Elizabeth] Univ Glasgow, Sch Geog & Earth Sci, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland",University of London; Royal Holloway University London; University of Arizona; University of Glasgow,"Hawkins, H (corresponding author), Univ London, Dept Geog, London TW20EX, England.",harriet.hawkins@rhul.ac.uk; marston@email.arizona.edu; mrilli@email.arizona.edu; Libby.Straughan@glasgow.ac.uk,,"Straughan, Elizabeth/0000-0002-5305-2715","Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC)/National Science Foundation grant (AHRC; NSF) [AH/I500022/1, 86908]; AHRC [AH/L005034/1]; AHRC [AH/I500022/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Arts and Humanities Research Council [AH/I500022/1, AH/L005034/1] Funding Source: researchfish",Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC)/National Science Foundation grant (AHRC; NSF)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Arts & Humanities Research Council (AHRC)); AHRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Arts & Humanities Research Council (AHRC)); AHRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Arts & Humanities Research Council (AHRC)); Arts and Humanities Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Arts & Humanities Research Council (AHRC)),Research for this article was funded by an Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC)/National Science Foundation grant (AHRC Grant No. AH/I500022/1; NSF Grant No. 86908) and AHRC Grant No. AH/L005034/1.,,35,36,36,0,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0004-5608,1467-8306,,ANN ASSOC AM GEOGR,Ann.

First exhibited in 1992, the artwork was addressed to the silencing of women about abortion and other denigrated bodily experiences in a deeply repressive social and political climate. More recent artworks which challenge how women's reproductive bodies are controlled by the state evidence the continued relevance of these themes as related to the Irish contexts, North and South.

This complexity can be challenging to simulate, and even more challenging to communicate effectively through the use of performance metrics. A multiplicity of CBDM techniques and metrics has been developed over the last two decades, but these were rarely assessed against each other. This paper reviews four state-of-the-art techniques based on the Radiance raytracing engine and systematically compares them against a benchmark CBDM method. Four classroom spaces are used to carry out an inter-model comparison between performance metrics commonly used for compliance verification obtained from all analysed techniques. Additional sensitivity analyses assessed how changes in input variables influence such metrics. Results from the inter-model comparison showed that the representation of direct sunlight is markedly different between the various CBDM techniques, and that metrics based on horizontal direct sunlight are very sensitive to the choice of simulation method. This led to differences in predicted Annual Sunlight Exposure up to 39 percentage points. Metrics that consider both direct and inter-reflected light were found to be more robust, with variations from benchmark results within +/- 15%. The analysis of the input variables showed that sensor grid spacing and time-step interpolation do not significantly affect any of these metrics. Changes in orientation and sky discretisation scheme had different effects depending on the metric and technique considered. The need for authoritative benchmarking systems when introducing new performance metrics for compliance verification or new simulation methods is also discussed.","[Brembilla, E.; Mardaljevic, J.] Loughborough Univ, Sch Architecture Bldg & Civil Engn, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England",Loughborough University,"Brembilla, E (corresponding author), Loughborough Univ, Sch Architecture Bldg & Civil Engn, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England.",E.Brembilla@lboro.ac.uk,"Brembilla, Eleonora/T-7372-2019","Brembilla, Eleonora/0000-0003-1800-8660","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council; Arup Lighting UKMEA Group, under the EPSRC CASE Award scheme [EP/K504476/1]; EPSRC; Arup Lighting Team; Loughborough University","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Arup Lighting UKMEA Group, under the EPSRC CASE Award scheme(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Arup Lighting Team; Loughborough University","The research described in this paper formed part of Dr. Brembilla's PhD thesis 'Applicability of Climate-Based Daylight Modelling'.

The literature on sustainability planning emphasizes the importance of collaborative work to build new capacities, develop knowledge, and create community commitment over the long term to advocate for municipal policies that prioritize climate change mitigation and resilience. However, case studies of rural community contexts are lacking in the literature, and rural communities may not have the planning and other resources found in the municipal offices of larger, urban communities. We argue that higher education institutions, especially those situated in small rural communities, have a vital role in supporting the climate strategies of local actors and can develop productive partnerships through research and co-curricular education. We discuss several challenges to effective campus-community partnerships, including the need to balance student engagement in community-based research with the traditional liberal arts model of education, engaging and sustaining the participation of community partners, and differential access to resources in rural spaces.","[Pattison, Andrew; Henke, Christopher R.] Colgate Univ, Environm Studies Program, Hamilton, NY 13346 USA; [Henke, Christopher R.] Colgate Univ, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, Hamilton, NY 13346 USA; [Pumilio, John] Colgate Univ, Off Sustainabil, Hamilton, NY 13346 USA",Colgate University; Colgate University; Colgate University,"Henke, CR (corresponding author), Colgate Univ, Environm Studies Program, Hamilton, NY 13346 USA.;Henke, CR (corresponding author), Colgate Univ, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, Hamilton, NY 13346 USA.",chenke@colgate.edu,,"Henke, Christopher/0000-0002-9973-333X",,,,,39,1,1,3,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",2190-6483,2190-6491,,J ENVIRON STUD SCI,J.

In particular, it looks to three weaver-activists who use their practices to reclaim the matrixial power of the ocean (as maternal womb and network of relation) in the face of ongoing US occupation in the Pacific: Marshallese poet and climate activist Kathy Jetnil-Kijiner; Hawai'i-based settler-ally weaver and installation artist Mary Babcock; and Kanaka Maoli sculptor Kaili Chun, also based in Hawai'i. Each artist begins from a particular positionality in the ongoing open weave of the ocean and uses specific cultural ontologies of weaving and netting to address knots and gaps in climate change imaginaries. These weavers help to articulate important nuances in recent calls for working in solidarity networks at the cultural interface of climate justice activism. Their processes directly address the need for greater emotional and relational capacity across cultural and national divides, across Indigenous and non-Indigenous feminist critiques of colonial-capitalist systems and through inter-connected waters.","[Faris, Jaimey Hamilton] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Contemporary Art Hist & Crit Theory, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA",University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa,"Faris, JH (corresponding author), Univ Hawaii Manoa, Contemporary Art Hist & Crit Theory, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",,,"Hamilton Faris, Jaimey/0000-0003-4647-4474",,,,,53,1,1,2,2,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0141-7789,1466-4380,,FEMINIST REV,Fem.

In contemporary times, the role and place of art are being questioned, producing its displacement from the idealized institutional spaces. Art that is realized in public spaces becomes a strategy for getting closer to both reality and the public. Most of the works that intervene in urban spaces deal with the concept of site-specific, which is characterized by an indiscernible limit between work and site. The use of public spaces raises new issues: the predicament of perceiving the artwork as such, the anonymous artist, the ephemeral quality of the artwork and its dissolution in the city structure. The poetics of art in public spaces permeate, besides the physical and cultural aspects of the city, other aspects of a more philosophical dimension, in which the aesthetic category of the sublime reappears in the contemporary context, in face of the human frailty before natural catastrophes, climate changes, urban violence, epidemics, etc. The city and its dynamics are converted into a reflex of the world, whereas the artist, attentive to this circumstance, makes use of the city as a means for reflecting upon the relations between subject and reality.","[Cartaxo, Zalinda] Univ Fed Estado Rio de Janeiro, Fed Univ State Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Estado do Rio de Janeiro,"Cartaxo, Z (corresponding author), Univ Fed Estado Rio de Janeiro, Fed Univ State Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.",,,,,,,,9,1,1,0,0,UNIV ESTADO RIO JANEIRO,RIO DE JANEIRO RJ,"RUA SAO FRANCISCO XAVIER, 524-BLOCO F, RIO DE JANEIRO RJ, 20559-900, BRAZIL",0104-7671,2176-7017,,PERCEVEJO ONLINE,Percevejo Online,JAN-JUN,2009,1,,,,,,,,,,,16,Theater,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Theater,VE7TF,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000440295300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Drawing on the authors' work and practice worldwide, 'standard art-science' (the artist as communicator and observer) and emerging 'transdisciplinary/paradisciplinary' practices are explored in the watery realm. While standard art-science 'encounters' were viewed favourably from the viewpoint of community engagement, especially by commissioning bodies, they did not measurably improve the explanation of science to the public nor offer new avenues for creative investigation. In light of this, the authors undertook a series of explicitly interdisciplinary/transdisciplinary 'entanglements' by co-conceiving projects, carrying out joint fieldwork and 'data' collection and, most importantly, working together in the studio and laboratory. These projects suggest that multi-scalar approaches are required when using art-geoscience to explore environmental issues which impact significantly on individuals and communities.","[Macklin, Judy E.] Aberystwyth Univ, Sch Educ & Life Long Learning, Aberystwyth, Dyfed, Wales; [Macklin, Mark G.] Univ Lincoln, Sch Geog, Lincoln LN6 7TS, England; [Macklin, Mark G.] Univ Lincoln, Lincoln Ctr Water & Planetary Res, Lincoln LN6 7TS, England; [Macklin, Mark G.] Massey Univ, Inst Agr & Environm, Innovat River Solut, Palmerston North, New Zealand; [Macklin, Mark G.] La Trobe Univ, Ctr Inland, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Aberystwyth University; University of Lincoln; University of Lincoln; Massey University; La Trobe University,"Macklin, MG (corresponding author), Univ Lincoln, Sch Geog, Lincoln LN6 7TS, England.;Macklin, MG (corresponding author), Univ Lincoln, Lincoln Ctr Water & Planetary Res, Lincoln LN6 7TS, England.",mmacklin@lincoln.ac.uk,,"Macklin, Mark/0000-0003-4167-2033",,,,,19,2,3,0,1,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1744-5647,,,J MAPS,J.

However, this investment will only arise if the general community is supportive, and community support is only likely if the issues are widely understood. Scientists often find it difficult to communicate with the general public. The role of the visual and performing arts is often overlooked in this regard, yet the arts have long communicated issues, influenced and educated people, and challenged dominant paradigms. To assess the response of professional ecologists to the role of the arts in communicating science, a series of constructed performances and exhibitions was integrated into the program of a national ecological conference over five days. At the conclusion of the conference, responses were sought from the assembled scientists and research students toward using the arts for expanding audiences to ecological science. Over half the delegates said that elements of the arts program provided a conducive atmosphere for receiving information, encouraged them to reflect on alternative ways to communicate science, and persuaded them that the arts have a role in helping people understand complex scientific concepts. A sizeable minority of delegates (24%) said they would consider incorporating the arts in their extension or outreach efforts. Incorporating music, theatre, and dance into a scientific conference can have many effects on participants and audiences. The arts can synthesize and convey complex scientific information, promote new ways of looking at issues, touch people's emotions, and create a celebratory atmosphere, as was evident in this case study. In like manner, the visual and performing arts should be harnessed to help extend the increasingly unpalatable and urgent messages of global climate change science to a lay audience worldwide.","[Curtis, David J.; Reid, Nick; Ballard, Guy] Univ New England, Armidale, NSW 2351, Australia",University of New England,"Curtis, DJ (corresponding author), Univ New England, Armidale, NSW 2351, Australia.",,,"Reid, Nick/0000-0002-4377-9734",Land and Water Australia; Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation,Land and Water Australia; Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation,"A sincere thanks to all those artists and performers who participated in the arts program for the 2003 Ecological Society of Australia Conference, to those who participated in surveys, and to those who gave permission for the use of their images.

Aerosols and their interactions with radiation and clouds represents in the moment one of the major uncertainties in our understanding of climate system as they can described only roughly in coarse resolution global models. The online coupled comprehensive chemistry model system COSMO-ART already showed in several case studies the potential of closing this gap. In order to apply it on decadal climate time scales the use of high performance computing becomes a necessity. We propose to perform decadal climate simulations on two domains. A first one covers Europe at a horizontal resolution of 14 km for a period from 1995 to 2005. The second domains covers Germany at a horizontal resolution of 2.8 km for the same period and it will be forced at the boundaries by the results of the first domain. On the European domain only the interactions of aerosols and radiation will be represented, whereas in the high-resolution German domain, the simulated aerosol can additionally act as cloud condensation and ice nuclei. The results will be obtained will be unprecedented and lead to a better understanding of changes in the regional climate of Europe and Germany.

This study uses simulations performed with coupled general circulation models (CGCMs) to investigate how regional precipitation in the twenty-first century may be affected by changes in both ENSO-driven precipitation variability and slowly evolving mean rainfall. First, a dominant, time-invariant pattern of canonical ENSO variability (cENSO) is identified in observed SST data. Next, the fidelity with which 33 state-of-the-art CGCMs represent the spatial structure and temporal variability of this pattern (as well as its associated precipitation responses) is evaluated in simulations of twentieth-century climate change. Possible changes in both the temporal variability of this pattern and its associated precipitation teleconnections are investigated in twenty-first-century climate projections. Models with better representation of the observed structure of the cENSO pattern produce winter rainfall teleconnection patterns that are in better accord with twentieth-century observations and more stationary during the twenty-first century. Finally, the model-predicted twenty-first-century rainfall response to cENSO is decomposed into the sum of three terms: 1) the twenty-first-century change in the mean state of precipitation, 2) the historical precipitation response to the cENSO pattern, and 3) a future enhancement in the rainfall response to cENSO, which amplifies rainfall extremes. By examining the three terms jointly, this conceptual framework allows the identification of regions likely to experience future rainfall anomalies that are without precedent in the current climate.","[Bonfils, Celine J.

Although global-scale climatic impacts following the formation of stratospheric sulfate aerosol are well understood, many aspects of the evolution of the early volcanic aerosol cloud and regional impacts are uncertain. In the last twenty years, several advances have been made, mainly due to improved satellite measurements and observations enabling the effects of small-magnitude eruptions to be quantified, new proxy reconstructions used to investigate the impact of past eruptions, and state-of-the-art aerosol-climate modelling that has led to new insights on how volcanic eruptions affect the climate. Looking to the future, knowledge gaps include the role of co-emissions in volcanic plumes, the impact of eruptions on tropical hydroclimate and Northern Hemisphere winter climate, and the role of eruptions in long-term climate change. Future model development, dedicated model intercomparison projects, interdisciplinary collaborations, and the application of advanced statistical techniques will facilitate more complex and detailed studies. Ensuring that the next large-magnitude explosive eruption is well observed will be critical in providing invaluable observations that will bridge remaining gaps in our understanding.","[Marshall, Lauren R.; Maters, Elena C.; Schmidt, Anja] Univ Cambridge, Dept Chem, Cambridge, England; [Schmidt, Anja] Univ Cambridge, Dept Geog, Cambridge, England; [Schmidt, Anja] German Aerosp Ctr DLR, Inst Atmospher Phys IPA, Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany; [Schmidt, Anja] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Meteorol Inst, Munich, Germany; [Timmreck, Claudia] Max Planck Inst Meteorol, Hamburg, Germany; [Robock, Alan] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Environm Sci, New Brunswick, NJ 08903 USA; [Toohey, Matthew] Univ Saskatchewan, Inst Space & Atmospher Studies, Saskatoon, SK, Canada",University of Cambridge; University of Cambridge; Helmholtz Association; German Aerospace Centre (DLR); University of Munich; Max Planck Society; Rutgers State University New Brunswick; University of Saskatchewan,"Marshall, LR (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Chem, Cambridge, England.",lrm49@cam.ac.uk; ecm63@cam.ac.uk; anja.schmidt@dlr.de; claudia.timmreck@mpimet.mpg.de; robock@envsci.rutgers.edu; matthew.toohey@usask.ca,"Robock, Alan/B-6385-2016","Timmreck, Claudia/0000-0001-5355-0426; Marshall, Lauren/0000-0003-1471-9481; Robock, Alan/0000-0002-6319-5656","Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [VOL-CLIM (NE/S000887/1)]; NERC [NE/S00436X/1]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft Research Unit VolImpact [FOR2820, 398006378]; U.S. National Science Foundation [AGS-2017113]; Leverhulme Trust; Isaac Newton Trust",Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft Research Unit VolImpact(German Research Foundation (DFG)); U.S. National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Leverhulme Trust(Leverhulme Trust); Isaac Newton Trust,"The authors would like to thank Thomas Aubry for insightful discussions and comments, and an anonymous reviewer, Mark Jellinek and Andrew Harris for their reviews, which have greatly improved this manuscript.

While tailored NBS tools could facilitate and accelerate this process, a comprehensive mapping of their availability and capacity to respond to cities' challenges is missing. This research aims to provide an overview of tools that intend to facilitate the uptake of NBS for urban climate adaptation supporting cities in overcoming their challenges. To do so, this paper (i) presents the results of interviews and workshops with municipal officers and decision-makers from different European cities that identified the challenges they experience with NBS uptake; (ii) selects and reviews NBS tools and (iii) analyzes them on their capacity to address these implementation challenges. Our research revealed four key challenges that municipal officers experience: resources availability; level of expertise, know-how or competence; the institutional setting, and collaborative governance and planning. The results from the tools' review show that existing tools can support overcoming a lack of expertise (31), but, to a smaller extent, can also be of use when experiencing the institutional setting (13), availability of resources (11), and collaborative governance and planning (10) as a challenge. This work provides researchers and tool developers with insights into potential market saturation as well as scarcity of certain types of tools that would match cities' challenges, highlighting needs and opportunities for new tool development.","[Voskamp, Ilse M.; Polo-Ballinas, Monserrat Budding] Wageningen Univ & Res, Wageningen Environm Res, POB 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; [de Luca, Claudia] Alma Mater Studiorum Univ Bologna, Dept Architecture, I-40136 Bologna, Italy; [Hulsman, Helena; Brolsma, Reinder] Deltares, NL-2629 HV Delft, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research; University of Bologna; Deltares,"Voskamp, IM (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ & Res, Wageningen Environm Res, POB 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands.;de Luca, C (corresponding author), Alma Mater Studiorum Univ Bologna, Dept Architecture, I-40136 Bologna, Italy.",ilse.voskamp@wur.nl; claudia.deluca5@unibo.it; monserrat.budding@wur.nl; Helena.Hulsman@deltares.nl; Reinder.Brolsma@deltares.nl,"de Luca, Claudia/AFL-6981-2022; de Luca, Claudia/AAG-7031-2022","de Luca, Claudia/0000-0001-6836-4298; de Luca, Claudia/0000-0001-6836-4298; Budding-Polo Ballinas, Monserrat/0000-0002-5071-1041","EIT-Climate KIC [190193]; Amsterdam Institute for Advanced Metropolitan Solutions (AMS); Dutch Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality; Wageningen University Knowledge Base program: KB36 Biodiversity in a Nature Inclusive Society [KB36-005-005]","EIT-Climate KIC; Amsterdam Institute for Advanced Metropolitan Solutions (AMS); Dutch Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality; Wageningen University Knowledge Base program: KB36 Biodiversity in a Nature Inclusive Society","This work received financial support in the frame of the Adaptive Cities Through integrated Nature Based Solutions (ACT on NBS) project, by EIT-Climate KIC (project ID 190193).

Methodology - We analyze survey data from associate and full professors to identify predictors of satisfaction with advancement. Focus group and interview data supplement our interpretations of regression results. Findings - The two colleges differ in the impact of gender, rank, perceptions of the full professor promotion process, and quality of department relationships on satisfaction with advancement. At one college, there is no gender difference, while at the other, women are less satisfied than men. The effect of gender at this college is fully mediated by department relationship quality. Research limitations - This cross-sectional study was conducted at only two colleges. Interpretations of the quantitative results are inductively generated and not tested in the analysis. Practical implications - We make recommendations to improve processes and pathways for promotion that recognize the role of department climates in fostering or hindering career progression. Gender may be less salient in contexts in which associate professors have positive department relationships and in which promotion criteria value their administrative service and other institutional contributions sufficiently. Originality - Previous research about promotion to full professor has focused on research universities while we examine the issue at liberal arts colleges, institutions that emphasize undergraduate study.","[Berheide, Catherine White] Skidmore Coll, Dept Sociol, Saratoga Springs, NY 12866 USA; [Walzer, Susan] Skidmore Coll, Dept Sociol, Sociol, Saratoga Springs, NY 12866 USA",Skidmore College; Skidmore College,"Berheide, CW (corresponding author), Skidmore Coll, Dept Sociol, Saratoga Springs, NY 12866 USA.",,"Berheide, Catherine/ABH-9721-2020",,,,,,33,4,4,0,1,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY, W YORKSHIRE BD16 1WA, ENGLAND",1529-2126,,978-1-78441-069-8; 978-1-78441-070-4,ADV GEND RES,,,2014,,,,,177,198,,10.1108/S1529-212620140000019008,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/S1529-212620140000019008,10.1108/S1529-2126201419,,22,Sociology; Women's Studies,Book Citation Index – Social Sciences & Humanities (BKCI-SSH),Sociology; Women's Studies,BH7OS,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000402721800010,View Full Record in Web of Science

Similar multidecadal variability is also seen in other (societal important) parameters such as Sahel rainfall or Atlantic hurricane activity. The existence of the multidecadal variability makes climate change detection a challenge, since global warming evolves on a similar timescale. The ongoing discussion about a potential anthropogenic signal in the Atlantic hurricane activity is an example. A lot of work was devoted during the last years to understand the dynamics of the multidecadal variability, and external and internal mechanisms were proposed. This review paper focuses on two aspects. First, it describes the mechanisms for internal variability using a stochastic framework. Specific attention is given to variability of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), which is likely the origin of a considerable part of decadal variability and predictability in the Atlantic Sector. Second, the paper discusses decadal predictability and the factors limiting its realization. These include a poor understanding of the mechanisms involved and large biases in state-of-the-art climate models. Enhanced model resolution, improved subgrid scale parameterisations, and the inclusion of additional climate subsystems, such as a resolved stratosphere, may help overcome these limitations.

After selection of the sample buildings and short-term field measurements from local climate throughout the year, the field data collected was used in simulation and comparison of the traditional and the contemporary sample buildings. All buildings were simulated with Design Builder software under natural ventilation conditions as a passive solution in moderate periods of the year while split air-conditioning systems were used during hot and humid periods. The findings show that shading, proper materials in exterior walls and natural ventilation in traditional dwellings are the primary factors in improving comfort conditions and reducing cooling loads; and accordingly, discomfort hours decreased by 12-34% and the cooling energy consumption was also reduced by 26-46% in these dwellings. Better thermal comfort and less energy consumption in traditional dwellings of Bushehr show that the integrated climate-responsive solutions used in these dwellings have well-responded to the local climate characteristics in this city and have contributed to the formation of climate-responsive buildings in the severe climate conditions of this region. Today it is possible to reuse these buildings as residential spaces with satisfactory thermal comfort conditions and less energy consumption compared to the contemporary ones and the solutions used in these dwellings can also be used to design new climate-responsive buildings.","[Mohammadi, Amin; Saghafi, Mahmoud Reza; Nasrollahi, Farshad] Art Univ Isfahan, Fac Architecture & Urbanism, Esfahan, Iran; [Tahbaz, Mansoureh] Shahid Beheshti Univ, Fac Architecture & Urbanism, Tehran, Iran",Shahid Beheshti University,"Mohammadi, A (corresponding author), Art Univ Isfahan, Fac Architecture & Urbanism, Esfahan, Iran.",aminmohammadi.pgu@gmail.com; mrsaghafi@gmail.com; m58tahbaz@yahoo.com,"Tahbaz, Mansoureh/ABB-7994-2021; Mohammadi, Amin/T-6866-2017; Saghafi, Mahmoud Reza/AAJ-3077-2020; Saghafi, Mahmoud Reza/GRN-9697-2022","Tahbaz, Mansoureh/0000-0003-3765-8407; Mohammadi, Amin/0000-0001-7932-7011; Saghafi, Mahmoud Reza/0000-0001-7779-7132; ",Art University of Isfahan,Art University of Isfahan,This article is part of unpublished Ph.

Most commonly used bias correction methods operate on a single variable, which ignores dependency among multiple variables. The misrepresentation of multivariable dependence may result in biased assessment of climate change impacts. To solve this problem, a new multivariate bias correction method referred to as two-stage quantile mapping (TSQM) is proposed by combining a single-variable bias correction method with a distribution-free shuffle approach. Specifically, a quantile mapping method is used to correct the marginal distribution of single variable and then a distribution-free shuffle approach to introduce proper multivariable correlations. The proposed method is compared with the other four state-of-the-art multivariate bias correction methods for correcting monthly precipitation, and maximum and minimum temperatures simulated by global climate models. The results show that the TSQM method is capable of both bias correcting univariate statistics and inducing proper inter-variable rank correlations. Especially, it outperforms all the other four methods in reproducing inter-variable rank correlations and in simulating mean temperature and potential evaporation for wet and dry months of the validation period. Overall, without complex algorithm and iterations, TSQM is fast, simple and easy to implement, and is proved a competitive bias correction technique to be widely applied in climate change impact studies.","[Guo, Qiang; Chen, Jie; Shen, Mingxi; Chen, Hua; Guo, Shenglian] Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Water Resources & Hydropower Engn S, Wuhan 430072, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xunchang] USDA ARS, Grazinglands Res Lab, 7207 West Cheyenne St, El Reno, OK 73036 USA",Wuhan University; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Chen, J (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Water Resources & Hydropower Engn S, Wuhan 430072, Hubei, Peoples R China.",jiechen@whu.edu.cn,"Shen, Mingxi/ACA-3626-2022; Chen, hua/AAN-1532-2020","Shen, Mingxi/0000-0001-9798-7945; Guo, Qiang/0000-0001-6539-5988; Zhang, John/0000-0002-0082-8436","National Natural Science Foundation of China [51779176, 51539009, 51339004]; Thousand Youth Talents Plan from the Organization Department of CCP Central Committee (Wuhan University, China)","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Thousand Youth Talents Plan from the Organization Department of CCP Central Committee (Wuhan University, China)","This work was partially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant no. 51779176, 51539009, 51339004) and the Thousand Youth Talents Plan from the Organization Department of CCP Central Committee (Wuhan University, China).

Model studies for the Holocene focus either on internally generated variability or on externally forced variability. Internal variability is estimated from the hierarchy of climate models in free simulations without external forcing. Long-term simulations indicate that the internal variability on decadal to centennial scales is of major importance in the atmosphere-ocean system. Forced variability is estimated from climate model simulations employing time-varying forcings, e.g., for solar irradiance and volcanism. In simulations with coupled atmosphere-ocean-vegetation models also the bio-geophysical feedback mechanisms appear important.

Daily weather for a series of transient climate scenarios spanning the 21st century were developed for the study site with the help of the LARS-WG weather generator. Changes in the length of dry and wet spells, temperature, precipitation and solar radiation defining the scenarios were obtained from regional climate simulations carried out in the framework of the PRUDENCE project. Compared to 1961-1990, the latter indicated that for 2071-2100 there would be a noticeable increase in temperature (roughly 3 degrees C in winter and 5 degrees C in summer), a significant drop in summer precipitation (of the order of -30%) and a nearly 2-fold increase in the length of dry spells. Assuming that clover is less drought-tolerant than grass, we examined whether clover abundance would decrease as a consequence of increasing heat and water stress, or be promoted on account of CO2 stimulation. Results indicated that: (1) at our site, climate change alone did not curtail biological N-2 fixation to the point as to alter the composition of the sward but nevertheless entailed a decrease in grassland productivity; (2) increasing CO2 clearly promoted clover growth (via feedbacks on nitrogen acquisition) and grassland productivity; and (3) even with CO2 stimulation, the additional N input from symbiotic N-2 fixation was not sufficient to substantially improve the mineral N status of the system and promote grass competitiveness.","[Lazzarotto, Patrick; Calanca, Pierluigi; Fuhrer, Juerg] Air Pollut Climate Grp, Agroscope Reckenholz Tanikon Res Stn ART, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland; [Semenov, Mikhail] Ctr Math & Computat Biol, Harpenden AL5 2JQ, Herts, England",Swiss Federal Research Station Agroscope; Swiss Federal Research Station for Agroecology & Agriculture,"Calanca, P (corresponding author), Air Pollut Climate Grp, Agroscope Reckenholz Tanikon Res Stn ART, Reckenholzstr 191, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland.",pierluigi.calanca@art.admin.ch,"Semenov, Mikhail/HCI-8667-2022","Semenov, Mikhail/0000-0002-1561-7113","National Centre of Competence in Research on Climate (NCCR Climate); EU [017841-2, EVK2-CT2001-00132]; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) of the United Kingdom",National Centre of Competence in Research on Climate (NCCR Climate)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); EU(European Commission); Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) of the United Kingdom(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)),The authors wish to acknowledge the financial support of the National Centre of Competence in Research on Climate (NCCR Climate) and the EU project Nitro Europe IP (contract no. 017841-2).

This paper analyzes the general education (or core) curriculum in the top 100 universities and liberal-arts colleges in the U.S. to assess the proportion of core courses that highlight climate change or climate science. The probability that a student takes at least one climate change course via the core curriculum is estimated at 0.17 across all schools. The probability is higher at research universities than at liberal arts colleges, in core programs that have more science and social science courses, and at public universities in states with a Democrat-controlled legislature than in states with a Republican-controlled or split legislature. Drawing on cases of best practices in the U.S. identified from the data set, the authors discuss strategies that could ensure a higher likelihood that the core curriculum includes education on climate science and climate change. The study advances the broader research literature on sustainability in higher education programs by bringing it into conversation with research on the college core curriculum and by focusing both on the specific issue of climate-change education.

Such changes have various implications on water security, particularly in urban regions that are highly concentrated with human population and socio-economic activities. Assessing the climate change impacts on water security is often based on using the projections from an ensemble of climate models which are further downscaled into finer spatial resolutions. The availability of downscaled climate simulations has resulted in the optimism that future climate change threats to urban water security could now be quantified at the scale of individual cities; however, is this really the case? To showcase some of the challenges in the direct application of downscaled climate projections for impact assessment, here we explore the reliability of a state-of-the-art ensemble of downscaled climate simulations in the city of Montreal, Canada. We show that spatial variability in long-term climate over Montreal is misrepresented by downscaled climate projections. In addition, uncertainty in future projections as a result of climate models and/or concentration pathways can pose extra challenges in application of the downscaled projection in real-world design and operational contexts. Based on the currently available literature, we suggest few directions to handle current modeling uncertainties until improved climate modeling technology becomes available.","[Jaramillo, Pablo; Nazemi, Ali] Concordia Univ, Dept Bldg Civil & Environm Engn, Montreal, PQ, Canada",Concordia University - Canada,"Nazemi, A (corresponding author), Concordia Univ, Dept Bldg Civil & Environm Engn, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",ali.nazemi@concordia.ca,,,Concordia University through Startup and Strategic Hire Funds; Graduate Students' Scholarship Program,Concordia University through Startup and Strategic Hire Funds; Graduate Students' Scholarship Program,"Downscaled climate scenarios used were from the NASA Earth Exchange Global Daily Downscaled Projections (NEX-GDDP) dataset, prepared by the Climate Analytics Group and NASA Ames Research Center using the NASA Earth Exchange, and distributed by the NASA Center for Climate Simulation (NCCS) - see https://cds.nccs.nasa.gov/nex-gddp/.

SAMM is a new concept of AORCM (Atmosphere-Ocean Regional Climate Model), where a global atmosphere model is locally coupled with a regional ocean circulation model. It consists of the global spectral AGCM ARPEGE-Climate model, whose variable resolution is maximum in the Mediterranean region (50 km), which has been coupled to the Mediterranean Sea limited area OGCM OPAMED (10 km). A 140-year numerical experiment starting in 1960 was run with the AORCM. Up to year 2000, forcing was prescribed from observed Values, whereas forcing following a SRES-A2 scenario was applied beyond 2000. In order to ensure the model stability, a simple monthly heat flux correction on air-sea exchanges was applied. The present-climate validation proves that the AORCM is comparable to the state-of-the-art European Atmosphere Regional Climate Models (ARCM) at the same resolution. At first order, the climate change impact over Europe simulated by the AORCM is comparable with ARCM simulations. However the AORCM significantly amplifies the climate change signal over large parts of Europe with respect to the corresponding ARCM: the warming is higher in all seasons and in many areas of Europe (LIP to 25% of the signal), winters are wetter over northern Europe and summers drier over southern and eastern Europe (up to 50% of the signal). These differences are highly significant and the choice between coupled and non-coupled regional models could be an additional Source Of uncertainty when evaluating the climate change response over Europe. The factors responsible for these differences are discussed. Among them, the response of the Mediterranean SST, better simulated by the high resolution Mediterranean Sea model of the AORCM, seems to be preponderant. Further mechanism studies and model inter comparisons are however required to legitimate the present results. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Most of the time, those 1d-corrections do not modify the ranks of the time series to be corrected. This implies that biases in the spatial or inter-variable dependences of the simulated variables are not adjusted. Hence, over the last few years, some multivariate bias correction (MBC) methods have been developed to account for inter-variable structures, inter-site ones, or both. As proof-of-concept, we propose to adapt a computer vision technique used for Image-to-Image translation tasks (CycleGAN) for the adjustment of spatial dependence structures of climate model projections. The proposed algorithm, named MBC-CycleGAN, aims to transfer simulated maps (seen as images) with inappropriate spatial dependence structure from climate model outputs to more realistic images with spatial properties similar to the observed ones. For evaluation purposes, the method is applied to adjust maps of temperature and precipitation from climate simulations through two cross-validation approaches. The first one is designed to assess two different post-processing schemes (Perfect Prognosis and Model Output Statistics). The second one assesses the influence of nonstationary properties of climate simulations on the performance of MBC-CycleGAN to adjust spatial dependences. Results are compared against a popular univariate bias correction method, a quantile-mapping method, which ignores inter-site dependencies in the correction procedure, and two state-of-the-art multivariate bias correction algorithms aiming to adjust spatial correlation structure. In comparison with these alternatives, the MBC-CycleGAN algorithm reasonably corrects spatial correlations of climate simulations for both temperature and precipitation, encouraging further research on the improvement of this approach for multivariate bias correction of climate model projections.","[Francois, Bastien; Thao, Soulivanh; Vrac, Mathieu] Univ Paris Saclay, CNRS CEA UVSQ, UMR 8212, Lab Sci Climat & Environm LSCE IPSL, Paris, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Earth Sciences & Astronomy (INSU); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Cite; Universite Paris Saclay; CEA,"Francois, B (corresponding author), Univ Paris Saclay, CNRS CEA UVSQ, UMR 8212, Lab Sci Climat & Environm LSCE IPSL, Paris, France.",bastien.francois@lsce.ipsl.fr,,"FRANCOIS, Bastien/0000-0002-9471-026X","CoCliServ project, ERA4CS, an ERA-NET; JPI Climate; European Union","CoCliServ project, ERA4CS, an ERA-NET; JPI Climate; European Union(European Commission)","This research has been supported by the CoCliServ project, which is part of ERA4CS, an ERA-NET initiated by JPI Climate and cofunded by the European Union.",,107,6,6,4,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0930-7575,1432-0894,,CLIM DYNAM,Clim.

We illustrate the key steps and share the main lessons learnt from our experience in the creation of Project Ukko (http://project-ukko.net), a fully working climate services prototype developed within the European project EUPORIAS. To address the domain challenge in climate services, extensive engagement with science and industry stakeholders was required. To address the informational challenge, we applied visualisation techniques that can help users to interpret and utilise the information as simply and quickly as possible. Fostering interdisciplinary teams of design researchers, climate scientists and communication specialists brought a wide range of expertise and competences in all stages of climate services development. Specifically, the project recognised the role of users in co-designing the product. This helped to improve the usability of climate predictions, tailor climate information to answer actual needs of users, better communicate uncertainty, and bridge the gap between state-of-the-art climate predictions and users' readiness to apply this novel information.

The model is applied to an area encompassing the Mediterranean Sea and compared to a stand-alone version of its atmospheric component. An assessment of the model performances is done by using available observational datasets. Despite a persistent bias, the PROTHEUS system is able to capture the inter-annual variability of seasonal sea surface temperature (SST) and also the fine scale spatio-temporal evolution of observed SST anomalies, with spatial correlation as high as 0.7 during summer. The close inspection of a 10-day strong wind event during the summer of 2000 proves the capability of the PROTHEUS system to correctly describe the daily evolution of SST under strong air-sea interaction conditions. As a consequence of the model's skill in reproducing observed SST and wind fields, we expect a reliable estimation of air-sea fluxes. The model skill in reproducing climatological land surface fields is in line with that of state of the art regional climate models.","[Artale, Vincenzo; Calmanti, Sandro; Carillo, Adriana; Dell'Aquila, Alessandro; Herrmann, Marine; Pisacane, Giovanna; Ruti, Paolo M.; Sannino, Gianmaria; Struglia, Maria Vittoria] ENEA, Italian Natl Agcy New Technol Energy & Environm, ACS CLIM MOD, I-00060 Rome, Italy; [Giorgi, Filippo; Bi, Xunqiang; Pal, Jeremy S.; Rauscher, Sara] Abdus Salam Int Ctr Theoret Phys, Trieste, Italy; [Herrmann, Marine] Meteo France, CNRM, Toulouse, France; [Pal, Jeremy S.] Loyola Marymount Univ, Los Angeles, CA 90045 USA",Italian National Agency New Technical Energy & Sustainable Economics Development; Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP); Meteo France; Loyola Marymount University,"Calmanti, S (corresponding author), ENEA, Italian Natl Agcy New Technol Energy & Environm, ACS CLIM MOD, Bldg F19,Room 112,Sp 91 CR Casaccia,Via Anguilla, I-00060 Rome, Italy.",sandro.calmanti@enea.it; alessandro.dellaquila@enea.it,"artale, vincenzo/J-5406-2013; Carillo, Adriana/AAF-7596-2022; Carillo, Adriana/AFK-0627-2022; Struglia, Maria Vittoria/AAD-6738-2022; Giorgi, Filippo/C-3169-2013; Pisacane, Giovanna/AAX-7244-2021; Herrmann, Marine/F-9740-2018; Sannino, Gianmaria/AAL-8402-2021; Dell'Aquila, Alessandro/E-5582-2017","artale, vincenzo/0000-0003-1116-8856; Struglia, Maria Vittoria/0000-0002-0821-333X; Herrmann, Marine/0000-0001-6125-7238; Dell'Aquila, Alessandro/0000-0002-5498-6966; Carillo, Adriana/0000-0003-4955-3047; Calmanti, Sandro/0000-0002-4382-7687; Pisacane, Giovanna/0000-0003-2619-2664; Sannino, Gianmaria/0000-0002-3985-9432; Pal, Jeremy/0000-0002-5937-0319",EU [036961],EU(European Commission),"The authors wish to thank the anonymous reviewers for very useful suggestions and comments.

It turns a critical eye on Cancun, a leading Caribbean beach tourist destination and battered epicenter of anthropogenic climate change. First, the article contextualizes Cancun's design and construction as a state development project and manufactured tourist city. It describes the city's socio-spatial segregation and highlights the role of hurricanes in processes of beach enclosure. Second, it explores a series of risk maps elaborated as responses to international demands on coastal disaster mitigation and beach erosion. I show how local authorities, academics, and the Mexican state are bound to disregard risk maps to further enclose the Caribbean beach and keep the city productive for tourism. Finally, I look at the adoption of anthropogenic narratives on climate change as tourist attractions in Cancun's Underwater Museum of Art, a unique coalition between conservation, art and tour-operators in the city. I show that turning sea level rise and ocean acidification into tourist spectacles through copyrighted art, this attraction depoliticizes tourism's responsibility in patterns of environmental degradation. The article serves to reflect on the tacit paradoxes that plague efforts to imagine alternative environmental politics and sustainable tourism urbanisms outside neoliberal trends.","[Azcarate, Matilde Cordoba] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Commun, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego,"Azcarate, MC (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Commun, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",mcazcarate@ucsd.edu,,,,,,,48,6,6,6,31,CHANNEL VIEW PUBLICATIONS,CLEVEDON,"FRANKFURT LODGE, CLEVEDON HALL, VICTORIA ROAD, CLEVEDON, BS21 7HH, ENGLAND",0966-9582,1747-7646,,J SUSTAIN TOUR,J.

Observations always evidence a positive feedback, warming leading to release of carbon to the atmosphere; however, the processes at play differ depending on the timescales. State-of-the-art Earth System Models now represent these climate-carbon cycle feedbacks, always simulating a positive feedback over the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, although with substantial uncertainty. Recent studies now help to reduce this uncertainty. First, on short timescales, El Nino years record larger than average atmospheric CO2 growth rate, with tropical land ecosystems being the main drivers. These climate-carbon cycle anomalies can be used as emerging constraint on the tropical land carbon response to future climate change. Second, centennial variability found in last millennium records can be used to constrain the overall global carbon cycle response to climatic excursions. These independent methods point to climate-carbon cycle feedback at the low-end of the Earth System Models range, indicating that these models overestimate the carbon cycle sensitivity to climate change. These new findings also help to attribute the historical land and ocean carbon sinks to increase in atmospheric CO2 and climate change.","[Friedlingstein, Pierre] Univ Exeter, Coll Engn Math & Phys Sci, Exeter EX4 4QE, Devon, England",University of Exeter,"Friedlingstein, P (corresponding author), Univ Exeter, Coll Engn Math & Phys Sci, Exeter EX4 4QE, Devon, England.",p.friedlingstein@exeter.ac.uk,"Friedlingstein, Pierre/H-2700-2014","Friedlingstein, Pierre/0000-0003-3309-4739; Krahe, Charlotte/0000-0002-0620-1263; Paloyelis, Yannis/0000-0002-4029-3720","European Commission [282672, 603864]",European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre),The author was supported by supported by the European Commission's 7th Framework Programme under grant agreements 282672 (EMBRACE) and 603864 (HELIX).,,67,54,55,55,274,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",1364-503X,1471-2962,,PHILOS T R SOC A,Philos.

In the absence of indigenous inhabitants and a human population that excluded all women until the 1960s, these feminist contemporary artists make linkages between the region and issues of climate change to gender, the relation of the human to the non-human, questions of territory, knowledge production, and empire. The intersectional art works of these artists jolt viewers out of routine assumptions about the natural world using the strategies of postmodernism, speculative fiction, the Gothic, and the horror genre.

We argue that many places experience a persistent mismatch between predominantly science-based and technical framings of climatic risk on the one hand, and the place-based understandings of climate extremes and responses of people living in these places on the other. We introduce the case studies presented in this issue and highlight their common focus on 'narratives of change' as one missing link in climate governance. Narratives of change address the past, present and future of a specific place understood as a weather-world, adding a cultural dimension to climate change experienced as a succession of weather and seasons. We focus on memories of extreme weather events and how people coped with them, in order to improve climate governance under future climatic change. We argue that attention to local narratives expands the scope of issues covered by climate information and improves its integration into social and cultural life. We offer up seven lessons for why it is important to incorporate narratives in climate governance and suggest some creative methods for doing so. Post-normal science, art-science cooperation, and the inclusion of the humanities mark the difference that the individual contributions make to the literature about climate governance and democratic decision-making.","[Krauss, Werner] Univ Bremen, Artec Sustainabil Res Ctr, Bremen, Germany; [Bremer, Scott] Univ Bergen, Ctr Study Sci & Humanities, Parkveien 9,Postboks 7805, N-5020 Bergen, Norway",University of Bremen; University of Bergen,"Bremer, S (corresponding author), Univ Bergen, Ctr Study Sci & Humanities, Parkveien 9,Postboks 7805, N-5020 Bergen, Norway.",scott.bremer@uib.no,"Krauß, Werner/AAU-5324-2021","Krauß, Werner/0000-0002-8007-4151",ERA4CS research project CocliServ [274246]; ERC [804150],ERA4CS research project CocliServ; ERC(European Research Council (ERC)European Commission),"The authors, as co-editors of this special issue, want to thank all contributors for their honest, creative and interesting treatment of narratives in climate research.

The ICOsahedral Nonhydrostatic model with Aerosols and Reactive Trace gases (ICON-ART) provides such an environment. Here, we introduce the most up-to-date version of the flexible tracer framework for ICON-ART and explain its application in one numerical weather forecast and one climate related case study. We demonstrate the implementation of idealised tracers and chemistry tendencies of different complexity using the ART infrastructure. Using different ICON physics configurations for weather and climate with ART, we perform integrations on different timescales, illustrating the model's performance. First, we present a hindcast experiment for the 2002 ozone hole split with two different ozone chemistry schemes using the numerical weather prediction physics configuration. We compare the hindcast with observations and discuss the confinement of the vortex split using an idealised tracer diagnostic. Secondly, we study AMIP-type integrations using a simplified chemistry scheme in conjunction with the climate physics configuration. We use two different simulations: the interactive simulation, where modelled ozone is coupled back to the radiation scheme, and the non-interactive simulation that uses a default background climatology of ozone. methane oxidation for the interactive simulation. We discuss the impact of stratospheric ozone and water vapour variations in the interactive and non-interactive integrations on the water vapour tape recorder, as a measure of tropical upwelling changes. Additionally we explain the seasonal evolution and latitudinal distribution of the age of air. The age of air is a measure of the strength of the meridional overturning circulation with young air in the tropical upwelling region and older air in polar winter downwelling regions. We conclude that our flexible tracer framework allows for tailor-made configurations of ICON-ART in weather and climate applications that are easy to configure and run well.","[Schroeter, Jennifer; Rieger, Daniel; Stassen, Christian; Vogel, Heike; Werchner, Sven; Ruhnke, Roland; Vogel, Bernhard; Braesicke, Peter] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Karlsruhe, Germany; [Weimer, Michael] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Steinbuch Ctr Comp, Karlsruhe, Germany; [Rieger, Daniel; Foerstner, Jochen; Pril, Florian; Reinert, Daniel; Zaengl, Guenther] Deutsch Wetterdienst, Offenbach, Germany; [Giorgetta, Marco] Max Planck Inst Meteorol, Hamburg, Germany; [Stassen, Christian] Monash Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Climate Syst Sci, Sch Earth Atmosphere & Environm, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; Max Planck Society; ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science; Monash University,"Schroter, J (corresponding author), Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Karlsruhe, Germany.",jennifer.schroeter@kit.edu; bern-hard.vogel@kit.edu,"Vogel, Bernhard/A-9558-2013; Braesicke, Peter/D-8330-2016; Ruhnke, Roland/J-8800-2012; Stassen, Christian/ABC-3014-2020","Vogel, Bernhard/0000-0002-8894-0165; Braesicke, Peter/0000-0003-1423-0619; Ruhnke, Roland/0000-0002-0353-1603; Weimer, Michael/0000-0002-1004-4002; Stassen, Christian/0000-0002-5407-4297; Reinert, Daniel/0000-0001-6899-5655; Foerstner, Jochen/0000-0002-7989-462X","Ministry of Science, Research and the Arts Baden-Wurttemberg; DFG (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft)","Ministry of Science, Research and the Arts Baden-Wurttemberg; DFG (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft)(German Research Foundation (DFG))","This work was performed on the computational resource ForHLR II funded by the Ministry of Science, Research and the Arts Baden-Wurttemberg and DFG (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft).",,71,10,10,1,4,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1991-959X,1991-9603,,GEOSCI MODEL DEV,Geosci.

However, there is limited research focused on documenting what arts-related pedagogical practices look like in actual classroom settings, particularly in Asia. Drawing on a large dataset of observations conducted in Kindergarten 1 classrooms (4-5 years), this study describes the arts education landscape in Singapore preschools. Findings show that: (1) Certain art forms are commonly observed (e.g., visual arts 2D, singing, and movement) whereas others are rare (e.g., visual arts 3D, dance); (2) Teachers and students engage with the arts in four different types of settings (integrated learning activities, fillers and transitions, learning center time, and art-focused lessons), in which the presence of the various art forms considerably differs; (3) While classroom climate is generally positive and children seem to enjoy engaging with the arts, teachers focus on providing product-oriented instructions rather than fostering children's individual creativity and expression; and (4) Although art activities are frequently available to children, there is limited accessibility to art activities and materials due to the rigidity of schedules. We conclude that while arts education plays an important role in Singapore's preschool education, pedagogical practices-perhaps as a reflection of Asian values and societal expectations- are primarily reproductive and teacher-led. Professional development should enhance teachers' level of preparation to better foster children's free exploration and access to resources, creativity and self-expression, and their confidence to utilize certain art forms more often. These findings enrich the limited classroom-based arts education international literature. Similarities and differences with Western studies are discussed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Climate feedback processes in 2 x CO2 are different from those in 1% CO2, and the equilibrium climate sensitivity (T-2x) in 2 x CO2 is different from the effective climate sensitivity (T-2x,(eff)) in 1% CO2. The difference between T-2x and T-2x,T-eff is from - 1.3 to 1.6 K, a large part of which can be explained by the difference in the ice-albedo and cloud feedback. The largest contribution is cloud SW feedback, and the difference in cloud SW feedback for 2 x CO2 and 1% CO2 could be determined by the distribution of the SAT anomaly which causes differences in the atmospheric thermal structure. An important factor which determines the difference in ice-albedo feedback is the initial sea ice distribution at the Southern Ocean, which is generally overestimated in 2 x CO2 as compared to 1%CO2 and observation. Through the comparison of climate feedback processes in 2 x CO2 and 1%CO2, the possible behaviour of the time evolution of T-2x,T-eff is discussed.","[Yokohata, Tokuta; Emori, Seita; Nozawa, Toru; Ogura, Tomoo] Natl Inst Environm Studies, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Emori, Seita; Kawamiya, Michio; Tsushima, Yoko; Suzuki, Tatsuo; Abe-Ouchi, Ayako] Frontier Res Ctr Global Change, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan; [Yukimoto, Seiji] Meteorol Res Inst, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305, Japan; [Emori, Seita; Abe-Ouchi, Ayako; Hasumi, Hiroyasu; Kimoto, Masahide] Univ Tokyo, Ctr Climate Syst Res, Kashiwa, Chiba, Japan; [Sumi, Akimasa] Transdisciplinary Initiat Global Sustainabil, Tokyo, Japan",National Institute for Environmental Studies - Japan; Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science & Technology (JAMSTEC); Meteorological Research Institute - Japan; University of Tokyo,"Yokohata, T (corresponding author), Natl Inst Environm Studies, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.",yokohata.tokuta@nies.go.jp,"Abe-Ouchi, Ayako/M-6359-2013; kimoto, masahide/P-9077-2014; Emori, Seita/D-1950-2012; Yokohata, Tokuta/N-4540-2019; Kawamiya, Michio/GPS-7720-2022; 小倉, 知夫/I-3502-2018","Abe-Ouchi, Ayako/0000-0003-1745-5952; Yokohata, Tokuta/0000-0001-7346-7988; SUZUKI, TATSUO/0000-0002-6259-6466","21st Century of the Ministry of Education, Sports, Culture, Science and Technology of Japan; Ministry of the Environment of Japan","21st Century of the Ministry of Education, Sports, Culture, Science and Technology of Japan(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); Ministry of the Environment of Japan(Ministry of the Environment, Japan)","We acknowledge the international climate modelling groups, the PCMDI, and WCRP's Working Group on Coupled Modelling for their roles in making available the WCRP's CMIP3 multimodel dataset.

In some studies the monitoring was limited, for longer or shorter periods, to air Temperature and Relative Humidity logging, which can show if extreme values and rates of variation occur. In other cases mechanical monitoring was combined with microclimatic logging, which provides quantitative information directly related to the microclimate; these data are useful to validate mathematical models that eventually may predict the long-term behaviour of the objects. Although the quality of the information obtainable by combined mechanical-hygrothermal monitoring is more directly usable, due to the actual response to the microclimate, using simply logged microclimatic data it is possible to formulate a statistical analysis aimed at defining microclimate variance. Museums all over the world are engaged in lively discussions regarding the long-term conservation of works of art created using hygroscopic materials, which are sensitive to microclimate fluctuations. The climate fluctuations can have both temporary and permanent effects on the hygroscopic objects and they are a potential cause of damage. The current preventive approach is based on a compromise between the technical limitations of the museums' air conditioning plants and the presumed needs of the objects, as determined by conservators and conservation scientists. The primary goal is to keep the climate as stable as possible around standard values, with strict fluctuation ranges usually defined as 20 degrees C +/- 2 and 50% RH +/- 5. There is considerable pressure in favor of widening the allowable ranges, based on the need of a lighter carbon footprint as well as to facilitate the loan of artifacts between institutions. Although we have long-term evidence of the generally positive effects of a microclimate within the standard range of allowable fluctuations, we lack experimental data regarding the effects under broader ranges. Wooden works of art are useful in representing the complexity of possible reactions. Because of the mechanical response caused by thermo-hygrometric conditions, the monitoring of Wooden Objects of Art ( WOAs) in their exhibition and storage environment is important in order to protect them from potential physical/mechanical degradation. Due to the specificity of each artwork, both from its structural point of view and from its previous microclimatic history ( for the most part totally unknown), the analysis of an artifact's response to short-and long-term variations can supply useful information about its individual sensitivity to the exhibition microclimate, suggesting the adoption of more or less rigid parameters. Case studies monitoring wooden objects have been conducted for many years. In some studies, the monitoring was limited, for longer or shorter periods, to air T/RH logging, which can verify if extreme values and types of variation occur. In other cases, mechanical monitoring was combined with microclimatic logging, which provides quantitative information directly related to the microclimate; these data are useful to validate mathematical models that eventually may predict the long-term behavior of the objects. Although the quality of the information obtainable by combined mechanical-hygrothermal monitoring is of higher magnitude, using simply logged microclimatic data makes possible to formulate a statistical analysis aimed at defining microclimate variance, obtaining a very efficient schematization of the greater or lesser stability of the climate according to the presumed lower or higher sensitivity of the artifact under consideration. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate how delicate the widening of allowable ranges is and how misleading a generalized approach can be, while the eventual choices of standards relaxation must be based on careful analysis of the long-term response of the objects.

In 2014, I began convening walking seminars together with the researcher Christian Ernsten and the documentary photographer Dirk-Jan Visser. Each seminar involves a mix of scholars, artists, curators and activists and results in various work: journal articles, musical scores, photographic essays, and creative non-fiction. This chapter sets out the thinking behind the walking seminars, drawing on a variety of sources: recent interventions in the environmental humanities, decolonial thinking and practice, arts-based research methods and ideas around embodied research and the senses. Not least, it draws on the long history of writing about walking as a way through which to engage the world and intervene in social scenarios. As we enter the ambiguous new epoch of the Anthropocene, and as familiar landscapes change and degrade, we need-more than ever-to pay attention, to notice, to take care. For scholars, this arguably involves leaving the 'white cube' of the seminar room for more materially involved and implicated forms of engagement with our research subjects. The humble, everyday act of walking offers one route towards such modes of engagement.","[Shepherd, Nick] Univ Pretoria, Dept Archaeol & Heritage Studies, Aarhus Univ, DK-8000 Aarhus, Central Denmark, Denmark; [Shepherd, Nick] Univ Pretoria, Pretoria, South Africa",Aarhus University; University of Pretoria,"Shepherd, N (corresponding author), Univ Pretoria, Dept Archaeol & Heritage Studies, Aarhus Univ, DK-8000 Aarhus, Central Denmark, Denmark.;Shepherd, N (corresponding author), Univ Pretoria, Pretoria, South Africa.",ns@cas.au.dk,,,Aarhus University Research Foundation,Aarhus University Research Foundation,The author gratefully acknowledges financial support from the Aarhus University Research Foundation.,,37,0,0,3,3,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INDIA  PVT LTD,NEW DELHI,"B-1-I-1 MOHAN CO-OPERATIVE INDUSTRIAL AREA, MATHURA RD, POST BAG NO 7, NEW DELHI 110 044, INDIA",0971-7218,0973-0796,,SCI TECHNOL SOC,Sci.

It takes as its central onbject of concern the shared practice that has made recent art-science collaborations so productive: their mutual interest in reimagining the possibilities of life and the body in an era in which these can be so fundamentally re-engineered, which this paper examines this under the rubric of 'speculative biology'. The multi-disciplinary art projects examined in this paper thus invite us to reflect upon the precarity of life, during a period that finds itself at the crossroads of a rapidly increasing series of extinction and climate change events, on the one hand, and an equally rapidly accelerating scientific and technological capacity to reengineer life and living materials, on the other.","[Stephens, Elizabeth] Univ Queensland, Inst Adv Studies Humanities, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",University of Queensland,"Stephens, E (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Inst Adv Studies Humanities, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",e.stephens@uq.edu.au,"Stephens, Elizabeth/J-1551-2018","Stephens, Elizabeth/0000-0002-9109-1598",Australian Research Council by Future Fellowship [FT170100214],Australian Research Council by Future Fellowship(Australian Research Council),This work was supported by the Australian Research Council by Future Fellowship: FT170100214,,36,0,0,4,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1030-4312,1469-3666,,CONTINUUM-J MEDIA CU,Continuum-J.

This study has examined the context in which climate policy is formulated in Colombia from an actor-oriented perspective. Using a traveling model approach,we analyzed the role of actors at international and national levels in raising climate issues and shaping climate policies. The results showed that the translation chains from several governmental and non-governmental actors increase the visibility of climate issues in Colombia and how such consultations help defining and addressing these issues. The analysis arising from the climate traveling model exposes power struggles between competing agencies: the National Planning Department (DNP), which promoted climate-change adaptation, and the National Disaster Risk Management Unit (UNGRD), which favored disaster risk management. At the end of the translation chains, governmental actors reappropriated the international consultants' interpretations of the issues and solutions within an economic perspective. Hence, adaptation to climate change came to be seen as an economic opportunity or as a way to avoid economic loss. International dominance in the elaboration of climate policies combined with scant involvement of local actors could constitute a challenge for policy implementation and potentially inhibit achieving successful outcomes.","[Howland, Fanny; Le Coq, Jean Francois] Int Ctr Trop Agr CIAT, Km 17 Recta Cali Palmira,Apartado Aereo 6713, Cali, Colombia; [Howland, Fanny; Le Coq, Jean Francois] Int Ctr Trop Agr, CGIAR Res Program Climate Change Agr & Food Secur, Cali, Colombia; [Le Coq, Jean Francois] French Agr Res Ctr Int Dev CIRAD, UMR ART DEV, Campus Lavalette TA 85-15-73,Rue JF Breton, Montpellier 5, France",Alliance; International Center for Tropical Agriculture - CIAT; Alliance; International Center for Tropical Agriculture - CIAT; CGIAR; CIRAD; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Paul-Valery; Universite Perpignan Via Domitia; Universite de Montpellier,"Howland, F (corresponding author), Int Ctr Trop Agr CIAT, Km 17 Recta Cali Palmira,Apartado Aereo 6713, Cali, Colombia.",f.c.howland@cgiar.org,,"Howland, Fanny/0000-0002-0778-2741","ANR [anr-17-ce03-0005]; CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS); CGIAR Fund Donors","ANR(French National Research Agency (ANR)); CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS)(CGIAR); CGIAR Fund Donors(CGIAR)","This work was funded by ANR (anr-17-ce03-0005) and the CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS) , the CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS) , which is carried out with support from CGIAR Fund Donors and through bilateral funding agreements.

To emulate and compare the latest and previous multimodel ensembles, this study establishes a new method to diagnose a set of parameters of effective radiative forcing, feedback, and impulse response functions by fitting a minimal emulator to time series of individual models in response to step- and ramp-shaped CO2 forcing up to a quadrupling concentration level. The diagnosed CO2 forcing is scaled down to a doubling level, leading to an unbiased estimate of equilibrium climate sensitivity. The average climate sensitivity of the latest ensemble is 18% and 13% greater than that of the previous ensemble for equilibrium and transient states. Although these increases are subject to data availability, the latter smaller rate is significant and is consistent with the relationship between feedback strength and response timescales. Plain Language Summary Pathways of climate change mitigation are based on probabilistic warming projections by a simple emulator that mimics an ensemble of state-of-the-art climate models. To gain insights into the latest multimodel ensemble, this study establishes a new method to analyze a set of key parameters to emulate individual models in terms of the global temperature and energy balance in response to changes in the atmospheric CO2 concentration. This method properly estimates the level of CO2 forcing, proportional to global warming, whereas a commonly used conventional method overestimates forcing levels for most mitigation pathways. On average, a common warming measure to a doubled CO2 concentration in the latest multimodel ensemble is 18% and 13% greater than that in the previous ensemble for a final and transient responses, respectively. The latter smaller change can be explained from a fundamental characteristic in a simplified forcing-response framework. Although the differences between the two ensembles are subject to data availability, the difference between the final and transient responses is significant and has implications for mitigation pathways during this century.","[Tsutsui, Junichi] Cent Res Inst Elect Power Ind, Abiko, Chiba, Japan",Central Research Institute of Electric Power Industry - Japan,"Tsutsui, J (corresponding author), Cent Res Inst Elect Power Ind, Abiko, Chiba, Japan.",tsutsui@criepi.denken.or.jp,,,"Integrated Research Program for Advancing Climate Models (TOUGOU) from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), Japan [JPMXD0717935457]","Integrated Research Program for Advancing Climate Models (TOUGOU) from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), Japan","This work was supported by the Integrated Research Program for Advancing Climate Models (TOUGOU) Grant Number JPMXD0717935457 from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), Japan.

The results show that the state-of-the-art global climate models still have significant difficulty in simulating the SEP stratocumulus clouds and associated cloud feedback. Comparing with observations, the models tend to simulate significantly less cloud cover, higher cloud top, and a variety of unrealistic cloud albedo. The insufficient cloud cover leads to overly weak shortwave CRF and net CRF. Only two of the eight models capture the observed positive cloud feedback at subannual to decadal time scales. The cloud and radiation biases in the models are associated with 1) model biases in large-scale temperature structure including the lack of temperature inversion, insufficient lower troposphere stability (LTS), and insufficient reduction of LTS with local SST warming, and 2) improper model physics, especially insufficient increase of low cloud cover associated with larger LTS. The two models that arguably do best at simulating the stratocumulus clouds and associated cloud feedback are the only ones using cloud-top radiative cooling to drive boundary layer turbulence.","[Lin, Jia-Lin; Qian, Taotao] Ohio State Univ, Dept Geog, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Shinoda, Toshiaki] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Phys & Environm Sci, Corpus Christi, TX USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; Texas A&M University System,"Lin, JL (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, Dept Geog, 1036 Derby Hall,154 North Oval Mall, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",lin.789@osu.edu,"Shinoda, Toshiaki/J-3745-2016; Shinoda, Toshiaki/S-1721-2019; Lin, Jiayuh/E-3515-2011; Keyes, Dennis/AAZ-9285-2021","Shinoda, Toshiaki/0000-0003-1416-2206; Shinoda, Toshiaki/0000-0003-1416-2206; ","NOAA Climate Program Office Modeling, Analysis, Predictions and Projections (MAPP) Program as part of the CMIP5 Task Force [GC10-400]; NASA MAP Program; NSF [ATM-0745872]; NOAA CPO MAPP; ESS [GC10-400, NA11OAR4310110]; ONR/LASP project [601153N]","NOAA Climate Program Office Modeling, Analysis, Predictions and Projections (MAPP) Program as part of the CMIP5 Task Force; NASA MAP Program(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NOAA CPO MAPP; ESS; ONR/LASP project","We highly appreciate the very insightful reviews from three anonymous reviewers, which significantly improved the manuscript.

Parliament and Council and seeks to analyse what the outcome of this case reveals about barriers to climate litigation, and public interest environmental suits in general, in the EU legal order. In response to this application for annulment under art. 263 TFEU, the Court held that the far-reaching nature of the effects of climate change exclude that they may give rise to an 'individual concern' such that neither individuals nor environmental NGOs have standing to challenge whether EU climate legislation sufficiently protects fundamental rights threatened by climate change. This outcome renews questions about whether the EU legal order provides adequate and effective access to justice in environmental matters, and what reforms may be needed to bring the EU into compliance with its duty to provide effective access to justice in accordance with art. 9 of the 1998 Aarhus Convention. Examining these issues and placing this case within the climate justice movement, this work considers possible reforms to bring the EU into compliance with the Aarhus Convention, and what the outcome in Carvalho and others may mean for future climate litigation before EU courts.","[Harris, Morgan Eleanor] Libera Univ Maria Ss Assunta LUMSA, Dipartimento Giurisprudenza Econ Polit & Lingue M, Via Marcantonio Colonna 19, I-00192 Rome, Italy",Universita LUMSA,"Harris, ME (corresponding author), Libera Univ Maria Ss Assunta LUMSA, Dipartimento Giurisprudenza Econ Polit & Lingue M, Via Marcantonio Colonna 19, I-00192 Rome, Italy.",m.harris@lumsa.it,,"Harris, Morgan Eleanor/0000-0003-0047-791X",,,,,27,0,0,0,3,SOC ED IL MULINO,BOLOGNA,"STRADA MAGGIORE 37, 40125 BOLOGNA, ITALY",1971-7105,1972-5485,,DIRITTI UMANI DIRITT,Diritti Umani Diritto Int.,JAN-APR,2020,1,,,,175,193,,10.12829/96813,http://dx.doi.org/10.12829/96813,,,19,International Relations; Law,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),International Relations; Government & Law,LR9VW,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000536043700009,View Full Record in Web of Science

The climate-change scenarios analysed are the result of 19 regional climate model (RCM) runs obtained for the period 2070-2099 based on two different greenhouse-gas emission scenarios (the A2 and B2 scenarios defined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) and on three different coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs), namely HadCM3. ECHAM4/OPYC3 and ARPEGE/OPA. The hydrological response of the study catchments to the climate scenarios is simulated through a conceptual reservoir-based precipitation-runoff transformation model called GSM-SCCONT. For the glacierized catchments, the glacier surface corresponding to these future scenarios is updated through a conceptual glacier surface evolution model. The results obtained show that all climate-change scenarios induce. in all catchments, an earlier start of the snowmelt period, leading to a shift of the hydrological regimes and of the maximum monthly discharges. The mean annual runoff decreases significantly in most cases. For the glacierized catchments, the simulated regime modifications are mainly due to an increase of the mean temperature and the corresponding impacts on the snow accumulation and melting processes. The hydrological regime of the catchments located at lower altitudes is more strongly affected by the changes of the seasonal precipitation. For a given emission scenario. the simulated regime modifications of all catchments are highly variable for the different RCM runs. This variability is induced by the driving AOGCM but also in large part by the inter-RCM variability. The differences between the different RCM runs are so important that the predicted climate-change impacts for the two emission scenarios A2 and B2 are overlapping.

Climate vulnerability and gender inequality may increase due to climate change. Women may, thus, face specific conditions of vulnerability in society and daily livelihood. This paper focuses on investigating factors that influence women's vulnerability from climate change, their adaptations, and the importance of women empowerment to reduce their inequality in SWCRB. This study also emphasizes gender inequality caused by climate change, and looks at accommodations for women to reduce hostile influences of climate change. From the 9 unions in SWCRB, a total of 320 household respondents were randomly selected to complete a questionnaire. The results of the statistical analysis showed that most of the survey's perimeter has significant. Interviews, case studies, focus group discussions, workshops, and key informant interviews were also conducted from 12 unions, and it was found that climate change impacts men and women differently, with women being more vulnerable than men. Through case study this paper investigated the main factors influencing the vulnerability of women. In terms of empowerment women may also be well positioned to lead adaptation efforts alongside men, as this analysis represent that gender inequalities are leading by social norms. Women being more vulnerable both in short-term i.e., major natural disasters, cyclones, flood, and long-term i.e., sea level rise, salinity intrusion in water and soil, land erosion, droughts, climatic events, as they enhance gender inequalities. Further, gender inequality is seen in illiteracy, food shortages and poor health conditions, traditional norms, religious taboos, and patriarchy. Moreover, gender-based economic opportunities, women's mobility, and income are changing, while household authority relations and gender-based socio-economic, cultural, and institutional constraints remain. This study examines the increased vulnerability of women in SWCRB to climate change, which can be mitigated through women empowerment; female involvement with environmentally friendly stoves, rural electrification and renewable energy development, microfinancing, and nakshikantha. (Nakshikantha is a special type of sewing art that is made by creating designs with different types of colored threads on plain stitches). Lastly, women may also lead adaptation efforts alongside men, make decisions, and promote their participation.","[Ashrafuzzaman, Md] Univ Lisbon, Climate Change & Sustainable Dev Policies, P-1600189 Lisbon, Portugal; [Ashrafuzzaman, Md; Gomes, Carla] Univ Lisbon, Inst Social Sci, P-1600189 Lisbon, Portugal; [Ashrafuzzaman, Md; Cerda, Artemi] Univ Valencia, Dept Geog, Valencia 46010, Spain; [Ashrafuzzaman, Md] Univ Chittagong, Dept Anthropol, Chattogram 4331, Bangladesh; [Ashrafuzzaman, Md] Univ East Anglia, Climate Change Dept, Norwich Res Pk, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Dias, Joao Miguel] Univ Aveiro, Phys Dept, CESAM, Campus Univ Santiago, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal","Universidade de Lisboa; Institute of Social Sciences, University of Lisbon (ICS-UL); Universidade de Lisboa; University of Valencia; University of Chittagong; University of East Anglia; Universidade de Aveiro","Ashrafuzzaman, M (corresponding author), Univ Lisbon, Climate Change & Sustainable Dev Policies, P-1600189 Lisbon, Portugal.;Ashrafuzzaman, M (corresponding author), Univ Lisbon, Inst Social Sci, P-1600189 Lisbon, Portugal.;Ashrafuzzaman, M (corresponding author), Univ Valencia, Dept Geog, Valencia 46010, Spain.;Ashrafuzzaman, M (corresponding author), Univ Chittagong, Dept Anthropol, Chattogram 4331, Bangladesh.;Ashrafuzzaman, M (corresponding author), Univ East Anglia, Climate Change Dept, Norwich Res Pk, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",md.a@edu.ulisboa.pt,,"Ashrafuzzaman, Md./0000-0003-2187-6549","Climate Change and Sustainable Development Policies, University of Lisbon, Lisbon, Portugal; CESAM by FCT/MCTES [UIDP/50017/2020+UIDB/50017/2020+LA/P/0094/2020]","Climate Change and Sustainable Development Policies, University of Lisbon, Lisbon, Portugal; CESAM by FCT/MCTES(Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology)","This work was funded by Climate Change and Sustainable Development Policies, University of Lisbon, Lisbon, Portugal.

The postglacial rebound and consequent land uplift have caused a continuous displacement of the shoreline, now situating the earliest rock art panels up to 26 m above sea level. By examining the rock surfaces at Hjemmeluft and other sites, using field observations and geological analyses, we found that the pronounced red bedrock surfaces in the current seashore zone are composed of inorganic iron films related to a high content of magnetite in the native sandstone. Coupled with an interpretation of regional environmental history, we also found that it is highly likely that the rock art was originally carved on rocks with red iron films, rocks that are now generally gray. Due to the land uplift and subsequent covering of the rock art with lichen, moss, and turf, the red color has waned at the rock art sites. This knowledge may renew interpretation and understanding of the location of rock art in Alta and may have implications for conservation and management.","[Tansem, Karin] UiT Arctic Univ Norway, Dept Archaeol Hist Religious Studies & Theol, Tromso, Norway; [Tansem, Karin] Alta Museum, World Heritage Rock Art Ctr, Sect Rock Art & World Heritage, Altaveien 19, N-9518 Alta, Norway; [Storemyr, Per] Archaeol & Conservat Serv, Hyllestad, Norway",UiT The Arctic University of Tromso,"Tansem, K (corresponding author), Alta Museum, World Heritage Rock Art Ctr, Sect Rock Art & World Heritage, Altaveien 19, N-9518 Alta, Norway.",kata@altamuseum.no,"Storemyr, Per/AAA-4203-2022",,Norwegian Research Council; World Heritage Rock Art Centre -Alta Museum,Norwegian Research Council(Research Council of NorwayEuropean Commission); World Heritage Rock Art Centre -Alta Museum,"Much appreciation is extended to Ingunn Thorseth, University of Bergen (for SEM/EDS analyses), and Torbjorg Bjelland, University of Stavanger (for aid in lichen determination).

Advance warning of meteorological conditions from seasonal climate models can therefore potentially anticipate unusually strong epidemic events, building resilience and adapting to possible changes in the frequency of such events. Here we present validation of a process-based, dynamic malaria model driven by hindcasts from a state-of-the-art seasonal climate model from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. We validate the climate and malaria models against observed meteorological and incidence data for Botswana over the period 1982-2006; the longest record of observed incidence data which has been used to validate a modeling system of this kind. We consider the impact of climate model biases, the relationship between climate and epidemiological predictability and the potential for skillful malaria forecasts. Forecast skill is demonstrated for upper tercile malaria incidence for the Botswana malaria season (January-May), using forecasts issued at the start of November; the forecast system anticipates six out of the seven upper tercile malaria seasons in the observational period. The length of the validation time series gives confidence in the conclusion that it is possible to make reliable forecasts of seasonal malaria risk, forming a key part of a health early warning system for Botswana and contributing to efforts to adapt to climate change.","[MacLeod, Dave A.] Univ Oxford, Dept Phys, Atmospher Ocean & Planetary Phys, Oxford, England; [Jones, Anne; Caminade, Cyril; Morse, Andrew P.] Univ Liverpool, Dept Geog & Planning, Sch Environm Sci, Liverpool L69 3BX, Merseyside, England; [Di Giuseppe, Francesca] European Ctr Medium Range Weather Forecasts, Reading RG2 9AX, Berks, England; [Caminade, Cyril] Univ Liverpool, Dept Epidemiol & Populat Hlth, Inst Infect & Global Hlth, Liverpool L69 3BX, Merseyside, England; [Morse, Andrew P.] NIHR, Hlth Protect Res Unit Emerging & Zoonot Infect, Liverpool, Merseyside, England",University of Oxford; University of Liverpool; European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF); University of Liverpool,"MacLeod, DA (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Dept Phys, Atmospher Ocean & Planetary Phys, Oxford, England.",macleod@atm.ox.ac.uk,,"MacLeod, Dave/0000-0001-5504-6450; Di Giuseppe, Francesca/0000-0001-9829-0429; Morse, Andrew/0000-0002-0413-2065; Caminade, Cyril/0000-0002-3846-7082",NERC [NE/H524757/1]; European Union FP7 project Quantifying Weather and Climate Impacts on Health in Developing Countries (QWeCI) [243964]; European Union FP7 project HEALTHY FUTURES [266327]; End-to-End Quantification of Uncertainty for Impacts Prediction (EQUIP) Natural Environmental Research Council [NE/H003487/1]; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/H003487/1] Funding Source: researchfish; NERC [NE/H003487/1] Funding Source: UKRI,NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); European Union FP7 project Quantifying Weather and Climate Impacts on Health in Developing Countries (QWeCI); European Union FP7 project HEALTHY FUTURES; End-to-End Quantification of Uncertainty for Impacts Prediction (EQUIP) Natural Environmental Research Council; Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"The authors would like to jointly thank Madeline Thomson (IRI) for providing the extended Botswana dataset, as well as the anonymous reviewers, whose comments helped improve the manuscript.

It responds to scholarship emphasizing the importance of connecting disparate ways of knowing, including scientific, artistic, embodied and local knowledges to better understand environmental change and to foster community resilience and engagement. This paper draws on the experience of an arts-based project in Lisbon, Portugal, and explores embodied and performative practices and their potential for climate change transformations. It puts forward and enlivens an example, where such forms of engaging communities can provide new insight into how equitable, just and sustainable transformations can come about. The process involved a series of interactive workshops with diverse arts-based methods and embodied practices to create performative material. From this process, a space emerged for the creation of meaning about climate change. Three key elements stood out in this process as being potentially important for the emergence of meaning-making and for understanding the impact of the project: the use of metaphors, embedding the project locally, and the use of creative, embodied practices. This furthers research, suggesting that the arts can play a critical role in engaging people with new perspectives on climate change and sustainability issues by offering opportunities for critical reflection and providing spaces for creative imagination and experimentation. Such processes may be important for contributing to the changes needed to realize transformations to sustainability.","[Bentz, Julia; Corso, Sara Dal] Univ Nova Lisboa, Colegio Almada Negreiros, CICS NOVA Interdisciplinary Ctr Social Sci, Campus Campolide, P-1070312 Lisbon, Portugal; [Bentz, Julia; Corso, Sara Dal] Univ Lisbon, Fac Sci, Ctr Ecol Evolut & Environm Changes ce3c, Bldg C1,4th Floor,Room 38, P-1749016 Lisbon, Portugal; [do Carmo, Leticia; Corso, Sara Dal] Univ Porto FAUP, Ctr Estudos Arquitectura & Urbanismo CEAU, Ctr Comunicacao & Representacao Espacial CCRE, Fac Arquitectura, Via Panoramica S-N, P-4150564 Porto, Portugal; [Schafenacker, Nicole; Corso, Sara Dal] Univ Northern British Columbia, Hlth Arts Res Ctr, Dr Donald R Rix Northern Hlth Sci Ctr, Room 9-380,3333 Univ Way, Prince George, BC V2N 4Z9, Canada; [Schirok, Joern; Corso, Sara Dal] Osnabruck Univ, Inst Geog, D-49069 Osnabruck, Germany",Universidade Nova de Lisboa; Universidade de Lisboa; Universidade do Porto; University of Northern British Columbia; University Osnabruck,"Bentz, J (corresponding author), Univ Nova Lisboa, Colegio Almada Negreiros, CICS NOVA Interdisciplinary Ctr Social Sci, Campus Campolide, P-1070312 Lisbon, Portugal.;Bentz, J (corresponding author), Univ Lisbon, Fac Sci, Ctr Ecol Evolut & Environm Changes ce3c, Bldg C1,4th Floor,Room 38, P-1749016 Lisbon, Portugal.",juliabentz@gmail.com,"Bentz, Julia/M-3774-2015","Bentz, Julia/0000-0001-5120-9371",Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [SFRH/BPD/115656/2016]; local perish Junta de Freguesia do Lumiar; University of Osnabruck; Norwegian Research Council; AdaptationCONNECTS project [250434],Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology(Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology); local perish Junta de Freguesia do Lumiar; University of Osnabruck; Norwegian Research Council(Research Council of NorwayEuropean Commission); AdaptationCONNECTS project,"We would like to thank the participants of the Climate Odyssey who contributed with their authenticity, care, and openness to the success of this project.

In this study, the representation of drought persistence in GCMs is assessed by comparing state-of-the-art GCM model simulations to observation-based data sets. For doing so, we consider dry-to-dry transition probabilities at monthly and annual scales as estimates for drought persistence, where a dry status is defined as negative precipitation anomaly. Though there is a substantial spread in the drought persistence bias, most of the simulations show systematic underestimation of drought persistence at global scale. Subsequently, we analyzed to which degree (i) inaccurate observations, (ii) differences among models, (iii) internal climate variability, and (iv) uncertainty of the employed statistical methods contribute to the spread in drought persistence errors using an analysis of variance approach. The results show that at monthly scale, model uncertainty and observational uncertainty dominate, while the contribution from internal variability is small in most cases. At annual scale, the spread of the drought persistence error is dominated by the statistical estimation error of drought persistence, indicating that the partitioning of the error is impaired by the limited number of considered time steps. These findings reveal systematic errors in the representation of drought persistence in current GCMs and suggest directions for further model improvement.","[Moon, H.; Gudmundsson, L.; Seneviratne, S.

Ballard's 1962 novel The Drowned World to Paulo Bacigalupi's The Drowned Cities, published in 2012; visual representations from Gustave Dore's The New Zealander in 1872 to Alexis Rockman's 2004 Manifest Destiny; and architectural conjecture, from Wolf Hilbertz's Autopia Ampere project from 1970 onwards to CRAB Studio's Soak City in 2009. The article draws out how these imaginaries intersect with theoretical understandings of science fiction and ecology, contending that an emphasis on multiple imaginaries of climate change is critical to expanding the narrow range of possibilities that currently characterize the literature on cities and climate change. Imaginative texts, images and designs mutually inform each other to encourage holistic ways of approaching how we think about the prospect of urban submergence and to incubate radical responses to it.","[Dobraszczyk, Paul] Bartlett Sch Architecture, 22 Gordon St, London WC1H 0QB, England",University of London; University College London,"Dobraszczyk, P (corresponding author), Bartlett Sch Architecture, 22 Gordon St, London WC1H 0QB, England.",p.dobraszczyk@ucl.ac.uk,,"Dobraszczyk, Paul/0000-0002-8600-7523",Independent Social Research Foundation,Independent Social Research Foundation,"The work presented here forms part of a larger independent research project on urban futures and the imagination, supported in its early stages by an Independent Scholar Research Fellowship from the Independent Social Research Foundation.

The model is based on findings from art perception and environmental psychology, which indicate that the response of the viewer to the artwork is (1) first an emotional reaction, which can be positive and/or negative. The emotional activation leads to (2) evaluation of the perceived quality of the artwork. This forms the first impression of the artwork the viewer gets, which then triggers (3) reflections on the artwork that are finally related to support for climate policies. The model test uses data collected at the ArtCOP21 that accompanied the 21(st) UN climate summit in Paris. At 37 connected events, the research team collected 883 audience responses with a brief quantitative paper-pencil questionnaire. The data were analyzed using a multilevel-structural equation modeling approach. Results support the suggested theoretical model. Moreover, the effect of reflections on the artwork on support for climate policies is moderated by environmental attitudes, meaning the lower the environmental attitudes, the higher the effect of reflections on policy support. Finally, artwork features like color, size, displaying something personal, etc., could be identified that had a significant relation to differences on the artwork level regarding the first impression of the artwork and the reflections elicited. The study shows that being confronted with climate change-related artwork relates at least in the short run to increased climate policy support, which is mostly channeled through an emotional activation with following cognitive processing. Features of the artwork relate to how strongly and which emotions are activated.","[Klockner, Christian Andreas; Sommer, Laura K.] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Psychol, Trondheim, Norway",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Klockner, CA (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Psychol, Trondheim, Norway.",Christian.Klockner@ntnu.no,,", Laura/0000-0002-2046-3489; Klockner, Christian A./0000-0003-4510-1748",Norwegian Research Council [235223],Norwegian Research Council(Research Council of NorwayEuropean Commission),"This research was funded to CAK by the Norwegian Research Council (www.nfr.no) in the Climart project (project number 235223).

The prediction of monsoons and associated climate features is a major challenge in seasonal time scale climate forecast. In this study, a comprehensive assessment of the interannual predictability of the WNP summer climate has been performed using the 1-month lead retrospective forecasts (hindcasts) of five state-of-the-art coupled models from ENSEMBLES for the period of 1960-2005. Spatial distribution of the temporal correlation coefficients shows that the interannual variation of precipitation is well predicted around the Maritime Continent and east of the Philippines. The high skills for the lower-tropospheric circulation and sea surface temperature (SST) spread over almost the whole WNP. These results indicate that the models in general successfully predict the interannual variation of the WNP summer climate. Two typical indices, the WNP summer precipitation index and the WNP lower-tropospheric circulation index (WNPMI), have been used to quantify the forecast skill. The correlation coefficient between five models' multi-model ensemble (MME) mean prediction and observations for the WNP summer precipitation index reaches 0.66 during 1979-2005 while it is 0.68 for the WNPMI during 1960-2005. The WNPMI-regressed anomalies of lower-tropospheric winds, SSTs and precipitation are similar between observations and MME. Further analysis suggests that prediction reliability of the WNP summer climate mainly arises from the atmosphere-ocean interaction over the tropical Indian and the tropical Pacific Ocean, implying that continuing improvement in the representation of the air-sea interaction over these regions in CGCMs is a key for long-lead seasonal forecast over the WNP and East Asia. On the other hand, the prediction of the WNP summer climate anomalies exhibits a remarkable spread resulted from uncertainty in initial conditions. The summer anomalies related to the prediction spread, including the lower-tropospheric circulation, SST and precipitation anomalies, show a Pacific-Japan or East Asia-Pacific pattern in the meridional direction over the WNP. Our further investigations suggest that the WNPMI prediction spread arises mainly from the internal dynamics in air-sea interaction over the WNP and Indian Ocean, since the local relationships among the anomalous SST, circulation, and precipitation associated with the spread are similar to those associated with the interannual variation of the WNPMI in both observations and MME. However, the magnitudes of these anomalies related to the spread are weaker, ranging from one third to a half of those anomalies associated with the interannual variation of the WNPMI in MME over the tropical Indian Ocean and subtropical WNP. These results further support that the improvement in the representation of the air-sea interaction over the tropical Indian Ocean and subtropical WNP in CGCMs is a key for reducing the prediction spread and for improving the long-lead seasonal forecast over the WNP and East Asia.","[Li, Chaofan; Lu, Riyu] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, State Key Lab Numer Modelling Atmospher Sci & Geo, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Dong, Buwen] Univ Reading, Dept Meteorol, Natl Ctr Atmospher Sci Climate, Reading, Berks, England","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); NERC National Centre for Atmospheric Science; University of Reading","Lu, RY (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, State Key Lab Numer Modelling Atmospher Sci & Geo, POB 9804, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.",lr@mail.iap.ac.cn,"Li, Chaofan/D-2735-2017","Li, Chaofan/0000-0001-5157-5427; Dong, Buwen/0000-0003-0809-7911","National Natural Science Foundation of China [40810059005, 40821092, 40975046]; UK National Centre for Atmospheric Science-Climate (NCAS-Climate) at the University of Reading; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/I006672/1, ncas10009] Funding Source: researchfish; NERC [NE/I006672/1] Funding Source: UKRI",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); UK National Centre for Atmospheric Science-Climate (NCAS-Climate) at the University of Reading; Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"We thank two anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments.

The former are dominated by the effect of temperature during the colder months of the year, with the energy demand increasing as the temperature decreases. Warming of the UK climate under the influence of anthropogenic forcings is therefore expected to lead to a reduction in domestic energy consumption. Here, we present an end-to-end attribution study that investigates whether the anthropogenic effect on consumption is already evident in the United Kingdom. We analyse data of gas and electricity use in UK households during 2008-2019 and use a simple linear model to express the temperature dependence. Uncertainties in the resulting transfer functions are derived with a recent methodology, originally introduced for downscaling purposes, but adapted here for use in impact studies. The transfer functions are applied to temperature data from simulations with and without the effect of human influence on the climate, generated by 11 state-of-the-art climate models. We thus assess the anthropogenic impact on energy consumption during the reference period by comparing it with what it might have been in a climate without anthropogenic climate change, but at the same level of adaptation. We find that without human influence on the climate, UK households would consume on average about 1,400 kWh more per year, which would increase the annual energy bills by about 70 GBP. Our attribution assessment provides useful evidence of an impact that has already emerged, which can help inform UK's adaptation plans as the climate continues to warm.","[Christidis, Nikolaos; McCarthy, Mark; Stott, Peter A.] Met Off, Hadley Ctr, FitzRoy Rd, Exeter EX1 3PB, Devon, England",Met Office - UK; Hadley Centre,"Christidis, N (corresponding author), Met Off, Hadley Ctr, FitzRoy Rd, Exeter EX1 3PB, Devon, England.",nikos.christidis@metoffice.gov.uk,,,Defra (Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme); BEIS,Defra (Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme); BEIS,BEIS and Defra (Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme),,31,1,1,1,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1530-261X,,,ATMOS SCI LETT,Atmos.

Whether this would lead to identifiable near-term responses in iconic climate quantities of wide scientific and public interest is unclear, because the climate response would be obscured by quasi-random internal variability. I define the climate response as an increase or decrease in a linear climate trend over the period 2021-2035, compared to 2006-2020, and establish the probability of such a trend change being caused by an assumed policy shift toward emissions reductions after 2020. I quantify the irreducible uncertainty in projecting such a trend change through very large (100-member) ensembles of the state-of-the-art climate model MPI-ESM-LR. Trends in global-mean surface temperature (GMST) are higher over the period 2021-2035 than over 2006-2020 in one-third of all realizations in the mitigation scenario RCP2.6, interpreted as implementing the Paris agreement, compared to around one-half in the no-mitigation scenario RCP4.5. Mitigation is sufficient to cause a GMST trend reduction with a probability of 0.40 and necessary with a probability of 0.33. Trend increases in Arctic September sea-ice area and the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation are caused by the emissions reductions with a probability of only around 0.1. By contrast, emissions reductions are necessary for a trend decrease in upper-ocean heat content with a probability of over one-half. Some iconic climate quantities might thus by year 2035 exhibit an identifiable response to a successful Paris agreement but sometimes with low probability, creating a substantial communication challenge.

Thirty-two data types are evaluated for their potential for improving a 50-y surface air temperature trend prediction with data from earlier periods, with an emphasis on 20 y. Data types can be ordered in terms of their ability to increase the precision of a forecast. Results show that important conclusions can follow from this ordering. The small size of the IPCC model ensemble (20 members) creates uncertainties in these conclusions, which need to be substantiated with the larger ensembles expected in the future.

The data generated by each model simulation amount to Terabytes of data, and demand fast and scalable methods to process them. In this context, we propose a new process of analysis aimed at discriminating between the temporal behavior of the data generated by climate models and the real climate observations gathered from ground-based meteorological station networks. Our approach combines fractal data analysis and the monitoring of real and model-generated data streams to detect deviations on the intrinsic correlation among the time series defined by different climate variables. Our measurements were made using series from a regional climate model and the corresponding real data from a network of sensors from meteorological stations existing in the analyzed region. The results show that our approach can correctly discriminate the data either as real or as simulated, even when statistical tests fail. Those results suggest that there is still room for improvement of the state-of-the-art climate change models, and that the fractal-based concepts may contribute for their improvement, besides being a fast, parallelizable, and scalable approach.","[Nunes, Santiago A.; Traina Jr, Caetano; Cordeiro, Robson L.

The application of climate adaptive building shells (CABS) has recently been put forward as a promising alternative within this strive for higher levels of sustainability in the built environment. Compared to conventional facades, CABS offer potential opportunities for energy savings as well improvement of indoor environmental quality. By combining the complementary beneficial aspects of both active and passive building technologies into the building envelope, CABS can draw upon the concepts of adaptability, multi-ability and evolvability. The aim of this paper is to present a comprehensive review of research, design and development efforts in the field of CABS. Based on a structured literature review, a classification of 44 CABS is made to place the variety of concepts in context with each other, and concurrent developments. In doing so, the overall motivations, enabling technologies, and characteristic features that have contributed to the development of CABS are highlighted. Despite the positive perspectives, it was found that the concept of CABS cannot yet be considered mature. Future research needs and further challenges to be resolved are therefore identified as well.

This paper details the findings from an international review of state-of-the-art knowledge concerning climate risks, and adaptation responses, for ports and their supply chains. Evidence from both academic and gray literature indicates that there has already been major damage and disruption to ports across the world from climate-related hazards and that such impacts are projected to increase in the years and decades to come. Findings indicate that while a substantial-and growing-body of scientific evidence on coastal risks and potential adaptation options is acting as a stimulus for port authorities to explicitly consider the risks for their assets and operations, only a notable few have actually made the next step toward implementing adaptation strategies. This paper concludes by putting forward constructive recommendations for the sector and suggestions for research to address remaining knowledge gaps. It emphasizes a call for collaboration between the research and practice communities, as well as the need to engage a broad range of stakeholders in the adaptation planning process.

Together with professional competences regarding the selection of a harmonized and attractive art repertoire, preparation and rehearsing of the interpretation of the work, and the musical performance, the leads of art ensembles must possess pedagogical-psychological didactic-methodical competences. Those include communication, social, analytical, and developmental competences, as well as a whole range of desirable personality traits: enthusiasm, patience, empathy, understanding, calmness, patience, etc. Apart from the aforementioned competences, special emphasis is placed on the importance and numerous other competences that enable the leads of art ensembles to successfully deal with administrative duties, build interpersonal relationships, motivate and guide the group, plan and organize concerts, and to ensure the recognisability of the ensemble. In order to determine the importance of the competences of art ensembles' leads, a semi-structured interview with fifteen leads of award-winning choirs was conducted to examine the possibility of implementing certain knowledge and skills in art studies programmes. The research results have shown that the leads are aware of the complexity of competences important for their successful work with choirs. In addition to professional and pedagogic competences, the leads emphasize the need to create a good social climate in the choir as well as good communication, and emphasize the importance of building a common vision for the ensemble's future and creating conditions for choir's good reputation. They point to the need for developing organizational skills for arranging performances and competitions. As a significant competence, they emphasize the ability to find opportunities to try out the quality of the choir and further affirm it. The leads also emphasize the need to implement different knowledge related to solving numerous administrative duties related to budget planning and control. The conducted research actualized the need for implementation of managerial competences in professional development programmes for music pedagogues and the curricula of art study programmes, so that the leads of different art ensembles are strengthened with additional competences and can more successfully respond to the challenges and needs of the new era.","[Skojo, Tihana] JJ Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Acad Arts Osijek, Osijek, Croatia; [Jukic, Renata] JJ Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Humanities & Social Sci, Osijek, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek; University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Skojo, T (corresponding author), JJ Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Acad Arts Osijek, Osijek, Croatia.",tihana.skojo@skojo.hr; rjukic@ffos.hr,,,,,,,24,0,0,1,3,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1847-0408,,,INTERDISC MANAG RES,,,2018,,,,,897,911,,,,,,15,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM9DQ,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000470808300050,View Full Record in Web of Science

On the decadal to millennial timescales over which hydrate-sourced methane release is hypothesized to occur, several processes consuming methane below and above the seafloor have the potential to slow, reduce or even prevent such release. Yet, the modulating effect of these processes on seafloor methane emissions remains poorly quantified, and the full impact of benthic methane consumption on ocean carbon chemistry is still to be explored. In this review, we document the dynamic interplay between hydrate thermodynamics, benthic transport and biogeochemical reaction processes, that ultimately determines the impact of hydrate destabilisation on seafloor methane emissions and the ocean carbon cycle. Then, we provide an overview of how state-of-the-art numerical models treat such processes and examine their ability to quantify hydrate-sourced methane emissions from the seafloor, as well as their impact on benthic biogeochemical cycling. We discuss the limitations of current models in coupling the dynamic interplay between hydrate thermodynamics and the different reaction and transport processes that control the efficiency of the benthic sink, and highlight their shortcoming in assessing the full implication of methane release on ocean carbon cycling. Finally, we recommend that current Earth system models explicitly account for hydrate driven benthic-pelagic exchange fluxes to capture potential hydrate-carbon cycle-climate feed-backs.","[De La Fuente, Maria; Arndt, Sandra] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Dept Geosci Environm & Soc DGES, BGeoSys, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Marin-Moreno, Hector] Norwegian Geotech Inst, PB 3930 Ulleval Stadion, N-0806 Oslo, Norway; [Minshull, Tim A.] Univ Southampton, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci, European Way, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, England","Universite Libre de Bruxelles; Norwegian Geotechnical Institute, NGI; NERC National Oceanography Centre; University of Southampton","De La Fuente, M (corresponding author), Univ Libre Bruxelles, Dept Geosci Environm & Soc DGES, BGeoSys, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.",maria.de.la.fuente.ruiz@ulb.be; sandra.arndt@ulb.be; hector.marin.moreno@ngi.no; tmin@noc.soton.ac.uk,"; Minshull, Timothy/D-1147-2010","Marin-Moreno, Hector/0000-0002-3412-1359; Minshull, Timothy/0000-0002-8202-1379; DE LA FUENTE RUIZ, MARIA/0000-0002-5688-1877",European Union [77342]; Research Council of Norway; Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique de Belgique (F.R.S.-FNRS) [2.5020.11]; Walloon Region,European Union(European Commission); Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway); Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique de Belgique (F.R.S.-FNRS)(Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique - FNRS); Walloon Region,"We thank Paul Wilson, Eelco Rohling, Bablu Sinha and Tina Treude for their contributions to the original development of the project that became FIESTA.

To illustrate the capability of our proposed algorithm, we benchmark its performance with other state-of-the-art climate classification techniques.

Our results exhibit that our proposed method performs a more realistic climate classification with less computational time. It can save more information during the climate classification process and is therefore efficient in further data analysis.

The 99th, 99.9th and 99.99th percentiles of daily precipitation in the models were compared with those in the recently released E-OBS observational database for winter, spring, summer and autumn. The majority of the models overestimated the values of the precipitation extremes compared with E-OBS, on average by approximately 38%, but some models exceeded 50%. To measure model performance, a simple metric is proposed that averages a nonlinear function of the seasonal biases over the European area. The sensitivity of the metric to different assumptions in the construction and the quality of the observational data was explored. Generally, low sensitivities of the metric to spatial and seasonal averaging were found. However, large sensitivities to potential biases in the observational database were found. An alternative metric that measures the spatial pattern of the extremes (which is not sensitive to a potential constant offset in the observational data) was further explored. With this metric, the ranking between the models changed substantially. However, the 2 models with the worst score in the standard metric also displayed the worst scores with this alternative metric. Finally, the regional climate models displayed the largest biases compared with E-OBS in areas where the underlying station density used in E-OBS is low, thus suggesting that data quality is indeed an important issue. In summary, the results show that: (1) there is no metric that guarantees an objective and precise ranking or weighting of the models, (2) by exploring different metrics it nevertheless appears possible to indentify models that perform consistently worse than other models, and (3) the observational data quality should be considered when designing and interpreting metrics.",,,"Lenderink, G (corresponding author), POB 201, NL-3730 AE De Bilt, Netherlands.",lenderin@knmi.nl,,"lenderink, geert/0000-0002-1572-4867",EU [505539]; Dutch Climate change and Spatial Planning program (CcSP); Knowledge for Climate (KfC),EU(European Commission); Dutch Climate change and Spatial Planning program (CcSP); Knowledge for Climate (KfC),"Financial support by the EU FP6 Integrated Project ENSEMBLES (contract no. 505539) and the Dutch Climate change and Spatial Planning program (CcSP) and Knowledge for Climate (KfC) is gratefully acknowledged.

These challenges are evaluated with regard to the state of the art, research interest, and regulatory issues, providing an assessment of the advances and defining research gaps in the literature review. The review shows that climate resilience mainly deals with larger systems, whereas the field is still developing at the building level. One of the main challenges identified is the institutional response. Many publications state that it is necessary to revise policies and develop legislation; however, this is sometimes hindered by uncertain climate change predictions. the EU legislation currently provides partial coverage of resource efficiency and climate mitigation in the building sector, while the national legislation is delayed. The current situation can impair the competitiveness of the national building sector, causing it to lag behind the goals set for achieving sustainability. From the cost perspective, immediate short-term actions are seen as more expensive, because delays can result in increased risks for major investments. The authorities are currently choosing between rapid and delayed actions, balancing the costs of early actions and the reciprocal costs of delay.","[Kristl, Ziva] New Univ, European Fac Law, Nova Gorica, Slovenia; [Senior, Coline; Salaj, Alenka Temeljotov] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Trondheim, Norway",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Kristl, Z (corresponding author), New Univ, European Fac Law, Nova Gorica, Slovenia.",ziva.kristl@epf.nova-uni.si; coline.senior@ntnu.no; alenka.temeljotov-salaj@ntnu.no,"Kristl, Živa/AAV-1273-2021; Salaj, Alenka Temeljotov/AAI-9208-2020","Salaj, Alenka Temeljotov/0000-0002-4139-5278; KRISTL, ZIVA/0000-0002-9706-2907",,,,,77,4,4,1,6,URBAN PLANNING INST REPUBLIC SLOVENIA,LJUBLJANA,"TRNOVSKI PRISTAN 2, P P 4717, LJUBLJANA, 1127, SLOVENIA",0353-6483,1855-8399,,URBANI IZZIV,Urbani Izziv,JUN,2020,1,,,,101,111,,10.5379/urbani-izziv-en-2020-31-01-004,http://dx.doi.org/10.5379/urbani-izziv-en-2020-31-01-004,,,11,Urban Studies,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Urban Studies,NJ2JM,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000565871600005,View Full Record in Web of Science

In order to achieve Net-Zero building design in hot and humid climates, efforts must be put to reduce the overall energy use to the maximum extent by integrating appropriate building technologies into the architectural designs. In this paper, the latest ideas dealing with building performances and net-zero building design projects, are reviewed and an outlook is given including new concepts of combined systems in hot and humid climate regions. The paper is structured in the following manner which includes basic guidelines, natural ventilation systems, cooling and dehumidification, insulation and construction materials, reviews of several net-zero energy building projects. The paper also proposes novel wind tower dehumidification design and ventilated attic building design for the hot and humid region.

Climate encourages us to think expansively, in terms of millennia, geological epochs, systems and patterns earthly in scope. Climate, through material and cultural processes, connects people to weather and the environment, particularly in timescales beyond the human lifetimethough some changes occur rapidly, visibly, and spectacularly. This review seeks to understand how people mediate between climate change at once lived and unfathomable. I propose that people do this through interactions with nature as material objects and earthly processes. That is, there is a substance to climate that is sometimes erased from abstract models and political debates. This article considers the substance of climate through three analytical frames: (a) matter and substance, (b) lively nonhuman nature, and (c) experience and embodiment in science and policy. The materiality of climate allows us to consider the scientific and environmental impacts of climate change immediately alongside the power dynamics that enable and can solve this problem.

Ozone impacts on yield and quality of crops and pastures depend on precursor emissions, atmospheric transport and leaf uptake and on the plant's biochemical defence capacity, all of which are influenced by changing climatic conditions, increasing atmospheric CO2 and altered emission patterns. In this article, recent findings about ozone effects under current conditions and trends in regional ozone levels and in climatic factors affecting the plant's sensitivity to ozone are reviewed in order to assess implications of these developments for future regional ozone risks. Based on pessimistic IPCC emission scenarios for many cropland regions elevated mean ozone levels in surface air are projected for 2050 and beyond as a result of both increasing emissions and positive effects of climate change on ozone formation and higher cumulative ozone exposure during an extended growing season resulting from increasing length and frequency of ozone episodes. At the same time, crop sensitivity may decline in areas where warming is accompanied by drying, such as southern and central Europe, in contrast to areas at higher latitudes where rapid warming is projected to occur in the absence of declining air and soil moisture. In regions with rapid industrialisation and population growth and with little regulatory action, ozone risks are projected to increase most dramatically, thus causing negative impacts major staple crops such as rice and wheat and, consequently, on food security. Crop improvement may be a way to increase crop cross-tolerance to co-occurring stresses from heat, drought and ozone. However, the review reveals that besides uncertainties in climate projections, parameters in models for ozone risk assessment are also uncertain and model improvements are necessary to better define specific targets for crop improvements, to identify regions most at risk from ozone in a future climate and to set robust effect-based ozone standards.","Agroscope Res Stn ART, Air Pollut Climate Grp, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Research Station Agroscope,"Fuhrer, J (corresponding author), Agroscope Res Stn ART, Air Pollut Climate Grp, Reckenholzstr 191, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland.",juerg.fuhrer@art.admin.ch,,,Swiss National Science Foundation,Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission),"The author thanks Max Hansson and three anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments.

There is increasing research that takes into account the changing climate risks and life-cycle costs in engineering to reduce the vulnerability or increase the resiliency of infrastructure - we define this as 'climate adaptation engineering'. The paper will describe how risk-based approaches are well suited to optimising climate adaptation strategies related to the construction, design, operation and maintenance of built infrastructure. Stochastic methods are used to model infrastructure performance, risk reduction and effectiveness of adaptation strategies, exposure, and costs. These concepts will be illustrated with state-of-the-art research on risk-based life-cycle assessment of climate adaptation strategies. Uncertainties of climate projections are also discussed. This will pave the way for more efficient and resilient infrastructure, and help 'future proof' new and existing infrastructure to a changing climate.","[Stewart, M.

Socialist realist artists stressed the need for unambiguous political contents and easy readability. In turn, the Forma 1 artists argued that abstract art meant a critique of pictorial representation that could contribute to a critique of bourgeois ideology, harmonising Marxism with advanced technical developments in the field of art. The PCI, for its part, pursued a policy of wide alliances of anti-fascist artists and intellectuals, which was increasingly difficult to hold in the climate of growing political and cultural confrontation in Italy that followed the War.","[Gomez Gutierrez, Juan Jose] Univ Seville, Aesthet & Art Theory, Seville, Spain",University of Sevilla,"Gutierrez, JJG (corresponding author), Univ Seville, Aesthet & Art Theory, Seville, Spain.",,"Gutierrez, Juan Jose Gomez/A-4569-2013","Gutierrez, Juan Jose Gomez/0000-0003-3951-6912",,,,,25,0,0,0,0,"UNIV BARCELONA, SERVEI PUBLICACIONS",BARCELONA,"C ADOLF FLORENSA S-N, BARCELONA, 08028, SPAIN",1139-0158,1699-7468,,CERCLES-REV HIST CUL,Cercles,,2012,,,,,111,135,,,,,,25,History,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),History,VC3QJ,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000433700200005,View Full Record in Web of Science

The coupled CAMS-CSM consists of the modified atmospheric model [ECmwf-HAMburg (ECHAM5)], ocean model [Modular Ocean Model (MOM4)], sea ice model [Sea Ice Simulator (SIS)], and land surface model [Common Land Model (CoLM)]. A detailed model description is presented and both the pre-industrial and historical simulations are preliminarily evaluated in this study. The model can reproduce the climatological mean states and seasonal cycles of the major climate system quantities, including the sea surface temperature, precipitation, sea ice extent, and the equatorial thermocline. The major climate variability modes are also reasonably captured by the CAMS-CSM, such as the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO), El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM), and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). The model shows a promising ability to simulate the EASM variability and the ENSO-EASM relationship. Some biases still exist, such as the false double-intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) in the annual mean precipitation field, the overestimated ENSO amplitude, and the weakened Bjerknes feedback associated with ENSO; and thus the CAMS-CSM needs further improvements.","[Rong, Xinyao; Li, Jian; Chen, Haoming; Xin, Yufei; Su, Jingzhi; Hua, Lijuan; Zhou, Tianjun; Qi, Yanjun; Zhang, Zhengqiu; Zhang, Guo; Li, Jianduo] Chinese Acad Meteorol Sci, State Key Lab Severe Weather, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Tianjun] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, State Key Lab Numer Modeling Atmospher Sci & Geop, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Tianjun] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences (CAMS); Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Li, J (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Meteorol Sci, State Key Lab Severe Weather, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",lij@cma.gov.cn,"Chen, Haoming/E-5716-2010; ZHOU, Tianjun/C-3195-2012","ZHOU, Tianjun/0000-0002-5829-7279","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFE0102400]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [91637210, 91737306]; Basic Research Fund of the Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences [2018Z007]",National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Basic Research Fund of the Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences,"Supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2016YFE0102400), National Natural Science Foundation of China (91637210 and 91737306), and Basic Research Fund of the Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences (2018Z007).",,96,36,39,5,39,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",2095-6037,2198-0934,,J METEOROL RES-PRC,J.

Projecting losses is more complex as it requires insight into the change in the weather hazard but also into exposure and vulnerability of assets. This article discusses the issues involved as well as a framework for projecting future losses, and provides an overview of some state-of-the-art projections. Estimates of changes in losses from cyclones and floods are given, and particular attention is paid to the different approaches and assumptions. All projections show increases in extreme weather losses due to climate change. Flood losses are generally projected to increase more rapidly than losses from tropical and extra-tropical cyclones. However, for the period until the year 2040, the contribution from increasing exposure and value of capital at risk to future losses is likely to be equal or larger than the contribution from anthropogenic climate change. Given the fact that the occurrence of loss events also varies over time due to natural climate variability, the signal from anthropogenic climate change is likely to be lost among the other causes for changes in risk, at least during the period until 2040. More efforts are needed to arrive at a comprehensive approach that includes quantification of changes in hazard, exposure, and vulnerability, as well as adaptation effects.","Deltares, Delft, Netherlands",Deltares,"Bouwer, LM (corresponding author), Deltares, Delft, Netherlands.",laurens.bouwer@deltares.nl,"Bouwer, Laurens/ABE-7170-2021; Bouwer, Laurens/AAV-7628-2021; Bouwer, Laurens/E-8080-2010","Bouwer, Laurens/0000-0003-3498-2586; Bouwer, Laurens/0000-0003-3498-2586",Dutch National Research Programme Climate Changes Spatial Planning,Dutch National Research Programme Climate Changes Spatial Planning,"Critical comments and helpful suggestions on earlier versions of this article were provided by two anonymous reviewers, and by my colleagues Pier Vellinga, Jeroen Aerts, Wouter Botzen, and Hans de Moel.

Here, we analyze 2,511 published low-temperature thermochronometric ages as a proxy of the regional-scale erosion of Central Asia. We compare these ages to tectonic and climate proxies, and state-of-the-art paleoclimate simulations to constrain the inFLuences of climate and tectonics on the topographic architecture of Central Asia. We observe a first-order relationship between younger cooling ages in areas of high precipitation and older ages (Mesozoic) in areas that have been sheltered from precipitation, despite high strain rates. Thus, we suggest that climate enhances erosion in areas where rock uplift produces significant orographic gradients, whereas in the continental interior, areas which are tectonically active but have been sheltered from significant precipitation record older ages and a longer erosional history. Plain Language Summary Modern topography represents the product of the relationships among climate, tectonics, and erosion through time. Central Asia is one of the most topographically diverse regions on Earth. However, the relative role of tectonics versus climate on erosion of continental Asia remains one of the major debates in Earth sciences. One way to investigate this is through the analysis of erosional proxies. In this study, we present the first regional-scale analysis of thermochronometric ages from Central Asia as a proxy of erosion. We compare these data to tectonic processes, climate proxies, and state-of-the-art paleoclimate simulations in order to constrain the relative inFLuences of climate and tectonics on the topographic architecture and erosion of Central Asia. There is a first-order relationship between more recent erosion and active tectonic boundaries. However, more recent erosion is also associated with areas of high precipitation, whereas areas that have been sheltered from significant precipitation retain a signal of older erosional events. Thus, we suggest that climate plays a key role in enhancing erosion in areas with developed topography and high precipitation, whereas areas which experienced sustained aridity record less erosion and preserve a record of older erosion. Key Points Despite the magnitude of the India-Asia collision, erosion throughout Central Asia reFLects Phanerozoic tectonics Regions of old erosion are preserved in more arid areas, whereas more recent erosion is concentrated in areas of high precipitation Tectonic mechanisms are required to initiate erosion; however, climate modulates the magnitude of erosion","[Jepson, Gilby; Carrapa, Barbara; DeCelles, Peter G.; Kapp, Paul] Univ Arizona, Dept Geosci, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Gillespie, Jack] Curtin Univ, Sch Earth & Planetary Sci, Inst Geosci Res TIGeR, Perth, WA, Australia; [Feng, Ran; Tabor, Clay R.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Geosci, Storrs, CT USA; [Zhu, Jiang] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Climate & Global Dynam Lab, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA",University of Arizona; Curtin University; University of Connecticut; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA,"Jepson, G (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Dept Geosci, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",gjepson@arizona.edu,"Zhu, Jiang/H-6040-2011","Zhu, Jiang/0000-0002-0908-5130; /0000-0003-0151-3062; Kapp, Paul/0000-0002-7173-9908; Tabor, Clay/0000-0002-9915-6157; Gillespie, Jack/0000-0002-3061-6223","NSF [OISE 1545859, NSF-1814029]; NSF-Tectonics program [EAR1763432]",NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NSF-Tectonics program(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"Kaustubh Thirumalai, Jay Quade, and Sarah George are thanked for their helpful discussions.

One reason is immanent to science: Facing hypercomplex systems and 'wicked problems', science cannot provide an unequivocal and binding basis for action and policy design. This problem is especially pronounced in systemic contexts in which epistemic subjects and objects are entangled in a co-evolutionary relationship, as in the economy, which is the core driver of climate change. I argue that in these contexts, 'art' becomes an epistemic mode on equal status with 'science' conventionally understood: Art is the epistemic mode of co-creation. This argument builds on the philosophy of post-Kantian German idealism and its intellectual metamorphoses, such as in American pragmatism. I discuss the essentials of this view, present examples from the field of Ecological economics and draw practical conclusions for method.","[Herrmann-Pillath, Carsten] Erfurt Univ, Max Weber Ctr Adv Cultural & Social Studies, Erfurt, Germany",University of Erfurt,"Herrmann-Pillath, C (corresponding author), Erfurt Univ, Max Weber Ctr Adv Cultural & Social Studies, Erfurt, Germany.",carsten.herrmann-pillath@uni-erfurt.de,,,,,,,46,6,6,4,9,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

We describe the core idea of a simulation application that visualizes climate change based on online data sets for vegetation and terrain, present two current prototypes and completed 'apps' and their evaluation, as well as comparing this solution to the state of art in climate change visualization.

Our best tools to capture state-of-the-art knowledge in an internally self-consistent modeling framework are the increasingly complex fully coupled Earth System Models (ESMs). However, computational limitations and the structural rigidity of ESMs mean that the full range of uncertainties across multiple domains are difficult to capture with ESMs alone. The tools of choice are instead more computationally efficient reduced complexity models (RCMs), which are structurally flexible and can span the response dynamics across a range of domain-specific models and ESM experiments. Here we present Phase 2 of the Reduced Complexity Model Intercomparison Project (RCMIP Phase 2), the first comprehensive intercomparison of RCMs that are probabilistically calibrated with key benchmark ranges from specialized research communities. Unsurprisingly, but crucially, we find that models which have been constrained to reflect the key benchmarks better reflect the key benchmarks. Under the low-emissions SSP1-1.9 scenario, across the RCMs, median peak warming projections range from 1.3 to 1.7 degrees C (relative to 1850-1900, using an observationally based historical warming estimate of 0.8 degrees C between 1850-1900 and 1995-2014). Further developing methodologies to constrain these projection uncertainties seems paramount given the international community's goal to contain warming to below 1.5 degrees C above preindustrial in the long-term. Our findings suggest that users of RCMs should carefully evaluate their RCM, specifically its skill against key benchmarks and consider the need to include projections benchmarks either from ESM results or other assessments to reduce divergence in future projections.","[Nicholls, Z.; Meinshausen, M.; Lewis, J.] Univ Melbourne, Australian German Climate & Energy Coll, Parkville, Vic, Australia; [Nicholls, Z.; Meinshausen, M.] Univ Melbourne, Sch Earth Sci, Parkville, Vic, Australia; [Meinshausen, M.] Leibniz Assoc, Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Potsdam, Germany; [Corradi, M.

This Perspectives article aims to inform this process by discussing the potential size and nature of is post-2025 target. We argue that the climate finance system around the current target to mobilise US$100 billion per year to support developing countries has been fraught with difficulties, and that it would be ineffective to simply increase the climate finance target without addressing these difficulties. Therefore, we identify and discuss five priority elements for negotiations: the relation to Article 2.1(c) of the Paris Agreement; the adaptation-mitigation balance; financial instruments; mobilising private finance; and 'new and additional' finance. To increase transparency, accountability, and trust in climate finance under the UNFCCC and to simultaneously allow for the mobilisation of finance at scale, we suggest setting a sub-target for grants. In combination with additional (sub)target(s), this could define an overall new collective quantified goal that is better suited to serve the challenging dual role of mobilising finance at scale and transferring resources to developing countries. Key policy insights Ambiguous definitions of climate finance and the US$100 billion target allow for multiple interpretations, reducing transparency and trust between countries. Climate finance targets can be interpreted in a dual and sometimes contrasting way: mobilising investment at scale and transferring resources from developed to developing countries. Recognising this duality may help to find common ground for a post-2025 climate finance target. Increasing the climate finance target may prove ineffective without further clarity on private finance mobilisation, the relation to Art. 2.1(c), and other priority elements. More detailed assessments of needs, priorities, costs, and support are needed to inform the post-2025 target and assess climate finance provision effectiveness. A sub-target for grants could increase accountability, trust, and transparency, and target the needs of the most vulnerable developing countries. Negotiations on the post-2025 climate finance target could also consider additional aspects such as access to and prioritisation of finance, and loss and damage.","[Pauw, W.

AT5 demonstrated that some climatic phenomena occurring in the tropics and even in the southern hemisphere remotely influence the Arctic climate, wherein the influence from the tropics is found to lead to higher predictability of the Arctic climate while that from the southern hemisphere is a limiting factor for the predictability.

In this study, daily precipitation persistence is assessed in an exhaustive ensemble of observation-based daily precipitation datasets and evaluated in global climate model (GCM) simulations for the period of 2001-2013. Daily precipitation time series are first transformed into categorical time series of dry and wet spells with a 1 mm d(-1) precipitation threshold. Subsequently, P-dd (P-ww), defined as the probability of a dry (wet) day to be followed by another dry (wet) day is calculated to represent daily precipitation persistence. The analysis focuses on the long-term mean and interannual variability (IAV) of the two indices. Both multi-observation and multi-model means show higher values of P-dd than P-ww. GCMs overestimate P-ww with a relatively homogeneous spatial bias pattern. They overestimate P-dd in the Amazon and Central Africa but underestimate P-dd in several regions such as southern Argentina, western North America and the Tibetan Plateau. The IAV of both P-dd and P-ww is generally underestimated in climate models, but more strongly for P-ww. Overall, our results highlight systematic model errors in daily precipitation persistence that are substantially larger than the already considerable spread across observational products. These findings also provide insights on how precipitation persistence biases on a daily time scale relate to well-documented persistence biases at longer time scales in state-of-the-art GCMs.","[Moon, Heewon; Gudmundsson, Lukas; Guillod, Benoit P.; Seneviratne, Sonia I.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, Zurich, Switzerland; [Guillod, Benoit P.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Environm Decis, Zurich, Switzerland; [Venugopal, V.] Indian Inst Sci, Ctr Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Bangalore, Karnataka, India; [Venugopal, V.] Indian Inst Sci, Div Ctr Climate Change, Bangalore, Karnataka, India",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Indian Institute of Science (IISC) - Bangalore; Indian Institute of Science (IISC) - Bangalore,"Moon, H (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, Zurich, Switzerland.",heewon.moon@env.ethz.ch,"Gudmundsson, Lukas/I-9535-2014; Seneviratne, Sonia I./G-8761-2011; Guillod, Benoit P./K-3191-2015","Gudmundsson, Lukas/0000-0003-3539-8621; Seneviratne, Sonia I./0000-0001-9528-2917; Guillod, Benoit P./0000-0003-1807-6997",European Union through the Copernicus Climate Change Service [C3S_511]; European Research Council (ERC) `DROUGHT-HEAT' project through the European Commission [FP7-IDEAS-ERC-617518],European Union through the Copernicus Climate Change Service; European Research Council (ERC) `DROUGHT-HEAT' project through the European Commission(European Research Council (ERC)),"Financial support on this work was provided by the European Union through the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S_511) implemented by ECMWF, and the European Research Council (ERC) `DROUGHT-HEAT' project funded through the European Commission's Seventh Framework Programme (grant agreement FP7-IDEAS-ERC-617518).

With an exploratory nature of climate data analyses and an explosive growth of datasets and service tools, scientists are struggling to keep track of their datasets, tools, and execution/study history, let alone sharing them with others. In response, we have developed a cloud-enabled, provenance-supported, web-service system called Climate Model Diagnostic Analyzer (CMDA). CMDA enables the physics-based, multi-variable model performance evaluations and diagnoses through the comprehensive and synergistic use of multiple observational data, reanalysis data, and model outputs. At the same time, CMDA provides a crowdsourcing space where scientists can organize their work efficiently and share their work with others.

This is the highest resolution coupled global climate model to be used to study the impacts of an AMOC slowdown so far. Many results found are consistent with previous studies and can be considered robust impacts from a large reduction or collapse of the AMOC. These include: widespread cooling throughout the North Atlantic and northern hemisphere in general; less precipitation in the northern hemisphere midlatitudes; large changes in precipitation in the tropics and a strengthening of the North Atlantic storm track. The focus on Europe, aided by the increase in resolution, has revealed previously undiscussed impacts, particularly those associated with changing atmospheric circulation patterns. Summer precipitation decreases (increases) in northern (southern) Europe and is associated with a negative summer North Atlantic Oscillation signal. Winter precipitation is also affected by the changing atmospheric circulation, with localised increases in precipitation associated with more winter storms and a strengthened winter storm track. Stronger westerly winds in winter increase the warming maritime effect while weaker westerlies in summer decrease the cooling maritime effect. In the absence of these circulation changes the cooling over Europe's landmass would be even larger in both seasons. The general cooling and atmospheric circulation changes result in weaker peak river flows and vegetation productivity, which may raise issues of water availability and crop production.","[Jackson, L.

Classic, postRenaissance European paintings are approaching photorealism with its rich expressions of shading and highlights whereas paintings from northeast Asia consist of motifs drawn in faint shades and dark contours. Given recent findings that artwork follows the statistical regularities of natural scenes, it is sensible to hypothesize that western and eastern painting styles reflect the visual environment of the respective province. Here, we propose that the different climates of Europe and Asia produced different natural light environments that changed the visual appearance of objects, which in turn influenced painting style. Analysis of meteorological data and optical simulations show that directional lightfields in Mediterranean climates produce object images with variegated shading and sharp highlights. Cloudy and diffused monsoon-like lightfields, in comparison, produce line-shaped shading only around the deepest concavities and remove highlights as well as cast shadows. Image statistics analysis suggests that western and eastern painting styles mimic such differences in visual appearance. The style of classical artworks that have been appreciated in a particular cultural realm could partially mirror the implicit structure of images as constrained by the natural light environment of the corresponding habitat.","[Motoyoshi, Isamu] Univ Tokyo, Dept Life Sci, 3-8-1 Komaba,Meguro ku, Tokyo 1538902, Japan",University of Tokyo,"Motoyoshi, I (corresponding author), Univ Tokyo, Dept Life Sci, 3-8-1 Komaba,Meguro ku, Tokyo 1538902, Japan.",imotoyosi.ac@gmail.com,,,JSPS KAKENHI;  [15K12042];  [18K19801];  [20K21803],"JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); ; ; ","Acknowledgements This study was supported by JSPS KAKENHI 15K12042, 18K19801, and 20K21803.

We have used a Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6)-derived single-wind forcing (from EC-EARTH) to produce a dynamic wind-wave climate ensemble for its historic (1995-2014) and future (2081-2100) periods. We discuss the uncertainty due to the wave model (intra-model uncertainty) in simulating the present and future wave climate. The historical wave climate runs were compared against the ERA5 reanalysis and found to be in good agreement for the significant wave height. This gives a good degree of confidence to investigate the intra-model uncertainty in WW3 using the available physics packages such as ST2, ST3, ST4, and ST6. In general, for the historic period, ST3 and ST4 physics packages perform better in the tropics whereas ST6 performs better in the extratropics, based on M-Score performance assessment. The study also reveals that the extratropical South Indian Ocean and tropical eastern South Pacific areas exhibit a larger amount of uncertainty, mainly induced by the ST2 physics package. The results of this study shed new light on the impacts associated with the use of multiple physics parameterizations in wave climate ensembles, an issue that has not received the necessary attention in scientific literature.","[Kumar, Rajesh] Ctr Climate Res Singapore, 36 Kim Chum Rd, Singapore 537054, Singapore; [Lemos, Gil; Semedo, Alvaro] Univ Lisbon, Fac Ciencias, Inst Dom Luiz IDL, P-1749016 Lisbon, Portugal; [Lemos, Gil; Semedo, Alvaro] IHE Delft, Dept Coastal Urban Risk & Resilience, Westvest 7, NL-2611 AX Delft, Netherlands; [Alsaaq, Faisal] King Abdulaziz Univ, Fac Maritime Studies, Dept Hydrog Surveying, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia",Universidade de Lisboa; IHE Delft Institute for Water Education; King Abdulaziz University,"Kumar, R (corresponding author), Ctr Climate Res Singapore, 36 Kim Chum Rd, Singapore 537054, Singapore.",rajesh_kumar@nea.gov.sg; grlemos@fc.ul.pt; a.semedo@un-ihe.org; falsaaq@kau.edu.sa,"Alsaaq, Faisal/AAY-1927-2020","Alsaaq, Faisal/0000-0003-3062-2380; Lemos, Gil/0000-0002-2585-6871; Kumar, Rajesh/0000-0002-1360-5792",Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT) [FCT UIDB/50019/2020],Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)(Portuguese Foundation for Science and TechnologyEuropean Commission),"G.L. acknowledges funding from FundacAo para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT), Grant FCT UIDB/50019/2020 IDL.

Here, we develop a framework to assess the fitness of a climate model for providing understanding. The framework is based on three dimensions: representational accuracy, representational depth, and graspability. We show that this framework does justice to the intuition that classical process-based climate models give understanding of phenomena. While simple climate models are characterized by a larger graspability, state-of-the-art models have a higher representational accuracy and representational depth. We then compare the fitness-for-providing understanding of process-based to data-driven models that are built with machine learning. We show that at first glance, data driven models seem either unnecessary or inadequate for understanding. However, a case study from atmospheric research demonstrates that this is a false dilemma.

The contemporary Tibetan artists consulted for this paper (both living in Tibet and elsewhere) address questions that arise when thinking about landscape imagery and Tibet, an already controversial place whose name conjures various definitions. What is real and what is imagined in these place/landscape images? How does the placement of the work in a gallery factor in to the reading of the scene? How does the title work in conjunction with the content to challenge tropes? How does the specific viewing community or space change the narrative?

Emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs), which cause an increase in radiative forcing, is the main contributor, and the only climate forcing agent currently considered in life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) methodologies. The direct consequence is an increase in the temperature of atmosphere and oceans, which leads to several types of higher-level impacts such as sea level rise, extreme meteorological events and perturbations in rainfalls, which in turn cause damages to human health and ecosystem quality. All the LCIA methodologies use GWPs (Global Warming Potentials), developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), as midpoint characterisation factors since they are based on state-of-the art and peer-reviewed publications and have a relatively low associated uncertainty. Some LCIA methodologies also propose endpoint characterisation factors. However, these factors are considered highly uncertain because of the complexity of the impact pathway so that further research is still needed to improve robustness of the models. Recent new developments are addressing the accounting of biogenic CO2 emissions, the timing of GHG emissions, and the development of characterisation factors for terrestrial albedo changes induced by human activities.","[Levasseur, Annie] Ecole Polytech Montreal, Dept Chem Engn, CIRAIG, Stn Ctr Ville,POB 6079, Montreal, PQ H3C 3A7, Canada",Universite de Montreal; Polytechnique Montreal,"Levasseur, A (corresponding author), Ecole Polytech Montreal, Dept Chem Engn, CIRAIG, Stn Ctr Ville,POB 6079, Montreal, PQ H3C 3A7, Canada.",annie.levasseur@polymtl.ca,,,,,,,50,11,11,2,3,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",2214-3505,2214-3513,978-94-017-9744-3; 978-94-017-9743-6,LCA COMPEND,,,2015,,,,,39,50,,10.1007/978-94-017-9744-3_3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-94-017-9744-3_3,10.1007/978-94-017-9744-3,,12,"Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Engineering, Environmental; Environmental Sciences",Book Citation Index – Science (BKCI-S),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BJ1IU,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000417721200004,View Full Record in Web of Science

The end result is an impacts assessment that is given more confidence than is warranted. In this study, we review sources for uncertainty in the development of human caused climate change scenarios. Uncertainty in future climate scenarios arises from two main sources: first is the uncertainty about future greenhouse gas emissions and atmospheric concentrations, and second is the uncertainty associated with the climate system's sensitivity to changes in greenhouse forcing. Comparing and contrasting output from two state-of-the-art climate change scenarios illustrates the potential for finding large differences between different climate change scenarios for the same time horizons and regions. We caution that goals for eliminating, or even vastly reducing, environmental uncertainty for the purpose of improved natural resource management are not likely to be met. An alternative avenue for improving resource management would focus instead on explicit incorporation of environmental uncertainty in management frameworks and policies.","Univ Washington, Climate Impacts Grp, Sch Marine Affairs, Joint Inst Study Atmosphere & Oceans, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Mantua, NJ (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Climate Impacts Grp, Sch Marine Affairs, Joint Inst Study Atmosphere & Oceans, POB 354235, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",mantua@atmos.washington.edu; philip@atmos.washington.edu,"Mote, Philip/AAB-3500-2021",,,,,,11,3,3,0,8,AMER FISHERIES SOC,BETHESDA,"5410 GROSVENOR LANE, STE 110, BETHESDA, MD 20814-2199 USA",0892-2284,,1-888569-40-9,AM FISH S S,Am.

These projects convert data to a human (versus global) scale, transport data from far off lands into our spaces, bring the future consequences of climate change into our present, and disrupt the philosophical separation between the human and non-human world.

These unknown series contain complex co variation relations of climate data. The extraction of these relations is essential for further revealing the complex representations between time series and space series in climate data. As an important application, through extracting these co-variation relations, we can further predict the change of climate to provide early warning for natural disasters, e.g., Greenhouse effect. Hence, it is a challenge to explore the relations between climate data. To address this, this work proposes a deep neural network. Based on Brenier theorem, the loss function is derived. Since Brenier theorem rigorously proves that the data distribution in background space is consistent with the data distribution in the feature space with greatest probability, ensuring that the relations extracted from the latent space are as close to that of in background space as possible. Then, the parameters of time series consisting of eight variables are encoded by the first hidden layer in the proposed model. The remaining two hidden layers encode the latitude and longitude in spatial series, respectively. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with respect to climate relations extracted. Hence, the proposed method is considered a good alternative in capturing relations between climate variables, as well as, between carbon dioxide (CO2) and surface temperature.","[Zheng, J.; Wang, J.; Chen, S.; Li, J.; Chen, Y.; Li, B.] Chongqing Aerosp Polytech, Chongqing, Peoples R China",,"Zheng, J (corresponding author), Chongqing Aerosp Polytech, Chongqing, Peoples R China.",zhengjian.002@163.com,,"zheng, jian/0000-0001-9741-9526","Science and Technology Research Program of Chongqing Municipal Education Commission of China [KJQN202003001, KJQN201903003]",Science and Technology Research Program of Chongqing Municipal Education Commission of China,The research funding is Supported by the Science and Technology Research Program of Chongqing Municipal Education Commission of China under Grant KJQN201903003.

More work has been done on East, Southeast, and South Asia than on Central, West, and North Asia, but great differences exist among needed research topics in these subregions. While some progress has been made on impact assessments of climate change and carbon emissions estimations, analysis and action remain mismatched.

An understanding of the impacts of different scenarios of solar geoengineering deployment will be crucial for informing decisions on whether and how to deploy it. Here we review the current state of knowledge about impacts of a solar-geoengineered climate and identify the major research gaps. We suggest that a thorough assessment of the climate impacts of a range of scenarios of solar geoengineering deployment is needed and can be built upon existing frameworks. However, solar geoengineering poses a novel challenge for climate impacts research as the manner of deployment could be tailored to pursue different objectives making possible a wide range of climate outcomes. We present a number of ideas for approaches to extend the survey of climate impacts beyond standard scenarios of solar geoengineering deployment to address this challenge. Reducing the impacts of climate change is the fundamental motivator for emissions reductions and for considering whether and how to deploy solar geoengineering. This means that the active engagement of the climate impacts research community will be important for improving the overall understanding of the opportunities, challenges, and risks presented by solar geoengineering.","[Irvine, Peter J.; Lawrence, Mark G.] Inst Adv Sustainabil Studies, Potsdam, Germany; [Irvine, Peter J.] Harvard Univ, John A Paulson Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Kravitz, Ben] Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Atmospher Sci & Global Change Div, Richland, WA USA; [Gerten, Dieter] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Res Domain Earth Syst Anal, Potsdam, Germany; [Gerten, Dieter] Humboldt Univ, Dept Geog, Berlin, Germany; [Caminade, Cyril] Univ Liverpool, Inst Infect & Global Hlth, Liverpool, Merseyside, England; [Gosling, Simon N.] Univ Nottingham, Sch Geog, Nottingham, England; [Hendy, Erica J.] Univ Bristol, Sch Earth Sci, Bristol, Avon, England; [Kassie, Belay T.] Univ Florida, Dept Agr & Biol Engn, Gainesville, FL USA; [Kissling, W.

It would also test and extend some established practices of climate research and policy in anticipating and making futures. The paper suggests that the key characteristics of scenarios as a cultural form are that they provide space for collective, improvisational and reflexive modes of acting on and thinking about uncertain futures.","[Tyszczuk, Renata] Univ Sheffield, Sch Architecture, Arts Tower,Western Bank, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England; [Smith, Joe] Open Univ, Fac Arts & Social Sci, Geog Discipline, Walton Hall, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, Bucks, England",University of Sheffield; Open University - UK,"Tyszczuk, R (corresponding author), Univ Sheffield, Sch Architecture, Arts Tower,Western Bank, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England.",r.tyszczuk@sheffield.ac.uk,,"Tyszczuk, Renata/0000-0001-9556-1502","Jerwood Charitable Foundation; Ashden Trust; University of Sheffield; Grantham Centre for Sustainable Futures at the University of Sheffield; Open University's Open Space Research Centre; Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC), Stories of Change project [AH/L008173/1]; Arts and Humanities Research Council [AH/L008173/1] Funding Source: researchfish; AHRC [AH/L008173/1] Funding Source: UKRI","Jerwood Charitable Foundation; Ashden Trust; University of Sheffield; Grantham Centre for Sustainable Futures at the University of Sheffield; Open University's Open Space Research Centre; Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC), Stories of Change project(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Arts & Humanities Research Council (AHRC)); Arts and Humanities Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Arts & Humanities Research Council (AHRC)); AHRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Arts & Humanities Research Council (AHRC))","The Culture and Climate Change series of projects, events and publications set out to analyse and debate cultural responses to climate change.

Although a national program aimed at the technological development of sustainable buildings with energy saving potential is ongoing, it is also appropriate to consult vernacular architectural tradition. This holds the potential to learn and adapt important cultural ideas developed over time on the art of balancing thermal comfort between climate and limited resources. This paper explores the five different climatic regions into which China is partitioned by the Chinese authorities: severe cold region, cold region, moderate region, hot summer and cold winter region, and hot summer and mild winter region. Analysis of each region covers the climate and its vernacular architecture with a special focus on how sustainability was addressed. Finally, regional climate scenario has been analyzed on the basis of data from Meteonorm V6.1 with special attention paid to passive design strategies.","[Sun, Feifei] NPS Grp, Earle House,Colonial St, Kingston Upon Hull HU2 8JY, Yorks, England",,"Sun, FF (corresponding author), NPS Grp, Earle House,Colonial St, Kingston Upon Hull HU2 8JY, Yorks, England.",feifei.sun@nps.co.uk,,,"Beijing Institute of China Construction and Design Research, Wuhan Branch","Beijing Institute of China Construction and Design Research, Wuhan Branch","This paper is partial of the Ph.

J,"Duxbury, L",,,,"Duxbury, Lesley",,,A Change in the Climate: New Interpretations and Perceptions of Climate Change through Artistic Interventions and Representations,WEATHER CLIMATE AND SOCIETY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"The uncertainties concerning climate change debated daily in the media polarize political leaders and the general public alike. While daily weather is something that can be experienced by everyone and changes in the weather can be accounted for within the timeframe of a human lifetime, climate change is more difficult to comprehend or connect with in an appreciable way because of its remoteness in time and unpredictability. General populations can be alienated by the overwhelming proliferation of scientific data and statistics and, in the face of potentially cataclysmic events, feel paralyzed and incapable of action. Scientific evidence alone may not be working to encourage or initiate changes in behaviors with the potential to curtail the perceived changes to life as we know it. This paper sets out to explicate alternative ways of comprehending and addressing some of the complex problems of climate change through art by focusing on the ways people perceive and sense the changing world around them. It contends that artists have the potential to engage society in emotional and experiential ways to promote behavioral and cognitive change. Drawing on the work of certain artists and art commentators, this paper argues that, far from being a purely imaginative or aesthetic activity, art is integral to meaningful communication between humans and the changing world.","RMIT Univ, Sch Art, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia",Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT),"Duxbury, L (corresponding author), RMIT Univ, Sch Art, GPO Box 2476, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia.",lesley.duxbury@rmit.edu.au,,,,,,,19,15,15,0,16,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",1948-8327,1948-8335,,WEATHER CLIM SOC,Weather Clim.

The hydrologic model is forced with an ensemble of high-resolution climate projections from the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. The latter has been extended with an interactive lake model (FLake) to capture the effect of the Great Lakes on the regional climate. The WRF ensemble encompasses two different moist physics configurations at resolutions of 90, 30, and 10km, as well as four different initial and boundary conditions, so as to control for natural climate variability. The integrated hydrologic model is run with a representative seasonal cycle, which effectively controls natural climate variability, while remaining computationally tractable with a large integrated model. However, the range of natural variability is also investigated, as are the impacts of climate model resolution and bias correction. The two WRF configurations show opposite climate change responses in summer precipitation, but similar responses otherwise. The hydrologic simulations generally follow the climate forcing; however, due to the memory of the subsurface, the differences in summer propagate throughout the entire seasonal cycle. This results in a set of dry scenarios with reduced streamflow and water availability year-round and a set of wet scenarios with increased streamflow for all times excluding the spring peak, which does not increase. Most of the analysis focuses on streamflow, but changes in the seasonal cycle of baseflow and groundwater recharge are also analyzed. Plain Language Summary In this study we investigate the impact of climate change on water resources using state-of-the-art computer simulations. The simulations were conducted using physically based models, which simulate the circulation of the atmosphere, rainfall, and the flow of water above and below the surface. The region of interest here is the Grand River Watershed, located in the Great Lakes region (southern Ontario, Canada). We show that with high resolution and a physical representation of the Great Lakes, only a simple correctionmuch less than for global climate modelsis necessary, in order to simulate a realistic climate. We find that predicted climate change impacts on water resources depend strongly on some approximations commonly made to represent thunderstorms and precipitation in climate models. The most likely scenario, based on our analysis, is an increase in precipitation and streamflow in all seasons except spring, but some scenarios also show less precipitation in summer, which results in lower streamflow year-round. A major result is that differences in summer precipitation can affect streamflow in all seasons, but only if the interaction with groundwater is properly accounted for. At the moment uncertainty in future summer precipitation changes limits our ability to predict impacts on water resources.","[Erler, Andre R.; Frey, Steven K.; Khader, Omar; Park, Young-Jin; Hwang, Hyoun-Tae; Sudicky, Edward A.] Aquanty, Waterloo, ON, Canada; [Erler, Andre R.; d'Orgeville, Marc; Peltier, W.

These processes result primarily from the combination of mean sea level, waves, storm surges and tides, which are affected by global and regional climate change, and whose uncertainty increases with time. This paper reviews the current state of the art of methods used to model climate change-induced coastal erosion focusing on how climate change-related drivers and the associated uncertainty are considered. We identify research gaps, describe and analyse the key components of a comprehensive framework to derive future estimates of shoreline change and make suggestions for good practice. Within the scope of the review, we find that although significant progress has been made over the last decade, most of the studies limit uncertainty sampling to considering ranges of variation of forcing variables and ensembles of emissions scenarios, and applications with high level of probabilistic development remain few. Further research is necessary to fully (a) incorporate projected time series of coastal drivers into the erosion models, including bias correction; (b) sufficiently sample the uncertainty associated with each step of the top-down approach, including the consideration of different emission scenarios, inter- and intra-model variability, and multiple runs of erosion models or model ensembles; and (c) reduce uncertainty in shoreline change estimates by developing better datasets and model parameterisations, and progressing in detection and attribution.","[Toimil, A.; Camus, P.; Losada, I.

One manifestation of this is the substantial spread in projections for the extratropical storm tracks made by different state-of-the-art climate models. In this study we perform a series of sensitivity experiments, with the atmosphere component of a single climate model, in order to identify the causes of the differences between storm track responses in different models. In particular, the Northern Hemisphere wintertime storm tracks in the CMIP3 multi-model ensemble are considered. A number of potential physical drivers of storm track change are identified and their influence on the storm tracks is assessed. The experimental design aims to perturb the different physical drivers independently, by magnitudes representative of the range of values present in the CMIP3 model runs, and this is achieved via perturbations to the sea surface temperature and the sea-ice concentration forcing fields. We ask the question: can the spread of projections for the extratropical storm tracks present in the CMIP3 models be accounted for in a simple way by any of the identified drivers? The results suggest that, whilst the changes in the upper-tropospheric equator-to-pole temperature difference have an influence on the storm track response to climate change, the large spread of projections for the extratropical storm track present in the northern North Atlantic in particular is more strongly associated with changes in the lower-tropospheric equator-to-pole temperature difference.","[Harvey, B.

While few pre-service teachers create balanced curriculum where students make and analyze art, even fewer implement such lessons as student teachers. By contrast, most pre-service teachers initially approach arts integration by asking students to make or analyze art. Such patterns imply teacher educators need to identify fieldwork placements supporting arts integration, frame pre-service teachers' initial arts integration as steps to be nurtured by continuing professional development, and prepare teachers committed to the arts to resist narrow definitions of learning in a climate of standardization.

They are core tools in the study of the interactions of many climatic processes and justifiably provide an additional strand in the argument that anthropogenic climate change is a critical global problem. Over a similar period, there has been growing interest in the interpretation and probabilistic analysis of the output of computer models; particularly, models of natural systems. The results of these areas of research are being sought and utilized in the development of policy, in other academic disciplines, and more generally in societal decision making. Here, our focus is solely on complex climate models as predictive tools on decadal and longer time scales. We argue for a reassessment of the role of such models when used for this purpose and a reconsideration of strategies for model development and experimental design. Building on more generic work, we categorize sources of uncertainty as they relate to this specific problem and discuss experimental strategies available for their quanti. cation. Complex climate models, as predictive tools for many variables and scales, cannot be meaningfully calibrated because they are simulating a never before experienced state of the system; the problem is one of extrapolation. It is therefore inappropriate to apply any of the currently available generic techniques which utilize observations to calibrate or weight models to produce forecast probabilities for the real world. To do so is misleading to the users of climate science in wider society. In this context, we discuss where we derive confidence in climate forecasts and present some concepts to aid discussion and communicate the state-of-the-art. Effective communication of the underlying assumptions and sources of forecast uncertainty is critical in the interaction between climate science, the impacts communities and society in general.","Ctr Environm, Environm Change Inst, Tyndall Ctr Climate Change Res, Oxford OX1 3QY, England; Univ Oxford, Clarendon Lab, Dept Atmospher Ocean & Planetary Sci, Oxford OX1 3PU, England; London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Stat, Ctr Anal Time Series, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of Oxford; University of Oxford; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Stainforth, DA (corresponding author), Ctr Environm, Environm Change Inst, Tyndall Ctr Climate Change Res, S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3QY, England.",das@atm.ox.ac.uk,"Allen, Myles R/A-5172-2012","Stainforth, David/0000-0001-6476-733X","Natural Environment Research Council [NER/J/S/2002/00737, tynd10001] Funding Source: researchfish; NERC [tynd10001] Funding Source: UKRI",Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),,,44,286,289,2,83,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",1364-503X,1471-2962,,PHILOS T R SOC A,Philos.

But they have no systems for indoor climate control or the church may be heated only at services. These conditions are inadequate for the preservation of cultural heritage. The objective of this paper is to assess an adaptive ventilation (AV) solution in a church for reduction of the relative humidity (RH) in an unheated church to prevent mould growth and disintegration of wooden parts. The operation principle of the system is to ensure ventilation in the church when water vapour content in the outdoor air is lower than that indoors, to lower the RH in the church. A case study in Hangvar Church in Gotland, Sweden, was conducted to test the performance of AV to reduce the RH in the church. Field measurements showed that AV has a positive impact on the indoor RH of the church. During the measurement period without climate control, the RH in the church was higher than 70% of 98% of the time; with AV, the indoor RH was higher than 70% only 78% of the time. Building simulation was carried out to test the performance and energy consumption of AV under different conditions. The simulations showed that auxiliary heating and airflow rate both have high impact on the system performance. The higher the heating power, the more effective the system is; thus, lower airflow rates are needed. Infiltration has also high impact on the system performance: the lower the infiltration rate, the better the AV performance is.","[Napp, Margus; Kalamees, Targo] Tallinn Univ Technol, Chair Bldg Phys & Energy Efficiency, EE-19086 Tallinn, Estonia; [Wessberg, Magnus; Brostrom, Tor] Uppsala Univ, Dept Art Hist, Conservat, Campus Gotland, Uppsala, Sweden",Tallinn University of Technology; Uppsala University,"Kalamees, T (corresponding author), Tallinn Univ Technol, Chair Bldg Phys & Energy Efficiency, EE-19086 Tallinn, Estonia.",targo.kalamees@ttu.ee,"Broström, Tor/AAG-5751-2021; Kalamees, Targo/B-4245-2009","Kalamees, Targo/0000-0002-1424-6154","Central Baltic Interreg IV A [grant Sustainable Management of Historic Rural Churches in the Baltic Sea Region]; Estonian Centre of Excellence in Zero Energy and Resource Efficient Smart Buildings and Districts, ZEBE - European Regional Development Fund [TK146]; Estonian Research Council [IUT1-15]","Central Baltic Interreg IV A [grant Sustainable Management of Historic Rural Churches in the Baltic Sea Region]; Estonian Centre of Excellence in Zero Energy and Resource Efficient Smart Buildings and Districts, ZEBE - European Regional Development Fund; Estonian Research Council","This work was supported by Central Baltic Interreg IV A [grant Sustainable Management of Historic Rural Churches in the Baltic Sea Region], Estonian Centre of Excellence in Zero Energy and Resource Efficient Smart Buildings and Districts, ZEBE [grant number TK146] funded by the European Regional Development Fund, and by the Estonian Research Council, with Institutional research funding [grant number IUT1-15].",,31,10,10,0,13,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1473-3315,2044-4044,,INT J VENT,Int.

The data collection period was August and September 2019 and included studies published between 2008 and 2019. This study followed a protocol based on the PRISMA statement. Data analysis was done in a qualitative way. Results The most of works were from Africa, Asia and Iran (71%), where temperature was the main climatic variable. Although the studies provide climatic conditions that are more favorable for the incidence of vector-borne and respiratory diseases, the influence of seasonal patterns on the onset, development and end of CSDs is still poorly understood, especially for gastrointestinal disorders. Moreover, little is known about the impact of droughts on CSDs. Conclusions This review summarized the state of art of the relationship between climate and CSDs in semi-arid regions. Moreover, a research agenda was provided, which is fundamental for health policy development, priority setting and public health management.","[Moreira, Rafaella Pessoa; Gomes, Ticiane Freire; de Oliveira Ferreira, Glauciano] Univ Int Integrat Afro Brazilian Lusophony, Inst Hlth Sci, Redencao, CE, Brazil; [Costa, Alexandre Cunha] Univ Int Integrat Afro Brazilian Lusophony, Inst Engn & Sustainable Dev, Redencao, CE, Brazil",,"Moreira, RP (corresponding author), Univ Int Integrat Afro Brazilian Lusophony, Inst Hlth Sci, Redencao, CE, Brazil.",rafaellapessoa@unilab.edu.br; cunhacos@unilab.edu.br; ticifg@gmail.com; glaucianobr86@gmail.com,"Costa, Alexandre Augusto da/HCJ-0140-2022; Costa, Alexandre/X-4942-2019","Costa, Alexandre Augusto da/0000-0001-7558-5435; Moreira, Rafaella/0000-0003-2341-7936",,,,,61,4,4,3,14,SPRINGER BASEL AG,BASEL,"PICASSOPLATZ 4, BASEL, 4052, SWITZERLAND",1661-8556,1661-8564,,INT J PUBLIC HEALTH,Int.

State-of-the-art palaeoclimatic methods routinely use hydroclimatic proxies to reconstruct temperature (for example, refs 3,4), possibly blurring differences in the variability continuum of temperature and precipitation before the instrumental period. Here, we assess the spectral characteristics of temperature and precipitation fluctuations in observations, model simulations and proxy records across the globe. We find that whereas an ensemble of different general circulation models represents patterns captured in instrumental measurements, such as land-ocean contrasts and enhanced low-frequency tropical variability, the tree-ring-dominated proxy collection does not. The observed dominance of inter-annual precipitation fluctuations is not reflected in the annually resolved hydroclimatic proxy records. Likewise, temperature-sensitive proxies overestimate, on average, the ratio of low-to high-frequency variability. These spectral biases in the proxy records seem to propagate into multi-proxy climate reconstructions for which we observe an overestimation of low-frequency signals. Thus, a proper representation of the high-to low-frequency spectrum in proxy records is needed to reduce uncertainties in climate reconstruction efforts.","[Franke, Joerg; Frank, David] Swiss Fed Res Inst WSL, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Franke, Joerg; Broennimann, Stefan] Univ Bern, Inst Geog, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Franke, Joerg; Frank, David; Raible, Christoph C.; Broennimann, Stefan] Oeschger Ctr Climate Change Res, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Raible, Christoph C.] Univ Bern, Inst Phys, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Esper, Jan] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Dept Geog, D-55099 Mainz, Germany","Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape Research; University of Bern; University of Bern; University of Bern; Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz","Franke, J (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Res Inst WSL, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland.",franke@giub.unibe.ch,"Raible, Christoph/M-8309-2016; Frank, David/C-7764-2013; Esper, Jan/O-3127-2018","Raible, Christoph/0000-0003-0176-0602; Esper, Jan/0000-0003-3919-014X; Frank, David/0000-0001-5463-5640; Bronnimann, Stefan/0000-0001-9502-7991",EU project MILLENNIUM [017008-GOCE]; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) through its National Center of Competence in Research on Climate (NCCR Climate); Synergia project FUPSOL; EU project Past4Future,EU project MILLENNIUM; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) through its National Center of Competence in Research on Climate (NCCR Climate)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Synergia project FUPSOL; EU project Past4Future,"This study was financially supported by the EU project MILLENNIUM (#017008-GOCE) and by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) through its National Center of Competence in Research on Climate (NCCR Climate).

Whilst the focus of climate change adaptation in Wales has been wintertime decarbonisation through the introduction of energy efficiency measures, Welsh Government now want to understand the summertime impacts of climate change on the occupants of Welsh housing. The aim of this project was to test the hypothesis that summertime indoor housing conditions in Wales will diminish as a consequence of climate change. A six-week period from 22nd July-31st August was modelled using UK 2018 local climate projections, baseline, 2030 and 2070 respectively. The results reveal increased incidences of summertime overheating in a majority of dwellings. The poorest performing dwellings were post 1990 dwellings, flats and properties with internal wall insulation. The results show that cooling strategies to reduce indoor air temperature will increasingly be required. The other indoor vulnerability modelled was that of moisture. Results demonstrate the potential for poorer indoor environmental quality due to increased relative humidity. Every location will experience increases in relative humidity regardless of dwelling typology. Relative humidity will be highest in pre-1919 dwellings and dwellings with solid stone walls. The results show that ventilation strategies to improve the extraction of moisture-laden air, whilst diluting the concentration of pollutants that are present indoors, are required if these dwellings are to avoid increased incidences of condensation, damp, and mould growth, and adverse impacts from other allergens, particles and pollutants.","[Hayles, Carolyn S.] Cardiff Metropolitan Univ, Cardiff Sch Art & Design, Western Ave, Cardiff CF5 2YB, Wales; [Huddleston, Matt; Helman, Jacob] Resilient Analyt, 814 Trail Ridge Dr, Louisville, CO 80027 USA; [Chinowsky, Paul] Univ Colorado, Program Environm Design, 314 UCB 1060 18th St, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",Cardiff Metropolitan University; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Hayles, CS (corresponding author), Cardiff Metropolitan Univ, Cardiff Sch Art & Design, Western Ave, Cardiff CF5 2YB, Wales.",cshayles@cardiffmet.ac.uk; mhuddleston@resilient-analytics.com; Paul.Chinowsky@colorado.edu; jhelman@resilient-analytics.com,,"Hayles, Carolyn/0000-0002-0811-0816",Welsh Government - Environmental Evidence Programme,Welsh Government - Environmental Evidence Programme,This work was supported by Welsh Government through a climate embedded research fellowship funded by the Environmental Evidence Programme.,,41,1,1,3,3,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0360-1323,1873-684X,,BUILD ENVIRON,Build.

In this review, we bring together perspectives of various communities involved in the research and regulation of bioenergy deployment in the context of climate change mitigation: Land-use and energy experts, land-use and integrated assessment modelers, human geographers, ecosystem researchers, climate scientists and two different strands of life-cycle assessment experts. We summarize technological options, outline the state-of-the-art knowledge on various climate effects, provide an update on estimates of technical resource potential and comprehensively identify sustainability effects. Cellulosic feedstocks, increased end-use efficiency, improved land carbon-stock management and residue use, and, when fully developed, BECCS appear as the most promising options, depending on development costs, implementation, learning, and risk management. Combined heat and power, efficient biomass cookstoves and small-scale power generation for rural areas can help to promote energy access and sustainable development, along with reduced emissions. We estimate the sustainable technical potential as up to 100EJ: high agreement; 100-300EJ: medium agreement; above 300EJ: low agreement. Stabilization scenarios indicate that bioenergy may supply from 10 to 245EJyr(-1) to global primary energy supply by 2050. Models indicate that, if technological and governance preconditions are met, large-scale deployment (>200EJ), together with BECCS, could help to keep global warming below 2 degrees degrees of preindustrial levels; but such high deployment of land-intensive bioenergy feedstocks could also lead to detrimental climate effects, negatively impact ecosystems, biodiversity and livelihoods. The integration of bioenergy systems into agriculture and forest landscapes can improve land and water use efficiency and help address concerns about environmental impacts.

While significant progress has been made in enhancing our integrated understanding of the climate system and the dynamics of the social systems that produce an array of potential greenhouse gases, it is also clear from the panel's reports how far the science community is from being able to present a dynamic and synoptic view of the climate system as a whole. Clear evidence of these complexities and uncertainties inherent in the climate system is evident in efforts aimed at designing robust policy interventions. In this paper, we argue that the adaptive management framework in ecosystem management may be a useful model for guiding how the IPCC can continue to be relevant both as a scientific establishment and as a policy-relevant scientific endeavor.","Michigan State Univ, Environm Sci & Policy Program, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; Michigan State Univ, Dept CARRS, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; Univ Oklahoma, Norman, OK 73019 USA; Univ Washington, Bothell, WA USA; Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; Ohio State Univ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; Univ Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; Indiana Univ, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; Univ Rochester, Rochester, NY 14627 USA",Michigan State University; Michigan State University; University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma - Norman; University of Washington; University of Washington Bothell; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University of Arizona; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; University of Rochester,"Arvai, J (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Environm Sci & Policy Program, 305 Nat Res Bldg, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",sknkwrks@msu.edu,"Robbins, Paul/AAC-3180-2020","Robbins, Paul/0000-0002-2818-4732; Koontz, Tomas/0000-0002-3607-6272; Franzese, Robert/0000-0002-6614-4213; Dolsak, Nives/0000-0002-8325-3155",,,,,17,59,60,0,18,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

Since the climate is changing, there is a growing body of research on the effects of climate change on aeroallergens. The present article provides a rapid review of this literature, highlighting the points of agreement, but also drawing attention to the main mistakes to be avoided. State of art. - For pollen, the prevailing view is that rising temperatures lead to an earlier start to the pollen season, a longer season, increased allergenic potential and higher concentrations. However, there are exceptions: what is true for one taxon, in one place and at one time, can almost never be generalised. For fungal spores, it is even more difficult to state universal rules. Perspectives. - Four priorities can be set for future research: (1) to look for trends only on sufficiently long series and not to neglect possible trend reversals; (2) to give priority to the local scale and the separate consideration of the various pollen and mycological taxa; (3) not to limit oneself to temperature as an element of explanation, but also to consider the other elements of the climate; (4) not to try to explain any evolution in the abundance or seasonality of aeroallergens by climate change alone. Conclusions. - Many more analytical studies giving precedence to observation over reasoning are still required, without any preconceptions, before it is possible to synthesise the impacts of climate change on pollen and, even more so, on fungal spores.

During this time the climate has been highly variable at atmospheric CO2 concentrations of -240 ppm. As yet, ice sheet-climate feedbacks were missing in previous studies. Therefore we use the state-ofthe-art coupled climate-ice sheet model, AWI-ESM-1.2, to investigate the MIS-13 climate and corresponding Northern Hemisphere ice sheet (NHIS) evolution by performing simulations under three different astronomical configurations representing 495, 506 and 517 kyr BP. The simulated excess ice compared to present-day is mainly over the Cordillera, Arctic islands and Tibet. The global mean surface air temperature for the MIS-13 experiments have the same magnitude. At 506 kyr BP with boreal summer at perihelion, the Northern Hemisphere continents are warmer during summer than the other experiments, which could potentially inhibit the development of the ice sheets. The Cordilleran Ice Sheet is found to be especially sensitive to orbital (precession) forcing, at an intermediate CO2 level. This is probably due to its high elevation where the freezing point could be easily maintained. The other ice sheets over northeast America and Eurasia, however, are absent in our simulations. We propose that the alpine-based Cordilleran Ice Sheet is more sensitive and easier to build up than other NHISs in response to the astronomical controlled summer insolation. Dynamic surges are simulated for the Cordilleran Ice Sheet under fixed low orbital forcing. These surges due to internal ice sheet-climate feedbacks could potentially be the mechanism for the millennial scale H-like events.","[Niu, Lu; Lohmann, Gerrit; Gierz, Paul; Gowan, Evan J.; Knorr, Gregor] Alfred Wegener Inst, Helmholtz Zentrum Polar & Meeresforsch, Bussestr 24, D-27570 Bremerhaven, Germany","Helmholtz Association; Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar & Marine Research","Niu, L (corresponding author), Alfred Wegener Inst, Helmholtz Zentrum Polar & Meeresforsch, Bussestr 24, D-27570 Bremerhaven, Germany.",lu.niu@awi.de,,"Niu, Lu/0000-0002-8314-7416; Gowan, Evan/0000-0002-0119-9440","NASA [NNX17AG65G]; NSF [PLR-1603799, PLR-1644277]; AWI via the PACES program; Impuls-und Vernetzungsfonds; HelmholtzExzellenznetzwerke [ExNet-0001-Phase 2-3]; Helmholtz Climate Initiative REKLIM (Regional Climate Change), a joint research project at the Helmholtz Association of German research centers (HGF); PACES-II program at the Alfred Wegener Institute; Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung; Federal Ministry for Education and Research initiative PalMod (project PalMod1.1, BMBF) [01LP1915A]","NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); AWI via the PACES program; Impuls-und Vernetzungsfonds; HelmholtzExzellenznetzwerke; Helmholtz Climate Initiative REKLIM (Regional Climate Change), a joint research project at the Helmholtz Association of German research centers (HGF); PACES-II program at the Alfred Wegener Institute; Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); Federal Ministry for Education and Research initiative PalMod (project PalMod1.1, BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF))","We thank the Max-Planck Institute in Hamburg (Germany) and colleagues from the Alfred-Wegener Institute (AWI) for making ECHAM6JSBACH and FESOM available to us.

However, the use of local ecological knowledge (LEK), which farmers have built up over the years to adopt climate-smart agriculture (CSA) practices, has been less explored by researchers and policy scientists. Leveraging on LEK, this study explores various local CSA practices, their benefits and management constraints and suggests ways to improve local CSA practices to enhance farmers' resilience to climate change (CC). We conducted eight focus group discussions (FGD) in eight farming communities in the Western region of Ghana. The data from the FGD was complemented by secondary data from sources such as peer-reviewed journal articles, organisational websites, and quarterly reports. The study found that farmers used LEK to identify key local CSA practices, including agroforestry, cover cropping, crop rotation, mulching, and mixed cropping. However, some of their farming practices are not consistent with sustainable agricultural practices. Key issues that need immediate attention include (i) limited access to agricultural inputs prevented farmers from adopting CSA, (ii) land tenure issues adversely affected access to arable land for farming, (iii) inadequate agricultural training for farmers on CSA practices, (iv) limited access to agricultural information on CSA options, and (v) high labour-intensive activities for some CSA practices. We maintain that governmental efforts to improve local CSA, and in the context of increasing resilience of farmers and local communities, need to engage relevant stakeholders and communities to formulate and develop an effective climate-smart agricultural action plan. The policy implications of these findings and recommendations for future research are also discussed and documented.","[Mensah, Henry] Brandenburg Univ Technol Cottbus Senftenberg, Law Europe & Environm, Dept Civil & Publ Law, Lehrgebaude 10,Room 525,Erich Weinert Str 1, D-03046 Cottbus, Germany; [Mensah, Henry; Ahadzie, Divine Kwaku] Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Art & Built Environm, Ctr Settlements Studies, Private Mail Bag,Univ Post Off, Kumasi, Ghana; [Takyi, Stephen Appiah; Amponsah, Owusu] Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Art & Built Environm, Dept Planning, Kumasi, Ghana",Brandenburg University of Technology Cottbus; Kwame Nkrumah University Science & Technology; Kwame Nkrumah University Science & Technology,"Mensah, H (corresponding author), Brandenburg Univ Technol Cottbus Senftenberg, Law Europe & Environm, Dept Civil & Publ Law, Lehrgebaude 10,Room 525,Erich Weinert Str 1, D-03046 Cottbus, Germany.;Mensah, H (corresponding author), Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Art & Built Environm, Ctr Settlements Studies, Private Mail Bag,Univ Post Off, Kumasi, Ghana.",hmensah200@yahoo.co.uk,"Mensah, Henry/ABI-4786-2020; Takyi, Stephen Appiah/ABE-3679-2020; Ahadzie, Divine Kwaku/L-7493-2019","Mensah, Henry/0000-0001-8807-9697; Takyi, Stephen Appiah/0000-0001-6025-2515; Ahadzie, Divine Kwaku/0000-0003-4909-7491; Amponsah, Owusu/0000-0002-8131-1913",,,,,72,5,5,2,20,SPRINGERNATURE,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2363-7692,2363-8338,,ENERGY ECOL ENVIRON,Energy Ecol.

Here we use a state-of-the-art ocean data assimilation system to reconstruct water column stratification in the Luzon Strait as a proxy for IW activity in the NSCS and diagnose mechanisms for its variability. Interannual variability of stratification is driven by intrusions of the Kuroshio Current into the Luzon Strait and freshwater fluxes associated with the El Nino-Southern Oscillation. Warming in the upper 100m of the ocean caused a trend of increasing IW activity since 1900, consistent with global climate model experiments that show stratification in the Luzon Strait increases in response to radiative forcing. IW activity is expected to increase in the NSCS through the 21st century, with implications for mitigating climate change impacts on coastal ecosystems.","[DeCarlo, Thomas M.] Massachusetts Inst Technol Woods Hole Oceanog Ins, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [DeCarlo, Thomas M.] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Geol & Geophys, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [Karnauskas, Kristopher B.] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [Davis, Kristen A.] Univ Calif Irvine, Civil & Environm Engn, Irvine, CA USA; [Wong, George T.

Their capacity is being increasingly recognized by international institutions and has been pointed out as crucial in the multi-level government scenario of the European Union (EU). Addressing the challenges of climate change at urban level is a complex issue which requires a holistic approach to strategic urban planning. Understanding why and how cities start action can help to identify the barriers they face when addressing climate change, and how national governments, regions and international bodies can support local authorities in their climate fight. This work aims to contribute to the provision of the knowledge needed to gain a better and deeper insight into urban climate action. The study investigates the state-of-the-art of urban climate plans in Spain and Italy, two countries which share similarities on many levels (i.e. cultural, geographical, climate vulnerabilities, urban configurations and institutional framework). The research analyses cities that are included in the Eurostat Urban Audit (UA), 26 in Spain and 32 in Italy, focusing on the actions taken by large and medium municipalities in reducing their contribution to climate change and becoming more resilient to changing weather patterns. The results of the analysis show a trend towards increasing awareness of climate mitigation (highly focused on energy efficiency and the promotion of cleaner energy sources), while adaptation remains a local policy area in its infancy in both countries. The study also identifies the beneficial influence of national and international climate city networks.","[De Gregorio Hurtado, S.] Tech Univ Madrid, Tech Sch Architecture, Dept Urban & Spatial Planning, Madrid, Spain; [Olazabal, M.] Basque Ctr Climate Change, Leioa, Spain; [Salvia, M.; Pietrapertosa, F.; Di Leo, S.] CNR, Natl Res Council Italy, Inst Methodol Environm Anal, IMAA, I-00185 Rome, Italy; [Olazabal, E.] Univ Lleida, Dept Geog & Sociol, Lleida, Spain; [Geneletti, D.] Univ Trento, Dept Civil Environm & Mech Engn, Trento, Italy; [D'Alonzo, V.] EURAC Res, Inst Renewable Energy, Bolzano, Italy; [Reckien, D.] Univ Twente, Dept Urban & Reg Planning & Geoinformat Managemen, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands",Universidad Politecnica de Madrid; Basque Centre for Climate Change (BC3); Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Metodologie per l'Analisi Ambientale (IMAA-CNR); Universitat de Lleida; University of Trento; European Academy of Bozen-Bolzano; University of Twente,"Hurtado, SD (corresponding author), Tech Univ Madrid, Tech Sch Architecture, Dept Urban & Spatial Planning, Madrid, Spain.",,"di leo, senatro/B-7893-2015; Olazabal, Marta/AFT-6957-2022; Reckien, Diana/P-7348-2015; Salvia, Monica/B-7549-2015; Pietrapertosa, Filomena/ABF-9161-2020; De+Gregorio+Hurtado, Sonia/AAT-3769-2020; Geneletti, Davide/D-5266-2014; Geneletti, Davide/AAH-5407-2019; Pietrapertosa, Filomena/B-7555-2015","di leo, senatro/0000-0003-2627-5726; Olazabal, Marta/0000-0002-3381-0654; Reckien, Diana/0000-0002-1145-9509; Salvia, Monica/0000-0001-8989-0377; De+Gregorio+Hurtado, Sonia/0000-0002-4654-5386; Geneletti, Davide/0000-0002-5528-3365; Geneletti, Davide/0000-0002-5528-3365; Pietrapertosa, Filomena/0000-0001-6519-7105",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (MINECO) [FPDI-2013-16631],Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (MINECO),The authors would like to thank Efren Feliu for his previous contribution in the context of this long-term research.

However, climate change education is accompanied by didactic and pedagogical challenges because, among other reasons, climate change is a complex phenomenon and many people have a psychological distance to the topic. A promising approach to face these challenges is inquiry-based learning (IBL), as several studies show. To date, however, there are barely any empirically tested instructional designs, especially for close-to-science IBL, focusing on climate change. The study presented here therefore addresses the question of how a science propaedeutic seminar for upper secondary schools on the regional implications of climate change should be designed to ensure successful learning processes. Based on the design-based research approach, qualitative research methods (focus group discussions, semi-standardised written teacher surveys, and participant observations) were used to identify target-oriented design guidelines and implementation principles for such seminars. In the seminars, 769 students have so far researched different aspects of climate change in their own regions. The identified design guidelines and implementation principles were further operationalised for teaching practice, so that the research generated both a contribution to theory building and an applicable concept for schools.","[Brumann, Sebastian; Ohl, Ulrike; Schulz, Johannes] Univ Augsburg, Inst Geog, Chair Geog Educ, D-86159 Augsburg, Germany",University of Augsburg,"Brumann, S (corresponding author), Univ Augsburg, Inst Geog, Chair Geog Educ, D-86159 Augsburg, Germany.",sebastian.brumann@geo.uni-augsburg.de; ulrike.ohl@geo.uni-augsburg.de; johannes.schulz@geo.uni-augsburg.de,,,Bavarian State Ministry for Science and Art via the bayklif research network,Bavarian State Ministry for Science and Art via the bayklif research network,This research project is funded by the Bavarian State Ministry for Science and Art via the bayklif research network.,,127,2,2,9,13,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,MAR,2022,6,,,,,,3544,10.3390/su14063544,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14063544,,,29,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,0E0QO,,"gold, Green Published",,,12/21/22,WOS:000776390800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Despite being the most widespread form of music there is a paucity of scholarship on climate change vis-a-vis popular music. In turn, this article explores how popular music may provide a soundtrack that narrates the rapidity of contemporary biophysical change. Approaches of conveying versus communicating climate change in music are considered across a spectrum of musical forms, from contemporary and historical popular music to contemporary classical music and sound art. The article applies the framework of shifting baselines to music engaged with environmental change in order to formulate a closer relationship between objective and quantitative intergenerational biophysical change and subjective and qualitative socio-cultural change. To cease losing track of such inexorable degradation, the article speculates on future musical forms that may obviate such intergenerational myopia by conveying and/or communicating the unprecedented rapidity of biophysical change.","[Wodak, Josh] Univ New South Wales, Fac Art & Design, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney,"Wodak, J (corresponding author), Univ New South Wales, Fac Art & Design, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",j.wodak@unsw.edu.au,,,,,,,45,9,9,1,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1752-4032,1752-4040,,ENVIRON COMMUN,Environ.

Most of RCMs show an increase of cyclone frequency in winter (DJF) and a decrease in summer (JJA) to the end of the 21st century. However, in one half of the RCMs, cyclones become weaker and substantially smaller in winter and deeper and larger in summer. RCMs as well as GCMs show an increase of cyclone frequency over the Baffin Bay, Barents Sea, north of Greenland, Canadian Archipelago, and a decrease over the Nordic Seas, Kara and Beaufort Seas and over the sub-arctic continental regions in winter. In summer, the models simulate an increase of cyclone frequency over the Central Arctic and Greenland Sea and a decrease over the Norwegian and Kara Seas by the end of the 21st century. The decrease is also found over the high-latitude continental areas, in particular, over east Siberia and Alaska. The sensitivity of the RCMs' projections to the boundary conditions and model physics is estimated. In general, different lateral boundary conditions from the GCMs have larger effects on the simulated RCM projections than the differences in RCMs' setup and/or physics.","[Akperov, Mirseid; Mokhov, Igor I.;

The majority of these manifestations are carried out illegally, and they consist of a combination of seemingly disjointed texts, whose main aim is to achieve a sensory distraction, a revolutionary or an anti-system act, instead of having an artistic purpose itself. However, there are other graffiti works that can be considered as masterpieces, since they have an artistic value that is comparable to any piece of art. Another distinctive aspect of graffiti works is its temporary character, so they are ephemeral and non-conservable pieces, since they are exposed to the climate elements. On the one hand, this fact is not necessarily a problem for the vast majority of graffiti, but, in the case of a graffiti masterpiece, it is undeniable that this distinctive feature of mutability, which is an intrinsic part of its artistic objective, should not avoid its correct documentation as a work of art. As its material transience has to be respected, at least, we should document them to preserve its memory and to create a graphic database of urban art masterpieces for future diffusion on other media. The main aim of this contribution is to show different photographic methodologies for the documentation of graffiti on architectural supports. These methodologies have been tested, analysed and evaluated, establishing a suitability criteria according to the conditions in which the works are placed. Finally, some conclusions will be drawn on the different documentation methodologies for these urban artworks, which are often photographed both in their sequence and in their final art, without having an adequate architectural graphic record.",,,,,"Gil Piqueras, Teresa/C-3667-2019","Gil Piqueras, Teresa/0000-0001-8739-3705",,,,,14,0,0,0,0,UNIV L AQUILA,L AQUILA,"PALAZZO CAMPONESCHI, PIAZZA SANTA MARGHERITA 2, L AQUILA, ITALY",1828-5961,,,DISEGNARECON,Disegnarecon,JUN,2020,24,,,,,,,,,,,15,Architecture,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Architecture,VK7OX,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000751945200014,View Full Record in Web of Science

Like many climate models, CCSM employs a coupler, a functional unit that coordinates the exchange of data between parts of the climate system such as the atmosphere and ocean. In this paper we describe the new coupler, cp16, contained in the latest version of CCSM, CCSM3. Cp16 introduces distributed-memory parallelism to the coupler, a class library for important coupler functions, and a standardized interface for component models. Cp16 is implemented entirely in Fortran90 and uses the Model Coupling Toolkit as the base for most of its classes.

Climate sensitive decision-making in companies is vital to addressing the urgent need for making societies resilient to climate change and entailed risks. Providing and using state-of-the-art scientific knowledge in decision-making, an integral aspect of climate services, poses great challenges for climate scientists and decision-makers. This article aims to contribute to more informed decision-making processes in climate adaptation by addressing the question How can climate scientists practically implement a transdisciplinary (TD) collaboration with an industry partner to reduce the gap between climate science and decision-making in industry?. We present an engagement framework that provides guidance to address this question. This framework conceptualizes the engagement using two spheres of interests offering the opportunity to explore and widen their overlap as a common space. We present a case study where we apply this framework to a TD collaboration for climate service provision with a Swiss hydropower industry stakeholder; leading to four practical recommendations for effectively using the proposed framework: (1) Secure an anchor person at management level of the decision-maker entity, (2) Be prepared to invest time into triggering and maintaining active engagement by all collaborators, (3) From the start, communicate the open nature of insights and solutions from the engagement process, (4) Be aware that you are working in a field of tension. The presented engagement framework and practical recommendations are particularly beneficial for climate scientists that are not yet familiar with TD collaborations and enables co-development of bespoke climate services.","[Fischer, Luise J.; Bresch, David N.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Environm Decis, Zurich, Switzerland; [Fischer, Luise J.; Wernli, Heini] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, Zurich, Switzerland; [Bresch, David N.] Fed Off Meteorol & Climatol MeteoSwiss, Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Federal Office of Meteorology & Climatology (MeteoSwiss),"Fischer, LJ (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Environm Decis, Zurich, Switzerland.",luise.fischer@usys.ethz.ch,"Wernli, Heini/F-1099-2016","Wernli, Heini/0000-0001-9674-4837",,,,,58,3,3,1,3,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2405-8807,,,CLIM SERV,Clim.

However, this discourse does not adequately acknowledge that these institutions are dynamic organizations that are responsive to their environments, social norms, and leadership changes, which impact with which communities they engage. This article uses an analysis of the Portland Art Museum (PAM) between 1994 and 2014 to show that a change over time in its leadership and funding climate has ostensibly led to changes in community building in its urban context. Notably, these changes in engagement strategy mirror changes in urban policy preferences at the time, particularly with respect to arts economic development, as articulated by A. J. Ashley (2015). The findings highlight the significant role that funding environment played in how the art museum programmed and how that programming influenced community building. The research also found a strong correlation between the change in programming strategy of PAM and a change in arts economic development policy norms. However, there was no strong evidence that one explicitly influenced the other, suggesting the need for further investigation.","[Meyer, Justin Reeves] Ctr Sci & Ind, Lifelong Learning Grp, Columbus, OH 43215 USA; [Meyer, Justin Reeves] 333 West Broad St, Columbus, OH 43215 USA",,"Meyer, JR (corresponding author), Ctr Sci & Ind, Lifelong Learning Grp, Columbus, OH 43215 USA.;Meyer, JR (corresponding author), 333 West Broad St, Columbus, OH 43215 USA.",jmeyer@cosi.org,,"Meyer, Justin/0000-0002-5471-1225","Museum Studies Program at the University of Michigan, USA","Museum Studies Program at the University of Michigan, USA","This research was supported in part by generous fellowships provided by the Museum Studies Program at the University of Michigan, USA.",,45,0,1,1,5,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0264-2751,1873-6084,,CITIES,Cities,MAY,2019,,,,,59,65,,10.1016/j.cities.2018.12.028,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cities.2018.12.028,,,7,Urban Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Urban Studies,HW1PT,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000466455500006,View Full Record in Web of Science

In the summer of 2011, this voyage, combining boat, water and islands, as well as their inhabitants, became a research site for members of Cape Farewell, an organisation that seeks to produce creative responses to climate change. Crew members specifically sought to consider the impact of climate change on island cultures and ecologies, and the sustainability and preservation initiatives deployed here, as well as broader indicators of climate change in the area. Using participant observation of the voyage and interviews, we examine the bodily experienced, rhythmic aspects of the voyage itself; that is, the aesthetics via which the spaces and places of the Inner and Outer Hebrides became known and felt. We consider especially the rhythms of nature and the sea that encompass the motility of materials that are central to a 'politics of mobility' that, for Cape Farewell, characterises these islands as frontiers of climate change.","[Straughan, Elizabeth; Dixon, Deborah] Univ Glasgow, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland",University of Glasgow,"Straughan, E (corresponding author), Aberystwyth Univ, Inst Geog & Earth Sci, Penglais Campus,Llandinum Bldg, Aberystwyth SY23 3DB, Ceredigion, Wales.",er6@aber.ac.uk,,"Straughan, Elizabeth/0000-0002-5305-2715",AHRC [AH/I500022/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Arts and Humanities Research Council [AH/I500022/1] Funding Source: researchfish,AHRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Arts & Humanities Research Council (AHRC)); Arts and Humanities Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Arts & Humanities Research Council (AHRC)),,,38,8,8,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1745-0101,1745-011X,,MOBILITIES-UK,Mobilities,,2014,3,,SI,,452,478,,10.1080/17450101.2013.844926,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17450101.2013.844926,,,27,Geography; Transportation,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Geography; Transportation,AP8JK,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000342325100008,View Full Record in Web of Science

Our study begins to fill that gap. We examine representations of animals in articles on climate change published over two decades in the most widely read popular science magazine in the world, National Geographic. National Geographic uses a variety of animal representations to make salient the problem of a changing climate. Analysis of 108 photographs and their captions in articles on climate change revealed four major themes: vulnerability of wildlife to climate change, representation of animals as specimens in climate change adaptation and conservation, the contribution of food animal consumption to climate change, and the vulnerability of the livelihoods of draft animals (sled dogs) and their human companions to climate change. We conclude that popular science is contributing to an expanded public discourse on climate change that extends beyond the vulnerability of iconic wild megafauna to include insects and amphibians and issues facing the relationship we have with other animals, such as the widespread consumption of animals for food.","[Whitley, Cameron Thomas] Michigan State Univ, Dept Sociol, 509 E Circle Dr,316 Berkey Hall, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Kalof, Linda] Michigan State Univ, Sociol, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Kalof, Linda] Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Michigan State University; Michigan State University; Michigan State University,"Whitley, CT (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Sociol, 509 E Circle Dr,316 Berkey Hall, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",cwhitley@msu.edu,,,National Science Foundation [SES-1247824],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"Cameron Thomas Whitley is a doctoral student in the Department of Sociology at Michigan State University.

It begins by considering the centrality of negativity to the historical project of critical theory most forcefully pursued by Adorno as 'negative dialectics.' Subsequent varieties of postmodern critique fairly dispensed with dialectics variously favouring complexity and an overriding emphasis on textuality. With the birth of neoliberalism and its burgeoning emphasis on 'the contemporary', economic values begin to penetrate every aspect of contemporary life and experience, including art and culture. Contemporary capitalism dematerialised as financialisation now comprises a naturalised ambience that is both everywhere and nowhere. Capitalist ambience is echoed in contemporary art that suggests criticality and yet seems to side with the imagery, values and logics of the prevailing financial order. The naturalisation of the neoliberal order is further internalised by artists online. Exacerbated contemporary emphasis on the 'self as entrepreneur' coincides with the biopolitical transformation of the contemporary artist into an individual 'enterprise unit'. This is particularly observable online on social media where an artist's whole life is simultaneously the subject and object of art. Criticality in art does not disappear but becomes 'self-annulling': it acts as a conduit questioning the commodity-identity of art while pointing to phenomena and affects outside the art world. With the recent appearance of the COVID-19 virus, added to the unignorable impact of global climate change, 'real nature' assumes a critical role, undermining neoliberalism's ideological naturalisation while laying-bare the extent of its structural contradictions. Art criticality is revivified by divesting from art contexts saturated with neoliberal imperatives. Criticality is negatively practiced as an 'un-' or 'not-doing', defining modes of exodus while, crucially, not abandoning art's institutional definition altogether.","[Gawronski, Alexander] Univ Sydney, Sydney Coll Arts SCA, Fac Arts & Social Sci FASS, Sch Literature Art & Media SLAM, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University of Sydney,"Gawronski, A (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Sydney Coll Arts SCA, Fac Arts & Social Sci FASS, Sch Literature Art & Media SLAM, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",alex.gawronski@sydney.edu.au,,,,,,,103,1,1,0,4,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-0752,,ARTS,Arts,MAR,2021,1,,,,,,11,10.3390/arts10010011,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/arts10010011,,,26,"Humanities, Multidisciplinary",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Arts & Humanities - Other Topics,RC8CF,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000633021300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The meridional ocean heat transport (OHT) can be decomposed into the contributions from the Euler mean circulation, bolus circulation, sub-mesoscale circulation and dissipation. The Euler mean heat transport dominates the total OHT in most latitudes, except that in the Southern Ocean (40-50 degrees S) where the OHT is determined by the eddy-induced circulation and dissipation. In the Indo-Pacific the OHT is fulfilled by the wind-driven circulation, which dominates the total global OHT in the tropics. In the Atlantic the OHT is carried by both the wind-driven circulation and the thermohaline circulation, and the latter dominates the total OHT in the midhigh latitudes. The meridional atmosphere heat transport consists of the dry static energy (DSE) and latent energy (LE) transport. In the tropics the LE transport is equatorward and compensates partially the poleward DSE transport. In the extratropics, the LE and DSE are poleward and reinforce one another, both of which are dominated by the eddy components. The LE transport can be considered as the joint air-sea mode since the ocean controls the moisture supply. It can be also precisely obtained from the evaporation minus precipitation over the ocean and thus this work quantifies the individual ocean basin contributions to the LE transport.","[Yang, Haijun; Li, Qing; Wang, Kun; Sun, Yu; Sun, Daoxun] Peking Univ, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Sch Phys, Lab Climate & Ocean Atmosphere Studies LaCOAS, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China",Peking University,"Yang, HJ (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Sch Phys, Lab Climate & Ocean Atmosphere Studies LaCOAS, 209 Chengfu Rd, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",hjyang@pku.edu.cn,"Li, Qing/I-5479-2019; Wang, Kun/AAE-8410-2022","Li, Qing/0000-0002-6464-0977; Wang, Kun/0000-0003-1980-9697","NSF of China [40976007, 41176002, 41376007]; National Basic Research Program of China [2012CB955200]; Special Fund for Meteorological Scientific Research in the Public Interest of CMA [GYHY201006022]; Norwegian Research Council through East Asian DecCen project [193690/S30]",NSF of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Basic Research Program of China(National Basic Research Program of China); Special Fund for Meteorological Scientific Research in the Public Interest of CMA; Norwegian Research Council through East Asian DecCen project,"We are grateful to Profs.

It is shown that fluctuations produced by these processes supply the slow climate components with energy through non-linear processes. As a consequence, the variability behavior in an integration with a complex model that represents these small-scale processes is generally different from that in an integration with a simple model that neglects these processes.","Univ Hamburg, Inst Meteorol, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany",University of Hamburg,"von Storch, JS (corresponding author), Univ Hamburg, Inst Meteorol, Bundesstr 55, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany.",,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,1,BIRKHAUSER VERLAG AG,BASEL,"VIADUKSTRASSE 40-44, PO BOX 133, CH-4010 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,,3-7643-6520-X,PROG PROBAB,,,2001,,,,,101,116,,,,,,16,"Mathematics, Applied; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences; Statistics & Probability",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Mathematics; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,BS47H,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000169962700003,View Full Record in Web of Science

It examines the degree to which the professional autonomy of the artists (and curator) was instrumentalized and diminished as a result of having to fit into normative frames set by institutional agendas (in this case, that of the neoliberal university). We ask to what extent do such entanglements, feel more like enstranglements, suffocating the artist's capacity to envision the world afresh or any differently? What kinds of pressures allow for certain kinds of evidence to be read and made visible, (and not others)? Are You Feeling Better? was a 2016 programme curated by Frances Williams, challenging simplistic expectations that the arts hold any automatic power of their own to make things better in healthcare. It included two performative projects - The Secret Society of Imperfect Nurses, by Anthony Schrag with student nurses at Kings College London, and Hiding in Plain Sight by Becky Shaw (plus film with Rose Butler) with doctoral researchers in nursing and midwifery. These projects were situated in a climate of United Kingdom National Health Service cuts and austerity measures where the advancement of social prescribing looks dangerously like the government abnegating responsibility and offering art as amelioration. The text therefore examines the critical stage on which these arts-health projects were performed and the extent to which critical reflection is welcomed within institutional contexts, how learning is framed, expressed aesthetically, as well as understood as art practice (as much as education or learning). It further examines how artistic projects might offer sites of resistance, rejection and mechanisms of support against constricting institutional norms and practices that seek to instrumentalise artistic works to their own ends.","[Williams, Frances] Wrexham Glyndwr Univ, Fac Arts Sci & Technol FAST, Wrexham, Wales; [Shaw, Becky] Sheffield Hallam Univ, Dept Art & Design, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Schrag, Anthony] Queen Margaret Univ, Sch Arts Social Sci & Management, Musselburgh, Scotland",Sheffield Hallam University; Queen Margaret University,"Shaw, B (corresponding author), Sheffield Hallam Univ, Dept Art & Design, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England.;Schrag, A (corresponding author), Queen Margaret Univ, Sch Arts Social Sci & Management, Musselburgh, Scotland.",b.shaw@shu.ac.uk; ASchrag@qmu.ac.uk,,,,,,,33,0,0,0,0,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-1078,,,FRONT PSYCHOL,Front.

This investigation takes into account evidence from the Earth's history, from climate models and our understanding of the physical processes governing climate shifts. Sudden alterations to climate forcing seem to be improbable, with sudden changes instead most likely to arise from climate feedbacks. Based on projections from models validated against historical events, dramatic changes in ocean circulation appear unlikely. Ecosystem climate feedbacks clearly have the potential to induce sudden change, but are relatively poorly understood at present. More probable sudden changes are large increases in the frequency of summer heatwaves and changes resulting from feedbacks involving hydrology. These include ice sheet decay, which may be set in motion this century. The most devastating consequences are likely to occur further in the future, however. Reductions in subtropical precipitation are likely to be the most severe hydrologic effects this century, with rapid changes due to the feedbacks of relatively well-understood large-scale circulation patterns. Water stress may become particularly acute in the Southwest US and Mexico, and in the Mediterranean and Middle East, where rainfall decreases of 10 25% (regionally) and up to 40% (locally) are projected.","Columbia Univ, NASA, Goddard Inst Space Studies, New York, NY 10025 USA",Columbia University; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center,"Shindell, D (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, NASA, Goddard Inst Space Studies, 2880 Broadway, New York, NY 10025 USA.",dshindell@giss.nasa.gov,"Shindell, Drew/D-4636-2012","Shindell, Drew/0000-0003-1552-4715",,,,,74,20,20,0,15,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",1364-503X,1471-2962,,PHILOS T R SOC A,Philos.

Since emission intensity varies greatly between different foods, changing food choices towards those with lower GHGE could make an important contribution to mitigating climate change. Public engagement events offer an opportunity to communicate these multifaceted issues and raise awareness about the climate change impact of food choices. An interdisciplinary team of researchers was preparing food and climate change educational activities for summer 2020. However, the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown disrupted these plans. In this paper, we report on shifting these events online over the month of June 2020. We discuss what we did and the reception to our online programme. We then reflect on and highlight issues that arose. These relate to: (1) the power dynamics of children, diet and climate change; (2) mental health, diet and COVID-19; (3) engaging the wider science, agriculture and food communities; (4) the benefits of being unfunded and the homemade nature of this programme; (5) the food system, STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics) and diversity; and (6) how our work fits into our ongoing journey of food and climate change education.","[Kluczkovski, A.; Lait, R.; Martins, C.

The Economics of Climate Change. HM Treasury, London, p. 188]. The total cost of climate change was estimated to be equivalent to a one-off, permanent 5-20% loss in global mean per-capita consumption today. And the marginal damage cost of a tonne of carbon emitted today was estimated to be around $312 [p. 344]. Both of these estimates are higher than most reported in the previous literature. Subsequently, a number of critiques have appeared, arguing that discounting is the principal explanation for this discrepancy. Discounting is important, but in this paper we emphasise that how one approaches the economics of risk and uncertainty, and how one attempts to model the very closely related issue of low-probability/high-damage scenarios (which we connect to the recent discussion of 'dangerous' climate change), can matter just as much. We demonstrate these arguments empirically, using the same models applied in the Stern Review. Together, the issues of risk and uncertainty on the one hand, and 'dangerous' climate change on the other, raise very strongly questions about the limits of a welfare-economic approach, where the loss of natural capital might be irreversible and impossible to compensate. Thus we also critically reflect on the state-of-the-art in integrated assessment modelling. There will always be an imperative to carry out integrated assessment modelling, bringing together scientific 'fact' and value judgement systematically. But we agree with those cautioning against a literal interpretation of current estimates. Ironically, the Stern Review is one of those voices. A fixation with cost-benefit analysis misses the point that arguments for stabilisation should, and are, built on broader foundations. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Accordingly, there is a rapidly increasing body of research reporting on the impacts of climatic stressors on cultural heritage and on the assessment of climate change impacts on cultural heritage assets. This review synthesizes the international literature on climate change impacts on tangible cultural heritage by developing hazard-impact diagrams focusing on the impacts of gradual changes in climate on: (1) the cultural heritage exposed to the outside environment, (2) the interiors of historical buildings and their collections, and (3) a third diagram associated with climate change and the impacts due to sudden changes in the natural physical environment (e.g., storm surges, floods and landslides, wildfire) in addition to sea level rise, permafrost thawing, desertification and changes in the properties of the oceans. These diagrams, which depict the relationships between various stressors and their impacts on cultural heritage, will allow other researchers, stakeholders, and potentially decision makers to determine the potential impacts of climate change on a specific cultural heritage asset without a separate examination of the literature. This review thus provides the current state-of-the-art on the impacts of climate change on the tangible, built heritage, that is, monuments, archeological sites, historical buildings, as well as their interiors and the collections they hold, highlights the limitations of previous research, and provides recommendations for further studies.

By motivating an ideology of discrimination of the feedstock (concept of historical materialism) the contemporary artistic object caused a split between the public and art. The series of artistic actions that generated public debates in recent decades have called into question the ethical - aesthetic balance able to restore the balance of moral and behavioral values in art, where we can see, the signs of an ethic psychopathology: rudeness, lack of faith, despair, catastrophic visions, aggression. We wonder whether the contemporary artist's work can be a phenomenon of the multiple moral incarnations able to respond positively to our wishes, aspirations, beliefs, and if the artist wants a reconsideration of balance, order and harmony able to lead us to perfection, state of well being and beauty? Nowadays, we can see a slight imbalance between art and moral education, but we cannot say that art is moral or immoral in its nature.","[Baba, Dorin] Univ Alexandru Ioan Cuza, Iasi, Romania",Alexandru Ioan Cuza University,"Baba, D (corresponding author), Univ Alexandru Ioan Cuza, Iasi, Romania.",,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,0,EDITURA TRACUS ARTE,BUCHAREST,"STR PICTOR SAVA HENTIA NR 2, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 011162, ROMANIA",1841-5377,2247-8353,,PHILOL JASSYENSIA,Philol.

Contemporary art therapy research practices are reviewed in 8 notable areas: effectiveness, salience, functionality, appropriateness, safeness, cost-effectiveness, program satisfaction, and acceptance. Substantiating the knowledge base in these areas will expand the evidence base for art therapy and provide practical strategies for future studies. Recommendations for integrating arts-informed and arts-based research are considered.

Though it brought numerous benefits, a great number of problems ensued such as resources depletion, pollution to the environment, species extinction, and global scale warming-up and climate change, etc. Over the recent years, environmental problems have worsened, consequences of environmental damages turned disastrous and catastrophes hit the world every now and then-promising to bring more sufferings and endangering the livelihood of the next generation. It is proven that through guidance of related courses, people would start to be more sensible towards environment. In this research, experimental design pattern is adopted. As for the experimental subjects, 312 primary school students in Jiangxi Province participated in the research. According to experiment result: (1) Environmental Art education could significantly influence over environment awareness; (2) natural experiences could significantly influence over environment awareness; (3) Environmental art education and natural experiences have differential influences over environment awareness increment. Afterwards, advices were put forth in light with the results in the expectance of offering access for students to environmental art through natural experience activities, leading them to a most authentic and a perfect natural world, enabling them to be aware of environment ever since, rather than to left blank memory for nature when grow up.","[Ding, Lei] East China Jiaotong Univ, Coll Art, Nanchang, Jiangxi, Peoples R China",East China Jiaotong University,"Ding, L (corresponding author), East China Jiaotong Univ, Coll Art, Nanchang, Jiangxi, Peoples R China.",1647479329@qq.com,,,,,,,16,0,0,3,17,SCIBULCOM LTD,SOFIA,"PO BOX 249, 1113 SOFIA, BULGARIA",1311-5065,,,J ENVIRON PROT ECOL,J.

Their projections are used in integrated assessments of climate change. Here we test, for the first time, systematically across many important systems, how well such impact models capture the impacts of extreme climate conditions. Using the 2003 European heat wave and drought as a historical analogue for comparable events in the future, we find that a majority of models underestimate the extremeness of impacts in important sectors such as agriculture, terrestrial ecosystems, and heat-related human mortality, while impacts on water resources and hydropower are overestimated in some river basins; and the spread across models is often large. This has important implications for economic assessments of climate change impacts that rely on these models. It also means that societal risks from future extreme events may be greater than previously thought.","[Schewe, Jacob; Reyer, Christopher; Buechner, Matthias; Frieler, Katja; Gerten, Dieter; Mueller, Christoph; Ostberg, Sebastian; Volkholz, Jan; Warszawski, Lila] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Member Leibniz Assoc, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany; [Gosling, Simon N.] Univ Nottingham, Sch Geog, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Zhao, Fang] East China Normal Univ, Sch Geog Sci, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China; [Ciais, Philippe; Vautard, Robert; Chang, Jinfeng; Wang, Xuhui] UVSQ, CNRS, CEA, Lab Sci Climat & Environm, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Elliott, Joshua] Univ Chicago, 5735S Ellis Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Elliott, Joshua] ANL Computat Inst, 5735S Ellis Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Francois, Louis] Univ Liege, Inst Astrophys & Geophys, UR SPHERES, B-4000 Liege, Belgium; [Huber, Veronika] Univ Pablo de Olavide, Dept Phys Chem & Nat Syst, Ctra de Utrera 1, Seville 41013, Spain; [Lotze, Heike K.; Eddy, Tyler D.; Tittensor, Derek P.] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Biol, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada; [Seneviratne, Sonia, I; Gudmundsson, Lukas] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Land Climate Dynam, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [van Vliet, Michelle T.

The project was an after-school program that combined hands-on climate change educational activities with photovoice, a participatory action research method that uses digital photography as the basis for problem identification, group dialogue, and social change action. Grounded in transformative sustainability learning theory and integrated with an arts-based participatory action research methodology, the program was designed to strengthen children's climate change awareness and sense of agency through youth-led action projects. After describing the program, this article details the collaborative action projects designed and carried out by 10- to 12-year-olds in each community (e.g., policy advocacy, tree-planting, community garden) as well as how the program facilitated children's constructive climate change engagement through children's enjoyment and agentic action.

These large climate ensembles drive two dynamical and spatially explicit epidemiological malaria models to provide future hazard projections for the focus region of eastern Africa. While the two malaria models produce very distinct transmission patterns for the recent climate, their response to future climate change is similar in terms of sign and spatial distribution, with malaria transmission moving to higher altitudes in the East African Community (EAC) region, while transmission reduces in lowland, marginal transmission zones such as South Sudan. The climate model ensemble generally projects warmer and wetter conditions over EAC. The simulated malaria response appears to be driven by temperature rather than precipitation effects. This reduces the uncertainty due to the climate models, as precipitation trends in tropical regions are very diverse, projecting both drier and wetter conditions with the current state-of-the-art climate model ensemble. The magnitude of the projected changes differed considerably between the two dynamical malaria models, with one much more sensitive to climate change, highlighting that uncertainty in the malaria projections is also associated with the disease modelling approach.","[Leedale, Joseph; Morse, Andrew P.] Univ Liverpool, Sch Environm Sci, Liverpool L69 3GE, Merseyside, England; [Tompkins, Adrian M.] Abdus Salam Int Ctr Theoret Phys, Trieste, Italy; [Caminade, Cyril; Jones, Anne E.] Univ Liverpool, Inst Infect & Global Hlth, Dept Epidemiol & Populat Hlth, Liverpool L69 3BX, Merseyside, England; [Nikulin, Grigory] Swedish Meteorol & Hydrol Inst, Rossby Ctr, S-60176 Norrkoping, Sweden; [Morse, Andrew P.] Natl Inst Hlth Res, Hlth Protect Res Unit Emerging & Zoonot Infect, Liverpool, Merseyside, England",University of Liverpool; Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP); University of Liverpool; Swedish Meteorological & Hydrological Institute; University of Liverpool,"Leedale, J (corresponding author), Univ Liverpool, Sch Environm Sci, Liverpool L69 3GE, Merseyside, England.",j.leedale@liverpool.ac.uk,"Tompkins, Adrian/N-6472-2013","Tompkins, Adrian/0000-0003-0975-6691; Morse, Andrew/0000-0002-0413-2065; Leedale, Joseph/0000-0001-9010-4126; Caminade, Cyril/0000-0002-3846-7082",HEALTHY FUTURES EU-FP7 project [266327]; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research [01LS1201]; Farr Institute for Health Informatics Research (MRC) [MR/M0501633/1],HEALTHY FUTURES EU-FP7 project; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); Farr Institute for Health Informatics Research (MRC),"the authors acknowledge funding support from the HEALTHY FUTURES EU-FP7 project (grant agreement 266327).

We analyzed irrigation as an adaptation measure to ensure the future sustainability of olive tree yields in Alentejo, the main olive producing area in Portugal. A dynamic crop model was used to simulate olive tree yields over the baseline (1981-2005) and two future scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, 2021-2080), using a 4 member-ensemble of state-of-the-art climate model chains. Climate change projections point to an increase in mean temperature (of up to 2 degrees C by 2080) and potential evapotranspiration (40 - 50 mm), while a decrease in precipitation (-80 to -90 mm) and actual evapotranspiration (-50 to - 70 mm), under both future scenarios. Future yield decreases 15-20% (for RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) and accumulated losses can reach -8 t/ha to -10 t/ha by 2080. This decrease is due to enhanced heat and water stress under future climate conditions. As an adaptation measure, irrigation was simulated, but only applied at a certain water stress level. The results indicate higher yields due to this adaptation strategy, in range with the present values (+/- 1%), thus alleviating the projected yield decreases in the future. The amount of water required for irrigation ranges from 60 to 85 mm, depending on the RCP, which corresponds to 0.6-1 times the projected decrease in precipitation. However, this value can reach up to 2 times for one climate model chain. We conclude that while irrigation is a feasible adaptation measure against the threats of climate change in Alentejo olive orchards, this strategy may be threatened by the scarcity of water resources. Outlining appropriate, timely and cost-effective adaptation measures is critical for the sustainability of both the environment and the Alentejo olive sector.","[Fraga, Helder; Santos, Joao A.] Univ Tras Os Montes & Alto Douro UTAD, Ctr Res & Technol Agroenvironm & Biol Sci CITAB, Vila Real, Portugal; [Fraga, Helder; Pinto, Joaquim G.] Karlsruhe Inst Technol KIT, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res IMK TRO, Karlsruhe, Germany",University of Tras-os-Montes & Alto Douro; Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology,"Fraga, H (corresponding author), Univ Tras Os Montes & Alto Douro UTAD, Ctr Res & Technol Agroenvironm & Biol Sci CITAB, Vila Real, Portugal.;Fraga, H (corresponding author), Karlsruhe Inst Technol KIT, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res IMK TRO, Karlsruhe, Germany.",hfraga@utad.pt,"Fraga, Helder/D-8507-2012; Santos, João Andrade/G-8805-2011; Pinto, Joaquim G/A-7352-2009","Fraga, Helder/0000-0002-7946-8786; Santos, João Andrade/0000-0002-8135-5078; Pinto, Joaquim G/0000-0002-8865-1769",FCT -Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [CEECIND/00447/2017]; CoaClimateRisk FCT Project [COA/CAC/0030/2019]; National Funds by FCT [UIDB/04033/2020]; AXA Research Fund,FCT -Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology(Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology); CoaClimateRisk FCT Project; National Funds by FCT(Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology); AXA Research Fund(AXA Research Fund),"Helder Fraga thanks the FCT -Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology for contract CEECIND/00447/2017.

If university campuses are considered as 'living labs for connecting the nexus energy, climate and sustainable development', it is a necessary step to consider the dynamics of the people (living organisms) that circulate in these areas; how they interact with each other and the surrounding environment; as well as the inner/embodied aspects of sustainability which compose their perception of the environment. Furthermore, it is fundamental to find creative forms in which awareness and engagement towards the environment can be enhanced and improved.

Contribution of Working Group I to the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press) pp 659-740). For both GHGs, the present-day budget is dominated by anthropogenic emissions (Friedlingstein P et al 2019 Earth Syst. Sci. Data 11 1783-838; Saunois M et al 2020 Earth Syst. Sci. Data 12 1561-623). For CO2 it is well established that the projected future rise in atmospheric concentration is near exclusively determined by anthropogenic emissions (Ciais P et al 2013 Climate Change 2013: The Physical Science Basis. Contribution of Working Group I to the Fifth Assessment Report of the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press) pp 465-570). For methane, this appears to be the common assumption, too, but whether this assumption is true has never been shown conclusively. Here, we investigate the evolution of atmospheric methane until 3000 CE under five Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) scenarios, for the first time using a methane-enabled state-of-the-art Earth System Model (ESM). We find that natural methane emissions, i.e. methane emissions from the biosphere, rise strongly as a reaction to climate warming, thus leading to atmospheric methane concentrations substantially higher than assumed in the scenarios used for CMIP6. We also find that the natural emissions become larger than the anthropogenic ones in most scenarios, showing that natural emissions cannot be neglected.","[Kleinen, Thomas; Brovkin, Victor] Max Planck Inst Meteorol, Bundesstr 53, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany; [Gromov, Sergey; Steil, Benedikt] Max Planck Inst Chem, Hahn Meitner Weg 1, D-55128 Mainz, Germany",Max Planck Society; Max Planck Society,"Kleinen, T (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Meteorol, Bundesstr 53, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany.",thomas.kleinen@mpimet.mpg.de,"Brovkin, Victor/C-2803-2016; Kleinen, Thomas/G-5666-2018; Gromov, Sergey/G-1224-2013","Brovkin, Victor/0000-0001-6420-3198; Kleinen, Thomas/0000-0001-9550-5164; Gromov, Sergey/0000-0002-2542-3005","project Palmod - German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) [01LP1921A, 01LP1921B]; Scientific Steering Committee (WLA) [bm1030]; CMIP6; ESGF",project Palmod - German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); Scientific Steering Committee (WLA); CMIP6; ESGF,"We acknowledge the World Climate Research Programme, which, through its Working Group on Coupled Modelling, coordinated and promoted CMIP6.

Here we show, with a fully coupled state-of-the-art climate model, that closing the Bering Strait and preventing its throughflow between the Pacific and Arctic Oceans during the glacial period can lead to the emergence of stronger hysteresis behavior of the ocean conveyor belt circulation to create conditions that are conducive to triggering abrupt climate transitions.

Here, a coupled state-of-the-art Earth system model with an interactive carbon cycle (BNU-ESM) was used to investigate whether this proportionality extends to the complex Earth system model and to examine the climate system responses to different emission pathways with a common emission budget of man-made CO2. These new simulations show that, relative to the lower emissions earlier and higher emissions later (LH) scenario, the amount of carbon sequestration by the land and the ocean will be larger and Earth will experience earlier warming of climate under the higher emissions earlier and lower emissions later (HL) scenario. The processes within the atmosphere, land, and cryosphere, which are highly sensitive to climate, show a relatively linear relationship to cumulative CO2 emissions and will attain similar states under both scenarios, mainly because of the negative feedback between the radiative forcing and ocean heat uptake. However, the processes with larger internal inertias depend on both the CO2 emissions scenarios and the emission budget, such as ocean warming and sea level rise.","[Tian, Di; Zhang, Han] Second Inst Oceanog, State Key Lab Satellite Ocean Environm Dynam, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Tian, Di; Yan, Xiaodong; Chou, Jieming; Yang, Shili; Guo, Yan; Yang, Zhiyong] Beijing Normal Univ, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Dong, Wenjie] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Atmospher Sci, 19 XinJieKouWai St, Guangzhou 510000, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Dong, Wenjie] Beijing Normal Univ, Future Earth Res Inst, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Zhuhai, Peoples R China; [Wei, Ting] Chinese Acad Meteorol Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Han] Xiamen Univ, Coll Ocean & Earth Sci, State Key Lab Marine Environm Sci, Xiamen, Peoples R China; [Wen, Xiaohang] Chengdu Univ Informat Technol, Coll Atmospher Sci, Plateau Atmosphere & Environm Key Lab Sichuan Pro, Chengdu, Peoples R China",Ministry of Natural Resources of the People's Republic of China; Second Institute of Oceanography (SIO); Beijing Normal University; Sun Yat Sen University; Beijing Normal University; Beijing Normal University Zhuhai; Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences (CAMS); Xiamen University; Chengdu University of Information Technology,"Dong, WJ (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Atmospher Sci, 19 XinJieKouWai St, Guangzhou 510000, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",dongwj@bnu.edu.cn,"Zhang, Han/C-6188-2011","Zhang, Han/0000-0002-8155-427X; Yan, Xiaodong/0000-0002-0774-9140","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41330527, 41505068]; Key Laboratory of Earth Surface Processes and Resource Ecology [2013-ZY-02]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Key Laboratory of Earth Surface Processes and Resource Ecology,"This work was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41330527), the Key Laboratory of Earth Surface Processes and Resource Ecology (2013-ZY-02), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41505068).",,45,14,14,2,45,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693, UNITED STATES",0894-8755,1520-0442,,J CLIMATE,J.

State of the art climate prediction uses Earth system models (ESMs), driven by systems of differential equations representing the laws of physics. Previously, these models have tended to underestimate Arctic sea ice loss. The issue is grave because accurate modeling is critical for economic, ecological, and geopolitical planning. We use machine learning techniques, including random forest regression and Gini importance, to show that the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) relies too heavily on just one of the ten chosen climatological quantities to predict September sea ice averages. Furthermore, E3SM gives too much importance to six of those quantities when compared to observed data.

The principal expression of the PETM in the geological record is a large and rapid negative excursion in the carbon isotopic composition of carbonates and organic matter from both marine and terrestrial environments. Palaeotemperature proxy data from across the PETM indicate a coincident increase in global surface temperatures of approximately 5-6 degrees C. Reliable estimates of atmospheric CO2 changes and global warming through past transient climate events can provide an important test of the climate sensitivities reproduced by state-of-the-art atmosphere-ocean general circulation models. Here, we synthesize the available carbon-cycle model estimates of the magnitude of the carbon input to the ocean-atmosphere-biosphere system, and the consequent atmospheric pCO(2) perturbation, through the PETM. We also review the theoretical mass balance arguments and available sedimentary evidence for the role of massive methane hydrate dissociation in this event. The plausible range of carbon mass input, approximately 4000-7000 PgC, strongly suggests a major alternative source of carbon in addition to any contribution from methane hydrates. We find that the potential range of PETM atmospheric pCO(2) increase, combined with proxy estimates of the PETM temperature anomaly, does not necessarily imply climate sensitivities beyond the range of state-of-the-art climate models.","[Dunkley Jones, T.; Maslin, M.

Our confidence in projections depends, in part, on how realistically they simulate present day climate and associated variability over a range of time scales. Traditionally, climate models are less commonly assessed at time scales relevant to daily weather systems. Here we explore the utility of a self-organizing maps (SOMs) procedure for evaluating the frequency, persistence and transitions of daily synoptic systems in the Australian region simulated by state-of-the-art global climate models. In terms of skill in simulating the climatological frequency of synoptic systems, large spread was observed between models. A positive association between all metrics was found, implying that relative skill in simulating the persistence and transitions of systems is related to skill in simulating the climatological frequency. Considering all models and metrics collectively, model performance was found to be related to model horizontal resolution but unrelated to vertical resolution or representation of the stratosphere. In terms of the SOM procedure, the timespan over which evaluation was performed had some influence on model performance skill measures, as did the number of circulation types examined. These findings have implications for selecting models most useful for future projections over the Australian region, particularly for projections related to synoptic scale processes and phenomena. More broadly, this study has demonstrated the utility of the SOMs procedure in providing a process-based evaluation of climate models.","[Gibson, Peter B.; Perkins-Kirkpatrick, Sarah E.; Alexander, Lisa V.; Pitman, Andrew J.] Univ New South Wales, Climate Change Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Gibson, Peter B.; Perkins-Kirkpatrick, Sarah E.; Alexander, Lisa V.; Pitman, Andrew J.] Univ New South Wales, ARC Ctr Excellence Climate Syst Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Uotila, Petteri] Finnish Meteorol Inst, Helsinki, Finland",University of New South Wales Sydney; ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science; University of New South Wales Sydney; Finnish Meteorological Institute,"Gibson, PB (corresponding author), Univ New South Wales, Climate Change Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.;Gibson, PB (corresponding author), Univ New South Wales, ARC Ctr Excellence Climate Syst Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",peter.gibson@unsw.edu.au,"Alexander, Lisa V/A-8477-2011; Uotila, Petteri/A-1703-2012; Perkins-Kirkpatrick, Sarah E/O-5042-2015; Pitman, Andrew J/A-7353-2011","Alexander, Lisa V/0000-0002-5635-2457; Uotila, Petteri/0000-0002-2939-7561; Perkins-Kirkpatrick, Sarah E/0000-0001-9443-4915; Pitman, Andrew J/0000-0003-0604-3274; Gibson, Peter/0000-0003-2095-5165",Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science [CE110001028]; Australian Postgraduate Award; Australian Research Council Discovery Early Career Researcher Award [DE140100952],Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science(Australian Research Council); Australian Postgraduate Award(Australian Government); Australian Research Council Discovery Early Career Researcher Award(Australian Research Council),"This work was supported by the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science Grant CE110001028.

The competing roles of both are usually studied by means of state-of-the-art global climate models (GCM) due to the complexity in the atmospheric processes and interactions involved. The main objective of this paper is to determine whether quantitatively similar results can be achieved using a simpler, medium-complexity GCM. This includes addressing the sensitivity of the medium-complexity model to changes in GHG and ozone concentrations as well as looking into the plausible mechanisms driving such patterns of variations in atmospheric circulation, precipitation and temperature extremes. Two sets of simulations are performed: one with fixed sea surface temperatures (SST) and another one making use of a mixed-layer ocean model coupled to the GCM. Results show that the GCM is highly sensitive to changes in the atmospheric composition, and that the largest differences are found when SST are allowed to vary accordingly, particularly in the case of temperature extremes. Specific analyses are also performed on changes in subtropical precipitation over the continental regions of the SH, with moisture budget decomposition being applied in order to provide explanations for the rainfall changes described in the manuscript.","[Saurral, Ramiro I.; Raggio, Gabriela A.] Univ Buenos Aires, CONICET, CIMA, Int Guiraldes 2160,Ciudad Univ,Pab 2,C1428EGA, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Saurral, Ramiro I.] Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Ciencias Exactas & Nat, DCAO, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Saurral, Ramiro I.; Raggio, Gabriela A.] UBA, CONICET, CNRS, UMI,IFAECI, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Kucharski, Fred] Abdus Salaam Int Ctr Theoret Phys, Earth Syst Phys Sect, Trieste, Italy; [Kucharski, Fred] King Abdulaziz Univ, Dept Meteorol, Ctr Excellence Climate Change Res, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia",Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); University of Buenos Aires; University of Buenos Aires; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); University of Buenos Aires; Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP); King Abdulaziz University,"Saurral, RI (corresponding author), Univ Buenos Aires, CONICET, CIMA, Int Guiraldes 2160,Ciudad Univ,Pab 2,C1428EGA, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.;Saurral, RI (corresponding author), Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Ciencias Exactas & Nat, DCAO, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.;Saurral, RI (corresponding author), UBA, CONICET, CNRS, UMI,IFAECI, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",saurral@cima.fcen.uba.ar,,"Raggio, Gabriela/0000-0002-6477-2371; Saurral, Ramiro/0000-0002-8600-199X",,,,,40,2,2,0,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0930-7575,1432-0894,,CLIM DYNAM,Clim.

To mobilize people for this transformation and press for policy reforms, socio-environmental movements combine strategies from art and activism. While existing studies conceptualise this phenomenon asartivism, empirical research on the design, function, and reception of social movements' artivist practices remains scarce . Therefore, this article examines the socio-environmental movement Extinction Rebellion's (xR) art-actions. Through visual analysis and focus group research, it analyses five of XR's recent art-actions in the Netherlands, their design and their reception among the activists and their target group. Drawing on Susanne C. Moser ' s ten tasks for transformative climate change communication , we argue that XR's art-actions use principles of transformative communication to serve movement-external goals, such as awareness-raising and mobilization, as well as movement-internal goals, such as the sharing of emotions and the prevention of activist exhaustion. Our analysis then shows that XR's art-actions often succeed in reaching movement-internal goals. Regarding movement-external goals, our findings indicate that XR's art-actions carry potential in mobilizing an ecologically aware audience for environmental action. The realisation of this potential, however, hinges on striking a careful balance between salient-image, specific call for action and positive outcome. Overall, we emphasize the relevance of considering the internal and external dimensions of artivism in social movement research and practice - and we show how reception research can serve this endeavour.","[Stammen, Lara; Meissner, Miriam] Maastricht Univ, Arts & Social Sci, Maastricht, Netherlands",Maastricht University,"Stammen, L (corresponding author), Maastricht Univ, Arts & Social Sci, Maastricht, Netherlands.",lk.stammen@student.maastrichtuniversity.nl,,,,,,,74,0,0,4,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1474-2837,1474-2829,,SOC MOVEMENT STUD,Soc.

To provide plausible outputs, these models require unbiased high resolution meteorological data as input for atmospheric conditions. State of the art regional climate models (RCMs) often fail to provide such data, since they can exhibit large systematic biases. Therefore, bias correction methods (BCMs) have become a common tool in climate impact studies. Bias correction, however, comes with strong assumptions and limitations, often resulting from the fact that most BCMs are unable to appropriately calibrate a time dependent and conditional transfer function. To address this problem, we introduce here regression quantile mapping (RQM), a bias correction approach based on (linear) regression models which allow to design transfer functions based on expert knowledge. The new RQM algorithm is described in full detail in its basic (linear model) version and applied to RCM generated precipitation data for entire Europe. Based on the latter example, we provide a thorough comparison with another established BCM, quantile delta mapping (QDM) regarding the seasonal characteristics of precipitation sums. Our results demonstrate that RQM already achieves good results when a simple linear model is used. The relationship between precipitation and temperature was properly evaluated by RQM and representation of seasonal variations and key characteristics of precipitation were improved for most seasons. Systematic biases where reduced significantly during this process. Particular improvements in comparison with QDM are found regarding the shape and width of the distribution of bias corrected model precipitation. Furthermore, the representation of precipitation extremes within the data was largely improved when RQM was used instead of QDM.","[Passow, Christian] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Meteorol, Carl-Heinrich-Becker-Weg 6-10, DE-12165 Berlin, Germany; [Passow, Christian; Donner, Reik V.] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Telegrafenberg A56, DE-14473 Potsdam, Germany; [Donner, Reik V.] Magdeburg Stendal Univ Appl Sci, Dept Water,Environm,Construct,Safety, Breitscheidstrasse 2, DE-39114 Magdeburg, Germany",Free University of Berlin; Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung,"Passow, C (corresponding author), Free Univ Berlin, Inst Meteorol, Carl-Heinrich-Becker-Weg 6-10, DE-12165 Berlin, Germany.;Passow, C (corresponding author), Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Telegrafenberg A56, DE-14473 Potsdam, Germany.",cpassow@zedat.fu-berlin.de; redonner@pik-potsdam.de,"Donner, Reik/F-4400-2017","Donner, Reik/0000-0001-7023-6375; Passow, Christian/0000-0001-7834-1532",German Federal Ministry for Education and Research [01LN1306A]; Belmont Forum/JPI Climate project GOTHAM (Globally Observed Teleconnections and their Representation in Hierarchies of Atmospheric Models) [01LP16MA],German Federal Ministry for Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); Belmont Forum/JPI Climate project GOTHAM (Globally Observed Teleconnections and their Representation in Hierarchies of Atmospheric Models),"This work has been financially supported by the German Federal Ministry for Education and Research via the Young Investigators Group CoSy-CC<SUP>2</SUP> (Complex Systems Approaches to Understanding Causes and Consequences of Past, Present and Future Climate Change, Grant No. 01LN1306A) and the Belmont Forum/JPI Climate project GOTHAM (Globally Observed Teleconnections and their Representation in Hierarchies of Atmospheric Models, Grant No. 01LP16MA).",,60,4,4,1,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1436-3240,1436-3259,,STOCH ENV RES RISK A,Stoch.

At longer timescales, the atmosphere can be predicted at best using statistical methods, as a response to external forcing linked to sea- and land- surface anomalies. Climate being defined as the mean of atmospheric states, it appears that it can be predicted up to a few months in advance, which is the characteristic time of the so-called slow components of the climate system. Forecasting in sometimes be extended to longer time ranges, especially when the coupled ocean-atmosphere system exhibits internal variability modes, with characteristic times of a few years. Seasonal climate forecasting is most often based upon Monte-Carlo simulations, where the various realisations correspond to slightly different initial conditions. The present sate-of-the-art Europe (ECMWF) and/or in the USA (M) allows to forecast such major phenomena, as El Nino, up to six months advance.

While art historians have often found the earth art movement to exemplify a new awareness of the geological impact of human activity on the planet, I argue that art may engender a more genuinely planetary perspective when it pays attention to those forces we cannot compel. Gesturing towards the limits of human agency with regard to the Earth may ultimately be a more effective way of challenging anthropocentrism, and of locating human history within planetary time. My analysis draws on works by four contemporary artists - Rafael Lozano-Hemmer (Canada/Mexico), Claudia Muller (Chile), Paul Rosero Contreras (Ecuador) and Michelle-Marie Letelier (Germany/Chile) - that explore the science of turbulent dynamics that are impervious to human action, such as solar flares, earthquakes, winds, tides, tsunamis and volcanic eruptions. As Nigel Clark argues, the fundamental asymmetry that governs our relationship with a volatile planet is often lost in accounts of the entanglement of human and nonhumans that have recently prevailed in the humanities and social sciences. The works I discuss revise the practices of earth art to create a 'planetary art', cultivating a sense of the planet beyond the human that allows us to understand its dynamics more fully, and to resituate human agency more properly within geohistories of matter and energy. In many cases, this art remains fully alert to the geopolitics of the Anthropocene, focusing on the increased vulnerability of the Global South to climate change and environmental disaster, and gesturing towards a decolonial critique of the objectification of nature and the dissociative, rationalist knowledge produced by modern science.","[Page, Joanna] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge, England",University of Cambridge,"Page, J (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Robinson Coll, Grange Rd, Cambridge CB3 9AN, England.",jep29@cam.ac.uk,,,British Academy,British Academy,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The author gratefully acknowledges the award of a grant from the British Academy to cover expenses associated with this research project.",,29,3,3,2,5,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",2053-0196,2053-020X,,ANTHROPOCENE REV,Anthr.

The novelty of the research lies in its investigation of how international collaborations impact the performance pedagogy project at the local level. The project bridged a wide spectrum of actors in order to design an interactive space and participatory infrastructure involving a diverse variety of stakeholders. The projects were created by the author of this paper and involved the art venue Gallery Meno Parkas in Kaunas, local Kaunas schools and environment-friendly local art initiatives, families in Kaunas, Kaunas Municipality, The Lithuanian Council for Culture, a performance designer and international artists from the Baltic-Nordic region. The author created the performative milieu in the gallery space with the intention of educating children and young people about the environment and climate change through performance pedagogy methods. The research question is as follows: How are the knotworks and networks created during the planning and realisation of the international performance pedagogy project, and how do they target the local community and influence projects locally in real-time? The study materials were collected by arts-based methods and analysed by utilising reflexive research. The data collected during the planning and implementation phases are the author's notes and reflections, notes from feedback and discussions with the involved artists and photos and videos. This research can be valuable to educators, performance designers and artists interested in knotwork- and network-building.

We propose an integrated framework for harmonizing state-of-the-art cyberinfrastructure techniques with the user habits formed by long-term familiarity with existing community-oriented software. An open source prototype named COVALI is implemented and used to compare and validate the results of several widely-used climate models and datasets. Our results show that the proposed cyberinfrastructure-based strategy can significantly automate the comparison and validation processes in climate modeling.

Mainstreaming climate adaptation objectives into existing policies, as opposed to developing dedicated adaptation policy, is widely advocated for public action. However, knowledge on what makes mainstreaming effective is scarce and fragmented. Against this background, this paper takes stock of peer-reviewed empirical analyses of climate adaptation mainstreaming, in order to assess current achievements and identify the critical factors that render mainstreaming effective. The results show that although in most cases adaptation policy outputs are identified, only in a minority of cases this translates into policy outcomes. This implementation gap is most strongly seen in developing countries. However, when it comes to the effectiveness of outcomes, we found no difference across countries. We conclude that more explicit definitions and unified frameworks for adaptation mainstreaming research are required to allow for future research syntheses and well-informed policy recommendations.","[Runhaar, Hens; Wilk, Bettina; Uittenbroek, Caroline] Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Environm Governance Grp, POB 80,115, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands; [Runhaar, Hens] Wageningen Univ & Res, Forest & Nat Conservat Policy Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Persson, Asa] Stockholm Environm Inst, Stockholm, Sweden; [Wamsler, Christine] Lund Univ Ctr Sustainabil Sci LUCSUS, Lund, Sweden",Utrecht University; Wageningen University & Research; Stockholm Environment Institute,"Runhaar, H (corresponding author), Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Environm Governance Grp, POB 80,115, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands.;Runhaar, H (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ & Res, Forest & Nat Conservat Policy Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands.",h.a.c.runhaar@uu.nl; asa.persson@sei-international.org; c.j.uittenbroek@uu.nl; christine.wamsler@lucsus.lu.se,"Persson, Åsa/ABD-8096-2021; Runhaar, Hens A.C./L-5395-2013","Runhaar, Hens A.C./0000-0001-7790-097X; Persson, Asa/0000-0002-8886-5046",,,,,33,77,78,3,6,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1436-3798,1436-378X,,REG ENVIRON CHANGE,Reg.

The damages, covered by the Governments of Canada and the U.S., were estimated to C$90M. This natural disaster motivated the study of mitigation measures to prevent such disasters from reoccurring. When evaluating flood risks, long-term evolving climate change should be taken into account to adopt mitigation measures that will remain relevant in the future. To assess the impacts of climate change on flood risks of the LCRR basin, three bias-corrected multi-resolution ensembles of climate projections for two greenhouse gas concentration scenarios were used to force a state-of-the-art, high-resolution, distributed hydrological model. The analysis of the hydrological simulations indicates that the 20-year return period flood (corresponding to a medium flood) should decrease between 8% and 35% for the end of the 21st Century (2070-2099) time horizon and for the high-emission scenario representative concentration pathway (RCP) 8.5. The reduction in flood risks is explained by a decrease in snow accumulation and an increase in evapotranspiration expected with the future warming of the region. Nevertheless, due to the large climate inter-annual variability, short-term flood probabilities should remain similar to those experienced in the recent past.","[Lucas-Picher, Philippe; Arsenault, Richard; Poulin, Annie; Brissette, Francois] Ecole Technol Super Montreal, Dept Construct Engn, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Lachance-Cloutier, Simon; Ricard, Simon; Turcotte, Richard] Quebecs Minist Environm & Fight Climate Change, Quebec City, PQ, Canada",University of Quebec; Ecole de Technologie Superieure - Canada,"Lucas-Picher, P (corresponding author), Ecole Technol Super Montreal, Dept Construct Engn, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",p.lucas.picher@gmail.com,"Ricard, Simon/HGB-8704-2022","Ricard, Simon/0000-0002-3049-8933; Arsenault, Richard/0000-0003-2834-2750","International Joint Commission Lake Champlain and Richelieu River Project; Departement de l'Expertise Hydrique du Ministere de l'Environnement et de la Lutte contre les Changements Climatiques; ClimEx project by the Bavarian State Ministry for the Environment and Consumer Protection; Gauss Centre for Supercomputing (GCS) by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research; Bavarian State Ministry of Education, Science and the Arts; French National Research Agency [ANR-18-MPGA-0005]","International Joint Commission Lake Champlain and Richelieu River Project; Departement de l'Expertise Hydrique du Ministere de l'Environnement et de la Lutte contre les Changements Climatiques; ClimEx project by the Bavarian State Ministry for the Environment and Consumer Protection; Gauss Centre for Supercomputing (GCS) by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research; Bavarian State Ministry of Education, Science and the Arts; French National Research Agency(French National Research Agency (ANR))","The authors are grateful to the anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments that helped in improving the manuscript.

A novel technique for generating fields of target data has been developed and is used to provide ensembles of LRM stochastic processes with a prescribed spatial covariance structure. Based on different parameter setups, hypothesis testing in the spectral domain is used to investigate if the field and spatial mean reconstructions are consistent with either the fractional Gaussian noise (fGn) process null hypothesis used for generating the target data, or the autoregressive model of order 1 (AR(1)) process null hypothesis which is the assumed temporal evolution model for the reconstruction technique. The study reveals that the resulting field and spatial mean reconstructions are consistent with the fGn process hypothesis for some of the tested parameter configurations, while others are in better agreement with the AR(1) model. There are local differences in reconstruction skill and reconstructed scaling characteristics between individual grid cells, and the agreement with the fGn model is generally better for the spatial mean reconstruction than at individual locations. Our results demonstrate that the use of target data with a different spatiotemporal covariance structure than the BARCAST model assumption can lead to a potentially biased climate field reconstruction (CFR) and associated confidence intervals.","[Nilsen, Tine; Divine, Dmitry V.; Rypdal, Martin] UiT Arctic Univ Norway, Dept Math & Stat, N-9037 Tromso, Norway; [Werner, Johannes P.] Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, N-5020 Bergen, Norway; [Divine, Dmitry V.] Norwegian Polar Res Inst, Fram Ctr, N-9296 Tromso, Norway",UiT The Arctic University of Tromso; Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research; Norwegian Polar Institute,"Nilsen, T (corresponding author), UiT Arctic Univ Norway, Dept Math & Stat, N-9037 Tromso, Norway.",tine.nilsen@uit.no,"Rypdal, Martin/AAA-2973-2020; Werner, Johannes/H-5702-2012","Rypdal, Martin/0000-0003-0053-665X; Werner, Johannes/0000-0003-4015-7398","Norwegian Research Council (KLIMAFORSK programme) [229754]; Tromso Research Foundation via the UiT project [A31054, A33020]; Centre for Climate Dynamics (SKD) at the Bjerknes Centre; IS-DAAD project [255778 HOLCLIM]",Norwegian Research Council (KLIMAFORSK programme); Tromso Research Foundation via the UiT project; Centre for Climate Dynamics (SKD) at the Bjerknes Centre; IS-DAAD project,"Tine Nilsen was supported by the Norwegian Research Council (KLIMAFORSK programme) under grant no. 229754, and partly by Tromso Research Foundation via the UiT project A31054.

Results show that under all scenarios, the distribution functions of hydrologic states will shift towards lower values and droughts will progressively become more frequent, longer and more intense.","[Serrat-Capdevila, Aleix; Valdes, Juan B.] Univ Arizona, Int Ctr Integrated Water Resources Management UNE, Tucson, AZ 85719 USA; [Serrat-Capdevila, Aleix; Valdes, Juan B.] Univ Arizona, Dept Hydrol & Water Resources, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Dominguez, Francina] Univ Arizona, Dept Atmospher Sci, Tucson, AZ USA; [Rajagopal, Seshadri] Univ Nevada, Desert Res Inst, Reno, NV 89506 USA",University of Arizona; University of Arizona; University of Arizona; Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); Desert Research Institute NSHE; University of Nevada Reno,"Valdes, JB (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Int Ctr Integrated Water Resources Management UNE, Tucson, AZ 85719 USA.",jvaldes@email.arizona.edu,"Dominguez, Francina/AAH-6741-2020; Dominguez, Francina/D-4412-2012; Serrat-Capdevila, Aleix/O-6227-2014",,International Center for Integrated Water Resources Management (ICIWaRM-UNESCO),International Center for Integrated Water Resources Management (ICIWaRM-UNESCO),"The lead author gratefully acknowledges the International Center for Integrated Water Resources Management (ICIWaRM-UNESCO) for his funding support.

It explores the language used to discuss adaptation, what is known about resonant frames, drawing on adaptation discourses in policy, practice, and the media. Identifying trends and widely applicable insights is made challenging not only by the variety of words used to speak of adaptation, but by the fact that adaptation' language is often not used at all. A broad literature on perceptions and experiences of climate change impacts and how these experiences affect people's valuations and emotional responses to climate change offers crucial insights to the challenges and opportunities in communicating adaptation. It reveals much about people's interest in and acceptability and knowledge of adaptation, about preferred timing and who is thought to be responsible for enacting adaptive actions. Insights from the literature on place attachment and place identity are of particular relevance to public engagement on adaptation as it goes a long way toward explaining the quality of the adaptation debate to date while offering promising opportunities for dialogue. Suggestions for improved adaptation communication practice and critical research gaps are offered. For further resources related to this article, please visit the .

The saiga antelope is the size of a goat. It is perfectly adapted to an and climate and can also endure heat and cold. Its large nose has a cavity in which inhaled cold or warm air is adapted to body temperature. Today the saiga antelope lives in the arid steppes of Central Asia, first of all in Kazakhstan. In historical times, its range extended westwards to the Ukraine. In especially dry and cold periods of the Palaeolithic, the animal was found as far west as Brittany and Cantabria. With 22 representations at 16 sites the saiga antelope was only seldom depicted in the Magdalenian. This corresponds to its minor importance as a hunted animal. Only at Moulin Neuf and other sites in the Gironde region was the saiga antelope a frequent prey. Most of the sites with representations of the saiga delivered only a few or no bones of the animal. Chronologically, the representations cover the timespan from Middle (Moulin Neuf. Enlene) to Final (Peyrat, Limeuil) Magdalenian. During the first part of the Middle Magdalenian (Magd. III), the saiga antelope was an element of the fauna in Southwestern Europe, but the animal was known until the end of Magdalenian. (C) 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Daily intense rainfall events are extracted at grid point scale using a 95th percentile threshold approach applied to all rainy days (i.e., daily rainfall >= 1 mm day(-1)) over the 1998-2008 period for which two satellite-derived precipitation products are available. Both RCM simulations provide similar results. They accurately capture the spatial and temporal characteristics of intense events, while they tend to overestimate their number and underestimate their intensity. The skill of AGCMs and AOGCMs is generally similar over the African continent and similar to previous global climate model generations. The majority of the AGCMs and AOGCMs greatly overestimate the frequency of intense events, particularly in the tropics, generally fail at simulating the observed intensity, and systematically overestimate their spatial coverage. The RCM performs at least as well as the most accurate global climate model, demonstrating a clear added value to general circulation model simulations and the usefulness of regional modeling for investigating the physics leading to intense events and their change under global warming.","[Cretat, Julien; Vizy, Edward K.; Cook, Kerry H.] Univ Texas Austin, Jackson Sch Geosci, Dept Geol Sci, Austin, TX 78712 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Cretat, J (corresponding author), Univ Texas Austin, Jackson Sch Geosci, Dept Geol Sci, 1 Univ Stn C1100, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",jc@jsg.utexas.edu,"Vizy, Edward/A-1577-2009","Vizy, Edward/0000-0002-5019-2819",U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science [DE-FG02-10ER65092],U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science(United States Department of Energy (DOE)),"Support from the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science (award DE-FG02-10ER65092) is gratefully acknowledged.

In doing so, they evoke climate change in particular ways, and make the issue meaningful in everyday discourse. While a diversity of climate change imagery exists, particular types of climate imagery appear to have gained dominance, promoting particular ways of knowing about climate change (and marginalizing others). This imagery, and public engagement with this imagery, helps to shape the cultural politics of climate change in important ways. This article critically reviews the nascent research area of the visual representations of climate change, and public engagement with visual imagery. It synthesizes a diverse body of research to explore visual representations and engagement across the news media, NGO communications, advertising, and marketing, climate science, art, and virtual reality systems. The discussion brings together three themes which occur throughout the review: time, truth, and power. The article concludes by suggesting fruitful directions for future research in the visual communication of climate change.

The aim is to quantify and analyze the medium-term socio-economic consequences of projected climate change. The methodology is innovative as it combines state-of-the-art knowledge from economic and biophysical sources and is demonstrated in application to two Mediterrenean countries: Israel and Italy. The information from the VALUE model was incorporated into the ICES economic model to improve the agricultural production structure. The new land allocation method takes into account the variation of substitutability across different types of land use. It captures agronomic features included in the VALUE model. This modification gives a better representation of heterogeneous information of land productivity to the economic framework. Climate impacts and policy evaluation with ICES are reinforced due to the more refined system of land allocation. This exercise is original in its ability to base the analysis on empirically estimated parameters rather than on assumptions, as in other studies of this kind. Notably, we suggest diverse land Constant Elasticity of Transformation (CET) frontiers for two main ecological regions in the Mediterranean basin for a more accurate representation of agronomic characteristics.

A multiplicity of climate hazards will be involved, triggering cumulative and interactive impacts on a variety of natural and human systems. An improved understanding of risk interactions and dynamics is required to support decision makers in their ability to better manage current and future climate change risks. To face this issue, the research community has been starting to test new methodological approaches and tools, including the application of Machine Learning (ML) leveraging the potential of the large availability and variety of spatio-temporal big data for environmental applications. Given the increasing attention on the application of ML methods to Climate Change Risk Assessment (CCRA), this review mapped out the state of art and potential of these methods to this field of research. Scientometric and systematic analysis were jointly applied providing an in-depth review of publications across the 2000-2020 timeframe. The resulting output from the analysis showed that a huge variety of ML algorithms have been already applied within CCRA, among them, the most recurrent are Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Artificial Neural Network. These algorithms are often applied in an ensemble or hybridized way to analyze most of all floods and landslides risk events. Moreover, the application of ML to deal with remote sensing data is consistent and effective across reviewed CCRA applications, allowing the identification and classification of targets and the detection of environmental and structural features. On the contrary concerning future climate change scenarios, literature seems not to be very widespread into scientific production, compared to studies evaluating risks under current conditions. The same lack can be noted also for the assessment of cascading and compound hazards and risks, since these concepts are recently emerging in CCRA literature but not yet in combination with ML-based applications.","[Zennaro, Federica; Furlan, Elisa; Simeoni, Christian; Torresan, Silvia; Aslan, Sinem; Critto, Andrea; Marcomini, Antonio] Univ Ca Foscari Venice, Dept Environm Sci Informat & Stat, Via Torino 155, I-30170 Venice, Italy; [Zennaro, Federica; Furlan, Elisa; Simeoni, Christian; Torresan, Silvia; Critto, Andrea; Marcomini, Antonio] Fdn Ctr Euro Mediterraneo Cambiamenti Climat, I-73100 Lecce, Italy; [Aslan, Sinem] Ege Univ, Int Comp Inst, TR-35100 Izmir, Turkey; [Aslan, Sinem] Ca Foscari Univ Venice, European Ctr Living Technol ECLT, Dorsoduro 3911,Calle Crosera, I-30123 Venice, Italy",Universita Ca Foscari Venezia; Ege University; Universita Ca Foscari Venezia,"Critto, A (corresponding author), Univ Ca Foscari Venice, Dept Environm Sci Informat & Stat, Via Torino 155, I-30170 Venice, Italy.",critto@unive.it,"Aslan, Sinem/C-3381-2008","Aslan, Sinem/0000-0003-0068-6551",PhD programme in Science and Management of Climate Change of Ca' Foscari University of Venice; Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs; International Cooperation in the frame of the Project BRIDGE-Building resilience of society; Strategic Projects of the Euro-Mediterranean Center on Climate Change (CMCC) Foundation,PhD programme in Science and Management of Climate Change of Ca' Foscari University of Venice; Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs(Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation (Italy)); International Cooperation in the frame of the Project BRIDGE-Building resilience of society; Strategic Projects of the Euro-Mediterranean Center on Climate Change (CMCC) Foundation,"The research leading to these results has been partly funded under the PhD programme in Science and Management of Climate Change of Ca' Foscari University of Venice (PhD research grant) and from the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation in the frame of the Project BRIDGE-Building resilience of society to disasters: improved methodologies and solutions for Italy and USA (2019-2021).

However, as researchers begin to systematically study environmental art, influencing factors must be addressed-for example, the effect of presenting contextualizing information. In the present study. 123 participants saw an environmental artwork with or without contextualizing information in a between-subjects design and rated the artwork on various variables regarding its aesthetic value and proenvironmental impact. Additionally, eye movement was recorded using mobile eye-tracking glasses to gain insight into the visual processing of the artwork. The results showed that information presentation increased personal meaning, which was in turn associated with increased liking, interest, and emotional responses. The average duration of fixations was shorter for participants in the information group, indicating easier processing possibly due to the guidance of the provided information. However, information had no effects on participants' proenvironmental intentions and behavior. Taken together, the results strongly suggest that both researchers and practitioners should be taking the effect of contextualizing information into account when exhibiting environmental art, because it can impact a variety of relevant factors.","[Keller, Anna; Hanss, Daniel] Hsch Darmstadt Univ Appl Sci, Dept Social Sci, Haardtring 100, D-64295 Darmstadt, Germany; [Sommer, Laura; Klockner, Christian A.] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Psychol, Trondheim, Norway",Hochschule Darmstadt; Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Keller, A (corresponding author), Hsch Darmstadt Univ Appl Sci, Dept Social Sci, Haardtring 100, D-64295 Darmstadt, Germany.",anna.b.keller@stud.h-da.de,"Keller, Ellis/AAK-5709-2021","Keller, Ellis/0000-0003-4478-0400; Klockner, Christian A./0000-0003-4510-1748",Norwegian Research Council [235223],Norwegian Research Council(Research Council of NorwayEuropean Commission),"The research for this article was conducted in cooperation with the Climart-project (www.climart.info), funded by the Norwegian Research Council (Project 235223).",,65,5,5,4,22,EDUCATIONAL PUBLISHING FOUNDATION-AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST, NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",1931-3896,1931-390X,,PSYCHOL AESTHET CREA,Psychol.

Global environmental and developmental changes, as well as national political decisions, open up Russia's Arctic to massive investment and industrial and socioeconomic development. How do Russian Arctic cities, towns, and municipalities reflect on new opportunities in terms of designing their climate change adaptation strategies at a local level? Starting with theoretical discourse on urban climate change adaptation strategy, this research examines state-of-the-art challenges and trends in planning for adaptation measures in Russia's Arctic industrial centers. Special attention is given to a comparative analysis of the cities' climate change adaptation strategies. The role of civil society institutions and business community in the adaptation strategy planning process is explored. Moreover, conflict-sensitive approaches to ensure participatory processes for designing and implementing adaptation measures are discussed. The field component of research is based on the cities of Apatity, Arkhangelsk, Murmansk, Norilsk, Salekhard, and Severodvinsk and the towns of Monchegorsk, Nickel, and Vorkuta. The study concludes that, despite significant challenges identified, the total balance sheet'' of the Arctic cities' efforts to enhance their adaptive capacities is very positive: Russian northern urban settlements do their best in addressing existing challenges via planning for sustainability approach. However, there is more to do, and municipalities should learn from one another's experiences, as the different approaches can be helpful in developing adequate climate change adaptation strategies at the local level.","[Bobylev, Nikolai; Konyshev, Valery; Lagutina, Maria; Sergunin, Alexander] St Petersburg State Univ, St Petersburg, Russia; [Gadal, Sebastien] Aix Marseille Univ, Univ Cote dAzur, Avignon Univ, CNRS,ESPACE,UMR 730, Marseille, France; [Gadal, Sebastien] North Eastern Fed Univ, Dept Ecol & Geog, Inst Nat Sci, Yakutsk, Russia; [Sergunin, Alexander] Nizhnii Novgorod State Univ, Nizhnii Novgorod, Russia",Saint Petersburg State University; Avignon Universite; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Aix-Marseille Universite; Universite Cote d'Azur; North-Eastern Federal University in Yakutsk; Lobachevsky State University of Nizhni Novgorod,"Sergunin, A (corresponding author), St Petersburg State Univ, St Petersburg, Russia.;Sergunin, A (corresponding author), Nizhnii Novgorod State Univ, Nizhnii Novgorod, Russia.",a.sergunin@spbu.ru,"GADAL, Sébastien/L-2835-2016","GADAL, Sébastien/0000-0002-6472-9955",Russian Foundation for BasicResearch (RFBR); Foundation ''Maison des Sciences de L'homme'' (France) [20-514-22001]; RFBR and Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (Germany) [21-514-12001]; U.S. National Science Foundation PIRE project [1545913]; Helsinki Collegium for Advanced Studies/Kone FoundationResearch Fellowship; EUErasmus1 Jean Monnet project [GRASS 587697-EPP-1-2017-1-RU-EPPJMO-PROJECT]; EU Erasmus1 Jean Monnet project [TERRA 611949-EPP-1-2019-1-RU-EPPJMO-PROJECT],Russian Foundation for BasicResearch (RFBR)(Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR)); Foundation ''Maison des Sciences de L'homme'' (France); RFBR and Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (Germany); U.S. National Science Foundation PIRE project; Helsinki Collegium for Advanced Studies/Kone FoundationResearch Fellowship; EUErasmus1 Jean Monnet project; EU Erasmus1 Jean Monnet project,This paper is based on the study done in the framework of several research projects: 1) Russian Foundation for BasicResearch (RFBR) and Foundation ``Maison des Sciences de L'homme'' (France) project 20-514-22001; 2) RFBR and Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (Germany) joint project 21-514-12001; 3) U.S. National Science Foundation PIRE project 1545913; 4) the Helsinki Collegium for Advanced Studies/Kone FoundationResearch Fellowship; 5) EUErasmus1 Jean Monnet project GRASS 587697-EPP-1-2017-1-RU-EPPJMO-PROJECT; and 6) EU Erasmus1 Jean Monnet project TERRA 611949-EPP-1-2019-1-RU-EPPJMO-PROJECT.,,46,0,0,3,3,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693, UNITED STATES",1948-8327,1948-8335,,WEATHER CLIM SOC,Weather Clim.

In Europe, anxiety over the expression of protest through violent means has steadily caused governments to abandon the traditional, seemingly limitless adherence to freedom of expression. Political fear over controversy has come to dominate the climate of commissioning public art. In a polarized world, the debate on what is tolerable has taken on an acute urgency. The art world itself no longer has an answer. After a half-century of autonomy, it has succeeded in demolishing its own authority by ridiculing every aspect of external criticism.

Besides, we found opposite changes in ocean heat uptake efficiency (), weakening in models and strengthening in nature, which explain why the models tend to overestimate the SAT(g) trend.

It has been around two decades since urban canopy models now commonly employed in mesoscale atmospheric models for operational and applied research purposes have emerged. To drive further advancement, it is timely to conduct a review of the state-of-the-art and lessons learnt from the relevant literature. In this paper, 102 urban climate real case modelling studies published in 2000?2019 are reviewed. Patterns and preferences in their study locations, periods, model choices, land cover databases, topics discussed, and scenarios investigated are holistically examined. There is an evident improvement in model complexity and urban surface data precision during the period reviewed. Most studies focus on the urban thermal climate and effects of urbanization. Based on the research gaps identified, more work is needed on the currently underrepresented but vulnerable cities in developing countries with tropical, arid, and cold climates. Collaborative field campaigns, initiatives to characterize cities in a consistent manner, and multi-scale modelling approaches have proven to benefit the progress in urban climate studies and should therefore be encouraged. More importantly, efforts should be invested in translating the science into information relevant to human well-being, urban planning, and policymaking.","[Kwok, Yu Ting; Ng, Edward Yan Yung] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Sch Architecture, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Chinese University of Hong Kong,"Kwok, YT (corresponding author), Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Sch Architecture, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",ytkwok@link.cuhk.edu.hk,,,Chinese University of Hong Kong; Hong Kong PhD Fellowship Scheme by the Research Grants Council of the HKSAR Government,Chinese University of Hong Kong(Chinese University of Hong Kong); Hong Kong PhD Fellowship Scheme by the Research Grants Council of the HKSAR Government,This work is supported by the Vice-Chancellor's Discretionary Fund of the Chinese University of Hong Kong.

This presents a big challenge in applying the current state-of-the-art regional climate models (RCMs) for climate change impact studies in the GBM River Basin. In this study, several RCM simulations generated by RegCM4.4 and PRECIS are assessed for their seasonal and interannual variations, onset/withdrawal of the Indian monsoon, and long-term trends in precipitation and temperature from 1982 to 2012. The results indicate that in general, RegCM4.4 and PRECIS simulations appear to reasonably reproduce the mean seasonal distribution of precipitation and temperature across the GBM River Basin, although the two RCMs are integrated over a different domain size. On average, the RegCM4.4 simulations overestimate monsoon precipitation by and in the Ganges and Brahmaputra-Meghna River Basin, respectively, while PRECIS simulations underestimate (overestimate) the same by (). Both RegCM4.4 and PRECIS simulations indicate an intense cold bias (up to ) in the Himalayas, and are generally stronger in the RegCM4.4 simulations. Additionally, they tend to produce high precipitation between April and May in the Ganges (RegCM4.4 simulations) and Brahmaputra-Meghna (PRECIS simulations) River Basins, resulting in early onset of the Indian monsoon in the Ganges River Basin. PRECIS simulations exhibit a delayed monsoon withdrawal in the Brahmaputra-Meghna River Basin. Despite large spatial variations in onset and withdrawal periods across the GBM River Basin, the basin-averaged results agree reasonably well with the observed periods. Although global climate model (GCM) driven simulations are generally poor in representing the interannual variability of precipitation and winter temperature variations, they tend to agree well with observed precipitation anomalies when driven by perfect boundary conditions. It is also seen that all GCM driven simulations feature significant positive surface temperature trends consistent with the observed datasets.","[Khandu; Awange, Joseph L.; Kuhn, Michael] Curtin Univ, Dept Spatial Sci, Kent St, Bentley, WA 6102, Australia; [Awange, Joseph L.; Fukuda, Yoichi] Kyoto Univ, Fac Earth & Planetary Sci, Kyoto, Japan; [Anyah, Richard] Univ Connecticut, Dept Nat Resources & Environm, Storrs, CT USA",Curtin University; Kyoto University; University of Connecticut,"Khandu, (corresponding author), Curtin Univ, Dept Spatial Sci, Kent St, Bentley, WA 6102, Australia.",khandu@postgrad.curtin.edu.au,"Kuhn, Michael/L-1182-2013","Kuhn, Michael/0000-0001-7861-8079; Awange, Joseph/0000-0003-3533-613X; Fukuda, Yoichi/0000-0002-7731-816X","Curtin Strategic International Research Scholarship, Curtin University (Australia); Prince Albert II of Monaco Foundation; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC); Japan Society of Promotion of Science (JSPS); Directorate For Geosciences [1342644] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Curtin Strategic International Research Scholarship, Curtin University (Australia); Prince Albert II of Monaco Foundation; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC); Japan Society of Promotion of Science (JSPS)(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Directorate For Geosciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO))","Khandu is grateful to Curtin Strategic International Research Scholarship, Curtin University (Australia) for the financial support.

Therefore, climate adaptation is a regional priority. At least 6% of SA population live at low-elevation coastal zones (LECZ) exposed to sea-level rise, ENSO variability and storminess. This paper reviews some recent and current adaptation experiences in SA coasts focusing on (i) socioeconomic and vulnerability status, (ii) links between adaptation and sustainable development, and (iii) constraints to adaptation. Despite the regional economic growth and poverty reduction over the last decade, an adaptation deficit to current climate variability persists. Overall, SA countries show a poor link between public policies, adaptation, and theoretical-academic scope. Public adaptation efforts in coastal areas are mostly oriented towards risk assessment, vulnerability and reduction of impacts at urban and touristic settlements. Many experiences developed from the academy follow the community-based adaptation (CBA) approach mainstreamed into local plans. Adaptation constraints are linked with poverty, social priorities, allocation of resources and the multifaceted impacts of climate change. Two coastal CBA case studies in Venezuela and Uruguay based on scientific and local knowledge show that non-structural adaptation measures can improve the populations' perception of risks, provided that stakeholders, mainly the community, are informed and integrated to define adaptation actions. There are lots of plans and less specific actions. We propose that the assessment of adaptation success has to rely on implementation and effectiveness criteria rather than solely on plans.","[Villamizar, Alicia] Univ Simon Bolivar, Dept Estudios Ambientales, Caracas, Venezuela; [Gutierrez, Maria E.] Univ Simon Bolivar, Direcc Relac Interinst, Caracas, Venezuela; [Nagy, Gustavo J.; Caffera, Ruben M.] UdelaR, Grp Cambio Global Costero, IECA, Fac Ciencias, Montevideo, Uruguay; [Caffera, Ruben M.] UdelaR, Fac Agron, Montevideo, Uruguay; [Caffera, Ruben M.] Soc Amigos Viento SAV NGO, Montevideo, Uruguay; [Leal Filho, Walter] Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Manchester, Lancs, England","Simon Bolivar University; Simon Bolivar University; Universidad de la Republica, Uruguay; Universidad de la Republica, Uruguay; Manchester Metropolitan University","Leal, W (corresponding author), Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Manchester, Lancs, England.",w.leal@mmu.ac.uk,"Leal, Walter/ACX-9082-2022; Leal, Walter/AAU-6997-2021; nagy, gustavo/G-8097-2017","Leal, Walter/0000-0002-1241-5225; Leal, Walter/0000-0002-1241-5225; nagy, gustavo/0000-0002-8296-4465; Villanueva Cuevas, Antonio/0000-0003-4923-3705",,,,,118,22,22,3,33,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

Since the general problem is inherently intractable, a range of approximations and heuristic methods have been proposed. Simple Monte Carlo sampling methods, although easy to implement and very flexible, are rather inefficient, making implementation possible only in the very simplest models. More sophisticated methods based on random walks and gradient-descent methods can provide more efficient solutions, but it is often unclear how to extract probabilistic information from such methods and the computational costs are still generally too high for their application to state-of-the-art general circulation models (GCMs). The ensemble Kalman filter is an efficient Monte Carlo approximation which is optimal for linear problems, but we show here how its accuracy can degrade in nonlinear applications. Methods based on particle filtering may provide a solution to this problem but have yet to be studied in any detail in the realm of climate models. Statistical emulators show great promise for future research and their computational speed would eliminate much of the need for efficient sampling techniques. However, emulation of a full GCM has yet to be achieved and the construction of such represents a substantial computational task in itself.","FRCGC, JAMSTEC, Kanazawa Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2360001, Japan",Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science & Technology (JAMSTEC),"Annan, JD (corresponding author), FRCGC, JAMSTEC, Kanazawa Ku, 3173-25 Showa Machi, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2360001, Japan.",jdannan@jamstec.go.jp,"Annan, James/A-3702-2010","Hargreaves, Julia/0000-0002-4217-5023",NERC [NE/C515904/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/C515904/1] Funding Source: researchfish,NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),,,38,32,32,0,9,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",1364-503X,1471-2962,,PHILOS T R SOC A,Philos.

The tuning is done through alterations of cloud parameters that affect, for instance, the model cloud water content, but the difference in cloud water content between the two model configurations is found to be negligible compared to the wide spread of the same quantity in a number of state-of-the-art GCMs. The equilibrium climate sensitivities of the two model configurations differ by ca. 0.24 K, and both lie well within the range of present estimates of climate sensitivity in different GCMs. This indicates that it is possible to tune the model to either of the two satellite datasets without drastically changing the climate sensitivity. However, the study illustrates that the climate sensitivity is a product of choices of parameter values that are not well restricted by observations, which allows for a certain degree of arbitrariness in the estimates of climate sensitivity.","Univ Stockholm, Dept Meteorol, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden",Stockholm University,"Bender, FAM (corresponding author), Univ Stockholm, Dept Meteorol, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",frida@misu.su.se,"Bender, Frida A-M./D-6228-2012; Keyes, Dennis/AAZ-9285-2021","Bender, Frida A-M./0000-0003-4867-4007; ",,,,,28,16,16,0,6,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1748-9326,,,ENVIRON RES LETT,Environ.

Here we present evidence from the early to middle Holocene (ca. 6200-4200 bc), a period of significant climate change in the wider region, moving from the African Humid Period towards an arid environment and the development to the south of the Saharan desert. Employing rock art and lithic evidence from across the landscape, we consider how these strands of archaeological evidence intersect and facilitate the description of human-environment interactions that were wholly different from those we see today. The interpretation of the full range of sites is underpinned by a landscape/environmental framework that considers site location and relationships with topography and hydrology. We also develop a socio-ecological approach that avoids environmental determinism but willingly accepts the role that the environment plays in contributing to the structure of human activity in a complex landscape. The art and archaeology of the Jebel Ousselat reflect complex interactions during a period of environmental, economic and cultural change. We feel that the art is not a mere reflection of food procurement but instead points to the production of complex socio-ecological relationships during a period of transition.","[Ben Nasr, Jaafar] Univ Kairouan, Fac Arts & Humanities, Dept Archaeol, LR 13 ES 11,UR 16 ES 01, Kairouan, Tunisia; [Walsh, Kevin] Univ York, Dept Archaeol, York YO1 7EP, N Yorkshire, England; [Walsh, Kevin] Aix Marseille Univ, Inst Adv Study IMeRA, Marseille, France",Universite de Kairouan; University of York - UK; UDICE-French Research Universities; Aix-Marseille Universite,"Ben Nasr, J (corresponding author), Univ Kairouan, Fac Arts & Humanities, Dept Archaeol, LR 13 ES 11,UR 16 ES 01, Kairouan, Tunisia.",bennasr.jaafar@gmail.com; kevin.walsh@york.ac.uk,"nasr, jaafar Ben/AAN-7724-2021","Ben Nasr, Jaafar/0000-0002-5158-0418","IMeRA-Institute for Advanced Study, Aix-Marseille University, Marseille, France; Cofund European Institutes for Advanced Study; Labex Reseau Francais d'Etudes Avancees; l'Agence Nationale de la Recherche-Investissements d'Avenir; Tunisian Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research [19PEJC01-01]","IMeRA-Institute for Advanced Study, Aix-Marseille University, Marseille, France; Cofund European Institutes for Advanced Study; Labex Reseau Francais d'Etudes Avancees; l'Agence Nationale de la Recherche-Investissements d'Avenir(French National Research Agency (ANR)); Tunisian Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research","Kevin Walsh is indebted to IMeRA-Institute for Advanced Study, Aix-Marseille University, Marseille, France-and funding from Cofund European Institutes for Advanced Study, Labex Reseau Francais d'Etudes Avancees and l'Agence Nationale de la Recherche-Investissements d'Avenir.

Spatial patterns of potential prediction errors differ substantially between the models, but some features are robust. Sea ice concentration errors are largest in the marginal ice zone, and in winter they are almost zero away from the ice edge. Sea ice thickness errors are amplified along the coasts of the Arctic Ocean, an effect that is dominated by sea ice advection.

It allows one to directly record damage growth while changes remain invisible to those caring for the collection, as opposed to monitoring and inferring damage indirectly due to undesired interactions with local climates or waiting for visible damage to develop. As a consequence, AE can be used to record environmentally-induced physical changes directly in historic materials and, hence, can support the assessment of strategies for the indoor climate management of museums. However, applying AE to museum collections requires specific measures to deal with issues such as the uniqueness and fragility of the monitored objects, the diversity of construction materials and the measurement of signals in an often noisy environment. Systematic tests of the propagation and attenuation of AE signals in wood were performed to better understand the monitoring results in terms of damage location and to assess the ability of various high-pass filters to reduce the background noise.

To address this issue, we use a new collection of initial-condition large ensembles from the Community Earth System Model version 1 that are prescribed with different combinations of industrial aerosol and greenhouse gas forcing. To compare the climate response to these external forcings, we adopt an artificial neural network (ANN) architecture from previous work that predicts the year by training on maps of near-surface temperature. We then utilize layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) to visualize the regional temperature signals that are important for the ANN's prediction in each climate model experiment. To mask noise when extracting only the most robust climate patterns from LRP, we introduce a simple uncertainty metric that can be adopted to other explainable artificial intelligence (AI) problems. We find that the North Atlantic, Southern Ocean, and Southeast Asia are key regions of importance for the neural network to make its prediction, especially prior to the early-21st century. Notably, we also find that the ANN predictions based on maps of observations correlate higher to the actual year after training on the large ensemble experiment with industrial aerosols held fixed to 1920 levels. This work illustrates the sensitivity of regional temperature signals to changes in aerosol forcing in historical simulations.

Previous studies have examined the time of emergence of climate averages. However, at the global scale, the emergence of changes in extreme events, which have the greatest societal impacts, has not been investigated before. Based on state-of-the-art climate models, we show that temperature extremes generally emerge slightly later from their quasi-natural climate state than seasonal means, due to greater variability in extremes. Nevertheless, according to model evidence, both hot and cold extremes have already emerged across many areas. Remarkably, even precipitation extremes that have very large variability are projected to emerge in the coming decades in Northern Hemisphere winters associated with a wettening trend. Based on our findings we expect local temperature and precipitation extremes to already differ significantly from their previous quasi-natural state at many locations or to do so in the near future. Our findings have implications for climate impacts and detection and attribution studies assessing observed changes in regional climate extremes by showing whether they will likely find a fingerprint of anthropogenic climate change.","[King, Andrew D.; Donat, Markus G.; Alexander, Lisa V.; Perkins, Sarah E.] Univ New S Wales, Climate Change Res Ctr, ARC Ctr Excellence Climate Syst Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [King, Andrew D.; Karoly, David J.; Dittus, Andrea J.; Lewis, Sophie C.] Univ Melbourne, Sch Earth Sci, ARC Ctr Excellence Climate Syst Sci, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Fischer, Erich M.] ETH, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Hawkins, Ed] Univ Reading, Dept Meteorol, Natl Ctr Atmospher Sci, Reading RG6 6BB, Berks, England; [Lewis, Sophie C.] Australian Natl Univ, Sch Earth Sci, ARC Ctr Excellence Climate Syst Sci, Acton 2601, Australia",ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science; University of New South Wales Sydney; ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science; University of Melbourne; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); NERC National Centre for Atmospheric Science; University of Reading; Australian National University,"King, AD (corresponding author), Univ New S Wales, Climate Change Res Ctr, ARC Ctr Excellence Climate Syst Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",andrew.king@unimelb.edu.au,"Perkins-Kirkpatrick, Sarah E/O-5042-2015; Lewis, Sophie/H-4968-2011; King, Andrew/AAS-4216-2021; Alexander, Lisa V/A-8477-2011; Fischer, Erich/B-6067-2011; Dittus, Andrea J./AAQ-3141-2020; Hawkins, Ed/B-7921-2011; Donat, Markus/J-8331-2012; Karoly, David J/C-8262-2011; Dittus, Andrea/F-9100-2015","Perkins-Kirkpatrick, Sarah E/0000-0001-9443-4915; Lewis, Sophie/0000-0001-6416-0634; King, Andrew/0000-0001-9006-5745; Alexander, Lisa V/0000-0002-5635-2457; Fischer, Erich/0000-0003-1931-6737; Dittus, Andrea J./0000-0001-9598-6869; Hawkins, Ed/0000-0001-9477-3677; Donat, Markus/0000-0002-0608-7288; Karoly, David J/0000-0002-8671-2994; Dittus, Andrea/0000-0001-9598-6869","Australian Research Council [RM08448, CE110001028, DE150100456, LP100200690, DE140100952]; UK National Environmental Research Council [NE/I020792/1]; National Centre for Atmospheric Science (NCAS-Climate); NCI facility in Australia; NERC [NE/N006054/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Natural Environment Research Council [ncas10009, NE/N006054/1] Funding Source: researchfish",Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); UK National Environmental Research Council; National Centre for Atmospheric Science (NCAS-Climate); NCI facility in Australia; NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"We thank the editor for handling this paper and the reviewers for their constructive feedback.

Of course, rock art can also be included in the number of such sites. Archaeological research conducted not only in Azerbaijan but also in many countries of the world led to the same conclusion that petroglyphs belonging to different periods of history from the Stone Age, in addition to being a valuable source, are primary samples of art. The complex of these images has a scientific importance as a valuable source for studying the roots of different fields of art (graphics, visual arts, music, ballet, theater), climate and history of the territory on which it was spread. Primitive art can be properly understood only in a social context, and only as a single system associated with the worldview. It is important that most experts interpret rock carvings, signs as the initial stage in the development of the mentioned fields of art. From this perspective, the art history and ethnographic study of rock art of Azerbaijan is of great scientific importance; these images are similar to West European in their artistic and aesthetic properties. One of the interesting and important issues is causes of petroglyphs. According to the researchers, it is the result of people's desire to fix everything seen-images, life, hunting scenes, etc. It is possible that petroglyphs are also the desire of ancient artists to leave a memory of themselves and of their family. It is important to note one more thing related to petroglyphs found in different parts of the world. The Font-de-Gaume in France, the Cave of Altamira in Spain and the Kapova cave in the Urals have images dating back to the Upper Paleolithic, and they are older than the images in Gobustan. Africa, Central Asia, Central Siberia, Mongolia also have images of the period of Gobustan images or later, and images similar to those in Gobustan. However, while images in these collections cover specific millenniums of separate historical periods, Gobustan rock art and other sites [ancient settlements, cemeteries and other archaeological and ethnographic monuments] reflect the continuity of life in a long period of time in the territory of Gobustan-about 15 thousand years-from the Upper Paleolithic to the Middle Ages. This is an important feature that distinguishes rock carvings in Gobustan from others. The main theme of rock art of Azerbaijan is the lives of people and animals. Images of women and men are reflected in the profiles of the hunter, sailor, rider, armed or unarmed man, etc. Thus, another important function of rock art is observed. They prove that, along with history, the art and culture of our people also have ancient roots in the Stone Age. According to I. Dzhafarzade, petroglyphs and other monuments and archaeological sites associated with them are a very important set of ancient culture. They can be traced to a more ancient period.","[Alimammadov, Anar F.] Natl Acad Sci Azerbaijan, Inst Archaeol & Ethnog, Baku, Azerbaijan",Azerbaijan National Academy of Sciences (ANAS); Institute of Archaeology & Ethnography of the Azerbaijan National Academy of Sciences,"Alimammadov, AF (corresponding author), Natl Acad Sci Azerbaijan, Inst Archaeol & Ethnog, Baku, Azerbaijan.",anarelimemmedov@yahoo.com,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,9,TOMSK STATE UNIV,TOMSK,"LENIN AVE, 36, TOMSK, 634050, RUSSIA",1561-7793,1561-803X,,TOMSK STATE UNIV J,Tomsk State Univ.

Hence, global climate change is altering these environmental cues and will preclude, delay, or enhance regeneration from seeds, as already documented in some cases. Along with compromised seedling emergence and vigour, shifts in germination phenology will influence population dynamics, and thus, species composition and diversity of communities. Altered seed maturation (including consequences for dispersal) and seed mass will have ramifications on life history traits of plants. Predicted changes in temperature and precipitation, and thus in soil moisture, will affect many components of seed persistence in soil, e.g. seed longevity, dormancy release and germination, and soil pathogen activity. More/less equitable climate will alter geographic distribution for species, but restricted migratory capacity in some will greatly limit their response. Seed traits for weedy species could evolve relatively quickly to keep pace with climate change enhancing their negative environmental and economic impact. Thus, increased research in understudied ecosystems, on key issues related to seed ecology, and on evolution of seed traits in nonweedy species is needed to more fully comprehend and plan for plant responses to global warming.","[Walck, Jeffrey L.; Hidayati, Siti N.] Middle Tennessee State Univ, Dept Biol, Murfreesboro, TN 37132 USA; [Dixon, Kingsley W.] Kings Pk & Bot Gardens, Perth, WA 6005, Australia; [Dixon, Kingsley W.] Univ Western Australia, Sch Plant Biol, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Thompson, Ken] Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England; [Poschlod, Peter] Univ Regensburg, Inst Bot, D-93040 Regensburg, Germany",Middle Tennessee State University; University of Western Australia; University of Sheffield; University of Regensburg,"Walck, JL (corresponding author), Middle Tennessee State Univ, Dept Biol, Murfreesboro, TN 37132 USA.",jwalck@mtsu.edu,"Poschlod, Peter/AAF-7902-2019; Dixon, Kingsley W/A-8133-2016; Dixon, Kingsley W/B-1042-2011","Dixon, Kingsley W/0000-0001-5989-2929; Hidayati, Siti Nur/0000-0001-6979-8477","Bavarian Ministery of Science, Research and Art","Bavarian Ministery of Science, Research and Art","Kathryn Steadman, Kayri Havens, and an anonymous reviewer are thanked for their helpful comments.

Thus, entrepreneurship education which draws upon the traditional business paradigm is based on real case studies to a large extent. Alternatively to the previous dominant stream of teaching, the present article focuses on the use of art in entrepreneurship education in accordance with Dewey's perspective for the utility of the aesthetic experience. To make entrepreneurial art-based teaching more systematic, three distinct levels for art adoption are introduced with different learning objectives and expectations. Accordingly, pieces of art can be used for entertainment, facilitating the classroom climate, for comprehension of concepts and skills and further, for reflection or critical reflection. The features of each separate level are discussed and examples from music, poetry, painting, literature, theatre or cinema are given. Furthermore, empirical evidence is sought from an elective course where students were free to choose either to elaborate a business plan or to work with a piece of art. Comparisons between the two groups indicate that the first group seeks for acquisition of business skills and knowledge whilst the second advocates gratification and deeper thinking on the notions. The preferences and expectations of the latter group are consistent with the present framework for art-adoption and provide insights for future research. Therefore, the article develops a theoretical framework for art-based teaching in entrepreneurship, supported by rudimentary empirical evidence, in order to motivate scholars and educators towards art adoption as learning innovation in entrepreneurial teaching.","[Kakouris, Alexandros; Liargovas, Panagiotis] Univ Peloponnese, Dept Management Sci & Technol, Tripoli, Greece; [Liargovas, Panagiotis] Ctr Planning & Econ Res, Athens, Greece",University of Peloponnese,"Kakouris, A (corresponding author), Univ Peloponnese, Dept Management Sci & Technol, Tripoli, Greece.",a.kakouris@uop.gr,,,"Centre of Planning and Economic Research, Greece","Centre of Planning and Economic Research, Greece","P.L. acknowledges funding from the Centre of Planning and Economic Research, Greece, towards participating in the conference.",,35,0,0,1,2,ACAD  CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-1050,2049-1069,978-1-914587-10-8,PROC EUR CONF ENTREP,,,2021,,,,,468,475,,10.34190/EIE.21.071,http://dx.doi.org/10.34190/EIE.21.071,,,8,Business; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BS7EF,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000759344600055,View Full Record in Web of Science

This has significant implications for our ability to reach the Sustainable Development Goals (e.g. SDGs 2, 3, 13, 15) and for the design of effective mitigation and adaptation policies and risk management. To be able to achieve the SDG targets, closer integration of climate change and air pollution both in terms of impact assessment for human health and agricultural productivity and respective policy development is needed. Currently, studies estimating the impacts of climate and air pollutants on human health and crops mostly treat these stressors separately, and the methods used by the health and agricultural science communities differ. Better insights into the methods applied in the different communities can help to improve existing and develop new methods to advance our knowledge about the combined impacts of climate change and air pollution on human health and crops. This topical review provides an overview of current methodologies applied in the two fields of human health and agricultural crop impact studies, ranging from empirical regression-based and experimental methods to more complex process-based models. The latter are reasonably well developed for estimating impacts on agricultural crops, but not for health impacts. We review available literature addressing the combined effects of climate and air pollution on human health or agricultural productivity to provide insights regarding state-of-the-art knowledge and currently available methods in the two fields. Challenges to assess the combined effect of climate and air pollution on human health and crops, and opportunities for both fields to learn from each other, are discussed.","[Sillmann, Jana; Aunan, Kristin; Van Oort, Bob; Brisebois, Anouk] Ctr Int Climate Res CICERO, Pb 1129 Blindern, N-0318 Oslo, Norway; [Emberson, Lisa] Univ York, Environm & Geog Dept, York YO10 5NG, N Yorkshire, England; [Bueker, Patrick] Deutsch Gesell Int Zusammenarbeit GIZ GmbH, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [O'Neill, Connie] Univ York, Environm & Geog Dept, SEI York, York YO10 5NG, N Yorkshire, England; [Otero, Noelia] Inst Adv Sustainabil Studies, Berliner Str 130, D-14467 Potsdam, Germany; [Otero, Noelia] Freie Univ, Inst Meteorol, Carl Heinrich Becker Weg 6-10, D-12165 Berlin, Germany; [Pandey, Divya] Leibniz Zentrum Agrarlandschaftsforsch, Eberswalder Str 84, D-15374 Muncheberg, Germany",University of York - UK; University of York - UK; Free University of Berlin; Leibniz Zentrum fur Agrarlandschaftsforschung (ZALF),"Sillmann, J (corresponding author), Ctr Int Climate Res CICERO, Pb 1129 Blindern, N-0318 Oslo, Norway.",jana.sillmann@cicero.oslo.no,"Sillmann, Jana/P-3482-2017; Emberson, Lisa/ABA-8711-2021","Sillmann, Jana/0000-0002-0219-5345; ","Norwegian Research Council [310672, 160015/F40, 244551]; Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (UK); European Union [820655, 771134]","Norwegian Research Council(Research Council of NorwayEuropean Commission); Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (UK)(Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA)); European Union(European Commission)","We thank two anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments that greatly improved this article.

Sentinels of climate and environmental changes, mountains have experienced more rapid and intense warming trends in the recent decades, leading to serious impacts on mountain ecosystems and downstream. In this paper we use a state-of-the-art Global Climate Model (EC-Earth) to investigate the impact of model spatial resolution on the representation of this phenomenon and to highlight possible differences in EDW and its causes in different mountain regions of the Northern Hemisphere. To this end we use EC-Earth climate simulations at five different spatial resolutions, from approximate to 125 to approximate to 16 km, to explore the existence and the driving mechanisms of EDW in the Colorado Rocky Mountains, the Greater Alpine Region and the Tibetan Plateau-Himalayas. Our results show that the more frequent EDW drivers in all regions and seasons are the changes in albedo and in downward thermal radiation and this is reflected in both daytime and nighttime warming. In the Tibetan Plateau-Himalayas and in the Greater Alpine Region, an additional driver is the change in specific humidity. We also find that, while generally the model shows no clear resolution dependence in its ability to simulate the existence of EDW in the different regions, specific EDW characteristics such as its intensity and the relative role of different driving mechanisms may be different in simulations performed at different spatial resolutions. Moreover, we find that the role of internal climate variability can be significant in modulating the EDW signal, as suggested by the spread found in the multi-member ensemble of the EC-Earth experiments which we use.","[Palazzi, Elisa; Mortarini, Luca; Terzago, Silvia; von Hardenberg, Jost] CNR, Natl Res Council, ISAC, Inst Atmospher Sci & Climate, Corso Fiume 4, I-10133 Turin, Italy; [Mortarini, Luca] Univ Fed Santa Maria, Dept Fis, Santa Maria, RS, Brazil",Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Scienze dell'Atmosfera e del Clima (ISAC-CNR); Universidade Federal de Santa Maria (UFSM),"Palazzi, E (corresponding author), CNR, Natl Res Council, ISAC, Inst Atmospher Sci & Climate, Corso Fiume 4, I-10133 Turin, Italy.",e.palazzi@isac.cnr.it,"Terzago, Silvia/F-3801-2018; Mortarini, Luca/C-6556-2015; palazzi, elisa/C-7048-2015; von Hardenberg, Jost/D-1872-2010","Terzago, Silvia/0000-0001-7867-0440; Mortarini, Luca/0000-0002-0543-2975; palazzi, elisa/0000-0003-1683-5267; von Hardenberg, Jost/0000-0002-5312-8070","European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [641762, 641816]; Italian project of Interest NextData of the Italian Ministry for Education, University and Research","European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme; Italian project of Interest NextData of the Italian Ministry for Education, University and Research","This work has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement no. 641762 (ECOPOTENTIAL) and under grant agreement 641816 (CRESCENDO).

However, in order to make informed adaptation decisions, the uncertainties associated with their output must be recognized and taken into account. In this paper, the cascade of uncertainty from emissions scenario to global model to regional climate model is explored. The initial part of the discussion focuses on uncertainties associated with human action, such as emissions of greenhouse gases, and the climate system's response to increased greenhouse gas forcing, which includes climate sensitivity and feedbacks. In the second part of the discussion, uncertainties associated with climate modelling are explored with emphasis on the implications for regional scale analysis. Such uncertainties include parameterizations and resolutions, initial and boundary conditions inherited from the driving global model, intermodel variability and issues surrounding the validation or verification of models. The paper concludes with a critique of approaches employed to quantify or cater for uncertainties highlighting the strengths and limitations of such approaches.","Natl Univ Ireland, Dept Geog, Maynooth, Kildare, Ireland",Maynooth University,"Foley, AM (corresponding author), Natl Univ Ireland, Dept Geog, Maynooth, Kildare, Ireland.",aideen.m.foley@nuim.ie,,"Foley, Aideen/0000-0002-3310-9622",Higher Education Authority's Programme for Research in Third-Level Institutions; EU [EVK2-CT2001-00132],Higher Education Authority's Programme for Research in Third-Level Institutions; EU(European Commission),"This work was supported by the Higher Education Authority's Programme for Research in Third-Level Institutions (Cycle 4).

The UK-based program aimed to reduce CO2 emissions and encourage behavioral change through community-led environmental projects. It, thus, employed six community development facilitators, with expertise in environmental issues. These facilitators supported and learnt from 18 community groups over an 18-month period. The paper explores the narratives of the six professional facilitators. These facilitators discuss their experiences of supporting community groups. They also explain their-contribution to the wider evaluation of the community-led projects. This paper reflects on the facilitator experience of the program's outcome-led evaluation process. In turn, it also explores how the groups they supported experienced the process. The facilitator's narratives reveal that often community-group objectives did not align with predefined outcomes established through theory of change or logic model methodologies, which had been devised in attempt to align to program (under aims. Assisting community action emerges in this inquiry as a stochastic art that requires funder and facilitator willingness to experiment and openness to the possibilities of learning from failure. Drawing on in-depth accounts, the article illustrates that a reflexive, interpretive evaluation approach can enhance learning opportunities and provides funders with more trustworthy representations of community-led initiatives. Yet, it also addresses why such an approach remains marginal within policy circles. (C) 2016 The Author(s).

The response of Kiremt-season precipitation to climate change is thus of great concern to water resource managers. However, the complex processes that control Kiremt-season precipitation challenge the capability of general circulation models (GCMs) to accurately simulate precipitation amount and variability. This in turn raises questions about their utility for predicting future changes. This study assesses the impact of climate change on Kiremt-season precipitation using state-of-the-art GCMs participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5. Compared to models with a coarse resolution, high-resolution models (horizontal resolution < 2A degrees) can more accurately simulate precipitation, most likely due to their ability to capture precipitation induced by topography. Under the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 scenario, these high-resolution models project an increase in precipitation over central Highlands and northern Great Rift Valley in Ethiopia, but a decrease in precipitation over the southern part of the country. Such a dipole pattern is attributable to the intensification of the North Atlantic subtropical high (NASH) in a warmer climate, which influences Ethiopian Kiremt-season precipitation mainly by modulating atmospheric vertical motion. Diagnosis of the omega equation demonstrates that an intensified NASH increases (decreases) the advection of warm air and positive vorticity into the central Highlands and northern Great Rift Valley (southern part of the country), enhancing upward motion over the northern Rift Valley but decreasing elsewhere. Under the RCP 4.5 scenario, the high-resolution models project an intensification of the NASH by 15 (3 x 10(5) m(2) s(-2)) geopotential meters (stream function) at the 850-hPa level, contributing to the projected precipitation change over Ethiopia. The influence of the NASH on Kiremt-season precipitation becomes more evident in the future due to the offsetting effects of two other major circulation systems: the East African Low-level Jet (EALLJ) and the Tropical Easterly Jet (TEJ). The high-resolution models project a strengthening of the EALLJ, but a weakening of the TEJ. Future changes in the EALLJ and TEJ will drive this precipitation system in opposite directions, leading to small or no net changes in precipitation in Ethiopia.","[Li, Laifang; Li, Wenhong] Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Earth & Ocean Sci, 321C Old Chem Bldg,POB 90227, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Ballard, Tristan] Duke Univ, Trinity Coll Arts & Sci, Environm Sci, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Sun, Ge] USDA Forest Serv, Eastern Forest Environm Threat Assessment Ctr, Raleigh, NC 27606 USA; [Jeuland, Marc] Duke Univ, Sanford Sch Publ Policy, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Jeuland, Marc] Duke Univ, Duke Global Hlth Inst, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Li, Laifang] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Phys Oceanog, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA",Duke University; Duke University; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service; Duke University; Duke University; Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution,"Li, WH (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Earth & Ocean Sci, 321C Old Chem Bldg,POB 90227, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",wenhong.li@duke.edu,"Sun, Ge/ABF-6673-2020","Ballard, Tristan/0000-0002-7110-3598","NSF Grant [AGS-1147608, NIH-1R21AG044294-01A1]; Postdoctoral Scholar Program at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution; Ocean and Climate Change Institute",NSF Grant(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Postdoctoral Scholar Program at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution; Ocean and Climate Change Institute,"We acknowledge the World Climate Research Programme's Working Group on Coupled Modeling, which is responsible for CMIP, and we thank the climate modeling groups (listed in Table 1 of this paper) for producing and making available their model output.

The beneficial effects of climate therapy, are related to the reduced allergenic load and to the fact that,mites do not survive at high altitudes. Less exposure to allergens leads to improved respiratory function, decreased bronchial hyperreactivity, and lower levels of total and specific IgE as well as markers of inflammation. These different actions combine to produce a lower prevalence of asthma at higher altitudes. Other advantages of climate therapy is related to better management of care by a multidisciplinary team. This in turn enables: - a combined medial and paramedical approach to stablize the asthma with minimal effective closes of drug therapy; - the development of a specific educational program aimed at improving therapeutic compliance; - and art individualized education adapted to the learning problems which are often important in these children.

This seems to suggest a need for greater factuality/concreteness in artistic visualization projects, which may indeed be the case. However, in this paper, we synthesize insights from environmental psychology, the psychology of art, and intermediate disciplines like eco-aesthetics, to argue that artworks-defined by their counterfactual qualities-can be effective for stimulating elements of environmental consciousness. We also argue that different artworks may yield different effects depending on how they combine counter/factual strategies. In so doing, we assert that effective artistic perceptualization-here expressed as affectivization-exceeds the faithful translation of facts from one mode to another, and cannot be encapsulated in a single example of un/successful art.","[Buening, Rebecca; Maeda, Takuya; Liew, Kongmeng; Aramaki, Eiji] Nara Inst Sci & Technol, Grad Sch Sci & Technol, Informat Sci Div, Social Comp Lab, Nara, Japan",Nara Institute of Science & Technology,"Buening, R (corresponding author), Nara Inst Sci & Technol, Grad Sch Sci & Technol, Informat Sci Div, Social Comp Lab, Nara, Japan.",rebecca.buening@is.naist.jp,,,,,,,77,0,0,1,1,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-1078,,,FRONT PSYCHOL,Front.

In addition, the climatology regime of future climate projections is presented using 16 state-of-the-art global climate models participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 under 2 different representative concentration pathway (RCP) emissions scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). In the process, changes in the climate normals of 1961-1990 and 2061-2090 are compared. The following results were obtained: (1) Over the past century, the average annual amount of precipitation was 254 +/- 5 mm, 67.8% of which appeared in summer (June to August), and no clear trends were found. Temperature exhibited a clear upward trend at a rate of 0.18 degrees C decade(-1) (p < 0.001), and the increases in minimum temperature, mean temperature and maximum temperature were 1.90, 1.78 and 1.59 degrees C, respectively, showing an asymmetric warming process. The winter minimum temperature showed the largest warming trend, at a rate of 0.36 degrees C decade(-1) (p < 0.001). Spatial heterogeneity was apparent for both precipitation and temperature, although these variables exhibited different patterns. (2) During the coming century, increases in precipitation and temperature can be seen under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, with pronounced larger amplitude changes under RCP8.5. By 2100, the increases in precipitation are 13.3 and 16.1% for RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively, and the increases in mean temperature are 3.5 and 7.1 degrees C. The spatial patterns are more complicated. These results suggest that the Mongolian Plateau will experience significant climate warming and accompanying increased precipitation.

Whereas hemispheric or regional multi-proxy reconstructions for the past 500-1000 years are available for Europe and North America, the Southern Hemisphere including South America has remained largely terra incognita. In this special issue we present a comprehensive review of previously published and new data sets from a variety of paleoclimate archives across southern South America (south of ca. 15 degrees S). The underlying collaborative research initiative started in 2006 under the umbrella of IGBP-PACES Focus 2 Regional Climate Dynamics and aimed to (i) collate the large number of disperse paleoclimate data sets from various proxies for the last ca. 1000 years, and (ii) produce a spatially explicit, highly resolved, multi-proxy climate reconstruction for southern South America. The review and research articles in this special issue cover a variety of archives (historical documents, tree rings, ice cores, glacier fluctuations and lacustrine sediments) and suggest that, at least south of ca. 18 degrees S, the spatial and temporal coverage of the data is adequate to develop synoptic multi-proxy reconstructions for the past ca. 400 years. Although additional high-quality proxy records are still needed to resolve the finer temporal and spatial structure of past climate variations, the currently available data do provide a consistent picture of climate fluctuations at a large scale. We have identified two major directions for future research: (i) a dedicated effort to build a comprehensive, quality-tested, and homogenized set of climate data during the (early) instrumental period in order to calibrate proxy data series, to test and extend reanalysis data sets, and to explore the multi-decadal variability of synoptic-scale atmospheric features, and (ii) expansion of the database of robust well-calibrated paleoclimate data series of adequate quality, temporal resolution and spatial representation; currently, this is the bottleneck for further improvements of the reconstructions. Existing older data sets should be updated to include the most recent years. While well-calibrated tree-ring archives and documentary data have restrictions in terms of spatial coverage and/or the length of the data series, calibration and quantification of proxy series from ice cores, glacier fluctuations, lake sediments and vegetation records are of utmost concern and require greatest attention.

Although some review studies addressed land suitability, few of them specifically focused on land suitability analysis for agriculture. Furthermore, previous reviews have not reflected on the impact of climate change on future land suitability and how this can be addressed or integrated into ALSA methods. In the context of global environmental changes and sustainable agriculture debate, we showed from the current review that ALSA is a worldwide land use planning approach. We reported from the reviewed articles 69 frequently used factors in ALSA. These factors were further categorized in climatic conditions (16), nutrients and favorable soils (34 of soil and landscape), water availability in the root zone (8 for hydrology and irrigation) and socio-economic and technical requirements (11). Also, in getting a complete view of crop's ecosystems and factors that can explain and improve yield, inherent local socio-economic factors should be considered. We showed that this aspect has been often omitted in most of the ALSA modeling with only 38% of the total reviewed article using socio-economic factors. Also, only 30% of the studies included uncertainty and sensitivity analysis in their modeling process. We found limited inclusions of climate change in the application of the ALSA. We emphasize that incorporating current and future climate change projections in ALSA is the way forward for sustainable or optimum agriculture and food security.

In the present paper, detailed elaboration has been made how the state-of-art technologies of weather forecasting including the climate projections can be taken as a tool to reduce the negative impacts of climate change and climatic variability. Also for combating the climate change issues, the adaptation requires effective and timely delivery and exchange of all supporting mechanism and meteorological information.

A hundred and twenty kilometers from each other, they are surrounded by plains and sandy formations, punctuated by a few smaller massifs. Although they are of different ages and geological formations, the two great massifs both offered interesting and complementary refuges for prehistoric groups who used rock shelters, cliffs and boulders for engraving and painting. The existence of a multitude of styles and techniques allow to detect striking parallels between the rock art record of the two regions, providing a dynamic view of the regionalization of rock art and of how these territories were conceived and occupied by semi-nomadic groups during the Holocene optimum period (8000-3500 BCE). Paintings from the Gilf el-Kebir show very close stylistic affinities with representations identified in the Jebel el-'Uweinat. But the fact that they remain a minority in the overall rock art record from both areas tends to evidence that, contrary to what has been hypothesized before, migrations between the Gilf el-Kebir and the Jebel el-'Uweinat were not systematic. This paper also highlights a possible increase in the contacts and migrations between the two massifs after the adoption of pastoralist lifestyles. The repartition of rock art and the evolution through times of the parallels offers interesting insights into land use strategies of both hunter-gatherers and herd keepers in such contrasted environments, and into what can be called symbolic territories.

Led by the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) and the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR), MECCA sponsored many numerical experiments on a CRAY-YMP supercomputer dedicated to climate modeling and produced information material with particular emphasis on assessing uncertainties involved in climate modeling for a range of potential users of climate predictions. As it turned out, it was difficult to align the goals of the climate modeling community with those of the climate impacts assessment community. Modelers primarily wanted to advance state-of-the-art General Circulation Models (GCMs). Impact analysts were interested in model evaluation in order to improve confidence levels in impacts predictions. An unconventional organizational scheme in climate science, MECCA also was a social experiment' in bringing together diverse communities and overcoming mutual skepticism. Climate scientists were skeptical about the policy-making ambitions of MECCA and about industry's motivation for getting involved in climate science, while industry doubted whether the scientists really made efforts to direct their work toward policy-relevant research questions. MECCA taught some scientists key lessons about the interactions between science and politics, but MECCA as such provided no effective answers to some of the basic skepticisms in the climate regime and consequently failed to reduce uncertainty on climate change issues.","[Hundebol, Nils Randlev; Nielsen, Kristian H.] Aarhus Univ, Ctr Sci Studies, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark",Aarhus University,"Hundebol, NR (corresponding author), Aarhus Univ, Ctr Sci Studies, Ny Munkegade 120-1520, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark.",nils.randlev.hundeboel@ivs.au.dk; khn@ivs.au.dk,,"Nielsen, Kristian Hvidtfelt/0000-0002-6192-400X",,,,,79,2,2,0,13,UNIV CALIFORNIA PRESS,OAKLAND,"155 GRAND AVE, SUITE 400, OAKLAND, CA 94612-3758 USA",1939-1811,1939-182X,,HIST STUD NAT SCI,Hist.

Tailoring this information to the needs of policymakers requires collaboration between scientists and stakeholders. A lot of literature on design principles and comprehension of scientific visualisations exists. However, the links between objective comprehension, perceived usefulness for communication and aesthetics of climate change impact maps have rarely been analysed in empirical studies. In a co-design effort together with stakeholders in adaptation planning and climate change communication experts, regional climate change impact maps were developed and published as open-access dataset. The comprehension, aesthetics and perceived usefulness of different map design features were qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated in a two-step survey. Designs with less information density were understood best, found most aesthetical and useful for communication practice. Uncertainties were deemed necessary by participants, but not understood well when combined with other variables on the same map sheet. Map understanding varied significantly with the cognitive difficulty of a task. This difference was robust over user groups. Co-designing maps at the science-policy interface have the potential to create more useful and comprehensible communication materials and thus supports adaptation planning with the best available information on future climate impacts.","[Becsi, Benedikt; Formayer, Herbert] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sciences, Inst Meteorol & Climatology, Gregor-Mendel-Str 33, A-1180 Vienna, Austria; [Hohenwallner-Ries, Daniela; Huber, Tobias] alpS GmbH, Grabenweg 68, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; [Grothmann, Torsten] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Inst Business Adm & Business Educ, Ammerlander Heerstr 114-118, DE-26129 Oldenburg, Germany; [Prutsch, Andrea] Environm Agcy Austria, Spittelauer Lande 5, A-1090 Vienna, Austria",Carl von Ossietzky Universitat Oldenburg,"Becsi, B (corresponding author), Univ Nat Resources & Life Sciences, Inst Meteorol & Climatology, Gregor-Mendel-Str 33, A-1180 Vienna, Austria.",benedikt.becsi@boku.ac.at,,"Becsi, Benedikt/0000-0002-5659-1183",,,,,38,10,10,1,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

To date, much sustainability education is prescriptive, rather than participatory, and most integrated art-science programming aims for content learning, rather than societal change. What this means is that learners are more often taught what is than invited to imagine what if? In order to envision and enact sustainable alternatives, there is a need for methods that allow community members, especially young people, to critically engage with the present, imagine a better future, and collaboratively act for sustainability today. This manuscript introduces a methodological framework that integrates the arts and sciences to facilitate: (1) transdisciplinary learning, focusing on local sustainability challenges; (2) participatory process, bringing experience-based knowledge into conversation with research-based knowledge; and (3) collaborative sustainability action, inviting community members to envision and enact sustainable alternatives where they live. The transformative potential of this framework is examined through international case studies from countries representing the richest and poorest in the Western hemisphere: a multi-site research study and after-school program for climate change education and action in collaboration with children in the Western US; and a multi-cycle research study and community arts center course for environmental photography and youth-led water advocacy in Southern Haiti. Despite many shared characteristics, case studies diverge in important ways relative to the sustainability challenges they sought to address, the specific context in which activities took place, and the manner in which art-science integration was practiced. Across cases, however, art-science integration facilitated participants' learning, connection, and action for sustainability. Framed by the shared aims of transdisciplinary approaches, this manuscript discusses methodological hurdles and practical lessons learned in art-science integration across settings as well as the transformative capacity of alternative pedagogical and research practices in building a sustainable future.","[Trott, Carlie D.] Univ Cincinnati, Dept Psychol, Cincinnati, OH 45221 USA; [Even, Trevor L.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Anthropol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Frame, Susan M.] Jakmel Ekspresyon Art Ctr, Jacmel, Haiti",University System of Ohio; University of Cincinnati; Colorado State University,"Trott, CD (corresponding author), Univ Cincinnati, Dept Psychol, Cincinnati, OH 45221 USA.",carlie.trott@uc.edu; trevor.even@colostate.edu; jakmelekspresyon@gmail.com,,,,,,,115,8,8,2,29,SPRINGER JAPAN KK,TOKYO,"SHIROYAMA TRUST TOWER 5F, 4-3-1 TORANOMON, MINATO-KU, TOKYO, 105-6005, JAPAN",1862-4065,1862-4057,,SUSTAIN SCI,Sustain.

We discuss limitations due to the resolution of the current state of the art PRISM climate model and provide new methodology for intelligent up-sampling of the PRISM model for studies that require spatially explicit climate data. In order to stress the importance of choosing an adequate climate model and understanding its limitations, we provide two examples where baseline climate models caused misleading predictions of how the climate envelope of ecosystems shifts as a consequence of increased temperature, and how tree growth may respond to climate change.

SCHT is technically designed to make use of information from state-of-art seasonal forecasts provided by the Copernicus Climate Data Store (CDS) combined with a range of different machine learning algorithms to perform the seasonal forecast of the accumulated inflow discharges to the reservoir of hydropower plants. The machine learning algorithms considered include support vector regression, Gaussian processes, long short-term memory, non-linear autoregressive neural networks with exogenous inputs, and a deep-learning neural networks model. Each machine learning model is trained over past decades datasets of recorded data, and forecast performances are validated and evaluated using separate test sets with reference to the historical average of discharge values and simpler multiparametric regressions. Final results are presented to the users through a user-friendly web interface developed from a tied connection with end-users in an effective co-design process. Methods are tested for forecasting the accumulated seasonal river discharges up to six months in advance for two catchments in Colombia, South America. Results indicate that the machine learning algorithms that make use of a complex and/or recurrent architecture can better simulate the temporal dynamic behaviour of the accumulated river discharge inflow to both case study reservoirs, thus rendering SCHT a useful tool in providing information for water resource managers in better planning the allocation of water resources for different users and for hydropower plant managers when negotiating power purchase contracts in competitive energy markets.","[Essenfelder, Arthur H.; Larosa, Francesca; Mysiak, Jaroslav] Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Dept Risk Assessment & Adaptat Strategies, I-30123 Venice, VE, Italy; [Essenfelder, Arthur H.; Larosa, Francesca; Mysiak, Jaroslav; Mercogliano, Paola] Euro Mediterranean Ctr Climate Change, I-30175 Venezia Marghera, VE, Italy; [Mazzoli, Paolo; Bagli, Stefano; Broccoli, Davide; Luzzi, Valerio] GECOsistema Srl, I-47521 Cesena, Italy; [dalla Valle, Francesco] Enel Green Power SpA, I-00198 Rome, Italy",Universita Ca Foscari Venezia; Centro Euro-Mediterraneo sui Cambiamenti Climatici (CMCC),"Essenfelder, AH (corresponding author), Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Dept Risk Assessment & Adaptat Strategies, I-30123 Venice, VE, Italy.;Essenfelder, AH (corresponding author), Euro Mediterranean Ctr Climate Change, I-30175 Venezia Marghera, VE, Italy.",arthur.essenfelder@cmcc.it; francesca.larosa@cmcc.it; paolo.mazzoli@gecosistema.it; stefano.bagli@gecosistema.it; davide.broccoli@gecosistema.it; valerio.luzzi@gecosistema.it; jaroslay.mysiak@cmcc.it; paola.mercogliano@cmcc.it; francesco.dallavalle@enel.com,"Mysiak, Jaroslav/A-8683-2019; Essenfelder, Arthur Hrast/AAK-1790-2021","Mysiak, Jaroslav/0000-0001-9341-7048; Essenfelder, Arthur Hrast/0000-0001-9396-6928; Mercogliano, Paola/0000-0001-7236-010X; Broccoli, Davide/0000-0003-3129-9618; Larosa, Francesca/0000-0002-4350-8790",European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [730482],European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme,This research was funded by the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Gran Agreement No 730482 in the framework of CLARA Project.,,73,2,2,2,5,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4433,,ATMOSPHERE-BASEL,Atmosphere,DEC,2020,12,,,,,,1305,10.3390/atmos11121305,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos11121305,,,21,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,PJ3YI,,"gold, Green Published",,,12/21/22,WOS:000601707200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

So far, most studies dealt with individual model results. In the present analysis, we refer to 79 coupled ocean-atmosphere simulations from 12 different climate models under 6 different IPCC scenarios. The basic question is as to what extent various state-of-the-art climate models agree in predicting changes in the main features of El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the monsoon climates in South Asia and West Africa. The individual model runs are compared with observational data in order to judge whether the spatio-temporal characteristics of ENSO are well reproduced. The model experiments can be grouped into multi-model ensembles. Thus, climate change signals in the classical index time series, in the principal components and in the time series of interannual variability can be evaluated against the background of internal variability and model uncertainty. There are large differences between the individual model predictions until the end of the 21st century, especially in tenus of monsoon rainfall and the Southern Oscillation index (SOI). The majority of the models tends to project La Nina-like anomalies in the SOI and an intensification of the summer monsoon precipitation in India and West Africa. However, the response barely exceeds the level of natural variability and the systematic intermodel variations are larger than the impact of different IPCC scenarios. Nonetheless, there is one prominent climate change signal, which stands out from model variations and internal noise: All forced model experiments agree in predicting a substantial warming in the eastern tropical Pacific. This oceanic heating does not necessarily lead to a modification of ENSO towards more frequent El Nino and/or La Nina events. It simply represents a change in the background state of ENSO. Indeed, we did not find convincing multi-model evidence for a modification of the wavelet spectra in terms of ENSO or the monsoons. Some models suggest an intensification of the annual cycle but this signal is fairly model-dependent. Thus, large model uncertainty still exists with respect to the future behaviour of climate in the low latitudes. This has to be taken into account when addressing climate change signals in individual model experiments and ensembles. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

This article attempts to connect these two key concepts of education through the medium of the seasons. The seasons bridge both time and nature. Our experience of nature is temporal and manifests itself in the transition of the seasons. On the other hand, our experience of time is conditioned by the seasons. Seasons are a concrete manifestation of time and nature. It seems that philosophy has not paid enough attention to this. In this article, Japanese arts (such as the Katsura Imperial Villa and waka poetry) are used as the examples of how the arts can help to form our sensibility toward the seasons, which has ethical and educational implications.

The analysis has been carried out by using a process-based Crop Simulation Model (CSM)-CERES-Rice fed with improved state of art bias corrected climate projections from eight Global Climate Models (GCMs) for four expected climatic scenarios Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP 2.6, 4.5, 6.0 and 8.5). Using weather-soil-crop information along with year-wise effect of CO2 increase assumption for different RCPs as input to the crop model, simulations were performed for the base period (1976-2005) as well as three future periods (2020s: 2006-2035, 2050s: 2036-2065, and 2080s: 2066-2095) for insight understanding of climate change impact on rice yield. Model simulated rice yields of future periods were compared with that of the base period to quantify the climate change impact. Results based on multi-GCM ensemble show expected increase in rice yield of most of the AEZs in RCP 2.6 but as on moving towards RCP 8.5 through RCP 4.5 and 6.0, the positive impact on rice yield in RCP 2.6, in major rice producing zones, is expected to mitigate and lead to the negative impact by 2080s. Large spatio-temporal variability is expected in most of the zones with humongous variability in arid and hilly zones. The overall change in spatial rice yield in India taking all used GCM-RCP combinations in consideration is expected to vary from 1.2 to 8.8%, 0.7 to 12.6% and -2.9 to 17.8% due to the expected climate change in 2020s, 2050s and 2080s, respectively.","[Gupta, Rishabh; Mishra, Ashok] Indian Inst Technol Kharagpur, Agr & Food Engn Dept, Kharagpur 721302, W Bengal, India; [Gupta, Rishabh] Univ Illinois, Agr & Biol Engn Dept, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Kharagpur; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Gupta, R (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol Kharagpur, Agr & Food Engn Dept, Kharagpur 721302, W Bengal, India.;Gupta, R (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Agr & Biol Engn Dept, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",gupta.rishabh.61@outlook.com,"Gupta, Rishabh/HGT-9965-2022","Gupta, Rishabh/0000-0002-8937-1910","Climate Change Impact and Adaptation Options for Sustaining Rice-Wheat Crop Production in India project - Department of Science and Technology (DST), Climate Change Programme (SPLICE), Government of India [DST/CCP/CoE/79/2017]","Climate Change Impact and Adaptation Options for Sustaining Rice-Wheat Crop Production in India project - Department of Science and Technology (DST), Climate Change Programme (SPLICE), Government of India","This work has been partially supported by the Climate Change Impact and Adaptation Options for Sustaining Rice-Wheat Crop Production in India project, funded by the Department of Science and Technology (DST), Climate Change Programme (SPLICE), Government of India, under Grant Nr.

It is a challenge to determine how, when and by whom climate predictions should be translated into risk estimates usable for decision-making. In this paper results from the Climate for Culture project are used to study how heritage decision-makers interpret future indoor climate-related risks to Swedish churches. Different sets of risk maps were presented to ten engineers, ten building conservators and five experts on indoor climate related risks. Interviews were used to understand how the interviewees made sense of the presented information and if they associated it with a perceived need for adaptation. The results show that the risks were interpreted and assessed largely dependent on their pre-understanding and familiarity with the individual risks. The magnitude of change and the lack of uncertainty estimates were subordinate to the overall impression of the information as being credible and salient. The major conclusion is that the dissemination of risk information, also from projects which at the outset have aimed at producing knowledge relevant for end-users, should be both customized and tested in collaborative efforts by stakeholders and scientists.

The intersection with the human social survival strategy spawned additional adaptive meaning systems. Under conditions threatening survival in socially oriented human groups, extra-language meaning systems co-opted and adapted to facilitate unity, including the early formats of the arts. They would have percolated into cultural practice for this social purpose and ultimately survival. With evolutionary pressures tapping into biologically inherited, physiologically functioning sensory-motor pathways, anchored specifically in rhythm cognition and motor synchrony output, initial art practice conveyed symbolic group cohesion through communal, all-inclusive synchronously moving dance formations and rhythmically produced vocal or percussion sounds. As with the sounds of language in the deep past, and numerous other cultural behaviors, such nonmaterial early art formats would not have left marks in the archeological record but their evolutionary driven practice would have contributed to adaptive genetic factors woven into brain-behavior evolution. Their practice is likely to have well predated unearthed art-related objects. Consolidation of evidence and notions from language evolution, genetics, human physiology, comparative animal communication, archeology, and climate history in the distant past of early humans in Africa supports the evolutionary driven practice of initial nonmaterial art formats conveying symbolic expressions optimizing group survival.

Subsequently, the performance of the defined state-of-the-art CO2 system is compared to natural refrigerant-based cascade and HFC/HFO-based DX and indirect refrigeration solutions operating in cold and warm climates. The results indicate that two-stage heat recovery, flooded evaporation, parallel compression and integration of air conditioning are the most promising features of the state-of-the-art integrated CO2 system.

Rainfall is the main source of the ground and surface water resources. Recently due to anticipated climate change it is projected that spatial and temporal pattern of rainfall in different part of the country will be change and there will be increase in intensity of rainfall greater monsoon variability. This unprecedented change is expected to have severe impact on the on the water resource and finally on water resource estimation for future planning and management. Apart from climate change, both the ever increasing population and the rapidly changing land use patterns have left the major river basins of the India in a bleak uncertainty to keep up the required runoff. For planning and management, the climate and the hydrological modellers have begun working out runoff projections. During recent years, the Global Climate Models (GCMs) and Regional Climate Models (RCMs) driven hydrological models are in frequent use to draw such projections. But the projections have been often found to lack of reliability. Very recently, there is another emerging field of multi-model ensembles that has added feather to cap of the climate modeling community but this field is yet to be tried in many of the basin runoff-studies especially in the Indian perspective. There is a dire need for more research input assessing the future runoff as far as the Indian River basins are concerned. The climate models are being improved day by day so are the hydrological models. The multi-model ensembles are expected to bring out more reliability in the model outputs regarding the future runoff regimes of the basins than that could be brought about using individual models. The present study is a brief review of the model-based projections made for the some of the major river basins of the world. This attempt also seeks to bring forth the basin wise state-of-the-art research activities of such a kind so that the unexplored horizons of model based hydrological research could be taken up as newer research challenges like eg. in India there hasn't yet been much basin scale studies conducted using multi-model ensembles. Therefore it is suggested that detailed studies to be taken up to assess the impact of climate change on the various parameters involved in estimation of water resources and asses water resource keeping in view the climate change for more realistic future planning and integrated water resource management.

The present-day simulation (1961-1990) with PRECIS is evaluated, including an examination of the impact of enhanced resolution and an identification of biases. The RCM is able to resolve features on finer scales than those resolved by the GCM, particularly those related to improved resolution of the topography. The most notable advantage of using the RCM is a more realistic representation of the spatial patterns of summer monsoon rainfall such as the maximum along the windward side of the Western Ghats. There are notable quantitative biases in precipitation over some regions, mainly due to similar biases in the driving GCM. PRECIS simulations under scenarios of increasing greenhouse gas concentrations and sulphate aerosols indicate marked increase in both rainfall and temperature towards the end of the 21st century. Surface air temperature and rainfall show similar patterns of projected changes under A2 and B2 scenarios, but the B2 scenario shows slightly lower magnitudes of the projected change. The warming is monotonously widespread over the country, but there are substantial spatial differences in the projected rainfall changes. West central India shows maximum expected increase in rainfall. Extremes in maximum and minimum temperatures are also expected to increase into the future, but the night temperatures are increasing faster than the day temperatures. Extreme precipitation shows substantial increases over a large area, and particularly over the west coast of India and west central India.","Indian Inst Trop Meteorol, Pune 411008, Maharashtra, India",Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) - India; Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM),"Kumar, KR (corresponding author), Indian Inst Trop Meteorol, Pune 411008, Maharashtra, India.",kolli@tropmet.res.in,"Sahai, Atul/AAU-3958-2021","Sahai, Atul/0000-0002-2917-1802; Revadekar, Jayashree/0000-0003-3766-2342",,,,,28,363,370,0,43,INDIAN ACAD SCIENCES,BANGALORE,"C V RAMAN AVENUE, SADASHIVANAGAR, P B #8005, BANGALORE 560 080, INDIA",0011-3891,,,CURR SCI INDIA,Curr.

As such, transmission of the virus is considered to be sensitive to environmental conditions and therefore changes in climate can impact the spatiotemporal dynamics of epizootic vulnerability. Epidemiological information describing the methods and parameters of RVF transmission and its dependence on climatic factors are used to develop a new spatio-temporal mathematical model that simulates these dynamics and can predict the impact of changes in climate. The Liverpool RVF (LRVF) model is a new dynamic, process-based model driven by climate data that provides a predictive output of geographical changes in RVF outbreak susceptibility as a result of the climate and local livestock immunity. This description of the multi-disciplinary process of model development is accessible to mathematicians, epidemiological modellers and climate scientists, uniting dynamic mathematical modelling, empirical parameterisation and state-of-the-art climate information.","[Leedale, Joseph; Morse, Andrew P.] Univ Liverpool, Sch Environm Sci, Liverpool L69 3GE, Merseyside, England; [Jones, Anne E.; Caminade, Cyril] Univ Liverpool, Inst Infect & Global Hlth, Dept Epidemiol & Populat Hlth, Liverpool L69 3GE, Merseyside, England; [Caminade, Cyril; Morse, Andrew P.] Natl Inst Hlth Res, Hlth Protect Res Unit Emerging & Zoonot Infect, Liverpool, Merseyside, England",University of Liverpool; University of Liverpool; University of Liverpool,"Leedale, J (corresponding author), Univ Liverpool, Sch Environm Sci, Liverpool L69 3GE, Merseyside, England.",j.leedale@liverpool.ac.uk,,"Leedale, Joseph/0000-0001-9010-4126; Caminade, Cyril/0000-0002-3846-7082; Morse, Andrew/0000-0002-0413-2065",HEALTHY FUTURES EU-FP7 project [266327]; Farr Institute for Health Informatics Research (MRC) [MR/M0501633/1],HEALTHY FUTURES EU-FP7 project; Farr Institute for Health Informatics Research (MRC),the authors acknowledge funding support from the HEALTHY FUTURES EU-FP7 project (grant agreement 266327).

In a first application, changes in the precipitation regime alone were shown to affect the distribution of yield considerably, with shifts not only in the mean but also in the standard deviation and the skewness. Production risk was found to respond more markedly to changes in the long-term mean than in the inter-annual variability of seasonal precipitation amounts. In a further application, yield projections were generated with respect to a full climate scenario, with the emission pathway as specified in the IPCC A2 scenario. Anticipation of the sowing date was found to reduce the negative impact of climate change on yield stability, but was not sufficient to ensure average productivity levels comparable to those observed at present. We argued that this was caused by the reduction in the duration of the growing season, which had a stronger impact than suggested by previous studies. Assuming no change in price relations, the results also revealed a strong increase in production risk with climate change, with more than a doubling in the probability of yield falling short of a critical threshold as compared to today's situation.","Agroscope Res Ctn ART, Air Pollut Climate Grp, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland; Agroscope Res Stn ART, Farm Management Grp, CH-8356 Ettenhausen, Switzerland; Univ Geneva, CH-1227 Carouge, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Research Station Agroscope; Swiss Federal Research Station Agroscope; University of Geneva,"Calanca, P (corresponding author), Agroscope Res Ctn ART, Air Pollut Climate Grp, Reckenholzstr 191, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland.",pierluigi.calanca@art.admin.ch,"Lips, Markus/AAC-9765-2020","Lips, Markus/0000-0001-7850-7918; BENISTON, Martin/0000-0002-3782-5458",,,,,60,28,28,2,21,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1436-3798,,,REG ENVIRON CHANGE,Reg.

These inconsistencies lead to biased economic policy advice. Controlling for how the economy is represented, different climate models result in significantly different optimal CO2 emissions. A long delay between emissions and warming leads to optimal carbon prices that are too low and attaches too much importance to the discount rate. Similarly we find that omitting positive carbon cycle feedbacks leads to optimal carbon prices that are too low. We conclude that it is important for policy purposes to bring economic models in line with the state of the art in climate science, and we make practical suggestions for how to do so.","[Dietz, Simon; Venmans, Frank] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London, England; [Dietz, Simon; van der Ploeg, Frederick; Rezai, Armon] CESifo, Munich, Germany; [van der Ploeg, Frederick] Univ Oxford, Oxford, England; [van der Ploeg, Frederick] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Rezai, Armon] Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Vienna, Austria; [Rezai, Armon] IIASA, Laxenburg, Austria; [Venmans, Frank] Univ Mons, Mons, Belgium",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Ifo Institut; University of Oxford; University of Amsterdam; Vienna University of Economics & Business; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); University of Mons,"Dietz, S (corresponding author), London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London, England.;Dietz, S (corresponding author), CESifo, Munich, Germany.",s.dietz@lse.ac.uk,,,Grantham Foundation; Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique,Grantham Foundation; Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique(Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique - FNRS),"participants at AERE@ASSA 2021, AERE 2020, the Belgian Environmental Economics Day in Hasselt, the 2020 CESifo Area Conference on Energy and Climate Economics, EAERE 2020, the European Geophysical Union 2020, the London School of Economics-Imperial Workshop in Environmental Economics, the Series of Webinars in Environmental and Energy Economics and Policy (SWEEP), and the Virtual Seminar in Climate Economics, as well as seminar participants at Bologna, Cambridge, the Centre International de Recherche sur l'Environnement et le Developpement (CIRED, Paris), and the European University Institute (Florence), for their input.

Such fluctuations do not appear directly in the equations of the mean climate but affect the mean indirectly through their effects on the time-mean transient-eddy fluxes of heat, momentum, and moisture. How large are these effects? What are the effects of tropical phenomena associated with substantial heating variations such as ENSO and the MJO? To what extent do variations of the extratropical surface heat fluxes and precipitation affect the mean climate? What are the effects of the rapid stochastic components of the heating fluctuations? Most current climate models misrepresent ENSO and the MJO and ignore stochastic forcing; they therefore also misrepresent their mean effects. To what extent does this contribute to climate model biases and to projections of climate change? This paper provides an assessment of such impacts by comparing with observations a long simulation of the northern winter climate by a dry adiabatic general circulation model forced only with the observed time-mean diabatic forcing as a constant forcing. Remarkably, despite the total neglect of all forcing variations, the model reproduces most features of the observed circulation variability and the mean climate, with biases similar to those of some state-of-the-art general circulation models. In particular, the spatial structures of the circulation variability are remarkably well reproduced. Their amplitudes, however, are progressively underestimated from the synoptic to the subseasonal to interannual and longer time scales. This underestimation is attributed to the neglect of the variable forcing. The model also excites significant tropical variability from the extratropics on interannual scales, which is overwhelmed in reality by the response to tropical heating variability. It is argued that the results of this study suggest a role for the stochastic, and not only the coherent, components of transient diabatic forcing in the dynamics of climate variability and the mean climate.","Univ Colorado, CIRES Climate Diagnost Ctr, Boulder, CO 80305 USA; NOAA, Earth Syst Res Lab, Boulder, CO 80305 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Sardeshmukh, PD (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, CIRES Climate Diagnost Ctr, 325 Broadway, Boulder, CO 80305 USA.",prashant.d.sardeshmukh@noaa.gov,,,,,,,30,17,17,0,2,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0894-8755,1520-0442,,J CLIMATE,J.

The effects of climate change factors such as elevated CO2, drought and warming on beneficial plant-microorganism interactions are increasingly being explored. This now makes it possible to test whether some general patterns occur and whether different groups of plant-associated microorganisms respond differently or in the same way to climate change. Here, we review the results of 135 studies investigating the effects of climate change factors on beneficial microorganisms and their interaction with host plants. The majority of studies showed that elevated CO2 had a positive influence on the abundance of arbuscular and ectomycorrhizal fungi, whereas the effects on plant growth-promoting bacteria and endophytic fungi were more variable. In most cases, plant-associated microorganisms had a beneficial effect on plants under elevated CO2. The effects of increased temperature on beneficial plant-associated microorganisms were more variable, positive and neutral, and negative effects were equally common and varied considerably with the study system and the temperature range investigated. Moreover, numerous studies indicated that plant growth-promoting microorganisms ( both bacteria and fungi) positively affected plants subjected to drought stress. Overall, this review shows that plant-associated microorganisms are an important factor influencing the response of plants to climate change.","[Compant, Stephane; Sessitsch, Angela] AIT Austrian Inst Technol GmbH, Bioresources Unit, A-2444 Seibersdorf, Austria; [van der Heijden, Marcel G.

The term is broad and can be applied in so many situations and settings to the learning that occurs outside of formal schooling. In this article, the author explores how a community event a painting competition held in a Melbourne suburb's botanic gardens constitutes public pedagogy. The event centres on appreciation of the gardens, and on fostering the arts in the community. Local schools and residents have shown their appreciation of the competition through increased participation over the past five years.

Capturing a collective memory of the suburb is one aspect of such learning that is historically significant.

The special issue Preservation of Cultural Heritage and Resources Threatened by Climate Change of Geosciences-launched to take stock of the existing but still fragmentary knowledge on this challenge, and to enable the community to respond to the implementation of the Paris agreement-includes 10 research articles. These papers exploit a broad range of data derived from preventive conservation monitoring conducted indoors in museums, churches, historical buildings, or outdoors in archeological sites and city centers. Case studies presented in the papers focus on a well-assorted sample of decay phenomena occurring on heritage materials-e.g., surface recession and biomass accumulation on limestone, depositions of pollutant on marble, salt weathering on inorganic building materials, and weathering processes on mortars in many local- to regional-scale study areas in the Scandinavian Peninsula, the United Kingdom, Belgium, France, Italy, Greece, and Panama. Besides monitoring, the methodological approaches that are showcased include, but are not limited to, original material characterization, decay product characterization, and climate and numerical modelling on material components for assessing environmental impact and climate change effects.","[Bertolin, Chiara] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Architecture & Technol, Alfred Getz Vei 3, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Bertolin, C (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Architecture & Technol, Alfred Getz Vei 3, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway.",chiara.bertolin@ntnu.no,"Bertolin, Chiara/ABI-3960-2020; Muñoz-Tuñon, Casiana/AAA-9309-2019","Bertolin, Chiara/0000-0002-0684-8980; Muñoz-Tuñon, Casiana/0000-0001-8876-4563",,,,,14,22,23,6,22,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3263,,GEOSCIENCES,Geosciences,JUN,2019,6,,,,,,250,10.3390/geosciences9060250,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/geosciences9060250,,,11,"Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Geology,IG4CV,,"Green Published, Green Submitted, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000473752600007,View Full Record in Web of Science

So far, mainly global climate models were used to generate PPEs, and little work has been conducted with regional climate models. This paper discusses the parameter uncertainty in two PPEs of a regional climate model driven by reanalysis data for the present climate over Europe. The uncertainty is evaluated for the variables of 2-m temperature, precipitation, and total cloud cover, with a focus on the annual cycle, interannual variability, and selected extremes. The authors show that the simulated spread of the PPEs encompasses the observations at a regional scale in terms of the annual cycle and the interannual variability, provided observational uncertainty is taken into account. To rank the PPEs a new skill metric is proposed, which takes into account observational uncertainty and natural variability. The metric is a generalization of the climate prediction index (CPI) and is compared to metrics used in other studies. The consideration of observational uncertainty is particularly important for total cloud cover and reveals that current observations do not allow for a systematic evaluation of high precipitation intensities over the entire European domain. The skill framework is additionally used to identify important model parameters, which are of interest for an objective model calibration.","[Bellprat, Omar; Kotlarski, Sven; Luethi, Daniel; Schaer, Christoph] ETH, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Bellprat, O (corresponding author), ETH, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, Univ Str 16, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",omar.bellprat@env.ethz.ch,"Schar, Christoph/A-1033-2008","Schar, Christoph/0000-0002-4171-1613; Bellprat, Omar/0000-0001-6434-1793",,,,,69,46,47,1,23,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0894-8755,1520-0442,,J CLIMATE,J.

Because of the possibly severe consequences that such an event could have on the northern North Atlantic and northwestern Europe, integrated assessment models (IAMs) are needed to explore the associated political and socioeconomic implications. State-of-the-art climate models representing the THC are, however, often too complex to be incorporated into an integrated assessment framework. In this paper we present a low-order model of the Atlantic THC which meets the main requirements of IAMs: it (1) is physically based, (2) is computationally highly efficient, (3) allows for comprehensive uncertainty analysis and (4) can be linked to globally aggregated climate models that are mostly used in IAMs. The model is an interhemispheric extension of the seminal Stommel model. Its parameters are determined by a least-squares fit to the output of a coupled climate model of intermediate complexity. Results of a number of transient global warming simulations indicate that the model is able to reproduce many features of the behaviour of coupled ocean-atmosphere circulation models such as the sensitivity of the THC to the amount, regional distribution and rate of climate change.","Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany; Tech Univ Berlin, Inst Math, D-10623 Berlin, Germany",Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; Technical University of Berlin,"Zickfeld, K (corresponding author), Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, POB 60 12 03, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany.",zickfeld@pik-potsdam.de,"Rahmstorf, Stefan/A-8465-2010","Rahmstorf, Stefan/0000-0001-6786-7723",,,,,61,23,23,0,19,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1616-7341,1616-7228,,OCEAN DYNAM,Ocean Dyn.,FEB,2004,1,,,,8,26,,10.1007/s10236-003-0054-7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10236-003-0054-7,,,19,Oceanography,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Oceanography,852OI,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000223765800002,View Full Record in Web of Science

The icons of the iconostasis of the church were made in the workshop of N.S. Emelyanov in Moscow in 1912. The investigation showed that the painter in principle technologically adhered to the traditional way of making icons. The panel is made of boards of lime wood with two crossbars on the reverse. The paint was applied to a chalk ground over a textile layer. The traditional iconographer's palette was expanded by a few contemporary pigments. The binding agent is classic egg tempera. Originally, the layers of paint had an oil varnish (olifa). The main aim of the project VirtEx, introduced in this paper, is to expand existing methods with numerical material and structural models to be able to predict quantitatively the behaviour of wooden artefacts under loads due to climate changes as well as mechanical loads. The detailed art technological investigation provides the required data for the computer models. The numerical data can then be validated with technologically exact copies and replicas. In the introduction to the article, the current state of research on icon painting techniques is also outlined.","[Herm, Christoph; Fuhrmann, Annegret; Kaden, Janine] Dresden Univ Fine Arts, Dresden, Germany; [Tietze, Oliver; Konopka, Daniel; Kaliske, Michael] Tech Univ Dresden, Inst Struct Anal, Dresden, Germany; [Belik, Zhanna; Trufanova, Olga] Cent Andrey Rublev Museum Ancient Russian Culture, Moscow, Russia; [Weiss, Bjoern] Inst Holztechnol Dresden, Dresden, Germany",Technische Universitat Dresden,"Tietze, O (corresponding author), Tech Univ Dresden, Inst Struct Anal, Dept Civil Engn, D-01062 Dresden, Germany.",oliver.tietze@tu-dresden.de,,"Trufanova, Olga/0000-0003-3389-8200; Belik, Zhanna/0000-0002-1962-4169; Konopka, Daniel/0000-0001-5522-611X","Sachsisches Staatsministerium fur Wissenschaft, Kultur und Tourismus [100371102]","Sachsisches Staatsministerium fur Wissenschaft, Kultur und Tourismus","This project is financed by the Sachsisches Staatsministerium fur Wissenschaft, Kultur und Tourismus with tax funds using the budget approved by the Landtag of the Free State of Saxony, Sachsische Aufbaubank [project number 100371102].",,49,2,2,1,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0039-3630,2047-0584,,STUD CONSERV,Stud.

We estimate the magnitude of between-cell groundwater flow as a function of grid cell size by aggregating results from a numerical model of equilibrium groundwater flow run and validated globally. We find that over a broad range of cell sizes spanning that of state-of-the-art regional and global climate models, mean between-cell groundwater flow magnitudes scale with the reciprocal of grid cell length. We also derive this scaling a priori from a simple statistical model of a flow network. We offer operational definitions of `significant' groundwater flow contributions to the grid cell water budget in both relative and absolute terms (between-cell flow magnitude exceeding 10% of local recharge or 10 mm y(-1), respectively). Groundwater flow is a significant part of the water budget, as measured by a combined test requiring both relative and absolute significance, over 42% of the land area at 0.1 degrees grid cell size (typical of regional and mesoscale models), decreasing to 1.5% at 1 degrees (typical of global models). Based on these findings, we suggest that between-cell groundwater flow should be represented in regional and mesoscale climate models to ensure realistic water budgets, but will have small effects on water exchanges in current global models. As well, parameterization of subgrid moisture heterogeneity should include the effects of within-cell groundwater flow.","[Krakauer, Nir Y.] CUNY City Coll, Dept Civil Engn, New York, NY 10031 USA; [Krakauer, Nir Y.] CUNY City Coll, NOAA CREST, New York, NY 10031 USA; [Li, Haibin; Fan, Ying] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA",City University of New York (CUNY) System; City College of New York (CUNY); City University of New York (CUNY) System; City College of New York (CUNY); National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Rutgers State University New Brunswick,"Krakauer, NY (corresponding author), CUNY City Coll, Dept Civil Engn, New York, NY 10031 USA.",nkrakauer@ccny.cuny.edu,,"Fan, Ying/0000-0002-0024-7965","NOAA [NA11SEC4810004, NA12OAR4310084]; EPA [STAR-RD834190]; National Science Foundation; Directorate For Geosciences [1045110] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); EPA(United States Environmental Protection Agency); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Directorate For Geosciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)),"The authors gratefully acknowledge support from NOAA under grants NA11SEC4810004 and NA12OAR4310084 and from EPA under grant STAR-RD834190.

A set of nine regional configurations with eight regional models from the ENSEMBLES project is evaluated. Although they are all based on similar large-scale conditions, the performances of regional models in reproducing the most crucial variables for crop production are extremely variable. This therefore leads to a large dispersion in crop yield prediction when using regional models in a climate/crop modelling system. This dispersion comes from the different physics in each regional model and also the choice of parametrizations for a single regional model. Indeed, two configurations of the same regional model are sometimes more distinct than two different regional models. Promising results are obtained when applying a bias correction technique to climate model outputs. Simulated yields with bias corrected climate variables show much more realistic means and standard deviations. However, such a bias correction technique is not able to improve the reproduction of the year-to-year variations of simulated yields. This study confirms the importance of the multi-model approach for quantifying uncertainties for impact studies and also stresses the benefits of combining both regional and statistical downscaling techniques. Finally, it indicates the urgent need to address the main uncertainties in atmospheric processes controlling the monsoon system and to contribute to the evaluation and improvement of climate and weather forecasting models in that respect.","[Oettli, Pascal; Sultan, Benjamin] LOCEAN, IPSL, F-75252 Paris 05, France; [Oettli, Pascal] Univ Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan; [Baron, Christian] CIRAD UPR AIVA, Montpellier, France; [Vrac, Mathieu] LSCE, IPSL, Gif Sur Yvette, France",Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle (MNHN); UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Universite Paris Cite; University of Tokyo; CIRAD; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Cite; Universite Paris Saclay; CEA; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Sultan, B (corresponding author), LOCEAN, IPSL, Boite 100,T45-55,4 Pl Jussieu, F-75252 Paris 05, France.",benjamin.sultan@locean-ipsl.upmc.fr,"Oettli, Pascal/I-9611-2014; Sultan, Benjamin/C-8957-2012","Oettli, Pascal/0000-0002-4654-0251; Sultan, Benjamin/0000-0003-0416-0338; Baron, Christian/0000-0001-9686-9672; Vrac, Mathieu/0000-0002-6176-0439",REGYNA (GIS-CES); AMMA; European community [505539],REGYNA (GIS-CES); AMMA; European community(European Commission),"This work has been funded by REGYNA (GIS-CES) and the AMMA programme.

We analyze how exposure to media coverage of the COP21 affected public opinion in the Netherlands. Based on a two-wave online panel survey (N = 876), we identified five audience segments that varied in their degree of climate change beliefs, involvement, policy preferences, and behavioral intentions. Different media effects across segments were found indicating (dis)confirmation bias, specifically, for medium levels of positive and negative engagement.

As one of Europe's few Indigenous peoples, the Sami are uniquely vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change, with inhabitants of the Arctic being on the frontlines of experiencing its impacts. Sami representatives have engaged in unsuccessful mitigation litigation on the basis of these impacts. The present article builds on previous litigation initiatives by exploring an alternative litigation avenue in order to assess its potential. In doing so, the article outlines the ways in which climate change has been reported to interfere with Sami cultural practices to date. Given that the ECHR does not contain explicit rights to culture or group rights, the article examines whether these impacts can be framed in terms of the individualistic civil and political rights that the Convention covers. The article therefore examines the possibilities of framing these impacts in terms of the prohibition of ill treatment (art 3), the right to respect for private and family life (art 8), and the right to non-discrimination (art 14).","[Nordlander, Linnea] Univ Copenhagen, Fac Law, Copenhagen, Denmark",University of Copenhagen,"Nordlander, L (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen, Fac Law, Copenhagen, Denmark.",linnea.nordlander@jur.ku.dk,,,Independent Research Fund Denmark,Independent Research Fund Denmark,"Email:linnea.nordlander@jur.ku.dk.The author acknowledges support from the Independent Research Fund Denmark (project: Enhancing Climate Action through International Law). 1.

The First Institute of Oceanography-Climate Prediction System (FIO-CPS), built on a climate model with the oceanic observation initialization, has been updated from version 1.0 to 2.0, with a finer resolution and more reasonable physical processes. Previous assessments show that the mean state was well simulated in version 2.0, and its influence on the prediction was further analyzed in this study. Hindcast experiments were conducted using FIO-CPS v1.0 and v2.0, and their prediction abilities based on 27 years (1993-2019) experiment data were analyzed. The results show that the sea surface temperature (SST) biases over the eastern Pacific and the Southern Ocean are improved in the initial condition of FIO-CPS v2.0. Moreover, this new system has a higher skill for predicting El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The prediction skill represented by the anomaly correlation coefficient (ACC) of the Nino3.4 index is greater than 0.78 at the 6-month lead time, which increases by 11.09% compared to the value of 0.70 in FIO-CPS v1.0. The root mean square error (RMSE) decreases by 0.20, which accounts for 28.59% of the FIO-CPS v1.0 result. Furthermore, the improvement of the prediction skill changes seasonally, featured by the ACC significantly increasing in the boreal winter and early spring. The improvement in the annual mean SST prediction over the Equatorial Pacific mainly contributes to the enhanced ENSO prediction skill in FIO-CPS v2.0. These results indicate that a state-of-the-art climate model with a well-simulated mean state is critical in improving the prediction skill on the seasonal time scale.","[Song, Yajuan; Shu, Qi; Bao, Ying; Yang, Xiaodan; Song, Zhenya] Minist Nat Resources, Inst Oceanog 1, Key Lab Marine Sci & Numer Modeling, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Song, Yajuan; Shu, Qi; Bao, Ying; Yang, Xiaodan; Song, Zhenya] Pilot Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol, Lab Reg Oceanog & Numer Modeling, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Song, Yajuan; Shu, Qi; Bao, Ying; Yang, Xiaodan; Song, Zhenya] Shandong Key Lab Marine Sci & Numer Modeling, Qingdao, Peoples R China",Ministry of Natural Resources of the People's Republic of China; Qingdao National Laboratory for Marine Science & Technology,"Song, ZY (corresponding author), Minist Nat Resources, Inst Oceanog 1, Key Lab Marine Sci & Numer Modeling, Qingdao, Peoples R China.;Song, ZY (corresponding author), Pilot Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol, Lab Reg Oceanog & Numer Modeling, Qingdao, Peoples R China.;Song, ZY (corresponding author), Shandong Key Lab Marine Sci & Numer Modeling, Qingdao, Peoples R China.",songroy@fio.org.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [42075039, 42022042, 41821004]; China-Korea Cooperation Project on Northwestern Pacific Climate Change and its Prediction; CAS Interdisciplinary Innovation Team [JCTD-2020-12]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China-Korea Cooperation Project on Northwestern Pacific Climate Change and its Prediction; CAS Interdisciplinary Innovation Team,"This research was jointly supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 42075039, 42022042, and 41821004), the China-Korea Cooperation Project on Northwestern Pacific Climate Change and its Prediction, and the CAS Interdisciplinary Innovation Team (JCTD-2020-12).",,34,4,5,5,13,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-6463,,FRONT EARTH SC-SWITZ,Front.

Here we utilize ensembles of twentieth century climate simulations to isolate the forced signal and residual internal variability in a network of observed and modeled climate indices. The observed internal variability so estimated exhibits a pronounced multidecadal mode with a distinctive spatiotemporal signature, which is altogether absent in model simulations. This single mode explains a major fraction of model-data differences over the entire climate index network considered; it may reflect either biases in the models' forced response or models' lack of requisite internal dynamics, or a combination of both. Plain Language Summary Global and regional warming trends over the course of the twentieth century have been nonuniform, with decadal and longer periods of faster or slower warming, or even cooling. Here we show that state-of-the-art global models used to predict climate fail to adequately reproduce such multidecadal climate variations. In particular, the models underestimate the magnitude of the observed variability and misrepresent its spatial pattern. Therefore, our ability to interpret the observed climate change using these models is limited.","[Kravtsov, Sergey] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Math Sci, Atmospher Sci Grp, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Milwaukee,"Kravtsov, S (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Math Sci, Atmospher Sci Grp, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA.",kravtsov@uwm.edu,"Kravtsov, Sergey/ABA-2061-2020","Kravtsov, Sergey/0000-0003-3653-9596","National Science Foundation [OCE-1243158, AGS-1408897]",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"The author acknowledges the World Climate Research Programme's Working Group on Coupled Modeling, which is responsible for CMIP and thanks the climate modeling groups for making their model output available.

That knowledge is captured and presented in narrative evidence-the product of the expert act of critical engagement with stories, and with others' engagement with stories. Storylistening is the theory and practice of gathering narrative evidence to inform decision-making, especially in relation to public reasoning, as part of a pluralistic evidence base. Storylistening is necessary to counter the political deployment of partial, selective, or misinterpreted narrative evidence. There are four ways in which stories can contribute to public reasoning about climate change. Stories play a role in reframing the idea of climate change, as well as being integral to many of the new disciplines, perspectives and knowledges drawn in as relevant by that reframing. Stories create and cohere collective identities and climate change beliefs and behavior. Narrative models complement and supplement computational models, creating an ensemble of models that more adequately covers the gaps that result from only deploying big, global, generalized models. Stories play a crucial role in enabling better anticipation for decision-making, and storylistening can enable the use of narrative evidence from narrative futures methods, as well as perhaps improve the ways scientific evidence about the future is also listened to. Incorporating storylistening into public reasoning about climate change requires the evolution of advisory systems and of the academic humanities, and can play a role in the urgent need to democratize public reasoning about climate change.

A major cause of this is the lack of integrated tools that allow the translation of data into useful and skillful climate information. This barrier is addressed through the development of an R package. Climate Services Toolbox (CSTools) is an easy-to-use toolbox designed and built to assess and improve the quality of climate forecasts for seasonal to multi-annual scales. The package contains process-based, state-of-the-art methods for forecast calibration, bias correction, statistical and stochastic downscaling, optimal forecast combination, and multivariate verification, as well as basic and advanced tools to obtain tailored products. Due to the modular design of the toolbox in individual functions, the users can develop their own post-processing chain of functions, as shown in the use cases presented in this paper, including the analysis of an extreme wind speed event, the generation of seasonal forecasts of snow depth based on the SNOWPACK model, and the post-processing of temperature and precipitation data to be used as input in impact models.","[Perez-Zanon, Nuria; Caron, Louis-Philippe; Lledo, Llorenc; Manubens, Nicolau; Bretonniere, Pierre-Antoine; Delgado-Torres, Carlos] Barcelona Supercomp Ctr BSC, Barcelona, Spain; [Caron, Louis-Philippe] Ouranos, 550 Sherbrooke St W, Montreal, PQ H3A9, Canada; [Terzago, Silvia; Corti, Susana; Fabiano, Federico; Giuntoli, Ignazio; von Hardenberg, Jost] Natl Res Council Italy, Inst Atmospher Sci & Climate CNR ISAC, Turin, Italy; [Van Schaeybroeck, Bert; Roulin, Emmanuel] Royal Meteorol Inst Belgium, Brussels, Belgium; [Alvarez-Castro, M.

Plaintiffs have sought, inter alia, compensation for climate-related losses and to compel governments to reduce their GHG emissions. So far, most of these claims have been unsuccessful. Here we assess the scientific and legal bases for establishing causation and evaluate judicial treatment of scientific evidence in 73 lawsuits. We find that the evidence submitted and referenced in these cases lags considerably behind the state of the art in climate science, impeding causation claims. We conclude that greater appreciation and exploitation of existing methodologies in attribution science could address obstacles to causation and improve the prospects of litigation as a route to compensation for losses, regulatory action and emission reductions by defendants seeking to limit legal liability. Legal cases to force governments to reduce emissions or to pursue compensation for climate change-related losses are increasing. The scientific evidence used in such cases is found to be lagging behind state-of-the-art climate science; using up-to-date methodologies could improve causation claims.","[Stuart-Smith, Rupert F.; Otto, Friederike E.

Issues such as environmental degradation and climate change were identified as causes for concern. They discussed human responsibility for environmental stewardship both in their local communities and globally. Climate change hazards such as flood and fire, human action leading to environmental pollution, and human responsibility for environmental stewardship surfaced as issues for their development. Youth expressed a felt responsibility to act on climate change and to reduce the anthropogenic impact on the Earth.

However, although relative glacial and interglacial intensities are well studied, there are still few proxies that permit quantitative terrestrial temperature and precipitation reconstruction. In this context, fauna-based climate reconstructions based on evidence preserved in archaeological or palaeontological sites are of great interest, even if they only document short windows of that climate variability, because (a) they provide a range of temperature and precipitation estimates that are understandable in comparison with present climate; (b) they may allow the testing of predicted temperature changes under scenarios of future climate change; and (c) quantitative temperature and precipitation estimates for past glacials and interglacials for specific regions/latitudes can help to understand their effects on flora, fauna and hominids, as they are directly associated with those cultural and/or biological events. Moreover such reconstructions can bring further arguments to the discussion about important climatic events like the Mid-Bruhnes Event, a climatic transition between moderate warmths and greater warmths during interglacials. In this paper we review a decade of amphibian- and reptile-based climate reconstructions carried out for the Iberian Peninsula using the Mutual Ecogeographic Range method in order to present a regional synthesis from MIS 22 to MIS 6, discuss the climate pattern in relation to the Mid-Bruhnes Event and the thermal amplitude suggested by these estimates and finally to identify the chronological gaps that have still to be investigated.

The recent concept of climate elasticity of streamflow was used to indicate in which parameters the streamflow is more sensitive. First, a statistically identified change point was used to define the base period. Methods including hydrological sensitivity, climate elasticity and hydrological modelling then allowed us to estimate the anthropogenic and climatic effects on streamflow and to have an idea of the complicated non-linear relationship among streamflow, precipitation and temperature. Our results suggest that climate variability accounted for 85% of the decrease in streamflow. The remaining change could result from land cover-use change. The climate elasticity method used in this study could predict streamflow for future climatic change scenarios.","[Saidi, Helmi; Dresti, Claudia; Manca, Dario; Ciampittiello, Marzia] CNR, ISE, Natl Res Council, Inst Ecosyst Study, Largo Tonolli 50, I-28922 Verbania, Italy",Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto per lo Studio degli Ecosistemi (ISE-CNR),"Saidi, H (corresponding author), CNR, ISE, Natl Res Council, Inst Ecosyst Study, Largo Tonolli 50, I-28922 Verbania, Italy.",h.saidi@ise.cnr.it,"Saidi, Helmi/AID-7123-2022; Ciampittiello, Marzia/AAY-1694-2020; Ciampittiello, Marzia/AAY-4007-2020; Saidi, Helmi/M-3880-2016","Ciampittiello, Marzia/0000-0001-6403-0493; Saidi, Helmi/0000-0002-8437-0249",International Commission for the Protection of Italy-Switzerland Waters (CIPAIS),International Commission for the Protection of Italy-Switzerland Waters (CIPAIS),"The data presented in this study are part of a CNR-ISE research project on Lake Maggiore, partially funded by the International Commission for the Protection of Italy-Switzerland Waters (CIPAIS).

Former growing conditions of the utilized trees, however, are largely unknown. Potential influences of historical forest management practices on climatic information, derived from TRW variability need to be considered but have not been assessed so far. Here, we examined the suitability of TRW series from traditionally managed oak forests (Quercus spp.) for climate reconstructions. We compared the climate signal in TRW chronologies of trees originating from high forests and coppice-with-standards (CWS) forests, a silvicultural management practice widely used in Europe for most of the common era. We expected a less distinct climate control in CWS due to management-induced growth patterns, yet an improved climate-growth relationship with TRW data from conventionally managed high forests. CWS tree rings showed considerably weaker correlations with hydroclimatic variables than non-CWS trees. The greatest potential for hydroclimate reconstructions was found for a large dataset containing both CWS and non-CWS trees, randomly collected from lumber yards, resembling the randomness in sources of historical material. Our results imply that growth patterns induced by management interventions can dampen climate signals in TRW chronologies. However, their impact can be minimized in well replicated, randomly sampled regional chronologies.","[Skiadaresis, Georgios] Univ Freiburg, Inst Forest Sci, Chair Silviculture, Freiburg, Germany; [Muigg, Bernhard; Tegel, Willy] Amt Archaol Kanton Thurgau, Frauenfeld, Switzerland; [Muigg, Bernhard] Univ Freiburg, Inst Forest Sci, Chair Forest Hist, Freiburg, Germany; [Tegel, Willy] Univ Freiburg, Inst Forest Sci, Chair Forest Growth & Dendroecol, Freiburg, Germany",University of Freiburg; University of Freiburg; University of Freiburg,"Skiadaresis, G (corresponding author), Univ Freiburg, Inst Forest Sci, Chair Silviculture, Freiburg, Germany.",georgios.skiadaresis@waldbau.uni-freiburg.de,"Tegel, Willy/M-8187-2014",,"Baden-Wuerttemberg Ministry of Science, Research and Art; University of Freiburg","Baden-Wuerttemberg Ministry of Science, Research and Art; University of Freiburg","The article processing charge was funded by the Baden-Wuerttemberg Ministry of Science, Research and Art and the University of Freiburg in the funding program Open Access Publishing.",,46,1,1,5,9,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",2296-701X,,,FRONT ECOL EVOL,Front.

Though the uncertainty of projected climate change at the regional level is higher, it is still necessary to assess its impacts on crop productivity for formulating response strategies. Climate change scenarios projected by the middle of the current century, based on the latest studies, were created and the impacts of concurrent changes of temperature and CO2 on the growth, development and yields of wheat in northwest India were quantified using a state-of-the-art dynamic simulation model. Yield enhancements of the order of 29-37% and 16-28% under tainted and irrigated conditions respectively in different genotypes were observed under a modified climate (T-max + 1.0degreesC, T-min + 1.5degreesC, 2 x CO2). Any further increase beyond 3degreesC cancelled the beneficial impact of enhanced CO2. Adaptation measures to mitigate the potential impact of climate change included possible changes in sowing dates and genotype selection. Enhancement of sowing by 10 days in late-sown cultivars and delaying of sowing by 10 days in normally sown cultivars resulted in higher yields under a modified climate, whereas a reduction in yield was observed in the reverse strategies.

They occur in equilibrated state, as well as in initialised seasonal to decadal simulations. The bias is typically characterised by too high SST in upwelling regions and associated errors of wind and precipitation. We examine the SST bias in the state-of-the-art CGCM EC-Earth by means of an upper ocean heat budget analysis. Horizontal advection processes affect the SST bias development only to a small extent, and surface heat fluxes mostly dampen the warm bias. Subgrid-scale upper ocean vertical mixing is too low in EC-Earth when compared to estimates from reanalysis data, potentially giving rise to the warm bias. We perform sensitivity experiments to examine the effect of enhanced vertical mixing on the SST bias in quasi equilibrium present day climate and its impact on projected climate change. Enhanced mixing in historical simulation mode (MixUppr) reduces the SST bias in the tropical Atlantic compared to the control experiment (Controlpr). Associated atmospheric biases of precipitation and surface winds are also reduced in MixUppr. We further perform climate projections under the RCP8.5 emission scenario (Controlfu and MixUpfu). Under increasing greenhouse gas forcing, the tropical Atlantic warms by up to 4.5 circle C locally, and maritime precipitation increases in boreal winter and spring. We show that the vertical mixing parameterisation influences future climate. In MixUpfu, SSTs remain 0.5 circle C colder in boreal winter and spring, but increase with the same amplitude in summer and fall. The strength and location of the projected intertropical convergence zone also depends on the ocean vertical mixing efficiency. The rain band moves southward in summer, and its strength increases in winter in MixUpfu as compared to Controlfu.","[Deppenmeier, Anna-Lena] Wageningen Univ, Meteorol & Air Qual, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Haarsma, Rein J.; LeSager, Philippe] Royal Netherlands Meteorol Inst KNMI, De Bilt, Netherlands; [Hazeleger, Wilco] Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, Utrecht, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research; Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute; Utrecht University,"Deppenmeier, AL (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ, Meteorol & Air Qual, Wageningen, Netherlands.",deppenme@ucar.edu,,"Haarsma, Rein/0000-0001-7171-2687; Deppenmeier, Anna-Lena/0000-0003-0549-7143; Hazeleger, Wilco/0000-0002-4566-958X",EU [603521],EU(European Commission),The authors would like to thank the two anonymous reviewers for their constructive criticism and suggestions.

However, wind energy is also susceptible to global climate change. Some changes associated with climate evolution will likely benefit the wind energy industry while other changes may negatively impact wind energy developments, with such 'gains and losses' depending on the region under consideration. Herein we review possible mechanisms by which global climate variability and change may influence the wind energy resource and operating conditions, summarize some of the tools that are being employed to quantify these effects and the sources of uncertainty in making such projections, and discuss results of studies conducted to date. We present illustrative examples of research from northern Europe. Climate change analyses conducted for this region, which has shown considerable penetration of wind energy, imply that in the near-term (i.e. to the middle of the current century) natural variability exceeds the climate change signal in the wind energy resource and extreme wind speeds, but there will likely be a decline in icing frequency and sea ice both of which will tend to benefit the wind energy industry. By the end of the twenty-first century there is evidence for small magnitude changes in the wind resource (though the sign of the change remains uncertain), for increases in extreme wind speeds, and continued declines in sea ice and icing frequencies. Thus the current state-of-the-art suggests no detectable change in the wind resource or other external conditions that could jeopardize the continued exploitation of wind energy in northern Europe, though further research is needed to provide greater confidence in these projections.

The number of studies is limited in this direction due to lack of data availability as well as non-availability of models considering all the above-mentioned components. As for example, the state-of-the-art variable infiltration capacity (VIC) model does not account for the glacier melt. Here we integrate a glacier-melt model with VIC and validate the model output with observed streamflow in five river basins in the Himalayas, at daily scale. Our model simulates the streamflow with Nash-Sutcliffe estimates greater than 0.65 in all basins. The sensitivity analysis shows that the contribution from snowmelt decreases substantially in all the five basins with highest decrease of 36% in Dudh Kosi (DK), in a warm and dry scenario. The glacier-melt increases (15%-70%) in a warmer environment with its present volume, but decreases (3%-38%) substantially, when the volumes are reduced to half. However, such a decrease is found to be compensated by increased precipitation in a wetter scenario with a net increase of 3%-13%. Climate model simulations show a decrease in the spring onset times for Sutlej basin while increase for DK basin for both RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios. Sutlej and Arun basins show decreases of more than 6 days in the center of volume of streamflow, which suggests that there will be increased flows in the early part of year and reduced flows later in the year.","[Chandel, Vikram S.; Ghosh, Subimal] Indian Inst Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India; [Ghosh, Subimal] Indian Inst Technol, Interdisciplinary Program Climate Studies, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Bombay; Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Bombay,"Ghosh, S (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.;Ghosh, S (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol, Interdisciplinary Program Climate Studies, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.",subimal@civil.iitb.ac.in,,"Chandel, Vikram Singh/0000-0003-1991-5596; Ghosh, Subimal/0000-0002-5722-1440","Ministry of Earth Sciences, Government of India [NCAOR/2018/HiCOM04, MoES/PAMC/HC/79/2016-PC-II]","Ministry of Earth Sciences, Government of India(Ministry of Earth Science (MoES), Government of India)","Authors sincerely thank the editor, associate editor and the anonymous reviewers for reviewing our manuscript and providing important suggestions.

In this paper, we develop an integrated literature-survey framework by combining the typical content analysis with a simple statistical analysis to systematically examine the developing trends of IAM-based multi-model studies and explore the model-robust climate policy findings; we also conduct an extended analysis to identify the role of a multi-model approach in global warming and other global change research by employing co-citation network analysis. The results reveal that multi-model comparison and ensemble are effective methods to explore reliable scientific findings and yield robust policy conclusions. The current multi-model studies are sparse as a whole, especially for IAM-based climate economic and policy research; future multi-model works, at both the global and regional levels, are therefore promising. We observe that the developed countries (the EU and the US) dominate the current multi-model study, which could be proved by the number of primary IAMs developed, frequency of models adopted, and number of works published. Addressing the risks of global warming relies on reliable scientific research and robust climate policy design, particularly for the developing large emitters, which heavily depends on consistent efforts toward primary model development and comprehensive cooperation with state-of-the-art model teams all over the world.","[Duan, Hongbo; Wang, Shouyang] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Duan, Hongbo] Univ Kansas, Dept Econ, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Zhang, Gupeng] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Publ Policy & Management, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Wang, Shouyang] Chinese Acad Sci, Acad Math & Syst Sci, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Fan, Ying] Beihang Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; University of Kansas; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Academy of Mathematics & System Sciences, CAS; Beihang University","Zhang, GP (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Publ Policy & Management, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.",zhanggupeng@ucas.ac.cn,,"Duan, Hongbo/0000-0001-5143-4413; Wang, Shouyang/0000-0001-5773-998X","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71874177, 71503242, 71690245, 71872169]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This research is financially supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No 71874177, 71503242, 71690245, 71872169), and we greatly appreciate the editors and anonymous referees for their valuable comments and suggestions.",,140,55,56,10,77,IOP Publishing Ltd,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1748-9326,,,ENVIRON RES LETT,Environ.

We then develop high-resolution projections of future climate change across the northeast USA, using IPCC SRES emission scenarios combined with these downscaling methods. The projections show increases in temperature that are larger at higher latitudes and inland, as well as the potential for changing precipitation patterns, particularly along the coast. While the absolute magnitude of change expected over the coming century depends on the sensitivity of the climate system to human forcing, significantly higher increases in temperature and in winter precipitation are expected under a higher as compared to lower scenario of future emissions from human activities.","[Hayhoe, Katharine] Texas Tech Univ, Dept Geosci, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA; [Hayhoe, Katharine] ATMOS Res & Consulting, Lubbock, TX USA; [Wake, Cameron] Univ New Hampshire, Inst Study Earth Oceans & Space, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Anderson, Bruce] Boston Univ, Dept Geog & Environm, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Liang, Xin-Zhong; Zhu, Jinhong] Illinois State Water Survey, Champaign, IL 61820 USA; [Maurer, Edwin] Santa Clara Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Santa Clara, CA 95053 USA; [Bradbury, James] Univ Massachusetts, Climate Syst Res Ctr, Dept Geosci, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [DeGaetano, Art] Cornell Univ, NE Reg Climate Ctr, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Ithaca, NY USA; [Stoner, Anne Marie; Wuebbles, Donald] Univ Illinois, Dept Atmospher Sci, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University; University System Of New Hampshire; University of New Hampshire; Boston University; Illinois State Water Survey; Santa Clara University; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; Cornell University; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Hayhoe, K (corresponding author), Texas Tech Univ, Dept Geosci, POB 41053, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA.",katharine.hayhoe@ttu.edu,"Thompson, Renee L/A-9675-2012; Liang, Xin-Zhong/B-3561-2014; Wake, Cameron/G-8114-2014; Maurer, Edwin P/C-7190-2009","Liang, Xin-Zhong/0000-0002-5047-3135; Maurer, Edwin P/0000-0001-7134-487X; Wake, Cameron/0000-0002-5961-5902","Office of Science, U.S. Department of Energy; United States Environmental Protection Agency [EPA RD-83096301-0]; National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration [NA05OAR4601080]","Office of Science, U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); United States Environmental Protection Agency(United States Environmental Protection Agency); National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA)","We acknowledge NOAA/FSL and NCSA/UIUC for their supercomputing support.

Novel climate reanalysis products outperform legacy data products in accuracy, temporal resolution, and provision of uncertainty metrics. Consequently, there is an urgent need to develop a workflow through which to integrate these improved data into biological analyses. The ERA5 product family (ERA5 and ERA5-Land) are the latest and most advanced global reanalysis products created by the European Center for Medium-range Weather Forecasting. These data products offer up to 83 essential climate variables at hourly intervals for the time-period of 1981 to today with preliminary back-extensions being available for 1950-1981. Spatial resolutions range from 30 x 30 km (ERA5) to 11 x 11 km (ERA5-Land) and can be statistically downscaled to study-requirements at finer spatial resolutions. Kriging is one such method to interpolate data to finer resolutions and has the advantages that one can leverage additional covariate information and obtain the uncertainty associated with the downscaling. The KrigR R-package enables users to (a) download ERA5(-Land) climate reanalysis data for a user-specified region, and time-period, (b) aggregate these climate products to desired temporal resolutions and metrics, (c) acquire topographical co-variates, and (d) statistically downscale spatial data to a user-specified resolution using co-variate data via kriging. KrigR can execute all these tasks in a single function call, thus enabling the user to obtain any of 83 (ERA5)/50 (ERA5-Land) climate variables at high spatial and temporal resolution with a single R-command. Additionally, KrigR contains functionality for computation of bioclimatic variables and aggregate metrics from the variables offered by ERA5(-Land). This R-package provides an easy-to-implement workflow for implementation of state-of-the-art climate data while avoiding issues of storage limitations at high temporal and spatial resolutions by providing data according to user-needs rather than in global data sets. Consequently, KrigR provides a toolbox to obtain a wide range of tailored climate data at unprecedented combinations of high temporal and spatial resolutions thus enabling the use of world-leading climate data through the R-interface and beyond.","[Kusch, Erik] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biol, Sect Ecoinformat & Biodivers, Ctr Biodivers Dynam Changing World BIOCHANGE, Ny Munkegade 116, Aarhus, Denmark; [Davy, Richard] Nansen Environm & Remote Sensing Ctr, Jahnebakken 3, Bergen, Norway",Aarhus University; Nansen Environmental & Remote Sensing Center (NERSC),"Kusch, E (corresponding author), Aarhus Univ, Dept Biol, Sect Ecoinformat & Biodivers, Ctr Biodivers Dynam Changing World BIOCHANGE, Ny Munkegade 116, Aarhus, Denmark.",rik.kusch@bio.au.dk,"Davy, Richard/H-8387-2016; Davy, Richard/GWC-5040-2022","Davy, Richard/0000-0001-9639-5980; Davy, Richard/0000-0001-9639-5980; Kusch, Erik/0000-0002-4984-7646",,,,,34,4,4,4,11,IOP Publishing Ltd,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1748-9326,,,ENVIRON RES LETT,Environ.

The latter are targeted by statistical bias correction (BC) and downscaling of climate model output. A nowadays well-established technique is quantile mapping (QM). Here, we apply several different implementations of empirical QM, a parametric (and computationally more expensive) QM method for daily precipitation, and a mean-BC to an ensemble of regional climate scenarios over the topographically structured terrain of Switzerland. The performance of these methods in the current climate and their long-term stability are analysed with respect to distributional and temporal statistics as well as climate impact indices for daily temperature and precipitation. We select an optimal QM implementation, study its effect on the inter-variable consistency, and compare its climate change signal (CCS) to that of a delta-change (DC) method. The results demonstrate that QM effectively reduces raw model biases. The most important improvements are corrected magnitudes and, for precipitation, also wet-day frequencies. The quantile-dependent bias removal is superior to the mean-BC with respect to distribution-tail statistics. Temporal statistics and climate impact indices are also improved. There is no performance benefit from the parametric QM method. The selected empirical QM implementation substantially improves the joint temperature-precipitation distribution and maintains the temperature-precipitation cross-correlation function as represented by raw climate model data. The CCS analysis reveals the superiority of QM over the DC method with respect to distribution-tail characteristics and temporal statistics. This work reveals empirical QM as a reliable and stable method for BC and downscaling from state-of-the-art regional climate models to local weather stations over alpine terrain, confirming and expanding previous studies.","[Ivanov, Martin A.; Kotlarski, Sven] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, Zurich, Switzerland; [Ivanov, Martin A.] Justus Liebig Univ Giessen, Dept Geog Climatol Climate Dynam & Climate Change, Senckenbergstr 1, D-35390 Giessen, Germany; [Kotlarski, Sven] Fed Off Meteorol & Climatol MeteoSwiss, Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Justus Liebig University Giessen; Federal Office of Meteorology & Climatology (MeteoSwiss),"Ivanov, MA (corresponding author), Justus Liebig Univ Giessen, Dept Geog Climatol Climate Dynam & Climate Change, Senckenbergstr 1, D-35390 Giessen, Germany.",martin.ivanov@geogr.uni-giessen.de,,"Ivanov, Martin/0000-0002-2816-343X","Swiss State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation SERI [C12.0089]","Swiss State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation SERI","This work was part of the ELAPSE project (Enhancing Local and Regional Climate Change Projections for Switzerland) and was supported by the Swiss State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation SERI, Project number C12.0089.

Certainly, many artists, activists, and scholars argue that exhibitions of protest art might echo the issues of the protest, but they do so in a 'context without consequence'. In answer, a number of curators have attempted instead to bring art exhibitions to the action as a way of potentially avoiding the institutional depoliticizing logic of the museum or gallery. Focusing on a public relations event titled 'Massive Uprising', which took place in Toronto, and two exhibitions, 'Art Goes to Heiligendamm', organized at anti-G8 protests, and 'RETHINK', held amid the COP15 negotiations in Copenhagen, I ask do the power relationships change if political or activist art is showcased outside of the institution?

This organisational transformation involves implementing several privacy practices (e.g., privacy policies, governance frameworks, and privacy-by-design methods) across multiple departments. The literature points to a strong influence of the organisations' culture and climate in implementing such privacy practices, depending on how leaders and employees perceive and address privacy concerns. However, this new hybrid topic referred to as Organisational Privacy Culture and Climate (OPCC), remains poorly demarcated and weakly defined. In this paper, we report a Scoping Review (ScR) on the topic of OPCC to systematically identify and map studies, contributing with a synthesis of the existing work, distinguishing core and adjacent publications, research gaps, and pathways of future research. This ScR includes 36 studies categorised according to their demographics, research types, contribution types, research designs, proposed definitions, and conceptualisations. Also, 18 studies categorised as primary research were critically appraised, assessing the studies' methodological quality and credibility of the evidence. Although published research has significantly advanced the topic of OPCC, more research is still needed. Our findings show that the topic is still in its embryonic stage. The theory behind OPCC has not yet been fully articulated, even though some definitions have been independently proposed. Only one measuring instrument for privacy culture was identified, but it needs to be further developed in terms of identifying and analysing its factors, and evaluating its validity and reliability. Initiatives of future research in OPCC will require interdisciplinary research efforts and close cooperation with industry to further propose and rigorously evaluate instruments. Only then OPCC would be considered an evidence-based research topic that can be reliably used to evaluate, measure, and embed privacy in organisations.","[Iwaya, Leonardo Horn; Iwaya, Gabriel Horn; Steil, Andrea Valeria] Fed Univ Santa Catarina UFSC, Dept Psychol, Grad Program Psychol, BR-88040 Florianopolis, SC, Brazil; [Iwaya, Leonardo Horn; Fischer-Hubner, Simone] Karlstad Univ, Dept Math & Comp Sci, Privacy & Secur PriSec Res Grp, S-65188 Karlstad, Sweden",Karlstad University,"Iwaya, LH (corresponding author), Fed Univ Santa Catarina UFSC, Dept Psychol, Grad Program Psychol, BR-88040 Florianopolis, SC, Brazil.;Iwaya, LH (corresponding author), Karlstad Univ, Dept Math & Comp Sci, Privacy & Secur PriSec Res Grp, S-65188 Karlstad, Sweden.",leonardo.iwaya@kau.se,"Iwaya, Leonardo/C-7818-2013","Iwaya, Leonardo/0000-0001-9005-0543; Iwaya, Gabriel/0000-0002-1075-9294",Swedish Knowledge Foundation (TRUEdig Project),Swedish Knowledge Foundation (TRUEdig Project),This work was supported by the Swedish Knowledge Foundation (TRUEdig Project).,,104,0,0,3,3,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2022,,,,,73907,73930,,10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3190373,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3190373,,,24,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,3Q9NW,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000838550500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

These datasets are easily available and offer high resolution information for all land areas globally. However, they have not been tested rigorously in smaller regions, and their use in regional CEM studies may pose problems derived from their poor representation of local climate features. Moreover, these problems may be enhanced when using CEMs for future climate projections-a topic of current active research-due to the uncertainty derived from the future altered climate scenarios. In this paper we use distributional data of European beech (Fagus sylvatica) in Northern Iberian Peninsula to analyze the discrepancies of the CEMs (predictive skill, variable importance and consistency using different predictor subsets) resulting from three alternative public, high-resolution climate datasets: a benchmarking regional climate dataset developed for the area of study (UC), the University of Barcelona Atlas for the Iberian Peninsula (UAB) and the worldwide WorldClim bioclimatic dataset (WC). The same CEM techniques (multiple logistic regression and multivariate adaptive regression splines) were applied to the different datasets, showing that the quality of the baseline climate has a great impact on the resulting models, as manifested by the different contributions of the bioclimatic predictors to the resulting models. Artifactual bioclimatic variables were found in some datasets, representing topographical features and spatial gradients, rather than true climatic patterns, thus significantly contributing to the models, although not for the right reasons.

Here we use, for the first time, four state-of-the-art Land Surface Models that explicitly consider ground freezing states, forced by a subset of bias-adjusted CMIP5 General Circulation Models to estimate the impact of different global warming scenarios (RCP2.6, 6.0, 8.5) on two modes of winter travel: overland travel days (OTDs) and ice road construction days (IRCDs). We show that OTDs decrease by on average -13% in the near future (2021-2050) and between -15% (RCP2.6) and -40% (RCP8.5) in the far future (2070-2099) compared to the reference period (1971-2000) when 173 d yr(-1) are simulated across the Pan-Arctic. Regionally, we identified Eastern Siberia (Sakha (Yakutia), Khabarovsk Krai, Magadan Oblast) to be most resilient to climate change, while Alaska (USA), the Northwestern Russian regions (Yamalo, Arkhangelsk Oblast, Nenets, Komi, Khanty-Mansiy), Northern Europe and Chukotka are highly vulnerable. The change in OTDs is most pronounced during the shoulder season, particularly in autumn. The IRCDs reduce on average twice as much as the OTDs under all climate scenarios resulting in shorter operational duration. The results of the low-end global warming scenario (RCP2.6) emphasize that stringent climate mitigation policies have the potential to reduce the impact of climate change on winter mobility in the second half of the 21st century. Nevertheless, even under RCP2.6, our results suggest substantially reduced winter overland travel implying a severe threat to livelihoods of remote communities and increasing costs for resource exploration and transport across the Arctic.","[Gaedeke, Anne; Reyer, Christopher P.

That is because measures to reduce GHG emissions interfere with the heart of the economy and the market: energy (in a broader sense than the energy sector as defined by statistics) and economical growth. Analyzing the environmental policy responses to climate change the conclusion is that GHG emission reduction can only be achieved through intensive environmental policy. While extensive environmental protection complements production horizontally, intensive environmental protection integrates into production and the environment vertically. The latter eliminates the source of the pollution, preventing damage. It utilizes the biochemical processes and self-purification of the natural environment as well as technical development which not only aims to produce state-of-the-art goods, but to make production more environmentally friendly, securing a desired environmental state. While in extensive environmental protection the intervention comes from the outside for creating environmental balance, in intensive environmental protection the system recreates this balance itself. Instead of dealing with the consequences and the polluter pays principle, the emphasis is on prevention. It is important to emphasize that climate strategy decisions have complex effects regarding the aspects of sustainability (economical, social, ecological). Therefore, all decisions are political. At present, and in the near future, market economy decisions have little to do with sustainability values under normal circumstances. Taking social and ecological interests into consideration can only be successful through strategic political aims.","[Szlavik, Janos; Fule, Miklos] Budapest Univ Technol & Econ, Dept Environm Econ & Law, H-1111 Budapest, Hungary",Budapest University of Technology & Economics,,szlavikj@eik.bme.hu; fulem@eik.bme.hu,,,,,,,12,1,1,0,7,AMER INST PHYSICS,MELVILLE,"2 HUNTINGTON QUADRANGLE, STE 1NO1, MELVILLE, NY 11747-4501 USA",0094-243X,,978-0-7354-0694-0,AIP CONF PROC,,,2009,,,,,73,82,,,,,,10,Ecology; Economics; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies; Public Administration,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BLH26,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000270167600010,View Full Record in Web of Science

A recent simulation of the LGM climate by a state-of-the-art fully coupled global climate model is shown to exhibit strong, steady atmospheric jets and weak transient eddy activity in the Atlantic sector compared to today's climate. In contrast, previous work based on uncoupled atmospheric model simulations has shown that the LGM jets and eddy activity in the Atlantic sector are similar to those observed today, with the main difference being a northeastward extension of their maxima. The coupled model simulation is shown to agree more with paleoclimate proxy records and thus is taken as the more reliable representation of LGM climate. The existence of this altered atmospheric circulation state during LGM in the model has implications for understanding the stability of glacial climates, for the possibility of multiple atmospheric circulation regimes, and for the interpretation of paleoclimate proxy records.","[Li, Camille; Battisti, David S.] Univ Washington, Dept Atmospher Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Li, C (corresponding author), Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, Allegaten 55, N-5007 Bergen, Norway.",camille@uib.no,"Li, Camille/G-5802-2011; Battisti, David S/A-3340-2013","Li, Camille/0000-0002-5439-2973; Battisti, David S/0000-0003-4871-1293",,,,,68,89,91,1,20,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0894-8755,1520-0442,,J CLIMATE,J.

This paper investigates the current state of the art for assessments on urban surface transport, where rising populations and increasing dependence on efficient and reliable mobility have increased the importance placed on resilience to weather. The standard structure of climate change impact assessment (CIA) requires understanding in three important areas: how weather currently affects infrastructure and operations; how climate change may alter the frequency and magnitude of these impacts; and how concurrent technological and socio-economic development may shape the transport network of the future, either ameliorating or exacerbating the effects of climate change. The extent to which the requisite knowledge exists for a successful CIA is observed to decrease from the former to the latter. This paper traces a number of developments in the extrapolation of physical and behavioural relationships on to future climates, including a broad move away from previous deterministic methods and towards probabilistic projections which make use of a much broader range of climate change model output, giving a better representation of the uncertainty involved. Studies increasingly demand spatially and temporally downscaled climate projections that can represent realistic sub-daily fluctuations in weather that transport systems are sensitive to. It is recommended that future climate change impact assessments should focus on several key areas, including better representation of sub-daily extremes in climate tools, and recreation of realistic spatially coherent weather. Greater use of the increasing amounts of data created and captured by intelligent infrastructure' and smart cities' is also needed to develop behavioural and physical models of the response of transport to weather and to develop a better understanding of how stakeholders respond to probabilistic climate change impact projections.","[Jaroszweski, David; Hooper, Elizabeth; Chapman, Lee] Univ Birmingham, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England",University of Birmingham,"Jaroszweski, D (corresponding author), Univ Birmingham, Coll Engn & Phys Sci, Sch Civil Engn, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England.",d.j.jaroszweski@bham.ac.uk,"chapman, lee/AAE-8287-2020; Chapman, Lee/F-4674-2014","chapman, lee/0000-0002-2837-8334; Chapman, Lee/0000-0002-2837-8334; Jaroszweski, David/0000-0002-8365-0193",,,,,102,28,28,5,123,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0309-1333,1477-0296,,PROG PHYS GEOG,Prog.

J,"Harris, DM",,,,"Harris, Dylan M.",,,Storying climate knowledge: Notes on experimental political ecology,GEOFORUM,,,English,Article,,,,,,Climate change; Storytelling; Political ecology; Experimental methods; Appalachia,GEOGRAPHIES,"Political ecology emphasizes critique, and, through critique, its ability to better understand nature-society relations. Recently, calls have been made from within the sub-discipline to move beyond critique, and towards engaging nature-society relations more experimentally. This paper asks: is it possible for political ecology to be less reactive and more proactive? Rather than studying events that have already happened, is it possible to study events currently happening or that have not yet happened? This paper is an attempt to do political ecology more experimentally by staging an intervention and studying its outcomes. Given the abstract nature of climate change, and given storytelling's capacity for helping people make sense of the world around them, this project combined political ecology analysis and storytelling, resulting in an experimental process of collaborative climate knowledge production in regions, and with people, central to the changing climate. Research for this paper took place over fourteen months in Appalachia and Alaska, climate-vulnerable regions with economies tied to fossil fuel industries and with culturally rich storytelling traditions. The aim of this paper is threefold. First, I will examine political ecology scholarship that already engages with experimentation as a way of making the case for a more experimental political ecology. Second, I will discuss the process and outcomes from my experimental research, namely that storytelling is a meaningful way of building climate knowledge. Finally, by outlining the challenges of doing this research, this paper ends with lessons for future iterations of more experimental research.","[Harris, Dylan M.] Univ Colorado, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, 1420 Austin Bluffs Pkwy, Colorado Springs, CO 80918 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado at Colorado Springs,"Harris, DM (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, 1420 Austin Bluffs Pkwy, Colorado Springs, CO 80918 USA.",dharri14@uccs.edu,,,West Virginia Center for Climate Change; National Science Foundation [1853036]; Robert and Patricia Switzer Foundation; Edna Bailey Sussman Foundation,West Virginia Center for Climate Change; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Robert and Patricia Switzer Foundation; Edna Bailey Sussman Foundation,"I am grateful to the storytellers I worked with during this project, who took so much time to teach me about the art and practice of storytelling.

To identify adaptive water allocation strategies that are robust to climate change uncertainties, a model framework combining many-objective robust decision making and biophysical modeling is developed for large rivers. The framework was applied to the Pearl River basin (PRB), China where sufficient flow to the delta is required to reduce saltwater intrusion in the dry season. Before identifying and assessing robust water allocation plans for the future, the performance of ten state-of-the-art MOEAs (multi-objective evolutionary algorithms) is evaluated for the water allocation problem in the PRB. The Borg multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (Borg MOEA), which is a self-adaptive optimization algorithm, has the best performance during the historical periods. Therefore it is selected to generate new water allocation plans for the future (2079-2099). This study shows that robust decision making using carefully selected MOEAs can help limit saltwater intrusion in the Pearl River Delta. However, the framework could perform poorly due to larger than expected climate change impacts on water availability. Results also show that subjective design choices from the researchers and/or water managers could potentially affect the ability of the model framework, and cause the most robust water allocation plans to fail under future climate change. Developing robust allocation plans in a river basin suffering from increasing water shortage requires the researchers and water managers to well characterize future climate change of the study regions and vulnerabilities of their tools.

Due to its complex terrain, the broader Adriatic region represents a major challenge to state-of-the-art RCMs in simulating local wind systems realistically. The objective of this study is to identify the added value in near-surface wind due to the refined grid spacing of RCMs. For this purpose, we use a multi-model ensemble composed of CORDEX regional climate simulations at 0.11A degrees and 0.44A degrees grid spacing, forced by the ERA-Interim reanalysis, a COSMO convection-parameterizing simulation at 0.11A degrees and a COSMO convection-resolving simulation at 0.02A degrees grid spacing. Surface station observations from this region and satellite QuikSCAT data over the Adriatic Sea have been compared against daily output obtained from the available simulations. Both day-to-day wind and its frequency distribution are examined. The results indicate that the 0.44A degrees RCMs rarely outperform ERA-Interim reanalysis, while the performance of the high-resolution simulations surpasses that of ERA-Interim. We also disclose that refining the grid spacing to a few km is needed to properly capture the small-scale wind systems. Finally, we show that the simulations frequently yield the accurate angle of local wind regimes, such as for the Bora flow, but overestimate the associated wind magnitude. Finally, spectral analysis shows good agreement between measurements and simulations, indicating the correct temporal variability of the wind speed.","[Belusic, Andreina; Prtenjak, Maja Telisman] Univ Zagreb, Fac Sci, Andrija Mohorovicic Geophys Inst, Dept Geophys, Zagreb, Croatia; [Guttler, Ivan] Meteorol & Hydrol Serv Croatia DHMZ, Zagreb, Croatia; [Ban, Nikolina; Leutwyler, David; Schar, Christoph] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, Zurich, Switzerland",University of Zagreb; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Belusic, A (corresponding author), Univ Zagreb, Fac Sci, Andrija Mohorovicic Geophys Inst, Dept Geophys, Zagreb, Croatia.",abelusic@gfz.hr,"Prtenjak, Maja Telisman/Y-4726-2019; Schar, Christoph/A-1033-2008","Schar, Christoph/0000-0002-4171-1613; Telisman Prtenjak, Maja/0000-0002-4941-8278; Leutwyler, David/0000-0002-5141-1737","Croatian Science Foundation (HrZZ) [2831, PKP-2016-06-2975]; HrZZ project CATURBO [09/151]; Swiss National Science Foundation through the Sinergia grant [CRSII2_154486]",Croatian Science Foundation (HrZZ); HrZZ project CATURBO; Swiss National Science Foundation through the Sinergia grant,"This work has been supported by the ongoing Croatian Science Foundation (HrZZ) projects CARE (no. 2831) and VITCLIC (PKP-2016-06-2975).

Currently, the greenhouse sector faces major challenges in reducing its energy demand while increasing crop quality and quantity. One route to improve the performance of industrial greenhouses could be based on using climate adaptive shells. These shells are capable of changing their thermal and optical properties on an hourly, daily, or seasonal basis to optimize performance. The climate adaptive shell concept shows considerable potential for performance improvement in the building sector. However, its potential for the greenhouse sector is yet unknown. This paper quantifies this potential by predicting the energy savings and the increase in net profit using a new framework based on numerical simulation and optimization techniques. The simulation results show that climate adaptive greenhouse shells increase net profit between 7% and 20% for tomato producing Dutch greenhouses. Monthly and hourly adaptation resulted in considerable primary energy savings of 23% and 37%, respectively. It is expected that the predicted net profit increase and energy savings will drive the attention of the greenhouse industry towards the development of climate adaptive greenhouse shells.

These organisations significantly rely on the government for funding and are therefore required to implement policy initiatives, albeit at arm's length from the government. Performance management systems (PMSs) were primarily designed to enable trustees to discharge their statutory duties of collecting, preserving, and displaying objects and works of arts, which were reflected in a management agreement containing the government's strategic priorities. The findings show that the changing politico-economic climate has subtly started to change values, accountability relationships and realities in the field of arts and culture. Whilst arts organisations emphasised sociocultural objectives in strategic planning and operational processes, external pressures arising from austerity have subtly started to displace socio-cultural values. Business language, vocabularies, and tools commonly used in the private sector are insidiously taking root in arts organisations. Austerity provided a signal to executives that the survival of their core activities was at stake, and they have to engage in income generating activities to support their core activities.

Here, we assess if current state of the art global climate model simulations at high spatial resolutions (0.35 degrees x0.35 degrees) capture the observed behavior of precipitation extremes in the past few decades over the continental US. We design a correlation-based regionalization framework to quantify precipitation extremes, where samples of extreme events for a grid box may also be drawn from neighboring grid boxes with statistically equal means and statistically significant temporal correlations. We model precipitation extremes with the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution fits to time series of annual maximum precipitation. Non-stationarity of extremes is captured by including a time-dependent parameter in the GEV distribution. Our analysis reveals that the high-resolution model substantially improves the simulation of stationary precipitation extreme statistics particularly over the Northwest Pacific coastal region and the Southeast US. Observational data exhibits significant non-stationary behavior of extremes only over some parts of the Western US, with declining trends in the extremes. While the high resolution simulations improve upon the low resolution model in simulating this non-stationary behavior, the trends are statistically significant only over some of those regions.","[Mahajan, Salil; Evans, Katherine J.; Branstetter, Marcia; Anantharaj, Valentine] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Computat Earth Sci Grp, Oak Ridge, TN USA; [Mahajan, Salil; Evans, Katherine J.; Branstetter, Marcia; Anantharaj, Valentine] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Climate Change Sci Inst, Oak Ridge, TN USA; [Leifeld, Juliann K.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Math, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Oak Ridge National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Oak Ridge National Laboratory; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Mahajan, S (corresponding author), Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Computat Earth Sci Grp, Oak Ridge, TN USA.",mahajans@ornl.gov,,"Mahajan, Salil/0000-0001-5767-8590; Evans, Katherine/0000-0001-8174-6450",,,,,26,7,10,1,5,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"SARA BURGERHARTSTRAAT 25, PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1877-0509,,,PROCEDIA COMPUT SCI,,,2015,,,,,2178,2187,,10.1016/j.procs.2015.05.492,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.procs.2015.05.492,,,10,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BE6DP,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,12/21/22,WOS:000373939100223,View Full Record in Web of Science

Three types of challenges were identified, the first relating to urban form, urban qualities, densification, population growth, localisation and mix of functions. The second concerned social inclusion and segregation, everyday life, lifestyles and mobility. The third, the need for new and innovative forms of planning and governance in order to meet the other challenges, and in relation hereto, planning at the city-regional scale was pointed out as the most potential planning level and form. In relation to the third challenge this paper suggests, that climate change adaptation planning should be added as a challenge, and the city-regional scale is the appropriate scale to provide and support a substantial and effective climate change adaptation planning. There is no universal definition of a city region, but three elements seem to be common in various conceptualisations: the core(s), the hinterland(s) and the linkage(s). Also common, seems to be spatial demarcation in relation to functional urban areas, usually defined in terms of commuting patterns and density of economic activities and/or population. But climate change doesn't respect such de-naturalized definitions and categorizations. Climate change is universal and global but the impact is local, and the impact interacts with specific natural conditions on site. The definition of city-regions is suggested adapted hereto by connecting it with landscape a re-naturalizing of the concept. An interesting example from urban theory based upon natural landscape conditions is professor in urban planning, Peter Bredsdorff s so called, Dry Feet Theory, (1973) focusing on how man in historic times used his ability to read and understand the natural landscape, its features, and to settle, cultivate and transport him self accordingly. Peter Bredsdorff based his analysis, and thus his theorizing, on a cross reading of orohydrological maps and urban planning. In light of the climate adaptation challenges in planning it seems interesting and relevant to discuss whether such a 'back to nature' in city-regional scale might hold a potential in qualifying climate adaptation planning. Taking point of departure in onetwo examples this paper discusses and suggests that natural watersheds could be used in defining and demarcating city-regions, and thus support and qualify climate change adaptation planning.","[Krarup, Jonna Majgaard] Acad Fine Art, Sch Architecture, Inst Architecture City & Landscape, Copenhagen, Denmark",,"Krarup, JM (corresponding author), Acad Fine Art, Sch Architecture, Inst Architecture City & Landscape, Copenhagen, Denmark.",,,,,,,,13,0,0,1,2,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-54-4,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2016,,,,,165,172,,,,,,8,"Architecture; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Architecture; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BH0OJ,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000395727600021,View Full Record in Web of Science

We demonstrate that high-quality station data of the past century and gridded multi-proxy reconstructions for the past 500 years can be used with great success but with various levels of detail. We also demonstrate that output data from the state-of-the-art global climate model EcHo-G are not suitable for modelling the Baltic Sea ocean climate. Two climate properties were studied: the annual maximum ice extent (MIB) and the vertically and horizontally integrated annual water temperature. Centennial time scale results indicate that the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries were the coldest centuries, while the 1690s were the coldest decade and 1695 the coldest year in the last 500 years. The results also indicate that the twentieth century was the warmest century with the least MIB of the last 500 years. On a decadal time scale, the 1990s, 1930s and 1730s were the warmest decades and comparable in terms of both water temperature and MIB. The year 1989 had the minimum observed MIB of only 52,000 km(2), implying that the Baltic Sea has been partly ice covered in all winters of the past half millennium. Even though different climate forcing mechanisms may operate on the climate system today compared to over the last half millennium, this study cannot clearly state that the region is experiencing climate change outside the natural limits of the past 500 years.","[Hansson, Daniel; Omstedt, Anders] Univ Gothenburg, Oceanog Earth Sci Ctr, Gothenburg 40530, Sweden",University of Gothenburg,"Hansson, D (corresponding author), Univ Gothenburg, Oceanog Earth Sci Ctr, Box 460, Gothenburg 40530, Sweden.",daniel@gvc.gu.se,,,,,,,41,23,23,1,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0930-7575,1432-0894,,CLIM DYNAM,Clim.

Here, we present exploratory work towards developing a strategy to select variants of a state-of-the-art but expensive climate model suitable for climate projection studies. The strategy combines information from a set of relatively cheap, idealized perturbed parameter ensemble (PPE) and CMIP5 multi-model ensemble (MME) experiments, and uses two criteria as the basis to select model variants for a PPE suitable for future projections: (a) acceptable model performance at two different timescales, and (b) maintaining diversity in model response to climate change. This second part of a pair of papers builds upon Part I in which we established a strong relationship between model errors at weather and climate timescales across a PPE for a variety of key variables. This relationship is used to filter out parts of parameter space that do not give credible simulations of present day climate, while minimizing the impact on ranges in forcings and feedbacks that drive model responses to climate change. We use statistical emulation to explore the parameter space thoroughly, and demonstrate that about 90% can be filtered out without affecting diversity in global-scale climate change responses. This leads to the identification of plausible parts of parameter space from which model variants can be selected for projection studies. We selected and ran 50 variants from the plausible parameter combinations and validated the emulator predictions. Comparisons with the CMIP5 MME demonstrate that our approach can produce a set of plausible model variants that span a relatively wide range in model response to climate change. We also highlight how the prior expert-specified ranges for uncertain model parameters are constrained as a result of our methodology, and discuss recommendations for future work.","[Karmalkar, Ambarish V.; Sexton, David M.

Restricted by current limited knowledge on underlying mechanisms, statistical correlation methods are often used rather than physical based model to characterize the connections. Nevertheless, available correlation methods are generally unable to reveal the interactions among a wide range of climate oscillations and associated effects on precipitation, especially on extreme precipitation. In this work, a probabilistic analysis approach by means of a state-of-the-art Copula-based joint probability distribution is developed to characterize the aggregated behaviors for large-scale climate patterns and their connections to precipitation. This method is employed to identify the complex connections between climate patterns (Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), El Nifio-Southem Oscillation (ENSO) and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO)) and seasonal precipitation over a typical semi-humid and semi-arid region, the Haihe River Basin in China. Results show that the interactions among multiple climate oscillations are non-uniform in most seasons and phases. Certain joint extreme phases can significantly trigger extreme precipitation (flood and drought) owing to the amplification effect among climate oscillations.","[Shi, Pengfei; Yang, Tao; Xu, Chong-Yu; Yong, Bin; Li, Zhenya; Wang, Xiaoyan; Zhou, Xudong] Hohai Univ, State Key Lab Hydrol Water Resources & Hydraul En, Ctr Global Change & Water Cycle, Nanjing 210098, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Shi, Pengfei; Yong, Bin] Hohai Univ, Sch Earth Sci & Engn, Nanjing 210098, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Xu, Chong-Yu] Univ Oslo, Dept Geosci, POB 1047, N-0316 Oslo, Norway; [Shao, Quanxi] Leeuwin Ctr, CSIRO Digital Prod Flagship, 65 Brockway Rd, Floreat, WA 6014, Australia; [Zhou, Xudong] CEA, Lab Sci Climat & Environnm, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Li, Shu] Yellow River Conservancy Commiss, Yellow River Inst Hydraul Res, Zhengzhou 450003, Henan, Peoples R China",Hohai University; Hohai University; University of Oslo; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; CEA; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Yangtze River Water Resources Protection Bureau,"Yang, T (corresponding author), Hohai Univ, State Key Lab Hydrol Water Resources & Hydraul En, Ctr Global Change & Water Cycle, Nanjing 210098, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",tao.yang@hhu.edu.cn,"Shao, Quanxi/A-2028-2009; xudong, zhou/AAK-7004-2021; Shi, Pengfei/AGU-5168-2022; Xu, Chong-Yu/B-2941-2012","Shao, Quanxi/0000-0002-9768-137X; Xu, Chong-Yu/0000-0003-4826-5350; Shi, Pengfei/0000-0002-4052-4007; Zhou, Xudong/0000-0001-7180-8187","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41371051, 51421006, 41561134016]; Chinese Academy of Sciences [KZZD-EW-12]; Ministry of Water Resources [201501032]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); Ministry of Water Resources,"The work was jointly supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41371051, 51421006, 41561134016), a key grant of Chinese Academy of Sciences KZZD-EW-12, and a grant from Ministry of Water Resources (201501032).",,60,25,25,3,60,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8181,1872-6364,,GLOBAL PLANET CHANGE,Glob.

Social-ecological theory suggests that the social contexts of different types of extracurricular activities may differentially affect student outcomes. Yet, there is scant research examining the relation between various extracurricular activities and student outcomes. The current study seeks to address this gap by exploring how participation in three activities (sports, clubs, and arts), and combinations of these activities are associated with perceptions of school climate, using multi-level modelling. Participants included 15,004 high school students from 28 schools across 11 states in the United States. Findings suggest that students involved in extracurricular activities have more favourable perceptions of social-emotional security, adult support, student support, and school connectedness. However, these perceptions vary by activity type and combination, and do not appear to have a stacked effect in which involvement in more activities yields more favourable outcomes. We conclude that extracurricular activity participation may serve as a mechanism to promote a positive school climate. Implications for research and practice are discussed.","[Martinez, Andrew] Sacred Heart Univ, Fairfield, CT USA; [Coker, Crystal; McMahon, Susan D.] Depaul Univ, Chicago, IL 60604 USA; [Cohen, Jonathan; Thapa, Amrit] Natl Sch Climate Ctr, New York, NY USA",Sacred Heart University; DePaul University,"Martinez, A (corresponding author), Sacred Heart Univ, Coll Arts & Sci, Dept Social Work, Acad Bldg HC219, Fairfield, CT 06825 USA.",AndrewMartinez78@gmail.com,,,,,,,37,18,20,1,19,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",2059-0776,2059-0784,,EDUC DEV PSYCHOL,Educ.

Imagination here is understood as a way of seeing, sensing, thinking, and dreaming that creates the conditions for material interventions in, and political sensibilities of the world. It draws upon literary, filmic, and creative arts practices to argue that imaginative practices from the arts and humanities play a critical role in thinking through our representations of environmental change and offer strategies for developing diverse forms of environmental understanding from scenario building to metaphorical, ethical, and material investigations. The interplay between scientific practices and imaginative forms is also addressed. Thematically, this review addresses the modalities of climate futures, adaptive strategies, and practices of climate science in its study of key imaginative framings of climate change.

For the first time, the indices based on daily temperature and precipitation are calculated with a consistent methodology across multimodel simulations and four reanalysis data sets (ERA40, ERA-Interim, NCEP/NCAR, and NCEP-DOE) and are made available at the ETCCDI indices archive website. Our analyses show that the CMIP5 models are generally able to simulate climate extremes and their trend patterns as represented by the indices in comparison to a gridded observational indices data set (HadEX2). The spread amongst CMIP5 models for several temperature indices is reduced compared to CMIP3 models, despite the larger number of models participating in CMIP5. Some improvements in the CMIP5 ensemble relative to CMIP3 are also found in the representation of the magnitude of precipitation indices. We find substantial discrepancies between the reanalyses, indicating considerable uncertainties regarding their simulation of extremes. The overall performance of individual models is summarized by a portrait diagram based on root-mean-square errors of model climatologies for each index and model relative to four reanalyses. This metric analysis shows that the median model climatology outperforms individual models for all indices, but the uncertainties related to the underlying reference data sets are reflected in the individual model performance metrics.

These factors point to a global food deficit unless the efficiency and resilience of crop production is increased. The intensification of agriculture has focused on improving production under optimized conditions, with significant agronomic inputs. Furthermore, the intensive cultivation of a limited number of crops has drastically narrowed the number of plant species humans rely on. A new agricultural paradigm is required, reducing dependence on high inputs and increasing crop diversity, yield stability and environmental resilience. Genomics offers unprecedented opportunities to increase crop yield, quality and stability of production through advanced breeding strategies, enhancing the resilience of major crops to climate variability, and increasing the productivity and range of minor crops to diversify the food supply. Here we review the state of the art of genomic-assisted breeding for the most important staples that feed the world, and how to use and adapt such genomic tools to accelerate development of both major and minor crops with desired traits that enhance adaptation to, or mitigate the effects of climate change.","[Abberton, Michael] Int Inst Trop Agr, PMB 5320, Ibadan, Nigeria;

Design/methodology/approach The findings are based on 12 qualitative interviews taken from two case studies, and the results are explained in relation to the multilevel network framework and environmental psychology. Findings Multilevel networks can promote learning and identification of specific actions in connection with climate change adaptation. The aim should be to establish interdisciplinarity, with participants from at least two authority levels. Representatives should be in positions that enable them to introduce acquired knowledge to the organization and influence its application. A network requires organizational commitment, during the initial phase and throughout the follow-up process. Municipal leaders (mayors) must be aware of the network, act as signatories to relevant documents, and be familiar with participating representatives. Commitment to knowledge application within the organization also requires that participants understand where and how to work strategically to convert new ideas into action. Practical implications This paper presents practical and research-based guidelines for the management of climate change adaptation networks at municipal, county and national authority levels. Originality/value This paper combines political science and environmental psychology perspectives as a means of analysing network achievements.

These complicated features consist of multiple time series and space series with unknown, as well as complex relationships. Hence, it is a challenge to discover the kind of relational patterns between variables from high-dimensional climate data using a deep model. To address this issue, we develop a deep model of possessing three hidden-layers to explore these accurate relational patterns in this work. Firstly, we derive the loss function according to the Brenier theorem because it gives a geometric interpretation of the optimal distance between original distribution and distribution generated. This is helpful since the discovered relationships between variables in latent space are as close to that between variables in background space as possible. Then, we encode the 8 climate parameters, e.g., heat diffusivity, etc., using the first hidden-layer. The last two hidden-layers are applied to encode the longitude and latitude, respectively. This way of encoding is beneficial to better address the consistency between time series and space series. Finally, the proposed model is applied on real-world climate datasets. Results show that the patterns discovered using our approach from climate datasets exceed using state-of-the-art methods in precision. We find that a shallow model of possessing deep architecture paradigm has the ability to capture these covariation representations between variables to climate. Moreover, the regular relationships between carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration and climate variation indicate that climate exhibits a periodic change when CO2 concentration is relatively low. On the contrary, climate change is aperiodic. Importantly, the relationships between atmospheric CO2 flux and surface temperatures indicate that CO2 concentration addresses a local peak in the region with high surface temperature. The peak phenomenon stays in a certain period of time. Our findings also suggest that the correlation of between seasons is decreasing, so that the probability that climate maintains the same regular in different seasons is getting lower and lower. As an important application, these patterns discovered are essential for exploring the effects of CO2 on the future climate variation.","[Zheng, Jian] Chongqing Aerosp Polytech, Chongqing 400021, Peoples R China",,"Zheng, J (corresponding author), Chongqing Aerosp Polytech, Chongqing 400021, Peoples R China.",zhengjian.002@163.com,,"zheng, jian/0000-0001-9741-9526",Science and Technology Research Program of Chongqing Municipal Education Commission of China [KJQN201903003],Science and Technology Research Program of Chongqing Municipal Education Commission of China,This research is supported by the Science and Technology Research Program of Chongqing Municipal Education Commission of China (Grant No KJQN201903003).,,20,1,1,0,4,PUBL HOUSE BULGARIAN ACAD SCI,SOFIA,"ACADEMICIAN G BONCEV ST, 1113 SOFIA, BULGARIA",1310-1331,,,CR ACAD BULG SCI,C.

However, as many other large ecosystems worldwide, it is subject to diverse anthropogenic pressures (overfishing, losses of biodiversity and habitats, pollution, climate variability and climate change (CC)). We reviewed over 180 studies dealing with the impacts of CC and climate variability in the GC region. Main issues on the impact of ENSO events, acidification, sea level rise, and water availability are discussed for the GC in a global context. Impacts of ENSO events on the GC are geographically heterogeneous, upwelling tends to be suppressed, and this in turn influences the distribution and abundance of marine mammals, fishes, shrimps, benthic species, seaweeds and phytoplankton. ENSO events strongly impact small pelagic fishes, key components of the GC ecosystem, thus affecting fisheries in general as well as non-harvested species such as marine mammals and sea birds. Probably the most wellknown phenomenon associated to ENSO impact in the GC is coral bleaching, a process by which corals expel most of their microalgal endosymbionts to become pale or white (bleached). Beside shifts in the distributional limits of benthic organisms, invasions of alien species are also occuring. Harmful algal blooms (HABs) are common and recurrent in the GC. Fourteen HAB-forming species have been recorded, with Gymnodinium catenatum being the most frequent. HABs are inhibited by El Nitio and promoted by La Nina. During El Nino events the size and biomass of macroalgal blooms tend to decrease. Finally, several aspects that require further research are proposed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In this work, we explore the potential for a state-of-the-art climate model, HadGEM3-GC3, to help refine our understanding of present-day coastal flood risk associated with extreme storm surges, which are the dominant driver of ESL events for the UK and wider European shelf seas. We use a 483-year present-day control simulation from HadGEM3-GC3-MM (1/4 degrees ocean, approx. 60 km atmosphere in mid-latitudes) to drive a north-west European shelf seas model and generate a new dataset of simulated UK storm surges. The variable analysed is the skew surge (the difference between the high water level and the predicted astronomical high tide), which is widely used in analysis of storm surge events. The modelling system can simulate skew surge events comparable to the catastrophic 1953 North Sea storm surge, which resulted in widespread flooding, evacuation of 32 000 people, and hundreds of fatalities across the UK alone, along with many hundreds more in mainland Europe. Our model simulations show good agreement with an independent re-analysis of the 1953 surge event at the mouth of the river Thames. For that site, we also revisit the assumption of skew surge and tide independence. Our model results suggest that at that site for the most extreme surges, tide-surge interaction significantly attenuates extreme skew surges on a spring tide compared to a neap tide. Around the UK coastline, the extreme tail shape parameters diagnosed from our simulation correlate very well (Pearson's r greater than 0.85), in terms of spatial variability, with those used in the UK government's current guidance (which are diagnosed from tide gauge observations), but ours have smaller uncertainties. Despite the strong correlation, our diagnosed shape parameters are biased low relative to the current guidance. This bias is also seen when we replace HadGEM3-GC3-MM with a reanalysis, so we conclude that the bias is likely associated with limitations in the shelf sea model used here. Overall, the work suggests that climate model simulations may prove useful as an additional line of evidence to inform assessments of present-day coastal flood risk.","[Howard, Tom] Met Off, FitzRoy Rd, Exeter EX1 3PB, Devon, England; [Williams, Simon David Paul] Nat Oceanog Ctr, Joseph Proudman Bldg,6 Brownlow St, Liverpool L3 5DA, Merseyside, England",Met Office - UK,"Howard, T (corresponding author), Met Off, FitzRoy Rd, Exeter EX1 3PB, Devon, England.",tom.howard@metoffice.gov.uk,"Williams, Simon/C-7214-2011","Williams, Simon/0000-0003-4123-4973; Howard, Tom/0000-0001-5951-9307","Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, UK Government; Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, UK Government through the Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme","Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, UK Government; Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, UK Government through the Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme","This research has been supported by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, UK Government and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, UK Government, through the Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme.",,51,1,1,2,3,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1561-8633,1684-9981,,NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS,Nat.

However, Mexico's vulnerability to climate change impacts is a major motivating factor behind its announced intended contributions at COP21 to cut its baseline emissions by at least 25% in 2030. We analyze the macroeconomic impacts of the Climate Action Plan (CAP) process undertaken in the Mexican border state of Baja California (BC). We adapt a state-of-the-art regional macroeconometric model to analyze the BC economy-wide impacts of 22 GHG mitigation policy options recommended in the Baja California CAP. The combined effects include an average annual increase of 1680 new jobs (or about 0.11% of the average annual employment in the baseline economic forecast) and a Gross State Product (GSP) increase of $9.85 billion pesos in NPV over the 2015-2030 planning horizon. Although the main objective of GHG mitigation is to reduce atmospheric concentrations, and hence future potential damages of these pollutants, the stimulus to the BC economy from the implementation of its CAP represents a valuable co-benefit. Moreover, it is a tangible one that will take place in the near-term, in contrast to the more long-term and more uncertain benefits associated with reducing climate change damages.

The Franco-Chinese Institute of Health Art of Care tries to experiment what may be tomorrow the teaching of health care. During a 5 day course, French and Chinese surgeon participants follow a teaching course in the latest western techniques in health care coupled with cultural, psychological and physical tools derived from western and Chinese culture: sessions of surgical techniques (2h30/day) and sessions of interactive teaching in mini groups (2h30/day). Sessions also include conferences on the compared history of health care, ethics and the bases and practice of health care. Exercises in skill, concentration and meditation adapted to surgical practice complete the training. Partipants thereby (re) discover for example the impact of work conditions on the surgical act (noise, movement etc.), the beauty and pleasure of gesture (Chinese calligraphy), the aspect of concentration (Martial arts) and neurosciences in health care. The course is also 5 days of intensive sharing community life. Can this programm contribute by its multidisciplinary approach to reinforcing all the elements that have cemented the greatness of the surgical act? How does it work? What is the real impact? How can it apply effectively in surgery? What are the fundamental ethics that could emanate from this research in better health care?

Furthermore, it is related to high impact weather causing floods, hail, tornadoes, landslides, and other hazards. State-of-the-art climate models have to parameterize deep convection due to their coarse grid spacing. These parameterizations are a major source of uncertainty and long-standing model biases. We present a North American scale convection-permitting climate simulation that is able to explicitly simulate deep convection due to its 4-km grid spacing. We apply a feature-tracking algorithm to detect hourly precipitation from Mesoscale Convective Systems (MCSs) in the model and compare it with radar-based precipitation estimates east of the US Continental Divide. The simulation is able to capture the main characteristics of the observed MCSs such as their size, precipitation rate, propagation speed, and lifetime within observational uncertainties. In particular, the model is able to produce realistically propagating MCSs, which was a long-standing challenge in climate modeling. However, the MCS frequency is significantly underestimated in the central US during late summer. We discuss the origin of this frequency biases and suggest strategies for model improvements.","[Prein, Andreas F.; Liu, Changhai; Ikeda, Kyoko; Bullock, Randy; Rasmussen, Roy M.; Holland, Greg J.; Clark, Martyn] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, 3090 Ctr Green Dr, Boulder, CO 80301 USA",National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA,"Prein, AF (corresponding author), Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, 3090 Ctr Green Dr, Boulder, CO 80301 USA.",prein@ucar.edu,"Clark, Martyn/AAH-9999-2020; Prein, Andreas/N-4928-2017","Clark, Martyn/0000-0002-2186-2625; Prein, Andreas/0000-0001-6250-179X",,,,,53,105,105,7,27,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0930-7575,1432-0894,,CLIM DYNAM,Clim.

For this purpose, we assessed the similarity of the simulated and quasi-observed (reanalysis) probability density functions for circulation, temperature, and humidity variables at various pressure levels, which we chose from a statistical-downscaling point of view. Our main goals were to assess which GCM variables can be reliably used as predictors for downscaling, and which GCMs perform especially well over the region under study. Results showed that specific humidity is as reliably reproduced as circulation and temperature variables, and that overall performance is best for the Hadley Centre's HADGEM2 model. Secondary goals were to estimate the skillful scale of the models, and to measure the added value of bias correction, a post-processing step commonly used in practice. We found that all models lack performance at the scale of individual grid boxes, indicating that they are not robustly skillful at their smallest scale. We also found that model performance generally improves after removing monthly bias. However, model errors at higher-order moments, which cannot be removed by simply correcting the bias, were common in some models.","[Brands, S.; Herrera, S.; San-Martin, D.; Gutierrez, J.

Three state of the art Global Climate Models (GCMs) and an ensemble of Regional Climate Models (RCMs) under emission scenarios B1, A2 and A1B provide future precipitation (P) and temperature (T) estimates that are bias adjusted against observations. The ensemble of RCMs for the A1B scenario project a higher P reduction compared to GCMs projections under A2 and B1 scenarios. Among GCMs model results, the ECHAM model projects a higher P reduction compared to IPSL and CNCM. Water availability for the whole island at basin scale until 2100 is estimated using the SAC-SMA rainfall-runoff model And a set of demand and infrastructure scenarios are adopted to simulate potential water use. While predicted reduction of water availability under the B1 emission scenario can be handled with water demand stabilized at present values and full implementation of planned infrastructure, other scenarios require additional measures and a robust signal of water insufficiency is projected. Despite inherent uncertainties, the quantitative impact of the projected changes on water availability indicates that climate change plays an important role to water use and management in controlling future water status in a Mediterranean island like Crete. The results of the study reinforce the necessity to improve and update local water management planning and adaptation strategies in order to attain future water security. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we analyzed the impacts of two different climate change scenarios on optimal field management practices in winterwheat and grain maize production with case studies from Switzerland. Management options included nitrogen fertilization (amount, timing and allocation) as well as irrigation. Optimal solutions that maximize the farmer's utility were sought with the help of a bioeconomic modeling system that integrated the process-based crop growth model CropSyst into an economic decision model. The latter accounted not only for the crop specific average profit margins, but also for production risks, reflecting the utility (expressed as the certainty equivalent) of a risk-averse farmer's management decisions at field scale. In view of the non-linearity and complexity of the problem, we used a genetic algorithm as optimization technique. For grain maize, our results showed that climate change will foster the use of irrigation, not only at sites prone to water limitation already under current climatic conditions, but more in general for climate change scenarios projecting a substantial decrease in summer precipitation. For winterwheat, irrigation was never identified as an optimal management option. For both crops and sites, climate change reduced the optimum nitrogen fertilization amount and decreased for winterwheat the number of fertilization applications. In all cases, the farmer's certainty equivalent decreased between 7% and 25% under climate change, implying negative impacts on winterwheat and grain maize production even under the assumption of an adjustment of the optimum management practices.

Furthermore, conventional climate models are unable to realistically represent the type of intense storms which dominate the West African monsoon. This paper presents a decision-first framing of climate research in co-production of a climate-hydrology-flooding modelling chain, linking scientists working on state-of-the-art regional climate science with decision-makers involved in city planning for future urban flood management in the city of Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. The realistic convection-permitting model over Africa (CP4A) is applied at the urban scale for the first time and data suggest significant intensification of high-impact weather events and demonstrate the importance of considering the spatio-temporal scales in CP4A. Hydrological modelling and hydraulic modelling indicate increases in peak flows and flood extents in Ouagadougou in response to climate change which will be further exacerbated by future urbanisation. Advances in decision-makers' capability for using climate information within Ouagadougou were observed, and key recommendations applicable to other regional urban areas are made. This study provides proof of concept that a decision-first modelling-chain provides a methodology for co-producing climate information that can, to some extent, bridge the usability gap between what scientists think is useful and what decision-makers need.","[Miller, James D.; Taylor, Christopher M.; Visman, Emma; Vesuviano, Gianni] UK Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Wallingford, Oxon, England; [Vischel, Theo; Panthou, Geremy; Wilcox, Catherine; Cazenave, Frederic] Univ Grenoble Alpes, CNRS, IRD, Grenoble, France; [Fowe, Tazen; Coulibaly, Gnenakantanhan] Inst 2iE, Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso; [Gonzalez, Pepo] Cranfield Univ, Cranfield, Beds, England; [Body, Richard] HR Wallingford, Wallingford, Oxon, England; [Bouvier, Christophe; Chahinian, Nanee] Univ Montpellier, CNRS, HydroSci Montpellier, IRD, Montpellier, France",UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (UKCEH); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Cranfield University; HR Wallingford Limited; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite de Montpellier,"Miller, JD (corresponding author), UK Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Wallingford, Oxon, England.",millj@ceh.ac.uk; theo.vischel@univ-grenoble-alpes.fr; tazen.fowe@2ie-edu.org; geremy.panthou@univ-grenoble-alpes.fr; cmt@ceh.ac.uk; emmvis@ceh.ac.uk; g.coulibaly@2ie-edu.org; pepo.gonz@gmail.com; r.m.body@hrwallingford.com; giaves@ceh.ac.uk; jean-christophe.bouvier@umontpellier.fr; nanee.chahinian@ird.fr; frederic.cazenave@ird.fr,"Vesuviano, Gianni/P-2429-2015; Taylor, Christopher/K-2319-2012","Vesuviano, Gianni/0000-0003-2157-8875; Taylor, Christopher/0000-0002-0120-3198","UK's Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)/Department for International Development (DFID) Future Climate for Africa programme, under the AMMA-2050 project [NE/M020428/1, NE/M019969/1, NE/M019950/1, NE/M020126/1, NE/M019934/1]; Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES) MeghaTropiques validation programme","UK's Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)/Department for International Development (DFID) Future Climate for Africa programme, under the AMMA-2050 project; Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES) MeghaTropiques validation programme","The research leading to these results received funding from the UK's Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)/Department for International Development (DFID) Future Climate for Africa programme, under the AMMA-2050 project (grant numbers NE/M020428/1, NE/M019969/1, NE/M019950/1, NE/M020126/1 and NE/M019934/1).

Using a review of three relevant urban planning and climate change policies of Ghana, and interviews with six urban planning and climate-related agencies in Kumasi, findings indicate a demonstration of an unclear nature of policies, and a lack of focus on climate change issues in urban planning. Evidence of weak agency framework and coordination challenges (e.g., logistics, enforcement of laws) were reported, a situation that has contributed to the city's inability to manage 'normal' climate change impacts (e.g., flash floods).

Results are averaged across an area large enough to overcome the difference in spatial scale between these two types of projections and thus make the comparison meaningful. Undertaking the comparison using a suite of state-of-the-art coupled climate models for two forcing scenarios presents a unique opportunity to test whether statistical linkages established between large-scale predictors and local rainfall under current climate remain valid in future climatic conditions. The study focuses on the southwest corner of Western Australia, a region that has experienced recent winter rainfall declines and for which climate models project, with great consistency, further winter rainfall reductions due to global warming. Results show that as a first approximation the magnitude of the modeled rainfall decline in this region is linearly related to the model global warming ( a reduction of about 9% per degree), thus linking future rainfall declines to future emission paths. Two statistical downscaling techniques are used to investigate the influence of the choice of technique on projection consistency. In addition, one of the techniques was assessed using different large-scale forcings, to investigate the impact of large-scale predictor selection. Downscaled and direct model projections are consistent across the large number of models and two scenarios considered; that is, there is no tendency for either to be biased; and only a small hint that large rainfall declines are reduced in downscaled projections. Among the two techniques, a nonhomogeneous hidden Markov model provides greater consistency with climate models than an analog approach. Differences were due to the choice of the optimal combination of predictors. Thus statistically downscaled projections require careful choice of large-scale predictors in order to be consistent with physically based rainfall projections. In particular it was noted that a relative humidity moisture predictor, rather than specific humidity, was needed for downscaled projections to be consistent with direct model output projections.","[Timbal, B.; Hope, P.] Bur Meteorol, Ctr Australian Weather & Climate Res, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia; [Charles, S.] Commonwealth Sci & Ind Res Org Land & Water, Floreat, Australia",Bureau of Meteorology - Australia; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Timbal, B (corresponding author), Bur Meteorol, Ctr Australian Weather & Climate Res, GPO Box 1289, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia.",b.timbal@bom.gov.au,"Charles, Stephen/C-6833-2011","Charles, Stephen/0000-0001-6457-030X","Australian Greenhouse Office; government of Western Australia under the Indian Ocean Climate Initiative (IOCI); IOCI; eWater Cooperative Research Centre, Australia; Office of Science; U.

Key elements of the analysis are on the impact side the exceedances of critical thresholds for air pollution and global change and on the cost side the estimates of costs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and air pollutants. The integrated modeling framework set up to meet these objectives consists of two state-of-the-art integrated models covering regional air pollution in Europe (RAINS) and global climate change (IMAGE), supplemented by new components. Based on a preliminary analysis it can be stated that climate change will make European vegetation in most regions less sensitive to acid deposition. Taking into account the emission trends the impacts of regional air pollution will decrease while the impacts of climate change increase.

Although several studies exist on the climatological impact of deforestation in the Congo basin, deforestation scenarios that are implemented in climate models are generally crude. This study aims to refine current impact assessments by removing the primary forest according to an existing spatially explicit scenario, and replacing it by successional vegetation typically observed for the Congo basin. This is done within the Consortium for Small-Scale Modeling (COSMO) model in climate mode (COSMO-CLM), a regional climate model at 25-km grid spacing coupled to a state-of-the-art soil-vegetation-atmosphere transfer scheme (Community Land Model). An evaluation of the model shows good performance compared to in situ and satellite observations. Model integrations indicate that the deforestation, expected for the middle of the twenty-first century, induces a warming of about 0.7 degrees C. This is about half the greenhouse gas-induced surface warming in this region, given an intermediate emission scenario (A1B) with COSMO-CLM driven by the ECHAM5 global climate model. This shows the necessity of taking into account deforestation to obtain realistic future climate projections. The deforestation-induced warming can be attributed to reduced evaporation, but this effect is mitigated by increased albedo and increased sensible heat loss to the atmosphere. Precipitation is also affected: as a consequence of surface warming resulting from deforestation, a regional heat low develops over the rain forest region. Resulting low-level convergence causes a redistribution of moisture in the boundary layer and a stabilization of the atmospheric column, thereby reducing convection intensity and hence precipitation by 5%-10% in the region of the heat low.","[Akkermans, Tom; Thiery, Wim; Van Lipzig, Nicole P.

However, there are still too few that consider the impact of climate change, and fewer still that look beyond the baseline climate data (i.e., precipitation and temperature). Here, a data-driven, regional model that considers a wider array of climate variables is built and tested to evaluate the impact of climate change on the coupled water and electricity demand nexus in the Midwestern USA. The model, which is based on a state-of-the-art statistical learning algorithm, is first used to compare model runs comprised of different climatic variables. The model runs included a baseline model that considers only precipitation and temperature, as well as a selected feature model that considered a wider array of climatic variables, including relative humidity and wind speed. Following this comparison, the model is used to make future projections of the coupled water and electricity demand as a function of future climate change scenarios. The results indicate that (1) the inclusion of additional climate variables beyond the baseline provides a significant improvement in predictive accuracy, and (2) the climate-sensitive portions of summer electricity and water use are expected to increase in the region by 19% and 7%, respectively. Finally, the regional-scale model is leveraged to make city-level projections, indicating a 10-20% (2-5%) increase in electricity (water) use across the analyzed cities due to a warming climate.","[Obringer, Renee; Nateghi, Roshanak] Purdue Univ, Environm & Ecol Engn, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Kumar, Rohini] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Computat Hydrosyst, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany; [Nateghi, Roshanak] Purdue Univ, Sch Ind Engn, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ); Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus,"Obringer, R (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, Environm & Ecol Engn, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",robringe@purdue.edu,"Nateghi, Roshanak/AAQ-2425-2020; Kumar, Rohini/B-2299-2013","Kumar, Rohini/0000-0002-4396-2037",,,,,57,7,7,3,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

Current studies of observed global and regional climate changes are briefly reviewed based on the analysis of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The anthropogenic nature of climate change is emphasized. It is also noted that the observed warming in Russia is significantly larger than global warming. Alternative hypotheses on causes of global climate changes discussed in some Russian publications are reviewed and their groundlessness is shown. The paper discusses some characteristics of ensembles of CMIP3 models that participated in the preparation of the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report. A model quality index is introduced. The dependence of simulated climate change in Russia on the choice of model ensembles and emission scenarios is considered. It is shown that the climate change in Russia does not depend significantly on the emission scenario choice until the middle of the 21st century.,"[Meleshko, V. P.; Kattsov, V. M.; Mirvis, V.

Although many of its intentions are laudable, the report fails to resolve the inherent problems associated with defining, measuring and judging cultural excellence, even though this forms the core of McMaster's argument about how policy should develop. This may have significant implications for cultural institutions in the future. In addition, many of the report's recommendations may either be contradictory or impractical in the current policy climate - such as the desire for institutions to take more risks whilst simultaneously increasing visitor numbers and meeting other targets. As such, without a wider change in the Government's approach and a re-acknowledgement of culture's intrinsic value, excellence may just become the latest buzzword for practitioners, rather than the key principle upon which future decisions will be based.","[Eckersley, Susannah] Newcastle Univ, Int Ctr Cultural & Heritage Studies, Newcastle, NSW, Australia",University of Newcastle,"Eckersley, S (corresponding author), Newcastle Univ, Int Ctr Cultural & Heritage Studies, Newcastle, NSW, Australia.",s.c.eckersley@ncl.ac.uk,,,,,,,7,3,3,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0954-8963,1469-3690,,CULT TRENDS,Cult.

Identifying, quantifying, and communicating this uncertainty is key to both evaluating the risk associated with a projection and building confidence in its robustness. We review how uncertainties in such projections are handled in marine science. We employ an approach developed in climate modelling by breaking uncertainty down into (i) structural (model) uncertainty, (ii) initialization and internal variability uncertainty, (iii) parametric uncertainty, and (iv) scenario uncertainty. For each uncertainty type, we then examine the current state-of-the-art in assessing and quantifying its relative importance. We consider whether the marine scientific community has addressed these types of uncertainty sufficiently and highlight the opportunities and challenges associated with doing a better job. We find that even within a relatively small field such as marine science, there are substantial differences between subdisciplines in the degree of attention given to each type of uncertainty. We find that initialization uncertainty is rarely treated explicitly and reducing this type of uncertainty may deliver gains on the seasonal-to-decadal time-scale. Weconclude that all parts of marine science could benefit from a greater exchange of ideas, particularly concerning such a universal problem such as the treatment of uncertainty. Finally, marine science should strive to reach the point where scenario uncertainty is the dominant uncertainty in our projections.","[Payne, Mark R.; MacKenzie, Brian R.] Tech Univ Denmark, Natl Inst Aquat Resources DTU Aqua, Ctr Ocean Life, DK-2920 Charlottenlund, Denmark; [Barange, Manuel; Fernandes, Jose A.; Queiros, Ana M.] Plymouth Marine Lab, Prospect Pl, Plymouth PL1 3DH, Devon, England; [Cheung, WilliamW.

However, where natural climate aberrations mask or amplify the impacts of anthropogenic climate change, identifying key detrimental changes is challenging. In these situations, long-term, systematic field studies allow the consequences of anthropogenically driven climate change to be distinguished from the expected fluctuations in natural resources. In this study, we describe fluctuations in encounter rates for humpback whales, Megaptera novaeangliae, between 2008 and 2018. Encounter rates were assessed during transect surveys of the Au'Au Channel, Maui, Hawaii. Initially, rates increased, tracking projected growth rates for this population segment. Rates reached a peak in 2013, then declined through 2018. Specifically, between 2013 and 2018, mother-calf encounter rates dropped by 76.5%, suggesting a rapid reduction in the reproductive rate of the newly designated Hawaii Distinct Population Segment of humpback whales during this time. As this decline coincided with changes in the Pacific decadal oscillation, the development of the NE Pacific marine heat wave and the evolution of the 2016 El Nino, this may be another example of the impact of this potent trifecta of climatic events within the North Pacific.","[Cartwright, R.; Venema, A.; Hernandez, V; Wyels, C.; Cesere, J.; Cesere, D.] Keiki Kohola Project, Kihei, HI 96753 USA; [Cartwright, R.] Calif State Univ Channel Isl, Dept Environm Sci & Resource Management, One Univ Dr, Camarillo, CA 93012 USA; [Wyels, C.] Calif State Univ Channel Isl, Dept Math, One Univ Dr, Camarillo, CA 93012 USA; [Cesere, J.; Cesere, D.] Fine Art Photog, Paia, HI 96779 USA",California State University System; California State University Channel Islands; California State University System; California State University Channel Islands,"Cartwright, R (corresponding author), Keiki Kohola Project, Kihei, HI 96753 USA.;Cartwright, R (corresponding author), Calif State Univ Channel Isl, Dept Environm Sci & Resource Management, One Univ Dr, Camarillo, CA 93012 USA.",rachel.cartwright@csuci.edu,,"Cartwright, Rachel/0000-0002-2175-574X","Worcester UK; British Broadcasting Corporation; Apple Computers Inc.; Whale Trust, Maui; Cesere Fine Art Photography","Worcester UK; British Broadcasting Corporation; Apple Computers Inc.; Whale Trust, Maui; Cesere Fine Art Photography","This project was principally funded through annual donations to the Keiki Kohola Project, received from Mark Percival, Worcester UK.

While their position of political influence in the Republican coalition is widely recognised, the full range of effects of this position on evangelicals' climate opinions is not. To move research on evangelicals from the margins of climate change opinion research, we review and integrate the interdisciplinary literature on US evangelicals, climate change, and politics. In assessing this literature, we identify three areas in need of further research. First, there is a critical need for more research on the climate attitudes of evangelicals of color, who comprise a growing share of the evangelical tradition in the US. Second, highlighting the Christian Right's active engagement in the climate debate, we identify a need for more experimental work examining how cues from religious elites may shape evangelicals' opinions. Finally, we suggest that to better harness insights across disciplines, researchers must become more explicitly aware of how different disciplines conceptualize temporality. Attending to temporal scale suggests that a new approach is needed to test how dominion beliefs, which are widely thought to be an important theological driver of climate skepticism, operate. We also suggest that two factors that appear to play a weak or limited role in driving climate skepticism over the short term (anti-science attitudes and evangelical religiosity) may in fact play a significant role in driving skepticism over the medium term.

To make climate governance work, much policy activity is needed at the local and regional levels. Entrepreneurs are actors who aim to affect change by using their agency. They target policy decisions at the local and regional levels, which might subsequently turn to other governance levels to expand their influence. The scientific discussion about governance entrepreneurs is characterized by a lack of conceptual clarity, by methodological challenges, and by several research gaps. Regarding the latter, at present, it is especially unclear when and why entrepreneurs become active, which factors they take into account when they select their strategies, and what explains the effects of entrepreneurial activity on the emergence of innovations in climate governance. All contributions to this special issue engage with one or several of these conceptual, methodological, and empirical challenges, thus advancing the state of art in the field. Highlights from the special issue include the development of a simple conceptual frame that connects actors, contexts, strategies, and outcomes in a systematic way. Some promising methodological avenues are described, since the special issue contains not only some qualitative case studies but also some studies that take a long-term perspective by following policy development for decades, and a study that proposes a census approach. Empirically, the contributions in this special issue shed light on a range of factors explaining levels of entrepreneurial activity, and they carefully trace impacts over time. We conclude by sketching an agenda for further work in this realm.","[Huitema, Dave] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies IVM, Boelelaan 1087, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Huitema, Dave; Beunen, Raoul] Open Univ Netherlands, Fac Management Sci & Technol, Dept Nat Sci, Valkenburgerweg 177, NL-6419 AT Heerlen, Netherlands; [Boasson, Elin Lerum] Univ Oslo, Dept Polit Sci, Moltke Moesvei 31, N-0851 Oslo, Norway; [Boasson, Elin Lerum] Ctr Int Climate & Environm Res CICERO, Gaustadalleen 21, N-0349 Oslo, Norway",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Open University Netherlands; University of Oslo,"Huitema, D (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies IVM, Boelelaan 1087, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.;Huitema, D (corresponding author), Open Univ Netherlands, Fac Management Sci & Technol, Dept Nat Sci, Valkenburgerweg 177, NL-6419 AT Heerlen, Netherlands.",dave.huitema@vu.nl; e.l.boasson@stv.uio.no; raoul.beunen@ou.nl,"Beunen, Raoul/L-9759-2013; Huitema, Dave/L-1343-2013","Beunen, Raoul/0000-0001-5005-075X; Huitema, D./0000-0002-0139-3913; Huitema, Dave/0000-0001-8565-3200",,,,,23,4,5,3,14,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1436-3798,1436-378X,,REG ENVIRON CHANGE,Reg.

Including diverse disciplines in science projects enables a range of different views which often facilitate the creation of innovative solutions. Supporting multiple views and options requires a different way of worldng beyond traditional reductionist approaches to science, communication and decision-making. To embrace diversity in scientific project teams in order to tackle complex, integrated and urgent issues but to expect singular and linear pathways forward is paradoxical. Much has been written about the need for the scientific community to embrace uncertainty (e.g. Popper, Lempert & Bankes 2005; Lempert et al., 2004; Nelson, Howden & Hayman 2013; Bammer & Smithson 2008). We argue that this in itself will not suffice, and that there is also a need to embrace ambiguity in certain. situations. Thus, in this article we explore: (1) what ambiguity is, including the benefits it can offer to climate adaptation in particular, using existing approaches to ambiguity in the arts and humanities as examples (2), we discuss practical meanings of ambiguity in relation to climate change, (3) we propose possible next steps for bringing ambiguity into interdisciplinary practice, and (4) we identify some challenges and necessary preconditions to successfully and appropriately embracing ambiguity.

In the Flemish Region the Directive has been implemented by the Decree of July 2003 on Integral Water Policy. As climate change affects the quality and quantity status of water bodies, the question arises whether the Water Framework Directive (WFD) and the Flemish implementation legislation are well-suited to handle climate change impacts. Although climate change concerns are not explicitly incorporated in the text of the WFD and the Flemish Decree, this author believes that the main components for an effective adaptation strategy are included in the above mentioned legislation. More in particular, this is achieved by the environmental objectives which have to be elaborated in environmental quality standards (EQS) on the one hand, and the integrated approach on the other hand. Water quality management on the basis of a high level of protection of the aquatic environment is indispensable for adapting to climate change, as ecosystem-based adaptation is most cost-effective. Therefore spatial planning should integrate water quality concerns, as spatial planning may be critical for spatial quality and more specific for the achievement of the environmental objectives. Consequently this contribution focuses on the impact of water quality standards on, permit decision-making and spatial planning. In this context some legal instruments anchored in the Flemish legislation on integral water policy will be highlighted, especially the 'watertoets' (translated as the water checkup), which may be useful to facilitate adaptation to climate change.","[De Smedt, Peter] Univ Ghent, Ctr Environm & Energy Law, Ghent, Belgium",Ghent University,"De Smedt, P (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Ctr Environm & Energy Law, Ghent, Belgium.",,,,,,,,12,2,2,0,0,BRILL ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,LEIDEN,"PLANTIJNSTRAAT 2, P O BOX 9000, 2300 PA LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS",1613-7272,1876-0104,,J EUR ENVIRON PLAN L,J.

Three different management scenarios (A, B, C) with different thinning grades and a thinning interval of five years were simulated. Every management scenario was simulated under three different climate scenarios (OK, 2K, 3K) compiled by the regional statistical climate model STAR 2.0 (PIK). For each climate scenario 100 different realisations were generated. The realisations of the climate scenarios encompass the period 2036-2060 and exhibit an increase of mean annual temperature of zero, two and three Kelvin until 2060, respectively. We selected 9 model outputs concerning biomass, growth and harvest which were aggregated to a single total performance index (TPI). The TPI was used to assess the management scenarios with regard to three management objectives (carbon sequestration, intermediate, timber yield) under climate change until 2060. We found out that management scenario A led to the highest TPI concerning the carbon sequestration objective and management scenario C performed best concerning the two other objectives. The analysis of variance in the growth related model outputs showed an increase of climate uncertainty with increasing climate warming. Interestingly, the increase of climate induced uncertainty is much higher from 2 to 3 K than from 0 to 2 K.","[Gutsch, M.; Lasch, P.; Suckow, F.; Reyer, C.] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res PIK, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany",Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung,"Gutsch, M (corresponding author), Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res PIK, POB 60 12 03, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany.",gutsch@pik-postdam.de,"Reyer, Christopher/A-5515-2013","Reyer, Christopher/0000-0003-1067-1492",BMBF [330576E],BMBF(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),This study was partly funded by the BMBF project OakChain with the reference number 330576E.,,27,11,11,1,22,INST NACIONAL INVESTIGACION TECHNOLOGIA AGRARIA ALIMENTARIA,MADRID,"CTRA CORUNA KM 7 5, MADRID, 28040, SPAIN",2171-5068,2171-9845,,FOREST SYST,For.

Nation states were given special responsibility to facilitate these by ensuring access to information and opportunities to participate in decision-making processes. Since then the need for public participation has featured prominently in calls to climate action. Using text analysis to produce a corpus of abstracts drawn from Web of Science, a review of literature incorporating public participation and citizen engagement in climate change adaptation since 1992 reveals lexical, temporal, and spatial distribution dynamics of research on the topic. An exponential rise in research effort since the year 2000 is demonstrated, with the focus of research action on three substantial themes-risk, flood risk, and risk assessment, perception, and communication. These are critically reviewed and three substantive issues are considered: the paradox of participation, the challenge of governance transformation, and the need to incorporate psycho-social and behavioral adaptation to climate change in policy processes. Gaps in current research include a lack of common understanding of public participation for climate adaptation across disciplines; incomplete articulation of processes involving public participation and citizen engagement; and a paucity of empirical research examining how understanding and usage of influential concepts of risk, vulnerability and adaptive capacity varies among different disciplines and stakeholders. Finally, a provisional research agenda for attending to these gaps is described.

Building on reviews published in WIREs Climate Change on images, films, drama, climate science fiction, and other literary forms, we examine how audio and visual art addresses the enduring problems of climate change communication. We begin with three of these problems: climate change's often abstract nature, the distances in time and space between those who cause climate change and the places its effects are felt, and forms of humanenvironmental relations that shape how climate is understood. We reflect on how, through a combination of vision and sound, art creates sensory experiences that tackle these challenges. In querying how our artistic examples bring about environmental engagements, we combine an analysis of the representations and narratives of these works with an appreciation of their aesthetic form-in short, how these art pieces activate emotional and experiential responses. While we recognize the limits of what art can do, especially the gallery-based forms of work we study here, we argue that spending time exploring the encounters that art creates helps us to understand what it brings to the communication of climate change. It also demonstrates how lessons learnt about sensory experience, affect, and emotions might be more widely applied to the analysis of cultural forms-from literature to films- and their role in climate change communication.

We outline the strengths and weaknesses of available climate projections, the uncertainty associated with future projections at different spatial and temporal scales, the differences between available downscaling methods (dynamical, statistical downscaling, and simple scaling of global circulation model output), and the implications these have for ecological models. We describe some of the changes in the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), including the new representative concentration pathways.

In observations, a wet short-rainy season is associated with the positive phase of the IOD and anomalous easterly low-level flow across the equatorial Indian Ocean. A model's ability to capture the teleconnection to the positive IOD is closely related to its representation of the mean state. During the short-rains season, the observed low-level wind in the equatorial Indian Ocean is westerly. However, half of the models analyzed exhibit mean-state easterlies across the entire basin. Specifically, those models that exhibit mean-state low-level equatorial easterlies in the Indian Ocean, rather than the observed westerlies, are unable to capture the latitudinal structure of moisture advection into East Africa during a positive IOD. Furthermore, the associated anomalous easterly surface wind stress causes upwelling in the eastern Indian Ocean. This upwelling draws up cool subsurface waters, enhancing the zonal sea surface temperature gradient between west and east and strengthening the positive IOD pattern, further amplifying the easterly wind stress. This positive Bjerknes coupled feedback is stronger in easterly mean-state models, resulting in a wetter East African short-rain precipitation bias in those models.","[Hirons, Linda; Turner, Andrew] Univ Reading, Natl Ctr Atmospher Sci, Reading, Berks, England; [Turner, Andrew] Univ Reading, Dept Meteorol, Reading, Berks, England",UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); NERC National Centre for Atmospheric Science; University of Reading; University of Reading,"Hirons, L (corresponding author), Univ Reading, Natl Ctr Atmospher Sci, Reading, Berks, England.",l.c.hirons@reading.ac.uk,"Turner, Andrew G/D-2286-2009","Turner, Andrew G/0000-0002-0642-6876; Hirons, Linda/0000-0002-1189-7576","Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)-Department for International Development (DFID) as part of the Future Climate for Africa (FCFA) programme [NE/M017222/1]; NERC [NE/M017214/1, ncas10003, NE/M017222/1] Funding Source: UKRI",Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)-Department for International Development (DFID) as part of the Future Climate for Africa (FCFA) programme; NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"This work has been conducted for the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)-Department for International Development (DFID)-funded Improving Model Processes for African Climate (IMPALA) project (NE/M017222/1), as part of the Future Climate for Africa (FCFA) programme.

Earth system models are climate models incorporating biogeochemical processes such as the carbon cycle. The development of ESM was triggered by studies of the feedback between climate change and the carbon cycle. State-of-the-art ESMs are much more realistic than the first ESMs. They now include various biogeochemical processes other than carbon, such as atmospheric chemistry and the nitrogen and iron cycles as well as nutrient transport by atmospheric dust and rivers. They are used to address many practical issues, such as evaluating the amount of carbon dioxide emissions that is consistent with climate change mitigation targets, and are indispensable tools for the development of climate change mitigation policies. Novel, ambitious attempts to use ESMs include coupling socioeconomics with Earth systems, and projecting the carbon cycle on decadal timescales. Development of ESMs requires ongoing integration of multiple aspects of climate science. Emerging applications of ESMs can bring forth meaningful insights, and should be directed toward expanding connections with fields outside climate science, e.g., socioeconomics.","[Kawamiya, Michio; Hajima, Tomohiro; Tachiiri, Kaoru; Watanabe, Shingo] Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, Kanazawa Ku, 3173-25 Showamachi, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2360001, Japan; [Yokohata, Tokuta] Natl Inst Environm Studies, 16-2 Onogawa, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058506, Japan",Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science & Technology (JAMSTEC); National Institute for Environmental Studies - Japan,"Kawamiya, M (corresponding author), Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, Kanazawa Ku, 3173-25 Showamachi, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2360001, Japan.",kawamiya@jamstec.go.jp,"Kawamiya, Michio/GPS-7720-2022; Tachiiri, Kaoru/G-7607-2011; Yokohata, Tokuta/N-4540-2019","Yokohata, Tokuta/0000-0001-7346-7988; Kawamiya, Michio/0000-0001-7553-0522","TOUGOU, the Integrated Research Program for Advancing Climate Models of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan [JPMXD0717935715]","TOUGOU, the Integrated Research Program for Advancing Climate Models of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan","This work is supported by TOUGOU, the Integrated Research Program for Advancing Climate Models of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan (Grant Number JPMXD0717935715).",,104,19,20,5,30,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",2197-4284,,,PROG EARTH PLANET SC,Prog.

Hygrothermal simulations would benefit from using a climate ensemble to account for the large uncertainties that come with modelled climate data. However, this has been rarely done so far, and no state-of-the-art methodology exists to implement ensemble data in hygrothermal simulations. This paper presents the application of a Canadian initial-condition ensemble CanRCM4 LE in hygrothermal (HAM) modelling. A brick-clad wood-stud wall assembly and historical solid masonry wall, before and after retrofitting, are analysed for Ottawa, CA. Variations in the HAM model are studied to evaluate whether the ensemble can be represented by one smaller reduced ensemble for different studies. And, the potential of climate-based indices to predict this reduced ensemble is studied. Further, the uncertainty of the ensemble is analysed, as well as the climate change signal of the damage functions. It is found that the application of a climate ensemble is highly valuable for HAM modelling, as it is able to account for the high uncertainty of climate change data. To maintain the level of information, it is recommended to perform HAM simulations using the entire ensemble. However, there is potential to select a reduced ensemble to represent spread of the climate change signal.","[Vandemeulebroucke, I.; Van Den Bossche, N.] Univ Ghent, Bldg Phys Grp, Fac Engn & Architecture, UGent Campus UFO, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Defo, M.; Lacasse, M.

Model performance on D2M timescales is evaluated using metrics designed to characterize the relative and absolute magnitude of variability at these frequencies. In observational data, we find that between 10% and 35% of the total variance occurs on D2M timescales. Regions characterized by the high end of this range include Africa, Australia, western North America, and the Amazon region of South America. In these areas D2M fluctuations are especially prominent and linked to prolonged drought. D2M fluctuations account for considerably less of the total variance (between 5% and 15%) in the CMIP5 archive of historical (1850-2005) simulations. The discrepancy between observation and model based estimates of D2M prominence reflects two features of the CMIP5 archive. First, interannual components of variability are generally too energetic. Second, decadal components are too weak in several key regions. Our findings imply that projections of the future lack sufficient decadal variability, presenting a limited view of prolonged drought and pluvial risk. Citation: Ault, T. R., J. E. Cole, and S.

In addition to univariate bias correction methods, several multivariate bias correction methods were proposed recently, which can not only correct the biases in marginal distributions of individual climate variables but also properly adjust the biased intervariable correlations simulated by climate models. Due to the diversities of climate regime and climate model bias, hydrological simulation for watersheds under different climate conditions may show various sensitivities to the correction of intervariable correlations. Therefore, it is of great importance to investigate (1) whether the correction of intervariable correlations has impacts on the hydrological modeling and (2) how these impacts vary with watersheds under different climate conditions. To achieve these goals, this study evaluates behaviors and their spatial variability of multiple state-of-the-art multivariate bias correction methods in hydrological modeling over 2,840 watersheds distributed in different climate regimes in North America. The results show that, compared to using a quantile mapping univariate bias correction method, applying multivariate methods can improve the simulation of snow proportion, snowmelt, evaporation, and several streamflow variables. In addition, this improvement is more clear for watersheds with arid and warm temperate climates in southern regions, while it is limited for northern snow-characterized watersheds. Overall, this study demonstrates the importance of using multivariate bias correction methods instead of univariate methods in hydrological climate change impact studies, especially for watersheds with arid and warm temperate climates.","[Guo, Qiang; Chen, Jie; Chen, Hua] Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Water Resources & Hydropower Engn S, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Guo, Qiang; Chen, Jie] Wuhan Univ, Hubei Prov Key Lab Water Syst Sci Sponge City Con, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xunchang John] ARS, USDA, Grazinglands Res Lab, El Reno, OK USA; [Xu, Chong-Yu] Univ Oslo, Dept Geosci, Oslo, Norway",Wuhan University; Wuhan University; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); University of Oslo,"Chen, J (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Water Resources & Hydropower Engn S, Wuhan, Peoples R China.;Chen, J (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ, Hubei Prov Key Lab Water Syst Sci Sponge City Con, Wuhan, Peoples R China.",jiechen@whu.edu.cn,"Xu, Chong-Yu/B-2941-2012","Xu, Chong-Yu/0000-0003-4826-5350; Guo, Qiang/0000-0001-6539-5988; Zhang, John/0000-0002-0082-8436","National Natural Science Foundation of China [51779176, 51539009]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFA0603704]; Overseas Expertise Introduction Project for Discipline Innovation (111 Project) - Ministry of Education and State Administration of Foreign Experts Affairs P.R.

Due to the complexity of climate-associated processes, identification of predictor variables from high dimensional atmospheric variables is considered a key factor for improvement of climate change projections in statistical downscaling approaches. For this purpose, the present paper adopts a new approach of supervised dimensionality reduction, which is called Supervised Principal Component Analysis (Supervised PCA) to regression-based statistical downscaling. This method is a generalization of PCA, extracting a sequence of principal components of atmospheric variables, which have maximal dependence on the response hydro-climate variable. To capture the nonlinear variability between hydro-climatic response variables and projectors, a kernelized version of Supervised PCA is also applied for nonlinear dimensionality reduction. The effectiveness of the Supervised PCA methods in comparison with some state-of-the-art algorithms for dimensionality reduction is evaluated in relation to the statistical downscaling process of precipitation in a specific site using two soft computing nonlinear machine learning methods, Support Vector Regression and Relevance Vector Machine. The results demonstrate a significant improvement over Supervised PCA methods in terms of performance accuracy.","[Sarhadi, Ali; Burn, Donald H.] Univ Waterloo, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; [Yang, Ge; Ghodsi, Ali] Univ Waterloo, Sch Comp Sci, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada",University of Waterloo; University of Waterloo,"Sarhadi, A (corresponding author), Univ Waterloo, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.",asarhadi@uwaterloo.ca,"Burn, Donald/P-7038-2019","Burn, Donald/0000-0001-7917-6380",,,,,49,11,11,4,26,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0930-7575,1432-0894,,CLIM DYNAM,Clim.

But, as the current generation of climate models enables consideration and implementation of important coupling processes, the present study provides perspectives for the modelling of relevant climate-hydrology interactions. On a more short-term perspective, these comprise anthropogenic land use and especially irrigation, which has been shown that it may even affect remote regions. On a long-term perspective, the coupling of hydrology to carbon cycle and vegetation becomes important, specifically the dynamics of permafrost and wetlands. Here, we present a review of current knowledge combined with some exemplary studies from a large-scale point of view.

As a signatory nation of the Paris Agreement, Brazil has made a climate action commitment, and expressed its nationally determined contribution to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 37%. The Brazilian population is highly urban, and Brazilian cities are mostly responsible for greenhouse gas emissions, and the worst effects of global warming are experienced in cities. Hence, the fulfillment of the Brazilian climate commitments depends on the active engagement of municipalities. Nevertheless, the Brazilian national government does not monitor local climate actions, and it is not clear how local urban policy is aligned with climate action. In order to bridge this gap, this study tackles the question of: Are, and if yes how, cities considering the climate emergency in their local planning mechanisms? This question is investigated by placing five major Brazilian cities under the microscope. The methodological approach includes literature review and applied qualitative analysis to scrutinize how climate issues and actions are factored in urban planning regulations to verify if and to what extent local policies contribute to the fulfillment of the Brazilian nationally determined contribution, and sustainable development goals. The results disclose that investigated cities have adequately incorporated climatic issues in their urban planning mechanisms. However, policy concentrates more on adaptation rather than mitigation, and policy implementation yet to be realized.","[Sotto, Debora; Philippi, Arlindo] Univ Sao Paulo, Sch Publ Hlth, Av Dr Arnaldo 715, BR-01246904 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [Yigitcanlar, Tan] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Civil Engn & Built Environm, 2 George St, Brisbane, Qld 4000, Australia; [Kamruzzaman, Md] Monash Univ, Fac Art Design & Architecture, 900 Dandenong Rd, Caulfield, Vic 3145, Australia",Universidade de Sao Paulo; Queensland University of Technology (QUT); Monash University,"Yigitcanlar, T (corresponding author), Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Civil Engn & Built Environm, 2 George St, Brisbane, Qld 4000, Australia.",tan.yigitcanlar@qut.edu.au,"Yigitcanlar, Tan/J-1142-2012; Philippi, Arlindo/N-9218-2016; Sotto, Debora/G-5857-2015","Yigitcanlar, Tan/0000-0001-7262-7118; Kamruzzaman, Md./0000-0001-7113-942X; Philippi Jr, Arlindo/0000-0003-0420-7749; Sotto, Debora/0000-0001-9194-5912",,,,,74,21,21,1,9,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1996-1073,,ENERGIES,Energies,SEP,2019,18,,,,,,3418,10.3390/en12183418,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en12183418,,,31,Energy & Fuels,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Energy & Fuels,JC2IR,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000489101200014,View Full Record in Web of Science

Typological analysis concentrated on participants' relative attention to Future Thinking, Climate Knowledge, and Narrative Communication. Despite professional application of climate knowledge, the majority of participants found it challenging to imagine future societies situated in future climates, especially those who did not consider themselves at risk, or who found it difficult to discuss projected climate change impacts.

However a spatio-temporal representation of the LIG climatic changes remains difficult to obtain, mainly because aligning paleoclimatic records from various archives (i.e. polar ice cores, marine sediments, speleothems) from around the globe is challenging. Here we summarize recent studies that highlight how the coupling of a synthesis of surface air and sea temperature records (above polar ice sheets and from the North Atlantic and Southern Ocean respectively) associated with harmonized chronologies and of appropriate climate model experiments improved our spatio-temporal representation of the LIG high-latitude climate evolution, and our understanding of the mechanisms at play, especially at the beginning of the LIG. In particular, we describe commonly-used record alignment strategies for marine sediment cores and we show that age discrepancies larger than 4 ka can exist between the timescales inferred from the different approaches. Providing harmonized chronologies when comparing multiple records is thus essential and we propose a new high latitude LIG data synthesis based on coherent record time scales together with associated time slices at 130, 125, 120 and 115 ka of surface temperature anomalies relative to present-day. The results provide the first robust evidence for asynchronous surface temperature evolutions at the LIG onset across the world and also enable one to identify important missing processes in state-of-the-art model climate simulations to reproduce the early LIG climate evolution. Our integrated model-data approach shows that a freshwater input into the North Atlantic (due to the Northern Hemisphere ice sheet early melting) needs to be accounted for in addition to the orbital and greenhouse gas concentration forcing in climate simulations, to explain the evolution of the early LIG climate.","[Capron, Emilie] Univ Copenhagen, Ctr Ice & Climate, Juliane Maries Vej 30, DK-2100 Copenhaguen, Denmark; [Capron, Emilie] British Antarctic Survey, High Cross Madingley Rd, Cambridge GB CB3 0ET, England; [Govin, Aline] Univ Paris Saclay, UVSQ, CEA, IPSL,LSCE,CNRS, FR-91198 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Stone, Emma J.] Univ Bristol, Sch Geog Sci, BRIDGE, Univ Rd, Bristol GB BS8 1SS, Avon, England",University of Copenhagen; UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); NERC British Antarctic Survey; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Cite; Universite Paris Saclay; CEA; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); University of Bristol,"Capron, E (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen, Ctr Ice & Climate, Juliane Maries Vej 30, DK-2100 Copenhaguen, Denmark.;Capron, E (corresponding author), British Antarctic Survey, High Cross Madingley Rd, Cambridge GB CB3 0ET, England.",capron@nbi.ku.dk; aline.govin@lsce.ipsl.fr; emma.j.stone@bristol.ac.uk,"Stone, Emma/H-9549-2012; Govin, Aline/E-6354-2013","Stone, Emma/0000-0002-8633-8074; Govin, Aline/0000-0001-8512-5571",UK-NERC consortium iGlass [NE/I009906/1]; European Union's Seventh Framework programme (FP7) [243908]; European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for research and innovation under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant [600207]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) under the special Priority Program INTERDYNAMIC (EndLIG project) [GO 2122/1-1],UK-NERC consortium iGlass; European Union's Seventh Framework programme (FP7); European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for research and innovation under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) under the special Priority Program INTERDYNAMIC (EndLIG project)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"The research leading to these results has received funding from the UK-NERC consortium iGlass (NE/I009906/1) and is also a contribution to the European Union's Seventh Framework programme (FP7/2007-2013) under grant agreement 243908, Past4Future.

Models are therefore an important tool to understand and predict the impacts of an eruption. This study uses five state-of-the-art decadal prediction systems that have been initialized with the observed state before volcanic aerosols are introduced. The impact of the volcanic aerosols is found by subtracting the results of a reference experiment where the volcanic aerosols are omitted. We look for the robust impact across models and volcanoes by combining all the experiments, which helps reveal a signal even if it is weak in the models. The models used in this study simulate realistic levels of warming in the stratosphere, but zonal winds are weaker than the observations. As a consequence, models can produce a pattern similar to the North Atlantic Oscillation in the first winter following the eruption, but the response and impact on surface temperatures are weaker than in observations.

Previous climate modelling attempts to estimate future sea level change in the Mediterranean did not meet a consensus. The low resolution of CMIP-type models prevents an accurate representation of important small scales processes acting over the Mediterranean region. For this reason among others, the use of high resolution regional ocean modelling has been recommended in literature to address the question of ongoing and future Mediterranean sea level change in response to climate change or greenhouse gases emissions. Also, it has been shown that east Atlantic sea level variability is the dominant driver of the Mediterranean variability at interannual and interdecadal scales. However, up to now, long-term regional simulations of the Mediterranean Sea do not integrate the full sea level information from the Atlantic, which is a substantial shortcoming when analysing Mediterranean sea level response. In the present study we analyse different approaches followed by state-of-the-art regional climate models to simulate Mediterranean sea level variability. Additionally we present a new simulation which incorporates improved information of Atlantic sea level forcing at the lateral boundary. We evaluate the skills of the different simulations in the frame of long-term hindcast simulations spanning from 1980 to 2012 analysing sea level variability from seasonal to multidecadal scales. Results from the new simulation show a substantial improvement in the modelled Mediterranean sea level signal. This confirms that Mediterranean mean sea level is strongly influenced by the Atlantic conditions, and thus suggests that the quality of the information in the lateral boundary conditions (LBCs) is crucial for the good modelling of Mediterranean sea level. We also found that the regional differences inside the basin, that are induced by circulation changes, are model-dependent and thus not affected by the LBCs. Finally, we argue that a correct configuration of LBCs in the Atlantic should be used for future Mediterranean simulations, which cover hindcast period, but also for scenarios.","[Adloff, Fanny; Somot, Samuel; Sevault, Florence; Planton, Serge] Meteo France, CNRM UMR 3589, CNRS, Toulouse, France; [Adloff, Fanny] Univ Reading, Dept Meteorol, Reading, Berks, England; [Jorda, Gabriel] UIB, IMEDEA, Palma De Mallorca, Spain; [Arsouze, Thomas] Univ Paris Saclay, ENSTA ParisTech, Palaiseau, France; [Arsouze, Thomas] Ecole Polytech, CNRS, IPSL, LMD, Palaiseau, France; [Meyssignac, Benoit] Univ Toulouse, LEGOS, UMR 5566, CNRS,CNES,IRD, Toulouse, France; [Li, Laurent] UPMC, CNRS, LMD, Paris, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Earth Sciences & Astronomy (INSU); Meteo France; University of Reading; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Instituto Mediterraneo de Estudios Avanzados (IMEDEA); Universitat de les Illes Balears; Institut Polytechnique de Paris; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Ecole des Ponts ParisTech; Institut Polytechnique de Paris; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Cite; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Earth Sciences & Astronomy (INSU); Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Laboratoire d'Etudes en Geophysique et oceanographie spatiales; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Ecole des Ponts ParisTech; UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Universite Paris Cite,"Adloff, F (corresponding author), Meteo France, CNRM UMR 3589, CNRS, Toulouse, France.;Adloff, F (corresponding author), Univ Reading, Dept Meteorol, Reading, Berks, England.",f.adloff@reading.ac.uk,"Meyssignac, Benoit/GLQ-5451-2022; Li, Laurent/X-3278-2019; Somot, Samuel/A-7585-2008","Meyssignac, Benoit/0000-0001-6325-9843; Li, Laurent/0000-0002-3855-3976; Arsouze, Thomas/0000-0002-8871-6120; Adloff, Fanny/0000-0003-1519-754X; Somot, Samuel/0000-0002-5066-2921",AXA Research Fund postdoctoral fellowship; Spanish Ministry of Economy [RYC-2013-14714]; Regional Government of the Balearic Islands; HyMeX programme; ESA; French National Research Agency (ANR) project REMEMBER [ANR-12-SENV-0001],AXA Research Fund postdoctoral fellowship(AXA Research Fund); Spanish Ministry of Economy(Spanish Government); Regional Government of the Balearic Islands; HyMeX programme; ESA(European Space Agency); French National Research Agency (ANR) project REMEMBER(French National Research Agency (ANR)),F.

At present, little is known about the achievement goals of martial arts practitioners, particularly in BJJ. Thus, our aim was knowledge about achievement goal orientations and perceptions of the motivational climate in a BJJ academy. We hypothesized that mastery-approach goals would correlate with weekly training duration, that goal orientation scores would reflect the corresponding higher-order motivational climate score, and that white belt practitioners would perceive the motivational climate as more performance-oriented than higher belt ranks. . Material and Methods: The sample comprised 42 males aged 31.9 +/- 6.2 years, with 5.4 +/- 3.8 years of training experience and a weekly training duration of 7.7 +/- 3.4 hours per week. The 3x2 Achievement Goal Questionnaire for Sport (3x2 AGQ-S) was used to assess achievement goal orientations. Perceptions of the motivational climate were measured with the Perceived Motivational Climate in Sport Questionnaire (PMCSQ-2). The 10-item Perceived Physical Ability (PPA) subscale of the Physical Self-Efficacy Scale was used to evaluate perceived physical ability. Results: Overall, the practitioners emphasized mastery-approach goals, which was congruous, but not significantly associated with higher-order motivational climate scores. Rank correlated both with goal orientations and perceived motivational climate. Additionally, weekly training duration and style preference were associated with task-approach goals. Conclusions: Brazilian jiu-jitsu practitioners appear to focus on mastery, making them more likely to demonstrate adaptive behaviour when facing adversity. These findings support previous observations on the compatibility of mastery goals and competitive martial arts.","[Ovretveit, Karsten; Saether, Stig Arve; Mehus, Ingar] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Sociol & Polit Sci, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Ovretveit, K (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Sociol & Polit Sci, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway.",karsten.ovretveit@ntnu.no,"Øvretveit, Karsten/AAD-9975-2021; Sæther, Stig Arve/K-8979-2019","Sæther, Stig Arve/0000-0002-1429-4746; Ovretveit, Karsten/0000-0002-5528-0674",,,,,37,3,3,0,1,"INT SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION, INC",MELVILLE,"150 BROADHOLLOW RD, STE 114, MELVILLE, NY 11747 USA",1643-8698,,,ARCH BUDO,Arch.

As a sub-genre of ecopoetry which aims at dealing with realistic environmental issues and raising readers' awareness to protect the earth, climate change poetry not only represents the ongoing climatic crises in varied ways, be they realistic or imaginative, but also actively engages in provoking ecological responsibilities and environmental activism. This article is an overview of contemporary British and Irish climate change poetry and its literary criticism. Having emerged at the end of the 20th century in the United Kingdom, this poetic genre cuts across literature and environment, rising both as a prominent literary mode and an important environmental phenomenon. Interdisciplinarity, multiple topics, environmental activism, and experimentation are its primary characteristics. Current scholarship on contemporary British and Irish climate change poetry is limited and it mainly adopts theories of ecocriticism and the Anthropocene. Climate justice, poetry and activism, and comparative literary perspective are among promising avenues for the future study of this new poetic genre. Contemporary British and Irish climate change poetry, and its criticism, indicate both poets and critics' efforts to represent and, more importantly, to grapple with ongoing climate change.

This challenge is elevated by population and income growth. Increased climate water stress levels reduce water supplies in many river basins and elevate competition for water among sectors. Organized information is needed to guide river basin managers and stakeholders who must plan for a changing climate through innovative water allocation policies, trade-off analysis, vulnerability assessment, capacity adaptation, and infrastructure planning. Several hydroeconomic models have been developed and applied assessing water use in different sectors, counties, cultures, and time periods. However, none to date has presented an optimization framework by which historical water use and economic benefit patterns can be replicated while presenting capacity to adapt to future climate water stresses to inform the design of policies not yet been implemented. This paper's unique contribution is to address this gap by designing and presenting results of a hydroeconomic model for which optimized base conditions exactly match observed data water use and economic welfare for several urban and agricultural uses at several locations in a large European river basin for which water use supports a population of more than 3.2 million. We develop a state-of-the arts empirical dynamic hydroeconomic optimization model to discover land and water use patterns that optimize sustained farm and city income under various levels of climate-water stress. Findings using innovative model calibration methods allow for the discovery of efficient water allocation plans as well as providing insight into marginal behavioral responses to climate water stress and water policies. Results identify that water trade policy under climate water stress provides more economically efficient water use patterns, reallocating water from lower valued uses to higher valued uses such as urban water. The Ebro River Basin in Spain is used as an example to investigate water use adaptation patterns under various levels of climate water stress. That basin's issues and challenges can be of relevance to other river basins internationally.","[Baccour, Safa] CITA Govt Aragon, Dept Agr & Nat Resource Econ, Zaragoza 50059, Spain; [Ward, Frank A.] New Mex State Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Agr Business, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA; [Albiac, Jose] Univ Zaragoza, Dept Econ Anal, Zaragoza 50005, Spain",University of Zaragoza,"Ward, FA (corresponding author), New Mex State Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Agr Business, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA.",fward@nmsu.edu; maella@unizar.es,"Albiac, Jose/J-8827-2012; Baccour, Safa/GSE-3851-2022","Albiac, Jose/0000-0002-9074-2942; ",Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [RTA 2017-00082-00-00]; European Regional Development Fund; Spanish Ministry,"Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Ministry of Science and Innovation, Spain (MICINN)Spanish Government); European Regional Development Fund(European Commission); Spanish Ministry(Spanish Government)","Acknowledgements This study has been financed by the project RTA 2017-00082-00-00 from the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation, which includes partial funding from the European Regional Development Fund.

There have also been many modeling studies in China on the polar climate system, including weather and sea-ice numerical forecasts to meet the national needs of polar scientific expeditions, assessments of the state-of-the-art coupled model performance, and process-oriented studies. Future model developments and modeling activities will need to address several big scientific questions originating from the polar climate system: i) How will polar ice mass balance evolve and affect global sea level? ii) How can we properly simulate open-ocean deep convection and quantify its role in driving the lower branch of the global overturning circulation? iii) How are Arctic and Antarctic connected and what caused the contrasting sea ice trends in the two polar regions over the last decades? To address these questions, polar climate system modelers will need to analyze extended observational datasets on a global scale and work together with other polar researchers to develop a more comprehensive and sustainable observation system in the polar regions.","[Wang, Zhaomin] Hohai Univ, Coll Oceanog, Nanjing 210098, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Wang, Zhaomin] Hohai Univ, Int Polar Environm Res Lab, Nanjing 210098, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Chen, Dake] MNR, Inst Oceanog 2, State Key Lab Satellite Ocean Environm Dynam, Hangzhou 310012, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Hohai University; Hohai University,"Wang, ZM (corresponding author), Hohai Univ, Coll Oceanog, Nanjing 210098, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.;Wang, ZM (corresponding author), Hohai Univ, Int Polar Environm Res Lab, Nanjing 210098, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",zhaomin.wang@hhu.edu.cn,,,Global Change Research Program of China [2015CB953900]; Major State Basic Research Development Program of China [2016YFA0601804]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41876220]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2017B04814 2017B20714],Global Change Research Program of China; Major State Basic Research Development Program of China(National Basic Research Program of China); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),"We would like to thank Dr Chengyan Liu, Dr Yang Wu, Mr Rui Bian, Ms Mingyi Gu, Ms Qing Qin and Ms Jiangchao Qian for their assistance during the preparation of this manuscript.

Air pollution is closely linked to CC. However, many CC-health-related conditions (i.e., allergic diseases, asthma, hypertension, fluid and electrolyte disorders, child and adult obesity, type 2 diabetes, vector-borne diseases) are not usually counted, either because they do not cause death or require hospital admission/emergency triage. They are the vast majority of health care seeking generally treated by family doctors (FDs) and family pediatricians (FPs). FDs/FPs are often not aware of CC-health-impacts. Their potential role in tackling such a global challenge through their local influence on individual and collective attitudes and policies is not considered. Proper FD training could fill these gaps, raise awareness of their role, and implement EH FDs/FPs-based surveillance networks to collect, analyze, interpret, and report EH data to inform EH-related Policy.

Current climate change projections are deeply uncertain. This uncertainty stems from several factors, including parametric and structural uncertainties. One common approach to characterize and, if possible, reduce these uncertainties is to confront (calibrate in a broad sense) the models with historical observations. Here, we analyze the problem of combining multiple climate models using Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) to derive future projections and quantify uncertainty estimates of spatiotemporally resolved temperature hindcasts and projections. One advantage of the BMA approach is that it allows the assessment of the predictive skill of a model using the training data, which can help identify the better models and discard poor models. Previous BMA approaches have broken important new ground, but often neglected space-time dependencies and/or imposed prohibitive computational demands. Here we improve on the current state-of-the-art by incorporating space-time dependence while using historical data to estimate model weights. We achieve computational efficiency using a kernel mixing approach for representing a space-time process. One key advantage of our new approach is that it enables us to incorporate multiple sources of uncertainty and biases, while remaining computationally tractable for large data sets. We introduce and apply our approach using BMA to an ensemble of Global Circulation Model output from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report of surface temperature on a grid of space-time locations.","[Bhat, K.

This working hypothesis is elaborated in the paper based on the case study of the city of Krakow in the Southern Poland. The aim of the paper is to identify the synergies and trade-offs from the climate mitigation and adaptation efforts planned within the climate, water and development sectors in Krakow. The scoping study of the policies and strategic documents was performed with that respect and the state-of-the-art literature was studied to capture the latest advancements in the climate mitigation and adaptation integration studies in order to develop the research method. The applied method was validated as relevant for integration of these aspects with the focus on the cities. The results show the landscape of the planned strategic actions towards mitigation and adaptation to climate change as well as synergies and trade-offs between the two.

In the first set of experiments, the thermal conductivity of snow at each grid cell is set to that of the underlying soil (SC-SOIL), effectively eliminating any insulation effect. This scenario is compared against a control run (CTRL), where snow thermal conductivity is determined as a prognostic function of snow density. In the second set of experiments, high (SC-HI) and low (SC-LO) thermal conductivity values for snow are prescribed, based on upper and lower observed limits. These two scenarios are used to envelop model sensitivity to the range of realistic observed thermal conductivities. In both sets of experiments, the high conductivity/low insulation cases show increased heat exchange, with anomalous heat fluxes from the soil to the atmosphere during the winter and from the atmosphere to the soil during the summer. The increase in surface heat exchange leads to soil cooling of up to 20 K in the winter, anomalies that persist (though damped) into the summer season. The heat exchange also drives an asymmetric seasonal response in near-surface air temperatures, with boreal winter anomalies of +6 K and boreal summer anomalies of -2 K. On an annual basis there is a net loss of heat from the soil and increases in ground ice, leading to reductions in infiltration, evapotranspiration, and photosynthesis. Our results show land surface processes and the surface climate within CAM3-CLM3 are sensitive to the treatment of snow thermal conductivity.","[Cook, Benjamin I.] Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Geol Observ, Palisades, NY 10964 USA; [Cook, Benjamin I.] NASA, Goddard Inst Space Studies, New York, NY 10025 USA; [Bonan, Gordon B.; Levis, Samuel] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [Epstein, Howard E.] Univ Virginia, Dept Environm Sci, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA",Columbia University; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; University of Virginia,"Cook, BI (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Geol Observ, 61 Route 9W,POB 1000, Palisades, NY 10964 USA.",bc9z@ldeo.columbia.edu,"Cook, Benjamin I/H-2265-2012",,,,,,64,22,22,1,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0930-7575,1432-0894,,CLIM DYNAM,Clim.

Its founder Professor William Nordhaus was recently awarded Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel due to his pioneering work on the economics of climate change. In a recent paper in American Economic Journal: Economic Policy, Nordhaus uses the model to conclude that a 2.5 degrees C target is almost out of reach. In this paper, we update DICE 2016 R2 with state-of-the-art models of the carbon cycle, heat uptake into the oceans, and the role of non-CO2 forcers. We find that the allowable remaining carbon budget (over the period 2015-2100) to meet a 2.5 degrees C target to be 2,360 GtCO(2) whereas the estimate obtained using DICE 2016 R2 is about 460 GtCO(2). Nordhaus's estimate of the remaining carbon budget for this target is hence five times lower than estimates made by our updated DICE. We also compare our results with estimates by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and find our results to be in line with the carbon budgets presented in IPCC SR 1.5. We explain the reasons behind the difference between our result and that of Nordhaus and propose that an updated climate module in DICE is warranted.","[Azar, Christian; Johansson, Daniel J.

By combining state-of-the-art multi-decadal meteorological records with a parsimonious representation of a power system, this study characterises the impact of year-to-year climate variability on multiple aspects of the power system of Great Britain (including coal, gas and nuclear generation), demonstrating why multi-decadal approaches are necessary. All aspects of the example system are impacted by inter-annual climate variability, with the impacts being most pronounced for baseload generation. The impacts of inter-annual climate variability increase in a 2025 wind-power scenario, with a 4-fold increase in the inter-annual range of operating hours for baseload such as nuclear. The impacts on peak load and peaking-plant are comparably small. Less than 10 years of power supply and demand data are shown to be insufficient for providing robust power system planning guidance. This suggests renewable integration studies-widely used in policy, investment and system design-should adopt a more robust approach to climate characterisation.","[Bloomfield, H. C.; Brayshaw, D.

The position of this jet is variable and shows for the present-day winter climate three preferred latitudinal states: a northern, central, and southern position in the NA. Here, the authors analyze the behavior of the eddy-driven jet under different glacial and interglacial boundary conditions using atmosphere-land-only simulations with the CCSM4 climate model. As state-of-the-art climate models tend to underestimate the trimodality of the jet latitude, the authors apply a bias correction and successfully extract the trimodal behavior of the jet within CCSM4. The analysis shows that during interglacial times (i.e., the early Holocene and the Eemian) the preferred jet positions are rather stable and the observed multimodality is the typical interglacial character of the jet. During glacial times, the jet is strongly enhanced, its position is shifted southward, and the trimodal behavior vanishes. This is mainly due to the presence of the Laurentide ice sheet (LIS). The LIS enhances stationary waves downstream, thereby accelerating and displacing the NA eddy-driven jet by anomalous stationary momentum flux convergence. Additionally, changes in the transient eddy activity caused by topography changes as well as other glacial boundary conditions lead to an acceleration of the westerly winds over the southern NA at the expense of more northern areas. Consequently, both stationary and transient eddies foster the southward shift of the NA eddy-driven jet during glacial winter times.","[Merz, Niklaus; Raible, Christoph C.] Univ Bern, Climate & Environm Phys, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Merz, Niklaus; Raible, Christoph C.] Univ Bern, Oeschger Ctr Climate Change Res, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Woollings, Tim] Univ Oxford, Clarendon Lab, Atmospher Phys, Oxford OX1 3PU, England",University of Bern; University of Bern; University of Oxford,"Merz, N (corresponding author), Univ Bern, Climate & Environm Phys, Inst Phys, Sidlerstr 5, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland.",merz@climate.unibe.ch,"Raible, Christoph/M-8309-2016","Raible, Christoph/0000-0003-0176-0602; Woollings, Tim/0000-0002-5815-9079",European Union [243908]; Swiss Federal Nuclear Safety Inspectorate (ENSI),European Union(European Commission); Swiss Federal Nuclear Safety Inspectorate (ENSI),"We kindly thank Andreas Born, Vidya Varma, Matthias Prange, and Alex Robinson for providing data.

We discuss one artwork, an experimental collaboration between artists and scientists, entitled Reefs on the Edge, which communicates valuable information about climate change to a general audience.","[Wu, Ge] Univ Sydney, Interact Design & Elect Arts, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Gough, Phillip] Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Wall, Caitilin de Berigny] Univ Canberra, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Gough, Phillip] Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of Sydney; University of Sydney; University of Canberra; University of Sydney,"Wu, G (corresponding author), Unit 166,90 Bonar St, Wolli Creek, NSW 2205, Australia.",gewu8614@uni.sydney.edu.au; pgou6397@uni.sydney.edu.au; dr.onaclov@sydney.edu.au,"Gough, Phillip/AAR-2442-2021; de Bérigny, Caitilin/AAS-8878-2021","Gough, Phillip/0000-0003-3687-6365; de Bérigny, Caitilin/0000-0001-8789-389X",,,,,23,0,0,0,0,INTELLECT LTD,BRISTOL,"THE MILL, PARNALL RD, BRISTOL, BS16 3JG, ENGLAND",1477-965X,1758-9533,,TECHNOETIC ARTS,Technoetic Arts,DEC,2012,3-Feb,,,,329,339,,10.1386/tear.10.2-3.329_1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1386/tear.10.2-3.329_1,,,11,"Humanities, Multidisciplinary",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Arts & Humanities - Other Topics,VB6WR,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000416688300025,View Full Record in Web of Science

The agriculture sector is one of the most vulnerable sectors with implications for smallholder farmers in semi-arid regions of Africa in terms of poverty and food security. Several researches have been carried out on perception and adaptation with a little investigation to unpack the gender differences and how this influence adaptation strategies. This research investigates gender difference and gender-specific adaptation strategies to climate change and variability. A household survey was conducted from August to December 2014 using a pre-tested questionnaire where 150 males and 150 female farmers were randomly sampled from 14 communities within the Bolgatanga Municipality and Bongo district. Results show the existence of gender differences in the adaptation strategies. Both gender groups perceived climatic change and variability but only 49% male and 40% female headed household (HH) have adopted strategies to cope with increasing temperatures while 56% male and 49% female have adapted to decreasing precipitation. On the other hand, 62% male and 60% female HH have adapted to increasing drought spells. The main differences between male and female adaptation strategies are that males prefer to migrate and seek employment in other parts of the country whereas females prefer to engage in off-farm jobs such as trading, basketry and shea-butter processing. The age of farmers, access to extension services, credit, perceived loss of soil fertility, among other factors influenced farmers adaptation strategies. Policy decisions to promote adaptation to climate change and variability should take these factors into consideration.","[Mensah, Michael] Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Architecture, Coll Art & Built Environm, Kumasi, Ghana; [Mensah, Michael; Vlek, Paul L.

Through a mixed-methods approach involving key-actors from EIA practice, decision making and climate adaptation planning, this study presents a transdisciplinary point of view on barriers and opportunities to tackle climate change adaptation in the environmental assessment of large-scale projects. It is based on both a retrospective ex-post evaluation of existing practices in Austria and Germany as well as prescriptive examination and development of outcomes for practice through the development of a climate-fit toolkit that supports the incorporation of climate change impacts into EIAs. The scenario analysis applied with a backcasting approach provided the opportunity to look beyond limitations related to legal compliance and partly lack of data identified by previous research. Three scenario narratives were elaborated based on nine key impact factors based on literature review, content analysis of EIA documents and interviews with EIA actors. The groups of actors carried out a prioritization of actions towards consideration of climate change in EIA.

In addition, many health issues can be traced back to bad indoor room-climate. However, especially in Europe, pupils spend a majority of their learning life in school classes affected by poor room climate. Without an automatic heating, ventilation and air conditioning system these pupils and their teachers have to rely on manual ventilation by opening windows. Thereby, they often lack fundamental room climate quality information to effectively guide their behavior. Information systems (IS) and sensor technology can be a remedy to these challenges. Existing room climate monitoring systems regularly reveal major shortcomings, e.g. in respect to user interfaces, presentation of data, and systematic engagement. We want to address the aforementioned shortcomings and present an art IS, which reflects room conditions in real time through modifications of depicted art. The artifact is evaluated in a field experiment, conducted in an Austrian grammar school. The evaluation reveals that room climate measured in CO2 can indeed be improved significantly. In addition, pupils also perceive a significant room climate improvement.","[Rigger, Paul; Wortmann, Felix; Dahlinger, Andre] Univ St Gallen, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland",University of St Gallen,"Rigger, P (corresponding author), Univ St Gallen, Dufourstr 40, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland.",paul.rigger@unisg.ch; felix.wortmann@unisg.ch; andre.dahlinger@unisg.ch,,,,,,,49,2,2,0,4,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",0302-9743,1611-3349,978-3-319-18714-3; 978-3-319-18713-6,LECT NOTES COMPUT SC,,,2015,,,,,71,86,,10.1007/978-3-319-18714-3_5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-18714-3_5,,,16,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Software Engineering; Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BD6BB,,Green Submitted,,,12/21/22,WOS:000361977600005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Within the EURO-CORDEX project, several state-of-the art models, including non-hydrostatic meso-scale models, were run for an extended time period (20 years) at high resolution (12 km), over a large domain allowing for the first time the simultaneous representation of atmospheric phenomena over a large range of spatial scales. Eight models were run in this configuration, and thirteen models were run at a classical resolution of 50 km. The models were driven with the same boundary conditions, the ERA-Interim re-analysis, and except for one simulation, no observations were assimilated in the inner domain. Results, which are compared with daily temperature and precipitation observations (ECA&D and E-OBS data sets) show that, even forced by the same re-analysis, the ensemble exhibits a large spread. A preliminary analysis of the sources of spread, using in particular simulations of the same model with different parameterizations, shows that the simulation of hot temperature is primarily sensitive to the convection and the microphysics schemes, which affect incoming energy and the Bowen ratio. Further, most models exhibit an overestimation of summertime temperature extremes in Mediterranean regions and an underestimation over Scandinavia. Even after bias removal, the simulated heat wave events were found to be too persistent, but a higher resolution reduced this deficiency. The amplitude of events as well as the variability beyond the 90th percentile threshold were found to be too strong in almost all simulations and increasing resolution did not generally improve this deficiency. Resolution increase was also shown to induce large-scale 90th percentile warming or cooling for some models, with beneficial or detrimental effects on the overall biases. Even though full causality cannot be established on the basis of this evaluation work, the drivers of such regional differences were shown to be linked to changes in precipitation due to resolution changes, affecting the energy partitioning. Finally, the inter-annual sequence of hot summers over central/southern Europe was found to be fairly well simulated in most experiments despite an overestimation of the number of hot days and of the variability. The accurate simulation of inter-annual variability for a few models is independent of the model bias. This indicates that internal variability of high summer temperatures should not play a major role in controlling inter-annual variability. Despite some improvements, especially along coastlines, the analyses conducted here did not allow us to generally conclude that a higher resolution is clearly beneficial for a correct representation of heat waves by regional climate models. Even though local-scale feedbacks should be better represented at high resolution, combinations of parameterizations have to be improved or adapted accordingly.","[Vautard, Robert; Yiou, Pascal] UVSQ, CNRS, CEA, Lab Sci Climat & Environm,IPSL, Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Gobiet, Andreas; Suklitsch, Martin] Graz Univ, Wegener Ctr Climate & Global Change, Graz, Austria; [Gobiet, Andreas; Suklitsch, Martin] Graz Univ, Inst Geophys Astrophys & Meteorol, Graz, Austria; [Jacob, Daniela] Climate Serv Ctr, Hamburg, Germany; [Belda, Michal; Halenka, Tomas] Charles Univ Prague, Dept Meteorol & Environm Protect, Prague, Czech Republic; [Colette, Augustin] Inst Natl Environm Ind & Risques INERIS, Verneuil En Halatte, France; [Deque, Michel] CNRS, GAME, CNRM, Meteo France, Toulouse, France; [Fernandez, Jesus] Univ Cantabria, Dept Appl Math & Comp Sci, E-39005 Santander, Spain; [Garcia-Diez, Markel] UC, CSIC, Inst Fis Cantabria, Santander, Spain; [Goergen, Klaus] Ctr Rech Publ Gabriel Lippmann, Belvaux, Luxembourg; [Guettler, Ivan; Patarcic, Mirta] Croatian Meteorol & Hydrol Serv DHMZ, Zagreb, Croatia; [Karacostas, Theodore; Katragkou, Eleni] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Sch Geol, Dept Meteorol & Climatol, Thessaloniki 54124, Greece; [Keuler, Klaus] Univ Technol BTU Cottbus, Chair Environm Meteorol, Cottbus, Germany; [Kotlarski, Sven] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, Zurich, Switzerland; [Mayer, Stephanie; Sobolowski, Stefan] Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, Uni Res, Bergen, Norway; [van Meijgaard, Erik] Royal Netherlands Meteorol Inst KNMI, De Bilt, Netherlands; [Nikulin, Grigory] Swedish Meteorol & Hydrol Inst, S-60176 Norrkoping, Sweden; [Scinocca, John] Environm Canada, Canadian Ctr Climate Modelling & Anal, Victoria, BC, Canada; [Teichmann, Claas] Max Planck Inst Meteorol, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany; [Warrach-Sagi, Kirsten; Wulfmeyer, Volker] Univ Hohenheim, Inst Phys & Meteorol, Stuttgart, Germany",UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Cite; Universite Paris Saclay; CEA; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); University of Graz; University of Graz; Charles University Prague; Institut National de l'Environnement Industriel et des Risques (INERIS); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universidad de Cantabria; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); Universidad de Cantabria; CSIC - Instituto de Fisica de Cantabria (IFCA); Luxembourg Institute of Science & Technology; Aristotle University of Thessaloniki; Brandenburg University of Technology Cottbus; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research; Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute; Swedish Meteorological & Hydrological Institute; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling & Analysis (CCCma); Max Planck Society; University Hohenheim,"Vautard, R (corresponding author), UVSQ, CNRS, CEA, Lab Sci Climat & Environm,IPSL, Gif Sur Yvette, France.",Robert.Vautard@lsce.ipsl.fr,"Gobiet, Andreas/AAX-2537-2020; Belda, Michal/F-4398-2012; Vautard, Robert/ABF-9489-2020; Teichmann, Claas/J-1149-2014; Goergen, Klaus/A-4655-2017; Gobiet, Andreas/AAF-6039-2020; Fernández, Jesús/F-5189-2011; Garcia-Diez, Markel/N-5917-2014","Belda, Michal/0000-0002-9514-4888; Teichmann, Claas/0000-0003-2478-7074; Goergen, Klaus/0000-0002-4208-3444; Gobiet, Andreas/0000-0001-5751-2961; Fernández, Jesús/0000-0002-3483-0008; Garcia-Diez, Markel/0000-0002-4760-0527; Sobolowski, Stefan/0000-0002-6422-4535; Katragkou, Eleni/0000-0003-0863-3411; Warrach-Sagi, Kirsten/0000-0003-2572-8527","Luxembourg National Research Fund (FNR) through Grant FNR [C09/SR/16]; Spanish R D program [CGL2010-21869, CGL2010-22158-C02-01]; GACR [P209/11/2405]; German Science Foundation (DFG) [FOR 1695]; European Union [265240]; Croatian Ministry of Science, Education and Sports [004-1193086-3035]; Research Committee of AUTH","Luxembourg National Research Fund (FNR) through Grant FNR(Luxembourg National Research Fund); Spanish R D program; GACR(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic); German Science Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); European Union(European Commission); Croatian Ministry of Science, Education and Sports(Ministry of Science, Education and Sports, Republic of Croatia); Research Committee of AUTH","The EURO-CORDEX simulations and analysis were carried out in several groups within the framework of the IMPACT2C FP7 project (Grant FP7-ENV. 2011.1.1.6-1).

Consequently, improved efficiency of climate control systems can significantly reduce the energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. In particular, by leveraging intermittent or continuous sources of waste heat and solar energy, thermally-driven energy storage systems for climate control can play a crucial role. We demonstrate the concept of a thermophysical battery, which operates by storing thermal energy and subsequently releasing it to provide heating and cooling on demand. Taking advantage of the adsorption-desorption and evaporation-condensation mechanisms, the thermophysical battery can be a high-power density and rechargeable energy storage system. We investigated the thermophysical battery in detail to identify critical parameters governing its overall performance. A detailed computational analysis was used to predict its cyclic performance when exposed to different operating conditions and thermodynamic cycles. In addition, an experimental test bed was constructed using a contemporary adsorptive material, NaX-zeolite, to demonstrate this concept and deliver average heating and cooling powers of 900 W and 650 W, respectively. The maximum power densities and specific powers observed were 103 W/I and 65 W/kg for heating, and 78 W/I and 49 W/kg for cooling, respectively, making the thermophysical battery competitive with the stateof-the-art climate control systems that provide relatively lower power densities. Additionally, with further opportunities for development and innovation, especially in synthesizing novel adsorptive materials, the thermophysical battery can achieve significantly higher power densities. With its ability to function using thermal energy input while being compact and lightweight, the thermophysical battery offers an option to address the energy challenges associated with the rising demand for climate control.

This is a major challenge for existing community models that represent very large code bases written in Fortran. We introduce the CLAW domain-specific language (CLAW DSL) and the CLAW Compiler that allows the retention of a single code written in Fortran and achieve a high degree of performance portability. Specifically, we present the Single Column Abstraction (SCA) of the CLAW DSL that is targeted at the column-based algorithmic motifs typically encountered in the physical parameterizations of weather and climate models. Starting from a serial and non-optimized source code, the CLAW Compiler applies transformations and optimizations for a specific target hardware architecture and generates parallel optimized Fortran code annotated with OpenMP or OpenACC directives. Results from a state-of-the-art radiative transfer code, indicate that using CLAW, the amount of source code can be significantly reduced while achieving efficient code for x86 multi-core CPUs and GPU accelerators. The CLAW DSL is a significant step towards performance portable climate and weather model and could be adopted incrementally in existing code with limited effort.","[Clement, Valentin; Rood, Jon] Ctr Climate Syst Modeling, Zurich, Switzerland; [Ferrachat, Sylvaine] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Zurich, Switzerland; [Fuhrer, Oliver; Lapillonne, Xavier; Osuna, Carlos E.] MeteoSwiss, Fed Off Meteorol & Climatol, Zurich, Switzerland; [Pincus, Robert] Univ Colorado, NOAA Earth Syst Res Lab, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Sawyer, William] Swiss Natl Supercomp Ctr CSCS, Lugano, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Federal Office of Meteorology & Climatology (MeteoSwiss); National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Clement, V (corresponding author), Ctr Climate Syst Modeling, Zurich, Switzerland.",valentin.clement@env.ethz.ch; sylvaine.ferrachat@env.ethz.ch; oliver.fuhrer@meteoswiss.ch; xavier.lapillonne@meteoswiss.ch; carlos.osuna@meteoswiss.ch; robert.pincus@colorado.edu; jon.rood@nrel.gov; wsawyer@cscs.ch,,"Pincus, Robert/0000-0002-0016-3470; Lapillonne, Xavier/0000-0001-6114-4321",Swiss National Supercomputing Centre (CSCS) [c15]; ETH Zurich; PASC Initiative under the ENIAC project; OMNI Compiler Team at RIKEN CCS,Swiss National Supercomputing Centre (CSCS); ETH Zurich(ETH Zurich); PASC Initiative under the ENIAC project; OMNI Compiler Team at RIKEN CCS,This work was supported by a grant from the Swiss National Supercomputing Centre (CSCS) under project ID c15.

These constituents have received relatively little attention because their contribution to the slow climatic manifold is controversial in comparison to that of the large heat capacity of the oceans. Furthermore, their initialization as well as their representation in state-of-the-art climate models remains a challenge. Numerous extraoceanic processes that could be active over the decadal range are proposed. Potential predictability associated with the aforementioned, poorly represented, and scarcely observed constituents of the climate system has been primarily inspected through numerical simulations performed under idealized experimental settings. The impact, however, on practical decadal predictions, conducted with realistically initialized full-fledged climate models, is still largely unexploited. Enhancing initial-value predictability through an improved model initialization appears to be a viable option for land surface, sea ice, and, marginally, the stratosphere. Similarly, capturing future aerosol emission storylines might lead to an improved representation of both global and regional short-term climatic changes. In addition to these factors, a key role on the overall predictive ability of ESMs is expected to be played by an accurate representation of processes associated with specific components of the climate system. These act as signal carriers, transferring across the climatic phase space the information associated with the initial state and boundary forcings, and dynamically bridging different (otherwise unconnected) subsystems. Through this mechanism, Earth system components trigger low-frequency variability modes, thus extending the predictability beyond the seasonal scale.","[Bellucci, A.; Materia, S.] Ctr Euromediterraneo Cambiamenti Climat, Bologna, Italy; [Haarsma, R.; van den Hurk, B.; Weiss, M.] Royal Netherlands Meteorol Inst, NL-3730 AE De Bilt, Netherlands; [Bellouin, N.] Univ Reading, Dept Meteorol, Reading, Berks, England; [Booth, B.] Met Off Hadley Ctr, Exeter, Devon, England; [Cagnazzo, C.] CNR, Ist Sci Atmosfera & Clima, Rome, Italy; [Keenlyside, N.] Univ Bergen, Geophys Inst, Bergen, Norway; [Koenigk, T.] Swedish Meteorol & Hydrol Inst, S-60176 Norrkoping, Sweden; [Massonnet, F.] Catholic Univ Louvain, Louvain La Neuve, Belgium",Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute; University of Reading; Met Office - UK; Hadley Centre; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Scienze dell'Atmosfera e del Clima (ISAC-CNR); University of Bergen; Swedish Meteorological & Hydrological Institute; Universite Catholique Louvain,"Bellucci, A (corresponding author), Ctr Euromediterraneo Cambiamenti Climat, Bologna, Italy.",alessio.bellucci@cmcc.it,"Keenlyside, Noel S/E-8303-2013; Kushnir, Yochanan/B-4472-2013; van den Hurk, Bart/ABI-1654-2020; Massonnet, Francois/J-5315-2014","Keenlyside, Noel S/0000-0002-8708-6868; van den Hurk, Bart/0000-0003-3726-7086; Massonnet, Francois/0000-0002-4697-5781; BELLUCCI, Alessio/0000-0003-3766-1921; MATERIA, Stefano/0000-0001-5635-2847; Haarsma, Rein/0000-0001-7171-2687; Bellouin, Nicolas/0000-0003-2109-9559; cagnazzo, chiara/0000-0002-2054-0448","Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research; Ministry for Environment, Land and Sea","Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR)); Ministry for Environment, Land and Sea","Data supporting Figure 2 are available at National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC), Fetterer et al.

Climate change is expected to have heterogeneous effects across locations globally, and the diversity of land uses characterising Great Britain (GB) presents a unique opportunity to test methods for assessing climate change effects and impacts. GB is a relatively cool and damp country, hence, the warmer and generally drier growing season conditions projected for the future are expected to increase arable production. Here we use state-of-the-art, kilometre-scale climate change scenarios to drive a land surface model (JULES; Joint UK Land Environment Simulator) and an ECOnometric AGricultural land use model (ECO-AG). Under unmitigated climate change, by the end of the century, the growing season in GB is projected to get >5 degrees C warmer and 140 mm drier on average. Rising levels of atmospheric CO2 are predicted to counteract the generally negative impacts of climate change on vegetation productivity in JULES. Given sufficient precipitation, warming favours higher value arable production over grassland agriculture, causing a predicted westward expansion of arable farming in ECO-AG. However, drying in the East and Southeast, without any CO2 fertilisation effect, is severe enough to cause a predicted reversion from arable to grassland farming. Irrigation, if implemented, could maintain this land in arable production. However, the predicted irrigation demand of similar to 200 mm (per growing season) in many locations is comparable to annual predicted runoff, potentially demanding large-scale redistribution of water between seasons and/or across the country. The strength of the CO2 fertilisation effect emerges as a crucial uncertainty in projecting the impact of climate change on GB vegetation, especially farming land-use decisions.","[Ritchie, Paul D.

First, to give a concise account of the current global climate situation, its previous history according to the palaeoclimate record, and climate scientists' predictions of the consequences of various scenarios of global climate change. Then to explain why so many people continue to be oblivious to the enormous risks of continuing with business as usual. Methodology/approach - The approach is through a comprehensive study of the relevant evidence and the scientific and scholarly literature, interwoven with philosophical reflections on their significance. Findings - The findings are as follows: the evidence for the anthropogenic nature of global warming is overwhelming, and the prognoses for continued burning of fossil fuels (sea level rise, extreme weather, etc.) are dire. The denial stems in large part from the undue influence of climate scepticism movements, lavishly funded by the fossil fuel industries, combined with a variety of psycho-social and economic factors. Social implications - The implications are several. Given the complex nature of global warming, scientists need to do a better job of communicating their findings to the general public, and scholars and academics need to find ways to expose the machinations of the fossil fuel industries. And given the global impact of climate change, citizens of the developed nations need to see that a radical change in their behaviour is demanded not only by considerations of social justice but also even by their own self-interest. Originality value - The value of this philosophical approach is that it affords a more comprehensive view of the situation around global warming than we get from the more specialised disciplines.","Natl Univ Ireland Univ Coll Cork, Cork, Ireland",University College Cork,"Parkes, G (corresponding author), Natl Univ Ireland Univ Coll Cork, Cork, Ireland.",,,,,,,,65,3,3,0,8,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY, W YORKSHIRE BD16 1WA, ENGLAND",2051-5030,,978-1-78350-137-3; 978-1-78350-136-6,ADV SUSTAIN ENV JUST,,,2013,,,,,51,80,,10.1108/S2051-5030(2013)0000013007,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/S2051-5030(2013)0000013007,,,30,Environmental Studies,Book Citation Index – Social Sciences & Humanities (BKCI-SSH),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BD2BC,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000358644800004,View Full Record in Web of Science

As more art/science initiatives develop in academia, art students are gaining access to difficult scientific research sites and using the experience to fuel creative strategies. The methodology for offering a course that taps these into possibilities for the teaching of creativity remains little explored. Through a case study at the School of Creative Media in Hong Kong, this article examines how student expeditions that work adjacent to environmental scientists in extreme environments can be used for the teaching of creativity and artistic process as well as informing a larger public on climate issues. The structure of the program with detailed descriptions of sequenced proficiencies is presented. Both pedagogical philosophy and logistic issues will be discussed through the set-up and organizational structure of the course, the variety of teaching materials, assignments, dissemination and finally the exhibition and impact of the students' work. Using scientific resources with the goal of artistic interpretation, the pedagogy is designed to respond to the emerging potential of digital technologies in creative media. The results, both for the students and the public, demonstrate multimodal approaches that offer broader possibilities for learning and outreach that are both scalable and transferable.","[Hessels, Scott] City Univ Hong Kong, Sch Creat Media, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Shine, Laura] Concordia Univ, 1455 Blvd Maisonneuve O, Montreal, PQ H3G 1M8, Canada",City University of Hong Kong; Concordia University - Canada,"Shine, L (corresponding author), Concordia Univ, 1455 Blvd Maisonneuve O, Montreal, PQ H3G 1M8, Canada.",laura.r.shine@gmail.com,,"HESSELS, Derwin Scott/0000-0002-2235-6724; Shine, Laura/0000-0001-6033-4246",,,,,14,0,0,5,7,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0539-0184,1461-7412,,SOC SCI INFORM,Soc.

So far, only a few studies(2,3) have projected changes in floods on a global scale. None of these studies relied on multiple climate models. A few global studies(4,5) have started to estimate the exposure to flooding (population in potential inundation areas) as a proxy of risk, but none of them has estimated it in a warmer future climate. Here we present global flood risk for the end of this century based on the outputs of 11 climate models. A state-of-the-art global river routing model with an inundation scheme(6) was employed to compute river discharge and inundation area. An ensemble of projections under a new high-concentration scenario(7) demonstrates a large increase in flood frequency in Southeast Asia, Peninsular India, eastern Africa and the northern half of the Andes, with small uncertainty in the direction of change. In certain areas of the world, however, flood frequency is projected to decrease. Another larger ensemble of projections under four new concentration scenarios(7) reveals that the global exposure to floods would increase depending on the degree of warming, but interannual variability of the exposure may imply the necessity of adaptation before significant warming.","[Hirabayashi, Yukiko; Mahendran, Roobavannan; Koirala, Sujan; Konoshima, Lisako; Watanabe, Satoshi] Univ Tokyo, Inst Engn Innovat, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138656, Japan; [Yamazaki, Dai] Univ Bristol, Sch Geog Sci, Bristol BS8 1SS, Avon, England; [Kim, Hyungjun] Univ Tokyo, Inst Ind Sci, Meguro Ku, Tokyo 1538505, Japan; [Kanae, Shinjiro] Tokyo Inst Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Meguro Ku, Tokyo 1528552, Japan",University of Tokyo; University of Bristol; University of Tokyo; Tokyo Institute of Technology,"Hirabayashi, Y (corresponding author), Univ Tokyo, Inst Engn Innovat, Bunkyo Ku, 2-11-16 Yayoi, Tokyo 1138656, Japan.",hyukiko@sogo.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp; kanae@cv.titech.ac.jp,"Hirabayashi, Yukiko/E-5628-2010; KIM, HYUNGJUN/I-5099-2014; Kanae, Shinjiro/E-5606-2010; Yamazaki, Dai/J-3029-2012; Watanabe, Satoshi/AAR-3380-2020","Hirabayashi, Yukiko/0000-0001-5693-197X; KIM, HYUNGJUN/0000-0003-1083-8416; Kanae, Shinjiro/0000-0002-3176-4957; Yamazaki, Dai/0000-0002-6478-1841; Watanabe, Satoshi/0000-0001-5601-7854","Funding Program for Next-Generation World-Leading Researchers; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; CREST of Japan Science and Technology Agency; Environmental Research and Technology Development Fund of the Ministry of the Environment, Japan [S-10]","Funding Program for Next-Generation World-Leading Researchers(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); CREST of Japan Science and Technology Agency(Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology (CREST)); Environmental Research and Technology Development Fund of the Ministry of the Environment, Japan","This paper was financially supported by the Funding Program for Next-Generation World-Leading Researchers, Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, CREST of Japan Science and Technology Agency, and the Environmental Research and Technology Development Fund (S-10, ICA-RUS) of the Ministry of the Environment, Japan.

Initially, climate change scenarios were coupled with state-of-the-art hurricane genesis, wind field, and tracking models to examine possible changes in hurricane intensity (maximum wind speed) and hurricane size (radius to maximum winds). A number of different postulated climate change models (IPCC scenarios) were considered. Each scenario suggested changes in sea surface temperature (SST), which is the driving parameter in most modern hurricane models. The evolution of hurricane genesis frequency was then considered both independently and jointly with hurricane intensification. State-of-the-art probabilistic event modeling and simulation techniques were used to generate 10,000 years of hurricane events under the 2005 and future climate conditions. The annual maximum wind speed distribution and the joint distribution of maximum wind speed and storm size, under 2005 and future climate scenarios, are then compared. Finally, the evolution of hurricane tracks was examined in an effort to establish a trend over time.

However, disease transmission involves complex nonlinear interactions between climate and population dynamics, which makes detecting climate drivers at the population level challenging. By analysing incidence data, estimated susceptible population size, and climate data with methods based on nonlinear time series analysis (collectively referred to as empirical dynamic modelling), we identified drivers and their interactive effects on dengue dynamics in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Climatic forcing arose only when susceptible availability was high: temperature and rainfall had net positive and negative effects respectively. By capturing mechanistic, nonlinear and context-dependent effects of population susceptibility, temperature and rainfall on dengue transmission empirically, our model improves forecast skill over recent, state-of-the-art models for dengue incidence. Together, these results provide empirical evidence that the interdependence of host population susceptibility and climate drives dengue dynamics in a nonlinear and complex, yet predictable way.","[Nova, Nicole; Shocket, Marta S.; MacDonald, Andrew J.; Mordecai, Erin A.] Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Deyle, Ethan R.; Sugihara, George] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Deyle, Ethan R.] Boston Univ, Dept Biol, 5 Cummington St, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Shocket, Marta S.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA USA; [MacDonald, Andrew J.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Earth Res Inst, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [MacDonald, Andrew J.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Bren Sch Environm Sci & Management, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Childs, Marissa L.] Stanford Univ, Emmett Interdisciplinary Program Environm & Resou, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Rypdal, Martin] UiT Arctic Univ Norway, Dept Math & Stat, Tromso, Norway",Stanford University; University of California System; University of California San Diego; Scripps Institution of Oceanography; Boston University; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; Stanford University; UiT The Arctic University of Tromso,"Nova, N (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",nicole.nova@stanford.edu,"Nova, Nicole/AAE-8030-2020; Deyle, Ethan R/AAR-8749-2021","Nova, Nicole/0000-0001-8585-1215; MacDonald, Andrew/0000-0003-0172-7749; Rypdal, Martin/0000-0003-0053-665X; Shocket, Marta/0000-0002-8995-4446; Childs, Marissa/0000-0002-8597-2161; Mordecai, Erin/0000-0002-4402-5547","Bing Fellowship in Honor of Paul Ehrlich; Stanford Data Science Scholars program; National Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1655203, DBI-1667584]; DoD-Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program [15 RC-2509]; Lenfest Foundation [00028335]; McQuown Chair in Natural Sciences, University of California San Diego; NSF [DEB-1518681, DBI-1611767, RAPID DEB-1640780, DEB-2011147]; Lindsay Family E-IPER Fellowship; Illich-Sadowsky Interdisciplinary Graduate Fellowship; National Institutes of Health (NIH) [R35GM133439]; Hellman Faculty Fellowship; Terman Fellowship; Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment Environmental Ventures Program; King Center for Global Development seed grant at Stanford University","Bing Fellowship in Honor of Paul Ehrlich; Stanford Data Science Scholars program; National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)National Research Foundation of Korea); DoD-Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program; Lenfest Foundation; McQuown Chair in Natural Sciences, University of California San Diego; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Lindsay Family E-IPER Fellowship; Illich-Sadowsky Interdisciplinary Graduate Fellowship; National Institutes of Health (NIH)(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Hellman Faculty Fellowship; Terman Fellowship; Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment Environmental Ventures Program; King Center for Global Development seed grant at Stanford University","We thank Giulio De Leo, Marcus Feldman, Tadashi Fukami and Dmitri Petrov for helpful feedback.

We conclude that public policies aimed at preventing climate catastrophes must take into account patterns of sentiment spreading, allowing for the potential economic benefits of mitigation of environmental change-related impacts.","[Gubareva, Mariya; Gomes, Orlando] Inst Politecn Lisboa, ISCAL Lisbon Accounting & Business Sch, Lisbon, Portugal; [Gubareva, Mariya] Univ Lisbon, ISEG Lisbon Sch Econ & Management, Lisbon, Portugal; [Gubareva, Mariya] CSG Res Social Sci & Management, SOCIUS Res Ctr Econ & Org Sociol, Lisbon, Portugal; [Gomes, Orlando] Business Res Unit BRU IUL, Lisbon, Portugal",Polytechnic Institute of Lisbon; Universidade de Lisboa; Instituto Universitario de Lisboa,"Gubareva, M (corresponding author), Inst Politecn Lisboa, ISCAL Lisbon Accounting & Business Sch, Lisbon, Portugal.;Gubareva, M (corresponding author), Univ Lisbon, ISEG Lisbon Sch Econ & Management, Lisbon, Portugal.;Gubareva, M (corresponding author), CSG Res Social Sci & Management, SOCIUS Res Ctr Econ & Org Sociol, Lisbon, Portugal.",mgubareva@iscal.ipl.pt,"Gubareva, Mariya/Y-8520-2018","Gubareva, Mariya/0000-0001-6829-7021; Gomes, Orlando/0000-0002-7251-8736",,,,,22,1,1,0,0,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013, UNITED STATES",1431-1933,,978-3-030-02662-2; 978-3-030-02661-5,CONTRIB ECON,,,2019,,,,,37,57,,10.1007/978-3-030-02662-2_3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-02662-2_3,10.1007/978-3-030-02662-2,,21,Development Studies; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Economics,Book Citation Index – Social Sciences & Humanities (BKCI-SSH),Development Studies; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Business & Economics,BO0DB,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000490284300003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Measurements used in the comparison include long-term station observations, satellite and ground-based remote sensing products, and complex datasets of aerosol chemical composition and number size distribution from recent field campaigns. This is the first time these comprehensive measurements of aerosol characteristics in Europe are used to evaluate a regional chemistry transport model. We show a detailed analysis of the simulated size-resolved chemical composition under different meteorological conditions. Mean, variability and spatial distribution of the concentrations of O-3 and NOx are well reproduced. SO2 is found to be overestimated, simulated PM2.5 and PM10 levels are on average underestimated, as is AOD. We find indications of an overestimation of shipping emissions. Time evolution of aerosol chemical composition is captured, although some biases are found in relative composition. Nitrate aerosol components are on average overestimated, and sulfates underestimated. The accuracy of simulated organics depends strongly on season and location. While strongly underestimated during summer, organic mass is comparable in spring and autumn. We see indications for an overestimated fractional contribution of primary organic matter in urban areas and an underestimation of SOA at many locations. Aerosol number concentrations compare well with measurements for larger size ranges, but overestimations of particle number concentration with factors of 2-5 are found for particles smaller than 50 nm. Size distribution characteristics are often close to measurements, but show discrepancies at polluted sites. Suggestions for further improvement of the modeling system consist of the inclusion of a revised secondary organic aerosols scheme, aqueous-phase chemistry and improved aerosol boundary conditions. Our work sets the basis for subsequent studies of aerosol characteristics and climate impacts with COSMO-ART, and highlights areas where improvements are necessary for current regional modeling systems in general.","[Knote, C.; Brunner, D.] Empa Mat & Sci, Lab Air Pollut Env Technol, CH-8600 Dubendorf, Switzerland; [Knote, C.; Brunner, D.] ETH, Ctr Climate Syst Modeling C2SM, Zurich, Switzerland; [Vogel, H.; Vogel, B.] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Karlsruhe, Germany; [Allan, J.] Univ Manchester, Natl Ctr Atmospher Sci, Sch Earth Atmospher & Environm Sci, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Asmi, A.; Aijala, M.] Univ Helsinki, Dept Phys, Helsinki, Finland; [Carbone, S.] Finnish Meteorol Inst, FIN-00101 Helsinki, Finland; [Jimenez, J.

Hence, nutrient load abatement strategies are intensively discussed. With the help of a high-resolution, coupled physical-biogeochemical circulation model we investigate the combined impact of changing nutrient loads from land and changing climate during the 21st century as projected from a global climate model regionalized to the Baltic Sea region. Novel compared to previous studies are an extraordinary spin-up based upon historical reconstructions of atmospheric, nutrient load and runoff forcing, revised nutrient load scenarios and a comparison of nutrient load scenario simulations with and without changing climate. We found in almost all scenario simulations, with differing nutrient inputs, reduced eutrophication and improved ecological state compared to the reference period 1976-2005. This result is a long-lasting consequence of ongoing nutrient load reductions since the 1980s. Only in case of combined high-end nutrient load and climate scenarios, eutrophication is reinforced. Differences compared to earlier studies are explained by the experimental setup including nutrient loads during the historical period and by the projected nutrient loads. We found that the impact of warming climate may amplify the effects of eutrophication and primary production. However, effects of changing climate, within the range of considered greenhouse gas emission scenarios, are smaller than effects of considered nutrient load changes, in particular under low nutrient conditions. Hence, nutrient load reductions following the Baltic Sea Action Plan will lead to improved environmental conditions independently of future climate change.","[Saraiva, Sofia] Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Tecn, Environm & Energy Sect, Ave Rovisco Pais,1, P-1049001 Lisbon, Portugal; [Meier, H.

To assess forest impacts from climate change, the existing empirical information must be structured, harmonised and assimilated into a form suitable to develop and test state-of-the-art forest and ecosystem models. The combination of empirical data collected at large spatial and long temporal scales with suitable modelling approaches is key to understand forest dynamics under climate change. To facilitate data and model integration, we identified major climate change impacts observed on European forest functioning and summarised the data available for monitoring and predicting such impacts. Our analysis of c. 120 forest-related databases (including information from remote sensing, vegetation inventories, dendroecology, palaeoecology, eddy-flux sites, common garden experiments and genetic techniques) and 50 databases of environmental drivers highlights a substantial degree of data availability and accessibility. However, some critical variables relevant to predicting European forest responses to climate change are only available at relatively short time frames (up to 10-20 years), including intra-specific trait variability, defoliation patterns, tree mortality and recruitment. Moreover, we identified data gaps or lack of data integration particularly in variables related to local adaptation and phenotypic plasticity, dispersal capabilities and physiological responses. Overall, we conclude that forest data availability across Europe is improving, but further efforts are needed to integrate, harmonise and interpret this data (i.e. making data useable for non-experts). Continuation of existing monitoring and networks schemes together with the establishments of new networks to address data gaps is crucial to rigorously predict climate change impacts on European forests.","[Ruiz-Benito, Paloma; Zavala, Miguel A.] Univ Alcala, Dept Ciencias Vida, Grp Ecol & Restaurac Forestal, Edificio Ciencias,Campus Univ, Alcala De Henares 28805, Madrid, Spain; [Ruiz-Benito, Paloma] Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Escuela Super Ciencias Expt & Tecnol, Dept Biala & Geol Fis & Quim Inorgan, C Tulipan S-N, Mostoles 28933, Madrid, Spain; [Vacchiano, Giorgio] Univ Milan, Dept Agr & Environm Sci DISAA, Via Celoria 2, I-23100 Milan, Italy; [Lines, Emily R.; Owen, Harry J.

This can be broken down into two more explicit questions: What is the role of liberal arts education in such a changed context? and What resources in the Lutheran tradition can contribute to preparing students to become effective sustainability leaders? The thesis of this article is that Lutheran liberal arts education, to foster planetary citizenship, must move students from an anthropocentric to an ecocentric understanding of vocation, preparing them to become leaders for a sustainable, interfaith society. This change can be accomplished by reaffirming the value of the liberal arts to foster sustainability education and retrieving Luther's understanding of creation to elicit wonder and appreciation of the natural world.","[Simmons, Ernest L.] Concordia Coll, Relig, 901 8th St South, Moorhead, MN 56562 USA; [Simmons, Ernest L.] Concordia Coll, Dovre Ctr Faith & Learning, Moorhead, MN USA",,"Simmons, EL (corresponding author), Concordia Coll, Relig, 901 8th St South, Moorhead, MN 56562 USA.",simmons@cord.edu,,,,,,,48,0,0,0,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-2033,1540-6385,,DIALOG-J THEOLOGY,Dialog,JUN,2018,2,,,,99,106,,10.1111/dial.12389,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/dial.12389,,,8,Religion,Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;HCI),Religion,GK0DH,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000435776500005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Given the strong climatic influence on olive trees, it becomes imperative to assess climate change impacts on this crop. Herein, these impacts were innovatively assessed, based on an ensemble of state-of-the-art climate models, future scenarios and dynamic crop models. The recent-past (1989-2005) and future (2041-2070, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) olive growing season length (GSL), yield, growing season temperature (GST) and precipitation (GSP), potential (ETP) and actual (ETA) evapotranspiration, water demand (WD) and water productivity (WP) were assessed over Southern Europe. Crop models were fed with an ensemble of EURO-CORDEX regional climate model data, along with soil and terrain data. For the recent-past, important differences between western and eastern olive growing areas are found. GSL presents a strong latitudinal gradient, with higher/lower values at lower/higher latitudes. Yields are lower in inner south Iberia and higher in Italy and Greece, which is corroborated by historical data. Southern Iberia shows higher GST and lower GSP, which contributes to a higher ETP, lower ETA and, consequently, stronger WD. Regarding WP, the recent-past values show similar ranges across Europe. Future projections point to a general increase in GSL along with an increase in GST up to 3 degrees C. GSP is projected to decrease in Western Europe, leading to enhanced WD and consequently a yield decrease (down to -45%). Over eastern European, GSP is projected to slightly increase, leading to lower WD and to a small yield increase (up to +15%). WP will remain mostly unchanged. We conclude that climate change may negatively impact the viability of olive orchards in southern Iberia and some parts of Italy. Thus, adequate and timely planning of suitable adaptation measures are needed to ensure the sustainability of the olive sector.","[Fraga, Helder; Santos, Joao A.] Univ Tras Os Montes & Alto Douro UTAD, Ctr Res & Technol Agroenvironm & Biol Sci CITAB, Vila Real, Portugal; [Fraga, Helder; Pinto, Joaquim G.] KIT, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res IMK TRO, Karlsruhe, Germany; [Viola, Francesco] Univ Cagliari, Dept Civil Environm & Architectural Engn, Cagliari, Italy",University of Tras-os-Montes & Alto Douro; Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; University of Cagliari,"Fraga, H (corresponding author), Univ Tras Os Montes & Alto Douro UTAD, Ctr Res & Technol Agroenvironm & Biol Sci CITAB, Vila Real, Portugal.",hfraga@utad.pt,"Fraga, Helder/D-8507-2012; Pinto, Joaquim G/A-7352-2009; Viola, Francesco/E-9722-2013; Santos, João Andrade/G-8805-2011","Fraga, Helder/0000-0002-7946-8786; Pinto, Joaquim G/0000-0002-8865-1769; Viola, Francesco/0000-0003-1716-192X; Santos, João Andrade/0000-0002-8135-5078","AXA Research Fund; Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [CEECIND/00447/2017, UID/AGR/04033/2013]; European Investment Funds [POCI-01-0145-FEDER-006958]",AXA Research Fund(AXA Research Fund); Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology(Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology); European Investment Funds,"AXA Research Fund; Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology, Grant/Award Numbers: CEECIND/00447/2017, UID/AGR/04033/2013; European Investment Funds, Grant/Award Number: POCI-01-0145-FEDER-006958",,45,40,41,2,29,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0899-8418,1097-0088,,INT J CLIMATOL,Int.

Weather generator (WG) models, generally designed for mesoscale applications (e.g., 10(1)-10(5) km(2)), are popular and widely used tools to downscale climate data to finer resolution. One advantage of using WGs is their ability to generate the necessary climate variables for impact studies in data sparse regions. In this study, we evaluate the ability of a previously established state of the art WG (the AWE-GEN-2d model) to perform in data sparse regions that are beyond the mesoscale, using the Zambezi River basin (10(6) km(2)) in southeast Africa as a case study. The AWE-GEN-2d model was calibrated using data from satellite retrievals and climate re-analysis products in place of the absent observational data. An 8-km climate ensemble at hourly resolution, covering the period of 1976-2099 (present climate and RCP4.5 emission scenario from 2020), was then simulated. Using the simulated 30-member ensemble, climate indices for both present and future climates were computed. The high-resolution climate indices allow detailed analysis of the effects of climate change on different areas within the basin. For example, the southwestern area of the basin is predicted to experience the greatest change due to increased temperature, while the southeastern area was found to be already so hot that is less affected (e.g., the number of 'very hot days' per year increase by 18 and 9 days, respectively). Rainfall intensities are found to increase most in the eastern areas of the basin (1 mm.d(-1)) in comparison to the western region (0.3 mm.d(-1)). As demonstrated in this study, AWE-GEN-2d can be calibrated successfully using data from climate reanalysis products in the absence of ground station data and can be applied at larger scales than the mesoscale.","[Peleg, Nadav; Sinclair, Scott; Fatichi, Simone; Burlando, Paolo] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Environm Engn, HIL D21-1,Stefano Franscini Pl 5, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Fatichi, Simone] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Singapore, Singapore",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; National University of Singapore,"Peleg, N (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Environm Engn, HIL D21-1,Stefano Franscini Pl 5, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland.",nadav.peleg@sccer-soe.ethz.ch,"Peleg, Nadav/Q-9719-2016","Peleg, Nadav/0000-0001-6863-2934; Fatichi, Simone/0000-0003-1361-6659",Horizon 2020 Framework Programme [690268],Horizon 2020 Framework Programme,"Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, Grant/Award Number: 690268",,92,7,7,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0899-8418,1097-0088,,INT J CLIMATOL,Int.

Climate-related impacts on urban areas are becoming one of the most urgent challenges for urban development: cities are the main contributors to energy consumption and GHG emissions, paying also the highest price for the climate impacts. Thus, climate issues have gained increasing importance in the last decades, both in terms of the metaphors coined by scholars (low-carbon cities, transition cities, smart cities, resilient cities, etc.) and in terms of the initiatives undertaken on different institutional levels. Unfortunately, mitigation and adaptation are generally regarded as two different approaches, neglecting the potential synergies and trade-offs between the related strategies. Hence, based on the growing awareness of the need for mainstreaming mitigation and adaptation policies at city level, this study will provide an overview of the state of the art of the mitigation and adaptation initiatives in Italian metropolitan cities. Then, focusing on the concepts of the smart and the resilient city - as key concepts for reducing CO2 emissions and improving the ability of cities to respond to climate impacts - and with reference to a conceptual framework for building up a smart and resilient urban system carried out in previous research works (Papa et al., 2015), the study will examine case studies of Rotterdam and Barcelona, highlighting how this framework may improve our understanding and contribute to better integration of the fragmented on-going strategies and initiatives.","[Papa, R.; Galderisi, A.; Majello, M.

Anthropogenic aerosols have previously been highlighted as a potential mitigator of AMOC weakening. In this study, we explain the oceanic mechanisms behind how anthropogenic aerosols force a strengthening of the AMOC by up to 20% in our state-of-the-art Earth system model. This strengthening is driven via atmospheric circulation changes which subsequently modulate the salinity budget of the North Atlantic subpolar gyre. Gradual salinification occurs via increased evaporation and decreased fluxes of ice through the Fram Straits. A component of the salinification is a positive feedback from the AMOC bringing more saline water northwards from the subtropical Atlantic. Salinification of the subpolar gyre results in increased deep convection and a strengthening of the AMOC. Following a reduction in aerosol concentrations, the AMOC rapidly weakens, approximately 3 times faster than in the case where anthropogenic aerosol concentrations had never been increased.

The predictability of the corresponding atmospheric signals is typically limited to less than 1 year lead time. Here we present observational and modelling evidence for multi-year predictability of coherent trans-basin climate variations that are characterized by a zonal seesaw in tropical sea surface temperature and sea-level pressure between the Pacific and the other two ocean basins. State-of-the-art climate model forecasts initialized from a realistic ocean state show that the low-frequency trans-basin climate variability, which explains part of the El Nino Southern Oscillation flavours, can be predicted up to 3 years ahead, thus exceeding the predictive skill of current tropical climate forecasts for natural variability. This low-frequency variability emerges from the synchronization of ocean anomalies in all basins via global reorganizations of the atmospheric Walker Circulation.","[Chikamoto, Yoshimitsu; Timmermann, Axel] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Int Pacific Res Ctr, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Timmermann, Axel] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Oceanog, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Luo, Jing-Jia] Bur Meteorol, Ctr Australian Weather & Climate Res, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia; [Mochizuki, Takashi] Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, Kanazawa Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2360001, Japan; [Kimoto, Masahide; Watanabe, Masahiro] Univ Tokyo, Atmosphere & Ocean Res Inst, Kashiwa, Chiba 2778568, Japan; [Ishii, Masayoshi] Japan Meteorol Agcy, Meteorol Res Inst, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050052, Japan; [Xie, Shang-Ping] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Jin, Fei-Fei] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Meteorol, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA",University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; Bureau of Meteorology - Australia; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science & Technology (JAMSTEC); University of Tokyo; Japan Meteorological Agency; Meteorological Research Institute - Japan; University of California System; University of California San Diego; Scripps Institution of Oceanography; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa,"Chikamoto, Y (corresponding author), Univ Hawaii Manoa, Int Pacific Res Ctr, 1680 East West Rd, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",chika44@hawaii.edu,"Xie, Shang-Ping/C-1254-2009; Mochizuki, Takashi/C-7466-2013; Timmermann, Axel/Y-2799-2019; Luo, Jing-Jia/T-9612-2019; Luo, Jing-Jia/B-2481-2008; Timmermann, Axel/F-4977-2011; Watanabe, Masahiro/G-8228-2017","Xie, Shang-Ping/0000-0002-3676-1325; Mochizuki, Takashi/0000-0001-7884-6717; Timmermann, Axel/0000-0003-0657-2969; Luo, Jing-Jia/0000-0003-2181-0638; Luo, Jing-Jia/0000-0003-2181-0638; Timmermann, Axel/0000-0003-0657-2969; Chikamoto, Yoshimitsu/0000-0003-1001-5188","Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, through the Program for Risk Information on Climate Change; NSF [1049219]; NOAA; Directorate For Geosciences [1305719, 1406601] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Div Atmospheric & Geospace Sciences [1049219, 1049238] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, through the Program for Risk Information on Climate Change; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); Directorate For Geosciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)); Div Atmospheric & Geospace Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO))","This study was supported by the Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, through the Program for Risk Information on Climate Change.

Artists, as cultural workers, play a valuable role in attending to questions of social and ecological justice. While there is growing artistic engagement with environmental research, there are few studies which critically explore the confluence of contemporary art, sustainability, and informal education within Canada. Using a framework of poetics (poiesis), this study explores how an environmentally engaged arts practice is a form of transformative environmental education. We interviewed 24 current Canada-based visual, installation, and performance artists to understand how they conceptualize their role in fostering socioecological transformations. We used an inductive thematic coding scheme to analyze transcripts and compared emergent themes to current ecocritical literature. Results reveal a framework of artist-researcher-teacher as facilitator of conviviality, curiosity, and care, showing the agency of artists and a need for poetics in environmental work, research, and education.","[Yakamovich, Jennifer; Wright, Tarah] Dalhousie Univ, Halifax, NS, Canada",Dalhousie University,"Yakamovich, J (corresponding author), Dalhousie Univ, Life Sci Ctr, Environm Sci, 1355 Oxford St,8th Floor, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada.",jen.yakamovich@dal.ca,,", Jennifer/0000-0002-3886-8775; Wright, Tarah/0000-0001-7210-2039",Insight Development Grant from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [430-201600811],Insight Development Grant from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada,"This research was funded through an Insight Development Grant from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (Grant Number 430-201600811, Principal Investigator Dr. Tarah Wright).",,62,0,0,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0095-8964,1940-1892,,J ENVIRON EDUC,J.

The article explains the evolution of the design of this type of Youth Camps, which started in the school year 2007-2008. The target of the Camps is to investigate new ways in which students must learn in order to become creative leaders and effective communicators to make our society aware of climate change throughout the development of awareness raising products. It also includes the evolution of the participants' selection process of the Youth Camp which, initially, focused on face-to-face author meetings in Galicia (Spain).

Studies show an increasing trend in the earth's surface temperature, with decreasing trends in rainfall. With most studies focused on predicting the extent of climate change, fewer studies focused on developing appropriate response strategies. This paper aims to propose a systematic approach to identify, analyze, and respond to the risks of climate change on irrigation water in arid regions using the Risk Management process. The compound effect of these risks was analysed using Monte Carlo Simulation, which indicated a 69% loss in crop production due to climate change at a 90% confidence level. The proposed responses to the risks of climate change include strategies to avoid, transfer, mitigate, and/or accept these risks. The study has made three contributions to the state of the art. First, to adopt a well-recognized risk management methodology in climate change studies. Second, to quantify the compound effect of climate change risks on irrigation water in arid regions. Third, to recommend a set of response strategies to help policymakers mitigate the inevitable harmful effect of climate change on irrigation water.","[Elnashar, Walaa; Elyamany, Ahmed] Zagazig Univ, Water Engn Dept, Zagazig, Egypt; [Elyamany, Ahmed] Zagazig Univ, Zagazig, Egypt",Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Zagazig University; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Zagazig University,"Elyamany, A (corresponding author), Zagazig Univ, Water Engn Dept, Zagazig, Egypt.;Elyamany, A (corresponding author), Zagazig Univ, Zagazig, Egypt.",walaanashar@yahoo.com; drahmedelyamany@yahoo.com,,"Elyamany, Ahmed/0000-0003-2154-1546","Science, Technology & Innovation Funding Authority (STDF); Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB)","Science, Technology & Innovation Funding Authority (STDF)(Science and Technology Development Fund (STDF)); Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB)","Open access funding provided by The Science, Technology & Innovation Funding Authority (STDF) in cooperation with The Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB).

The depth and strength of AMOC are shown to be strongly correlated with the depth of heat storage across a suite of state-of-the-art general circulation models (GCMs). In those models with a deeper and stronger AMOC, a smaller portion of the heat anomaly remains in the ocean mixed layer, and consequently, the surface temperature response is delayed. Representations of AMOC differ vastly across the GCMs, providing a major source of intermodel spread in the sea surface temperature (SST) response. A two-layer model fit to the GCMs is used to demonstrate that the intermodel spread in SSTs due to variations in the ocean's effective heat capacity is significant but smaller than the spread due to climate feedbacks.

Recent literature emphasising the need for boundary-work seeks to bridge the tensions in order to broker resolutions. I argue that perspectives on boundary-work connecting with the Foucauldian sense of power as relations could benefit from further analysis of the forms of intersubjective conflict involved. Accordingly Sartre's concept of conflicted Otherness is in focus. Through empirical investigation, the stances taken by advisory policy makers and school senior management attempting to navigate directives for art education are theorised. This original approach to such relational boundaries locates key issues in the field of policy studies. It raises questions about the difficulties of aiming for effective collaboration in a climate of protectionist reactions to globalisation, incentivised competition, and the divisive minimisation of creativity in the curriculum.","[Matthews, Miranda] Goldsmiths Univ London, London, England",University of London; Goldsmiths University London,"Matthews, M (corresponding author), Goldsmiths Univ London, London, England.",m.matthews@gold.ac.uk,,"Matthews, Miranda/0000-0002-6037-6240",,,,,34,3,3,0,5,INST EDUCATION POLICY STUDIES,NORTHAMPTON,"UNIV NORTHAMPTON, PARK CAMPUS, BOUGHTON GREEN RD, NORTHAMPTON, NN2 7AL, ENGLAND",2051-0969,1740-2743,,J CRIT EDUC POLICY S,J.

An analysis of the scientific contributions reveals that many multidisciplinary contributions have identified diverse risk factors. In the last thirty years safety climate has been one of the major organizational variables studied as an antecedent of workers safety /risk motivations, knowledge, and behaviour and work accidents. Despite of this state of the art until now only very few studies considered safety climate role in explaining occupational diseases. Considering that safety climate is critical for decreasing the exposure to risks it can be expected that will also impact on work sickness or sick leave. The present study intends to give one exploratory contribute to fulfil this gap. Data was collected in two Brazilian SMEs with the participation of 119 workers. Safety climate was assessed using a 45-item questionnaire, answered in a Likert type scale, which was previously validated for the Brazilian organizational context. Occupational disease and sick leave was collected considering the companies' medical records. In this study these variables were operationalized dichotomously (having versus not having sickness or sick leave days). According to the nature of the data the relations were tested using Kendall Tau and Spearman correlations and logistic regressions were conducted for the variables with significant correlations. Findings partially supported the relation between safety climate and occupational disease. This relation between safety climate dimensions and diseases revealed to be complex, only explained by moderation effects or by the direct effects of some items.","[Zavareze, Tais Evangelho; Cruz, Roberto] Univ Fed Santa Catarina, BR-88040900 Florianopolis, SC, Brazil; [Silva, Silvia Agostinho] ISCTE IUL, DRHCO, Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina (UFSC); Instituto Universitario de Lisboa,"Zavareze, TE (corresponding author), Univ Fed Santa Catarina, BR-88040900 Florianopolis, SC, Brazil.",,"Cruz, Roberto M./G-9205-2014",,,,,,5,0,0,0,4,PORTUGUESE SOC OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY & HYGIENE,GUIMARAES,"DPS-UNIVERSIDADE MINHO, GUIMARAES, 4800-058, PORTUGAL",,,978-989-98203-3-3,,,,2015,,,,,439,441,,,,,,3,"Ergonomics; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH),"Engineering; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",BC1YY,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000350559600148,View Full Record in Web of Science

Despite some noticeable biases, all the RCSMs capture spatial patterns and cyclone activity key characteristics in the region and thus all of them can be considered as plausible representations of the future evolution of Mediterranean cyclones. In general, the RCSMs show at the end of the twenty-first century a decrease in the number and an overall weakening of cyclones moving across the Mediterranean. Five out of seven RCSMs simulate also a decrease of the mean size of the systems. Moreover, in agreement with what already observed in CMIP5 projections for the area, the models suggest an increase in the Central part of the Mediterranean region and a decrease in the South-eastern part of the region in the cyclone-related wind speed and precipitation rate. These rather two opposite tendencies observed in the precipitation should compensate and amplify, respectively, the effect of the overall reduction of the frequency of cyclones on the water budget over the Central and South-eastern part of the region. A pronounced inter-model spread among the RCSMs emerges for the projected changes in the cyclone adjusted deepening rate, seasonal cycle occurrence and associated precipitation and wind patterns over some areas of the basin such as Ionian Sea and Iberian Peninsula. The differences observed appear to be determined by the driving Global Circulation Model (GCM) and influenced by the RCSM physics and internal variability. These results point to the importance of (1) better characterizing the range of plausible futures by relying on ensembles of models that explore well the existing diversity of GCMs and RCSMs as well as the climate natural variability and (2) better understanding the driving mechanisms of the future evolution of Mediterranean cyclones properties.","[Reale, Marco; Salon, Stefano] Natl Inst Oceanog & Appl Geophys OGS, Trieste, Italy; [Reale, Marco; Coppola, Erika; Giorgi, Filippo] ESP Grp, Abdus Salam Int Ctr Theoret Phys, ICTP, Trieste, Italy; [Cabos Narvaez, William David] Univ Alcala, Alcala De Henares, Spain; [Cavicchia, Leone] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Conte, Dario; Gualdi, Silvio; Lionello, Piero; Scoccimarro, Enrico] CMCC, Fdn Ctr Euro Mediterraneo Cambiamenti Climat, Lecce, Italy; [Flaounas, Emmanouil] Hellen Ctr Marine Res, Inst Oceanog, Athens, Greece; [Hochman, Assaf] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem HUJI, Freddy & Nadine Hermann Inst Earth Sci, Jerusalem, Israel; [Li, Laurent] Sorbonne Univ, Lab Meteorol Dynam, CNRS, Paris, France; [Lionello, Piero] Univ Salento, Dept Biol & Environm Sci & Technol, DiSTeBA, Lecce, Italy; [Podrascanin, Zorica] Univ Novi Sad, Fac Sci, Dept Phys, Novi Sad, Serbia; [Sanchez-Gomez, Emilia] Univ Toulouse, CERFACS, CNRS, CECI, Toulouse, France; [Sein, Dmitry, V] Helmholtz Ctr Polar & Marine Res, Alfred Wegener Inst, Bremerhaven, Germany; [Sein, Dmitry, V] Russian Acad Sci, Shirshov Inst Oceanol, Moscow, Russia; [Somot, Samuel] Univ Toulouse, CNRM Ctr Natl Rech Meteorol, CNRS, Meteo France, Toulouse, France; [Hochman, Assaf] Karlsruhe Inst Technol KIT, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Dept Tropospher Res IMK TRO, Karlsruhe, Germany","Istituto Nazionale di Oceanografia e di Geofisica Sperimentale; Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP); Universidad de Alcala; University of Melbourne; Centro Euro-Mediterraneo sui Cambiamenti Climatici (CMCC); Hellenic Centre for Marine Research; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Universite Paris Cite; University of Salento; University of Novi Sad; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CERFACS; Universite de Toulouse; Helmholtz Association; Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar & Marine Research; Russian Academy of Sciences; Shirshov Institute of Oceanology; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology","Reale, M (corresponding author), Natl Inst Oceanog & Appl Geophys OGS, Trieste, Italy.;Reale, M (corresponding author), ESP Grp, Abdus Salam Int Ctr Theoret Phys, ICTP, Trieste, Italy.",mreale@inogs.it,"Salon, Stefano/AGI-3626-2022; Cavicchia, Leone/AAK-3472-2020; Sein, Dmitry V/GLS-0252-2022; Gualdi, Silvio/F-3061-2015; reale, marco/AAK-6441-2020; Li, Laurent/X-3278-2019; Sein, Dmitry/P-6419-2018; Cabos Narvaez, William David/L-7374-2014","Salon, Stefano/0000-0003-1233-8271; Cavicchia, Leone/0000-0001-9857-7817; Gualdi, Silvio/0000-0001-7777-8935; reale, marco/0000-0003-1004-8203; Li, Laurent/0000-0002-3855-3976; Sein, Dmitry/0000-0002-1190-3622; Flaounas, Emmanouil/0000-0001-9769-7817; Cabos Narvaez, William David/0000-0003-3638-6438; lionello, piero/0000-0002-0779-5681",OGS under HPC-TRES award [2015-07]; CINECA under HPC-TRES [2015-07]; project FAIRSEA (Fisheries in the Adriatic Region-a Shared Ecosystem.

The author argues for an approach she calls 'resonant pedagogy' where improvisation is present in both the pedagogical design and in the content of the classes, allowing teachers/facilitators and students/participants to work together across the different disciplines that coalesce in the practice of sound art. A resonant, improvisatory approach also recognises and responds to the backgrounds, experiences, abilities, environments, and cultures of those present. Using examples from training in community settings in Australia, Northern Ireland, and Canada, and classes at the University of Regina, she suggests that incorporating improvisation might be one way to push back against the binary of 'inclusion' and 'exclusion'. In such a binary, power seems to rest with those doing the 'including'. Instead, she suggests teachers make room for unique cultural formations to thrive, in a climate marked by resonating differences.","[Caines, Rebecca] Univ Regina, Interdisciplinary Programs, Fac Media Art & Performance, Regina, SK, Canada; [Caines, Rebecca] Queens Univ Belfast, Son Arts Res Ctr, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland",University of Regina; Queens University Belfast,"Caines, R (corresponding author), Univ Regina, Interdisciplinary Programs, Fac Media Art & Performance, Regina, SK, Canada.;Caines, R (corresponding author), Queens Univ Belfast, Son Arts Res Ctr, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland.",,,"Caines, Rebecca/0000-0001-5862-2708",Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [895-2012-1006],Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),This work was supported by Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [Grant Number 895-2012-1006].,,34,1,1,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0749-4467,1477-2256,,CONTEMP MUSIC REV,Contemp.

Instead of exclusively chasing complexity, Levins advocated for the use of multiple different kinds of complementary models, including much simpler ones. In this paper, I argue that the epistemic challenges Levins attributed to the brute force strategy still apply to state-of-the-art climate models today: they have big appetites for unattainable data, they are limited by computational tractability, and they are incomprehensible to the human modeller. Along the lines Levins described, this uncertainty generates a trade-off between realistic, precise models with predictive power and simple, highly idealised models that facilitate understanding. In addition to building ensembles of highly complex dynamical models, climate modellers can address model uncertainty by comparing models of different types, such as dynamical and data-driven models, and by systematically comparing models at different levels of what climate modellers call the model hierarchy. Despite its age, Levins' paper remains incredibly insightful and should be considered an important entry into the philosophy of computational modelling.","[Walrnsley, Lachlan Douglas] Australian Natl Univ, Sch Philosophy, Bldg 9 Fellows Rd, Acton, ACT 2600, Australia",Australian National University,"Walrnsley, LD (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, Sch Philosophy, Bldg 9 Fellows Rd, Acton, ACT 2600, Australia.",Lachlan.walmsley@anu.edu.au,"Walmsley, Lachlan/AAU-7094-2021","Walmsley, Lachlan/0000-0001-8484-8217",Australian Research Council [PSA2018]; (ARC FL13),Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); (ARC FL13)(Australian Research Council),"I would like to John Matthewson and Kim Sterelny for their many helpful comments on this material as well as two anonymous reviewers whose advice led to a much-improved paper.

The research saw the innovative use of a differential GPS to record rock-art panels to within 5mm of accuracy at the site of Shuwaymis-2, the first time that such technology has been used to record rock art in the Arabian Peninsula. With such technology it was possible to show which of eighty-three late prehistoric rock-art panels surveyed were in their original position and which had fallen, and to demonstrate that there was spatial homogeneity of rock-art styles and composition across the site. The mapping recorded multiple panels of cattle, ibex, equid, large cat and other animals.

The impact of these expected climate changes on wastewater system performance has been studied extensively by applying the expected climate change as input for urban drainage, sewer or wastewater treatment models. The model-based analysis of the impact of climate change has an important drawback: applied models can only represent the processes incorporated in the model and typically have a limited universality, if at all calibrated, due to the limited information available in the time series used for model calibration. Literature describing possible climate change impacts on performance of the urban wastewater infrastructure based on the analysis of monitoring data is hardly available. Recent developments in continuous monitoring have resulted in an increased availability of high quality data sets. These data sets allow assessment of the impacts of climate change by scrutinizing the data sets searching for meteorological conditions that resemble expected climate changes. The potential of applying data analysis to study climate change effects is illustrated for the case of the Eindhoven wastewater system, for which an extensive database is available. The results of this study show that, due to the limitations of state of the art sewer water quality models as well as WWTP models, model based assessment of climate change impacts does not properly address all possible impacts of climate change. Consequently, the impact of climate change is underestimated. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Langeveld, J. G.] Delft Univ Technol, NL-2600 GA Delft, Netherlands; [Langeveld, J.

A review is given of the information available in the past record on the atmosheric circulation and its role in climate change, firstly at the surface via sea level pressure in both the northern and southern hemispheres and secondly for the free atmosphere. As with most climate information, the climate record is compromised by non-physical inhomogeneities arising from changes in observing and analyzing techniques and changes in data coverage. Problems with and threats to the rawinsonde network are discussed. Global analyses produced by the operational centers, U.S. National Meteorological Center (NMC) and the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), for weather forecasting purposes contain many discontinuous changes in the analyses arising from improvements in the system used to produce them. A discussion is given of the prospects for and motivation behind an activity known as 'reanalysis' in which the historical data are reanalyzed using a state-of-the-art system that is held constant for the entire record. The only sources of spurious change then are the changes in the observing system, such as the introduction of space-based observations. Recommendations are made on needed actions for better understanding and monitoring climate change. The role of the atmospheric circulation and the strong links to other variables such as temperature, precipitation and wind are established and illustrated with a survey of decadal variability, the evidence for it, and the way in which the observed atmospheric circulation is involved in the Pacific and Atlantic sectors. The importance of teleconnections is stressed, especially in the winter half year, for understanding local climate change. The likelihood that changes will be manifested in the frequency and intensity of preferred modes of behavior in the atmosphere, such as the Fl Nino-Southern Oscillation and Pacific-North American teleconnection patterns, rather than in changes in the modes is also emphasized. The recently observed climate changes and the tendency for an unprecedented prolonged El Nino are interpreted in this framework. The key coupled atmosphere-ocean character of decadal variability is noted with the atmosphere providing the spatial scales, the ocean the memory, but also with the need for collaborative, as opposed to destructive, interactions through the atmospheric circulation.",,,"Trenberth, KE (corresponding author), NATL CTR ATMOSPHER RES,POB 3000,BOULDER,CO 80307, USA.",,"Trenberth, Kevin Edward/A-5683-2012","Trenberth, Kevin Edward/0000-0002-1445-1000",,,,,79,64,71,1,8,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

Is art still capable to produce alternate visions of the future in the face of the disruption of globalization? Can theory face the age of advanced capitalism? Do the views of artists and theorists still have an impact on society? Is man the savior of Nature or just a careless consumer? Is technology a functional instrument or an intruder in our everyday life? What meaning does the concept of Nature still have? In this context, a new post-human view is desired together with a thorough reconsideration of nature as nature in itself, and with a firm acknowledgement of an independent animal phenomenology and animal Umvelt (typical environmental world). Thus, one should notice the inevitable turn to a posthuman aesthetics that no longer follows the modern decree that everything is to be understood in relation with the human. A redefinition of Social & Human Sciences (ecology, anthropology, human geography, urban planning, and environmental studies) as an interdisciplinary field together with a reconsideration of such concepts as human, subject and life is also to be noticed. In conclusion this paper aims to present an analysis of recent concepts and themes of the posthuman paradigm, together with the application of these concepts in the artistic field (both international and Romanian art scene will be in focus) and their influence on contemporary life and politics.","[Oancea, Raluca Ileana] Bucharest Natl Univ Arts, Bucharest, Romania",,"Oancea, RI (corresponding author), Bucharest Natl Univ Arts, Bucharest, Romania.",raluca8ileana@yahoo.com,,,CNCS; Project PN II-RU-TE [336/2015],CNCS(Consiliul National al Cercetarii Stiintifice (CNCS)); Project PN II-RU-TE,This research work was carried out with the support of CNCS and also was financed from Project PN II-RU-TE No336/2015.

Oceanic electric conductivities from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) climate simulations are combined with tidal currents of M2 and O1 to estimate electromagnetic tidal signals and their sensitivity to global warming. Ninety-four years of global warming leads to differences of +/- 0.3 nT in tidal magnetic amplitudes and +/- 0.1 mV/km in the tidal electric amplitudes at sea level. Locally, the climate-induced changes can be much higher, e.g., +1 nT in the North Atlantic. In general, all studied electromagnetic tidal amplitudes show large-scale climate-induced anomalies that are strongest in the Northern Hemisphere and amount to 30% of their actual values. Consequently, changes in oceanic electromagnetic tidal amplitudes should be detectable in electromagnetic records. Electric and magnetic signals, as well as tides of different frequencies, contain complementary regional information. Plain Language Summary Ocean water is a good conductive medium. Ocean water flow through Earth's ambient magnetic field generates measurable electromagnetic signals. By using state of the art Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 climate predictions, climate change-induced variations in seawater electric conductivity are calculated. Since these conductivity variations are slow and hard to separate in electromagnetic observations, the derived electric conductivity is combined with ocean tide velocities. Tides are since long detectable with magnetometer observations. We calculate the respective electromagnetic ocean tidal signals and relate their anomalies to climate change. We conclude that climate impact should be detectable in electromagnetic observations, even from space.","[Saynisch, J.; Petereit, J.; Irrgang, C.; Thomas, M.] GFZ German Res Ctr Geosci, Potsdam, Germany; [Irrgang, C.; Thomas, M.] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Meteorol, Berlin, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Center Potsdam GFZ German Research Center for Geosciences; Free University of Berlin,"Saynisch, J (corresponding author), GFZ German Res Ctr Geosci, Potsdam, Germany.",saynisch@gfz-potsdam.de,,"Irrgang, Christopher/0000-0001-8274-1678; Saynisch-Wagner, Jan/0000-0001-9619-0336",German Research Foundation's priority programme [1788]; Helmholtz Association of German Research Centres,German Research Foundation's priority programme; Helmholtz Association of German Research Centres(Helmholtz Association),"This study is funded by the German Research Foundation's priority programme 1788 Dynamic Earth and by the Helmholtz Association of German Research Centres.

Here, we examine whether the new-generation climate models in CMIP6 can reproduce the recent global warming slowdown, and further evaluate their capacities for simulating key-scale natural variabilities which are the most likely causes of the slowdown. The results show that although the CMIP6 models present some encouraging improvements when compared with CMIP5, most of them still fail to reproduce the warming slowdown. They considerably overestimate the warming rate observed in 1998-2013, exhibiting an obvious warming acceleration rather than the observed deceleration. This is probably associated with their deficiencies in simulating the distinct temperature change signals from the human-induced long-term warming trend and or the three crucial natural variabilities at interannual, interdecadal, and multidecadal scales. In contrast, the 4 models that can successfully reproduce the slowdown show relatively high skills in simulating the long-term warming trend and the three key-scale natural variabilities. Our work may provide important insight for the simulation and prediction of near-term climate changes.","[Wei, Meng; Shu, Qi; Song, Zhenya; Song, Yajuan; Yang, Xiaodan; Li, Xinfang; Qiao, Fangli] Minist Nat Resources, Inst Oceanog 1, Qingdao 266061, Peoples R China; [Wei, Meng; Shu, Qi; Song, Zhenya; Song, Yajuan; Yang, Xiaodan; Li, Xinfang; Qiao, Fangli] Minist Nat Resources, Key Lab Marine Sci & Numer Modeling, Qingdao 266061, Peoples R China; [Wei, Meng; Shu, Qi; Song, Zhenya; Song, Yajuan; Yang, Xiaodan; Li, Xinfang; Qiao, Fangli] Pilot Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol, Lab Reg Oceanog & Numer Modeling, Qingdao 266237, Peoples R China; [Wei, Meng; Shu, Qi; Song, Zhenya; Song, Yajuan; Yang, Xiaodan; Li, Xinfang; Qiao, Fangli] Shandong Key Lab Marine Sci & Numer Modeling, Qingdao 266061, Peoples R China; [Guo, Yongqing] Zhejiang Ocean Univ, Marine Sci & Technol Coll, Zhoushan 316000, Peoples R China",Ministry of Natural Resources of the People's Republic of China; Ministry of Natural Resources of the People's Republic of China; Qingdao National Laboratory for Marine Science & Technology; Zhejiang Ocean University,"Qiao, FL (corresponding author), Minist Nat Resources, Inst Oceanog 1, Qingdao 266061, Peoples R China.;Qiao, FL (corresponding author), Minist Nat Resources, Key Lab Marine Sci & Numer Modeling, Qingdao 266061, Peoples R China.;Qiao, FL (corresponding author), Pilot Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol, Lab Reg Oceanog & Numer Modeling, Qingdao 266237, Peoples R China.;Qiao, FL (corresponding author), Shandong Key Lab Marine Sci & Numer Modeling, Qingdao 266061, Peoples R China.",Qiaofl@fio.org.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [41806043, 41821004, 41906029]; Basic Scientific Fund for National Public Research Institutes of China [2019Q08]; Basic Scientific Fund for National Public Research Institute of China [2019S06]; National Program on Global Change and Air-Sea Interaction [GASI-IPOVAI-06]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Basic Scientific Fund for National Public Research Institutes of China; Basic Scientific Fund for National Public Research Institute of China; National Program on Global Change and Air-Sea Interaction,"We thank all the data providers.

Prior studies support improved air quality under NTCF mitigation, but with conflicting climate impacts that range from a significant reduction in the rate of global warming to only a modest impact. Here, we use state-of-the-art chemistry-climate model simulations conducted as part of the Aerosol and Chemistry Model Intercomparison Project (AerChemMIP) to quantify the 21st-century impact of NTCF reductions, using a realistic future emission scenario with a consistent air quality policy. Non-methane NTCF (NMNTCF; aerosols and ozone precursors) mitigation improves air quality, but leads to significant increases in global mean precipitation of 1.3% by mid-century and 1.4% by end-of-the-century, and corresponding surface warming of 0.23 and 0.21 K. NTCF (all-NTCF; including methane) mitigation further improves air quality, with larger reductions of up to 45% for ozone pollution, while offsetting half of the wetting by mid-century (0.7% increase) and all the wetting by end-of-the-century (non-significant 0.1% increase) and leading to surface cooling of -0.15 K by mid-century and -0.50 K by end-of-the-century. This suggests that methane mitigation offsets warming induced from reductions in NMNTCFs, while also leading to net improvements in air quality.","[Allen, Robert J.] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Horowitz, Larry W.; Naik, Vaishali; Sentman, Lori T.; John, Jasmin G.; Broderick, Conor] DOC NOAA OAR Geophys Fluid Dynam Lab, Biogeochem Atmospher Chem & Ecol Div, Princeton, NJ USA; [Oshima, Naga; Deushi, Makoto] Japan Meteorol Agcy, Meteorol Res Inst, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [O'Connor, Fiona M.; Turnock, Steven; Folberth, Gerd A.] Met Off Hadley Ctr, Exeter, Devon, England; [Shim, Sungbo] Natl Inst Meteorol Sci, Seogwipo Si, Jeju Do, South Korea; [Le Sager, Philippe; van Noije, Twan] Royal Netherlands Meteorol Inst KNMI, De Bilt, Netherlands; [Tsigaridis, Kostas; Bauer, Susanne E.] Columbia Univ, Ctr Climate Syst Res, NASA, Goddard Inst Space Studies, New York, NY USA; [Broderick, Conor] Macalester Coll, St Paul, MN 55105 USA; [Fujimori, Shinichiro] Kyoto Univ, Dept Environm Engn, Nishikyo Ku, C1-3 361 Kyotodaigaku Katsura, Kyoto, Japan; [Fujimori, Shinichiro] Natl Inst Environm Studies NIES, Ctr Social & Environm Syst Res, 16-2 Onogawa, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Fujimori, Shinichiro] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal IIASA, Schlosspl 1, Laxenburg, Austria; [Collins, William J.] Univ Reading, Dept Meteorol, Reading, Berks, England",University of California System; University of California Riverside; Japan Meteorological Agency; Meteorological Research Institute - Japan; Met Office - UK; Hadley Centre; National Institute of Meteorological Sciences; Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute; Columbia University; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; Macalester College; Kyoto University; National Institute for Environmental Studies - Japan; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); University of Reading,"Allen, RJ (corresponding author), Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.",rjallen@ucr.edu,"Fujimori, Shinichiro/A-1288-2015; Collins, William/A-5895-2010; Folberth, Gerd A./F-7376-2010; Tsigaridis, Kostas/K-8292-2012; Naik, Vaishali/Y-5661-2019","Fujimori, Shinichiro/0000-0001-7897-1796; Collins, William/0000-0002-7419-0850; Folberth, Gerd A./0000-0002-1075-440X; Tsigaridis, Kostas/0000-0001-5328-819X; Naik, Vaishali/0000-0002-2254-1700; Oshima, Naga/0000-0002-8451-2411","Korea Meteorological Administration Research and Development Program 'Development and Assessment of IPCC AR6 Climate Change Scenario' [KMA2018-00321]; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [JP18H03363, JP18H05292, JP19K12312, JP20K04070]; Environment Research and Technology Development Fund of the Environmental Restoration and Conservation Agency of Japan [JPMEERF20172003, JPMEERF20202003, JPMEERF20205001]; Arctic Challenge for Sustainability II (ArCS II) [JPMXD1420318865]; Ministry of the Environment, Japan; Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme - BEIS; Defra [GA01101]; EU Horizon 2020 Research Programme CRESCENDO project [641816]","Korea Meteorological Administration Research and Development Program 'Development and Assessment of IPCC AR6 Climate Change Scenario'; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Environment Research and Technology Development Fund of the Environmental Restoration and Conservation Agency of Japan; Arctic Challenge for Sustainability II (ArCS II); Ministry of the Environment, Japan(Ministry of the Environment, Japan); Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme - BEIS; Defra(Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA)); EU Horizon 2020 Research Programme CRESCENDO project","The data that support the findings of this study are openly available via the Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF) at https://esgf-node.llnl.gov/search/cmip6/.

Restricted by the current limited knowledge on underlying mechanisms, statistical methods (e.g. correlation methods) are often used rather than a physical-based model. However, available correlation methods generally fail to explain the interactions among a wide range of climate oscillations and associated effects on the water cycle. This study presents a new probabilistic analysis approach by means of a state-of-the-art Copula-based joint probability distribution to characterize the aggregated behaviors for large-scale climate patterns and their connections to precipitation. We applied this method to identify the complex connections between climate patterns (westerly circulation (WEC), El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO)) and seasonal precipitation over a typical endorheic region, the Tarim River Basin in central Asia. Results show that the interactions among multiple climate oscillations are non-uniform in most seasons and phases. Certain joint extreme phases can significantly trigger extremes (flood and drought) owing to theamplification effect among climate oscillations. We further find that the connection is mainly due to the complex effects of climatic and topographical factors.","[Shi, Pengfei; Yang, Tao; Zhang, Ke; Yu, Zhongbo; Zhou, Xudong] Hohai Univ, State Key Lab Hydrol Water Resources & Hydraul En, Ctr Global Change & Water Cycle, Nanjing 210098, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Yang, Tao] Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Desert & Oasis Ecol, Xinjiang Inst Ecol & Geog, Urumqi, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Ke] Univ Oklahoma, Cooperat Inst Mesoscale Meteorol Studies, Norman, OK 73072 USA; [Tang, Qiuhong] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100864, Peoples R China","Hohai University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Xinjiang Institute of Ecology & Geography, CAS; University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma - Norman; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS","Yang, T (corresponding author), Hohai Univ, State Key Lab Hydrol Water Resources & Hydraul En, Ctr Global Change & Water Cycle, Nanjing 210098, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.;Yang, T (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Desert & Oasis Ecol, Xinjiang Inst Ecol & Geog, Urumqi, Peoples R China.",yang.tao@ms.xjb.ac.cn,"Zhang, Ke/B-3227-2012; Tang, Qiuhong/AAD-9832-2022; Shi, Pengfei/AGU-5168-2022; xudong, zhou/AAK-7004-2021; Tang, Qiuhong/ABA-2194-2021","Zhang, Ke/0000-0001-5288-9372; Tang, Qiuhong/0000-0002-0886-6699; Shi, Pengfei/0000-0002-4052-4007; Zhou, Xudong/0000-0001-7180-8187","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41371051]; key grant of Chinese Academy of Sciences [KZZD-EW-12]; Ministry of Science and Technology of China [2013BAC10B01]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2015B25714, 2014B34514, 2015B28514]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); key grant of Chinese Academy of Sciences; Ministry of Science and Technology of China(Ministry of Science and Technology, China); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities)","The work was jointly supported by a grant from the National Natural Science Foundation of China 41371051, a key grant of Chinese Academy of Sciences KZZD-EW-12, a grant from the Ministry of Science and Technology of China 2013BAC10B01 and grants from the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities 2015B25714, 2014B34514, and 2015B28514.",,30,16,16,2,52,IOP Publishing Ltd,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1748-9326,,,ENVIRON RES LETT,Environ.

The Last Hurrah (and The Long Haul) project was developed using theatrical storytelling as a tool to provoke thought and empathy about the lived experience of climate change. Over a period of 3 years, a company of Acting students and their lecturer worked with faculty and students from a Geography department to explore climate change stories and the physical and human geographies that shape their impacts. This paper reflects on the process, highlighting opportunities and challenges for Geographers to become involved in interdisciplinary teaching and creative engagement as part of a more holistic approach to wicked problems, and explores the impact of the learning experience with the students involved. We conclude that storytelling is profoundly suited to overcoming the psychological barriers that can stand in the way of appreciating and empathizing with the implications for everyday life of an altered climate system.

In addition, an integrated interpretation of near-surface characteristics (typically temperature and precipitation) together with cloud properties is limited. The objective of this paper is to comprehensively evaluate the performance of a 'state-of-the-art' regional convection-permitting climate model for a mid-latitude coastal region with little orographic forcing. For this purpose, an 11-year integration with the COSMO-CLM model at Convection-Permitting Scale (CPS) using a grid spacing of 2.8 km was compared with in-situ and satellite-based observations of precipitation, temperature, cloud properties and radiation (both at the surface and the top of the atmosphere). CPS clearly improves the representation of precipitation, in especially the diurnal cycle, intensity and spatial distribution of hourly precipitation. Improvements in the representation of temperature are less obvious. In fact the CPS integration overestimates both low and high temperature extremes. The underlying cause for the overestimation of high temperature extremes was attributed to deficiencies in the cloud properties: The modelled cloud fraction is only 46 % whereas a cloud fraction of 65 % was observed. Surprisingly, the effect of this deficiency was less pronounced at the radiation balance at the top of the atmosphere due to a compensating error, in particular an overestimation of the reflectivity of clouds when they are present. Overall, a better representation of convective precipitation and a very good representation of the daily cycle in different cloud types were demonstrated. However, to overcome remaining deficiencies, additional efforts are necessary to improve cloud characteristics in CPS. This will be a challenging task due to compensating deficiencies that currently exist in 'state-of-the-art' models, yielding a good representation of average climate conditions. In the light of using the CPS models to study climate change it is necessary that these deficiencies are addressed in future research.","[Brisson, Erwan; Demuzere, Matthias; Devis, Annemarie; Saeed, Sajjad; van Lipzig, Nicole P.

Owing to the complexity of terrestrial hydro-systems there is to date only limited evidence suggesting that climate change has altered river discharge in specific regions(2-5). Here we show that it is likely(6) that anthropogenic emissions have left a detectable fingerprint in renewable freshwater resources in Europe. We use the detection and attribution approach(1,7)to compare river-flowobservations8 with state-of-the-art climate model simulations(9). The analysis shows that the previously observed amplification of the south (dry)-north (wet) contrast in pan-European river flow(10) is captured by climate models only if human emissions are accounted for, although the models significantly underestimate the response. A regional analysis highlights that a strong and significant decrease is observed in the Mediterranean, generally along with a weak increase in northern Europe, whereas there is little change in transitional central Europe. As river and streamflow are indicators for renewable freshwater resources(11-13), the results highlight the necessity of raising awarenessonclimatechange projections(5,14) that indicate increasing water scarcity in southern Europe.","[Gudmundsson, Lukas; Seneviratne, Sonia I.] ETH, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, Univ Str 16, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Zhang, Xuebin] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Climate Res Div, Toronto, ON M3H 5T4, Canada",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Environment & Climate Change Canada,"Gudmundsson, L (corresponding author), ETH, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, Univ Str 16, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",lukas.gudmundsson@env.ethz.ch,"Zhang, Xuebin/ABD-7511-2021; Seneviratne, Sonia I./G-8761-2011; Gudmundsson, Lukas/I-9535-2014","Seneviratne, Sonia I./0000-0001-9528-2917; Gudmundsson, Lukas/0000-0003-3539-8621",European Union [6070085]; ERC DROUGHT-HEAT project [617518],European Union(European Commission); ERC DROUGHT-HEAT project,"This research contributes to the European Union funded EUCLEIA project (contract no. 6070085).

Rock art sites are some of the most imperiled, with their exposed contexts posing unique challenges to conservation. Consequently, effective management of publically accessible rock art sites necessitates a sustainable approach that weighs visitation in regard to cultural significance and site stability. This essay integrates rock art stability and sustainability assessment methodologies at the Painted Rock Petroglyph Site in southwestern Arizona. The study specifically applies the Rock Art Stability Index (RASI) to evaluate the natural and anthropogenic weathering forces impacting the site, and the Heritage Asset Sensitivity Gauge (HASG) to assess site sustainability under existing management practices in relation to current and forecasted rates of visitation. A spatial analysis of aggregated RASI data shows that visitor foot traffic has had some of the most profound impacts to the petroglyphs. Unrestricted access to the site area is also highly correlated with the presence and location of vandalism and graffiti, and visitor-related trampling has adversely affected the site's surface artifact assemblage. Application of the HASG projects that, while existing management practices are fairly sustainable, they become less so under forecasted increases in visitation. Further, the HASG appraises the site's cultural significance as outweighing its market appeal, indicating management efforts should prioritize conservation over tourism-related development.","[Wright, Aaron M.] Archaeol Southwest, 300 N Ash Alley, Tucson, AZ 85701 USA",,"Wright, AM (corresponding author), Archaeol Southwest, 300 N Ash Alley, Tucson, AZ 85701 USA.",aaron@archaeologysouthwest.org,,,Conservation Lands Foundation; Archaeology Southwest,Conservation Lands Foundation; Archaeology Southwest,This study was funded by the Conservation Lands Foundation and Archaeology Southwest.,,124,6,6,1,18,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1072-5369,1573-7764,,J ARCHAEOL METHOD TH,J.

The example problem setting we consider consists of predicting natural variability of the North Atlantic sea surface temperature on the interannual timescale in the pre-industrial control simulation of the Community Earth System Model. While previous works have considered the use of recurrent networks such as convolutional LSTMs and reservoir computing networks in this and other similar problem settings, we currently focus on the use of feedforward convolutional networks. In particular, we find that a feedforward convolutional network with a Densenet architecture is able to outperform a convolutional LSTM in terms of predictive skill. Next, we go on to consider a probabilistic formulation of the same network based on Stein variational gradient descent and find that in addition to providing useful measures of predictive uncertainty, the probabilistic (Bayesian) version improves on its deterministic counterpart in terms of predictive skill. Finally, we characterize the reliability of the ensemble of machine learning models obtained in the probabilistic setting by using analysis tools developed in the context of ensemble numerical weather prediction.","[Luo, Xihaier; Ren, Yihui; Xu, Wei; Yoo, Shinjae] Brookhaven Natl Lab, Computat Sci Initiat, Upton, NY 11973 USA; [Nadiga, Balasubramanya T.] Los Alamos Natl Lab, Los Alamos, NM USA; [Park, Ji Hwan] Univ Oklahoma, Sch Comp Sci, Norman, OK 73019 USA",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Brookhaven National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Los Alamos National Laboratory; University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma - Norman,"Luo, X (corresponding author), Brookhaven Natl Lab, Computat Sci Initiat, Upton, NY 11973 USA.",xluo@bnl.gov,,"Luo, Xihaier/0000-0002-7621-940X; Nadiga, Balasubramanya/0000-0001-8100-4692","U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Science's Scientific Discovery; US DOE, SC's Office of Advanced Scientific Computing Research [DE-SC-0012704]; DOE's Office of Science [DE-SC0012704]; Office of Science of the U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC0205CH11231]; NERSC [DDR-ERCAP0022110]","U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Science's Scientific Discovery(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); US DOE, SC's Office of Advanced Scientific Computing Research; DOE's Office of Science(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Office of Science of the U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); NERSC","BN was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Science's Scientific Discovery through Advanced Computation (SciDAC) program under project Non-Hydrostatic Dynamics with Multi-Moment Characteristic Discontinuous Galerkin (NH-MMCDG) Methods Phase 2.

New elements include development of an equation for evolution of anomalous SST for interannual and longer time scales in a form analogous to that for OHC, parameterization of the diffusive heat flux at the base of the mixed layer, and analysis of a composite Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) event. Contributions to OHC and SST variability from two sources are evaluated: 1) net ocean-atmosphere heat flux and 2) all other processes, including advection, diffusion, and entrainment for SST. Anomalies in OHC tendency propagate anticlockwise around the SPNA on multidecadal time scales with a clear relationship to the phase of the AMOC. AMOC anomalies lead SST tendencies, which in turn lead OHC tendencies in both the eastern and western SPNA. OHC and SST variations in the SPNA on decadal time scales are dominated by AMOC variability because it controls variability of advection, which is shown to be the dominant term in the OHC budget. Lags between OHC and SST are traced to differences between the advection term for OHC and the advection-entrainment term for SST. The new results have implications for interpretation of variations in Atlantic heat uptake in the CMIP6 climate model assessment.","[Moat, B., I; Sinha, B.; Josey, S. A.; Holliday, N. P.; New, A.

Past climatic trends are inferred from fitting a truncated Taylor series to the observational record and an ensemble of downscaled results from climate models. Analytical expressions are derived for the warming rates associated with long-term temperature trends using simple calculus. Different trend models are compared, and a third-order polynomial gives the best description of the past winter warming over southwestern Scandinavia. The coefficients from the regression analysis are used in an objective comparison of the past climatic evolution in the models and the observations. Comparisons between the temperature trends from observations and the output from an ensemble of various climate models suggest that single climate model scenarios do not provide a reliable description of the climatic evolution. Ensembles of state-of-the-art climate models, on the other hand, capture the main features of the past climatic evolution. However, there has been an interval with pronounced local winter warming over Scandinavia in the past, which is not reproduced by the majority of climate models. It is difficult to say whether this accelerated warming event was part of natural decadal variations or induced by external factors. The climate models may not yet be able to predict similar local episodes for the future if they are related to events unaccounted for, such as solar activity or volcanism.","Norwegian Meteorol Inst, N-0313 Oslo, Norway",Norwegian Meteorological Institute,"Benestad, RE (corresponding author), Norwegian Meteorol Inst, POB 43, N-0313 Oslo, Norway.",,"Benestad, Rasmus E./I-3156-2019","Benestad, Rasmus E./0000-0002-5969-4508",,,,,32,33,33,0,7,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

We identify regions and socioeconomic sectors of interest and propose a method to evaluate the methodological consistency of the studies with the current state-of-the-art. The review shows that the topic has grown substantially in this decade, reaching 63 documents until 2018. The sectors under highest concern are the hydropower and the drinking water supply. The Parana and Atlantico Nordeste Oriental hydrographic regions received great attention; whereas the Atlantico Sudeste did not. In terms of methodology, the use of multi-model ensemble leaves room for improvement. The results suggest a lack of human resources and access to computational infrastructure to handle climate data. Given the current challenges that Brazilian science is facing, we suggest the synchronization of efforts among research institutions.

In Australia they contribute to the economic, social, and environmental sustainability of the communities and regions in which they are located. However, museums are facing challenges that are leading them to rethink their products and services, to improve their economic position, and to remain competitive in the marketplace. In this climate of change, the role of the volunteer is growing increasingly important to the operation of museums and art museums. However, why persons choose to volunteer for these attractions is not well understood. This article reports on initial findings from a wider study of volunteers in museums and art museums that was designed to explore volunteer motivation, expectations, values, and commitment. Factor analysis identified eight underlying dimensions to volunteer motivation for individuals in this field. This article has three objectives: first, to set the sustainable context in which museums and art museums operate; secondly, to present the initial findings of volunteer motivation; and thirdly, to discuss the implications they have for sustainable volunteer management.","[Edwards, Deborah] Univ Western Sydney, Coll Law & Business, Sch Management, Penrith, NSW 1797, Australia",Western Sydney University,"Edwards, D (corresponding author), Sch Management, Coll Law & Business, Locked Bag 1797,Penrith South, Sydney, NSW 1797, Australia.",d.edwards@uws.edu.au,"Edwards, Deborah C/M-6845-2013","Edwards, Deborah C/0000-0002-8345-9700",,,,,31,32,32,1,2,COGNIZANT COMMUNICATION CORP,PUTNAM VALLEY,"18 PEEKSKILL HOLLOW RD, PO BOX 37, PUTNAM VALLEY, NY 10579 USA",1544-2721,1943-4421,,TOUR REV INT,Tour.

If these goals are to be fulfilled under changing environmental conditions, a readjustment of the current management plan may be needed. Therefore, this paper investigates the economic impacts of managing the cod, sprat and herring stocks in the eastern Baltic Sea, given on-going climate change, which is known to affect cod recruitment negatively. It is shown that climate change may have severe biological and economic consequences under the current cod management plan and that the negative effects on the economic performance of the fishermen as well as on the abundance of cod can be mitigated by reducing the target fishing mortality rate of cod. These results are obtained by simulating three management scenarios in which the economic consequences of different management objectives for the fishing fleets are assessed through a dynamic multi-species and multi-fleet bio-economic assessment model that include both species interactions and climate change.

While impact assessment and adaptation planning rely on high-resolution projections (typically in the order of a few kilometers), state-of-the-art Earth System Models (ESMs) are available at spatial resolutions of few hundreds of kilometers. Current solutions to obtain high-resolution projections of ESMs include downscaling approaches that consider the information at a coarse-scale to make predictions at local scales. Complex and non-linear interdependence among local climate variables (e.g., temperature and precipitation) and large-scale predictors (e.g., pressure fields) motivate the use of neural network-based super-resolution architectures. In this work, we present auxiliary variables informed spatio-temporal neural architecture for statistical downscaling.

Instrumental and paleoclimate data indicate that natural hydroclimate fluctuations tend to be more energetic at low (multidecadal to multicentury) than at high (interannual) frequencies. State-of-the-art global climate models do not capture this characteristic of hydroclimate variability, suggesting that the models underestimate the risk of future persistent droughts. Methods are developed here for assessing the risk of such events in the coming century using climate model projections as well as observational (paleoclimate) information. Where instrumental and paleoclimate data are reliable, these methods may provide a more complete view of prolonged drought risk. In the U.S. Southwest, for instance, state-of-the-art climate model projections suggest the risk of a decade-scale megadrought in the coming century is less than 50%; the analysis herein suggests that the risk is at least 80%, and may be higher than 90% in certain areas. The likelihood of longer-lived events (>35 yr) is between 20% and 50%, and the risk of an unprecedented 50-yr megadrought is nonnegligible under the most severe warming scenario (5%-10%). These findings are important to consider as adaptation and mitigation strategies are developed to cope with regional impacts of climate change, where population growth is high and multidecadal megadrought worse than anything seen during the last 2000 years would pose unprecedented challenges to water resources in the region.","[Ault, Toby R.] Cornell Univ, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Cole, Julia E.; Overpeck, Jonathan T.] Univ Arizona, Dept Geosci, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Cole, Julia E.; Overpeck, Jonathan T.] Univ Arizona, Dept Atmospher Sci, Tucson, AZ USA; [Pederson, Gregory T.] US Geol Survey, Bozeman, MT USA; [Meko, David M.] Univ Arizona, Lab Tree Ring Res, Tucson, AZ USA",Cornell University; University of Arizona; University of Arizona; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; University of Arizona,"Ault, TR (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Bradfield Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",toby.ault@cornell.edu,"Cole, Julia/ABA-5759-2020","Cole, Julia/0000-0002-3389-7809",NSF [P2C2 (0903093)]; NCAR-ASP; NOAA CCDD [NA07OAR4310054]; NOAA Climate Program Office; NSF EaSM2 Grant [1243125]; Directorate For Geosciences [1243125] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NCAR-ASP(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)); NOAA CCDD(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); NOAA Climate Program Office(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); NSF EaSM2 Grant; Directorate For Geosciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)),"We thank Steve Gray, Jeff Lukas, Connie Woodhouse, and the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation for assistance, and we appreciate the helpful reviews we received from Joellen Russell and Scott St. George.

First, historical climate trend analyses illustrated mean temperature increases ranging from 0.26-1.2 degrees C in a representative sample of provincial parks. Second, General Circulation Models (GCMs) projected increases in annual temperature of about 1.8-3.2 degrees C in the 2020s, 1.8- 7 degrees C in the 2050s, and 2.5 degrees C-10 degrees C in the 2080s in the same representative sample ofprovincial parks. Third, results of the fire severity change analysis generally indicated a considerable decrease in the 'lowfire severity rankings and increases in the 'high, 'very high, and 'severe fire severity rankingsfor the majority of Ontario provincialpark' by the 2050s (similar to 2 x CO2) and especially the 2090s (similar to 3 x CO2). Finally, vegetation modelling results showed the potentialfor substantial change in biome-type in Ontario provincial park system (64-93% depending on the scenario used). The study identified a number of park policy and planning sensitivities, notably that the Ontario Parks system plan has been designed to protect specific natural features, species, and communities in situ, and not take into account shifts in ecosystem structure and distribution that could be induced by global climatic change. Ultimately, however, the anticipated changes in ecosystem structure and composition expected under climatic change, coupled with some species' inability to adapt genetically to new climatic conditions or migrate to suitable climatic and vegetation zones, could hinder the ability of Ontario protected area managers to maintain some habitats and species populations in the future.","Univ Waterloo, Dept Geography, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada",University of Waterloo,,cjlemieu@fes.uwaterloo.ca,"Scott, Daniel/AAB-6190-2020","Scott, Daniel/0000-0001-7825-9301",,,,,54,0,0,1,11,PARKS RESEARCH FORUM ONTARIO,WATERLOO,"UNIV WATERLOO, WATERLOO, ON N2L 3G1, CANADA",,,978-0-9737544-2-1,STATE ART WORKSH SER,,,2005,1,,,,21,35,,,,,,15,Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BGH00,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000246814800002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Detection of subtle indicators from a background of natural variability requires measurements over a time base of decades. This places severe demands on the instrumentation used, requiring measurements of sufficient accuracy and sensitivity that can allow reliable judgements to be made decades apart. The International System of Units ( SI) and the network of National Metrology Institutes were developed to address such requirements. However, ensuring and maintaining SI traceability of sufficient accuracy in instruments orbiting the Earth presents a significant new challenge to the metrology community. This paper highlights some key measurands and applications driving the uncertainty demand of the climate community in the solar reflective domain, e. g. solar irradiances and reflectances/radiances of the Earth. It discusses how meeting these uncertainties facilitate significant improvement in the forecasting abilities of climate models. After discussing the current state of the art, it describes a new satellite mission, called TRUTHS, which enables, for the first time, high-accuracy SI traceability to be established in orbit. The direct use of a 'primary standard' and replication of the terrestrial traceability chain extends the SI into space, in effect realizing a 'metrology laboratory in space'.","[Fox, Nigel; Winkler, Rainer; Woolliams, Emma] Natl Phys Lab, Teddington TW11 0LW, Middx, England; [Kaiser-Weiss, Andrea] Univ Reading, Natl Ctr Earth Observat, Reading RG6 6BB, Berks, England; [Schmutz, Werner] Phys Meteorol Observ Davos, World Radiat Ctr, CH-7260 Davos, Switzerland; [Thome, Kurtis] NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; [Young, Dave; Wielicki, Bruce] NASA, Langley Res Ctr, Hampton, VA 23681 USA",National Physical Laboratory - UK; UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); NERC National Centre for Earth Observation; University of Reading; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Langley Research Center,"Fox, N (corresponding author), Natl Phys Lab, Hampton Rd, Teddington TW11 0LW, Middx, England.",nigel.fox@npl.co.uk,"Wielicki, Bruce/AAX-3676-2020; Woolliams, Emma R/A-2404-2014; Thome, Kurtis J/D-7251-2012; Schmutz, Werner K/B-4153-2014; Fox, Nigel/ACL-1124-2022","Woolliams, Emma R/0000-0003-3517-1486; Schmutz, Werner K/0000-0003-1159-5639; ",National Measurement Office of the BIS Department of the UK,National Measurement Office of the BIS Department of the UK,"The authors would like to acknowledge the support and contributions of the following individuals (alphabetical by host institute) and organizations to the TRUTHS mission concept, which is in part summarized by this paper: T.

A conceptual framework of long-term adaptation planning for climate change in road systems is proposed to ensure the resilience and sustainability of road transport systems under various climate risks such as flooding and increased temperature. To do so, an advanced Fuzzy Bayesian Reasoning (FBR) model is first employed to evaluate the climate risks in the UK road transport networks. This modelling approach can tackle the high uncertainty in risk data and thus facilitate the development of the climate adaptation framework and its application in the UK road sector. To examine the feasibility of this model, a nationwide survey is conducted among the stakeholders to analyse the climate risks, in terms of the timeframe of climate threats, the likelihood of occurrence, the severity of consequences, and infrastructure resilience. From the modelling perspective, this work brings novelty by expanding the risk attribute the severity of consequence into three sub-attributes including economic loss, damage to the environment, and injuries and/or loss of life. It advances the-state-of-the-art technique in the current relevant literature from a single to multiple tier climate risk modelling structure. Secondly, an Evidential Reasoning (ER) approach is used to prioritise the best adaptation measure(s) by considering both the risk analysis results from the FBR and the implementation costs simultaneously. The main new contributions of this part lie in the rich raw data collected from the real world to provide useful practical insights for achieving road resilience when facing increasing climate risk challenges. During this process, a qualitative analysis of several national reports regarding the impacts posed by climate change, risk assessment and adaptation measures in the UK road sector is conducted for the relevant decision data (i.e. risk and cost). It is also supplemented by an in-depth interview with a senior planner from Highways England. The findings provide road planners and decision makers with useful insights on identification and prioritisation of climate threats as well as selection of cost-effective climate adaptation measures to rationalise adaptation planning.","[Wang, Tianni; Qu, Zhuohua; Nichol, Timothy] Liverpool John Moores Univ, Liverpool Business Sch, Liverpool, Merseyside, England; [Wang, Tianni; Yang, Zaili] Liverpool John Moores Univ, Liverpool Logist Offshore & Marine Res Inst, Liverpool, Merseyside, England; [Wang, Tianni; Clarke, Geoff; Bowden, Daniel] AECOM UK Ltd, Logist Dept, London, England; [Dimitriu, Delia] Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Res Ctr Ecol & Environm, Manchester, Lancs, England",Liverpool John Moores University; University of Liverpool; Liverpool John Moores University; Manchester Metropolitan University,"Yang, ZL (corresponding author), Liverpool John Moores Univ, Liverpool Logist Offshore & Marine Res Inst, Liverpool, Merseyside, England.",z.yang@ljmu.ac.uk,"zhao, yang/GXF-4424-2022; yang, zaili/A-6493-2013","yang, zaili/0000-0003-1385-493X; Nichol, Timothy/0000-0001-7130-0789",Liverpool John Moores University; AECOM UK; EU H2020 MC RISE programme [GOLF-777742],Liverpool John Moores University; AECOM UK; EU H2020 MC RISE programme,"This research is financially supported by Liverpool John Moores University, AECOM UK and EU H2020 MC RISE programme (Grant No. GOLF-777742).",,98,15,15,4,42,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",1361-9209,,,TRANSPORT RES D-TR E,Transport.

Resolving this issue is essential for adequate attribution of human-induced climate change. The purpose of this paper is to provide a perspective on multidecadal variability from the analysis of observations and results from model simulations. Data from the instrumental record indicate the existence of large-scale coherent patterns of multidecadal variability in sea surface temperature. Combined with long time series of proxy data, these results provide ample evidence for the existence of multidecadal sea surface temperature variations. Results of a hierarchy of climate models have provided several mechanisms of this variability, ranging from pure atmospheric forcing, via internal ocean processes to coupled ocean-atmosphere interactions. An important problem is that current state-of-the-art climate models underestimate multidecadal variability. We argue that these models miss important processes in their representation of ocean eddies and focus on a robust mechanism of multidecadal variability which is found in multi-century simulations with climate models having a strongly eddying ocean component.","[Juling, Andre; Dijkstra, Henk A.] Univ Utrecht, Inst Marine & Atmospher Res Utrecht, Dept Phys, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Hogg, Andrew McC] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Earth Sci, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Hogg, Andrew McC] Australian Natl Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Climate Extremes, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Moon, Woosok] Stockholm Univ, Dept Math, Stockholm, Sweden",Utrecht University; Australian National University; Australian National University; Stockholm University,"Dijkstra, HA (corresponding author), Univ Utrecht, Inst Marine & Atmospher Res Utrecht, Dept Phys, Utrecht, Netherlands.",h.a.dijkstra@uu.nl,"Hogg, Andy/AAZ-8733-2021; Hogg, Andy McC./A-7553-2011","Hogg, Andy/0000-0001-5898-7635; Hogg, Andy McC./0000-0001-5898-7635; Juling, Andre/0000-0003-2554-9641","Netherlands Earth System Science Centre (NESSC) - Ministry of Education, Culture and Science (OCW) [024.002.001]; Netherlands Science Foundation (NWO) [15502]; ARC Center for of Excellence on Climate Extremes (CLEX)","Netherlands Earth System Science Centre (NESSC) - Ministry of Education, Culture and Science (OCW); Netherlands Science Foundation (NWO)(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)); ARC Center for of Excellence on Climate Extremes (CLEX)","AJ and HD acknowledge support by the Netherlands Earth System Science Centre (NESSC), financially supported by the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science (OCW), Grant No. 024.002.001.

Here we quantify biases in the climatological state and dynamics of the transport of oceanic heat into the Nordic Seas across the Greenland-Scotland ridge in 23 state-of-the-art global climate models that participated in the Climate Model Intercomparison Project phase 5. The mean poleward heat transport, its seasonal cycle and interannual variability are inconsistently represented across these models, with a vast majority underestimating them and a few models greatly overestimating them. The main predictor for these biases is the resolution of the model via its representation of the Greenland-Scotland ridge bathymetry: the higher the resolution, the larger the heat transport through the section. The second predictor is the large-scale ocean circulation, which is also connected to the bathymetry: models with the largest heat transport import water from the European slope current into all three straits of the Greenland-Scotland ridge, whereas those with a weak transport import water from the Labrador Sea. The third predictor is the spatial pattern of their main atmospheric modes of variability (North Atlantic Oscillation, East Atlantic and Scandinavian patterns), where the models with a weak inflow have their atmospheric low-pressure centre shifted south towards the central Atlantic. We argue that the key to a better representation of the large-scale oceanic heat transport from the North Atlantic to the Arctic in global models resides not only in higher resolution, but also in a better bathymetry and representation of the complex ocean-ice-atmosphere interactions.","[Heuze, Celine] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Earth Sci, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Arthun, Marius] Univ Bergen, Geophys Inst, Bergen, Norway; [Arthun, Marius] Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, Bergen, Norway",University of Gothenburg; University of Bergen; Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research,"Heuze, C (corresponding author), Univ Gothenburg, Dept Earth Sci, Gothenburg, Sweden.",celine.heuze@gu.se,"Heuzé, Céline/U-5058-2017","Heuzé, Céline/0000-0002-8850-5868; Arthun, Marius/0000-0003-4500-1691",VINNOVA Marie Curie Cofund fellowship [2015-01487]; Research Council of Sweden project WAOW [2018-03859]; Research Council of Norway project PATHWAY [263223]; Blue-Action project (European Union Horizon 2020 research and innovation program) [727852],VINNOVA Marie Curie Cofund fellowship; Research Council of Sweden project WAOW; Research Council of Norway project PATHWAY; Blue-Action project (European Union Horizon 2020 research and innovation program),"C.H. is funded by a VINNOVA Marie Curie Cofund fellowship (Dnr. 2015-01487) and the Research Council of Sweden project WAOW (Dnr. 2018-03859).

In the spirit of Lord Dahrendorf, this paper represents the output of interdisciplinary collaboration and integrates state-of-the-art academic expertise from the fields of philosophy, economics and governance. Our focus is on Europe, which is widely perceived as a leader in climate change mitigation and adaptation. However, leadership weakness on climate over recent years, largely due to recession and political vacillation, is eroding this perception. What is needed is a firm justification for strong climate action, acknowledgement of the available tools, awareness of the reasons for our failures to date, and a realistic, but goal-oriented strategy for an integrated climate policy. We therefore present current normative insights from climate justice research highlighting the need to make institutions responsive to those most vulnerable; we discuss the economics of the transition to a low-carbon economy, pointing to key policy instruments and post-2020 climate targets for the EU; we contrast the normative and quantitative synoptic principles with the particularistic implementation schemes and politics of (not) implementing measures on the ground; and we suggest a careful coordination of European climate policies with acute challenges that could increase both climate justice and political feasibility.","[Creutzig, Felix] Mercator Res Inst Global Commons & Climate Change, Berlin, Germany; [Hedahl, Marcus] US Naval Acad, Annapolis, MD 21402 USA; [Rydge, James] Global Green Growth Inst, Seoul, South Korea; [Szulecki, Kacper] Univ Oslo, Dept Polit Sci, N-0316 Oslo, Norway",United States Department of Defense; United States Navy; United States Naval Academy; University of Oslo,"Creutzig, F (corresponding author), Mercator Res Inst Global Commons & Climate Change, Berlin, Germany.",,"Creutzig, Felix/B-8691-2016; Szulecki, Kacper/AAM-6587-2021; Szulecki, Kacper/H-1237-2013","Creutzig, Felix/0000-0002-5710-3348; Szulecki, Kacper/0000-0002-1835-3758; Szulecki, Kacper/0000-0002-1835-3758",,,,,54,7,7,1,33,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1758-5880,1758-5899,,GLOB POLICY,Glob.

Projected changes in both snow cover and temperature are presented for a range of future emissions scenarios, and implications for the continued survival of the wolverine in the contiguous US are discussed. It is shown that under a high or medium-low emissions scenario there are likely to be dramatic reductions in spring snow cover in present-day wolverine habitats. Under these scenarios there is also likely to be a concomitant increase in summer-time temperatures, with projected maximum daily August temperatures far above those currently tolerated by the wolverine. It is likely that the wolverine, with its many adaptations for cold weather and deep snow pack, would have great difficulty adapting to such changes. The results of the simulations presented here suggest that the very low numbers of wolverines currently living in the contiguous US will likely further decline in response to the deterioration of their habitat in coming decades.","Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Boulder, CO 80305 USA",National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA,"Peacock, S (corresponding author), Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, 1850 Table Mesa Dr, Boulder, CO 80305 USA.",synte@ucar.edu,,,National Science Foundation,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),The author would like to thank Mariana Vertenstein and Andrew Mai for their efforts in choreographing the 21st century runs with daily output.

In the present study, we developed and validated the hybrid model for the Syr Darya River basin based on a combination of state-of-the-art hydrological and machine learning models. Climate change impact on freshwater inflow into the Small Aral Sea for the projection period 2007-2099 has been quantified based on the developed hybrid model and bias corrected and downscaled meteorological projections simulated by four General Circulation Models (GCM) for each of three Representative Concentration Pathway scenarios (RCP). The developed hybrid model reliably simulates freshwater inflow for the historical period with a Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency of 0.72 and a Kling-Gupta efficiency of 0.77. Results of the climate change impact assessment showed that the freshwater inflow projections produced by different GCMs are misleading by providing contradictory results for the projection period. However, we identified that the relative runoff changes are expected to be more pronounced in the case of more aggressive RCP scenarios. The simulated projections of freshwater inflow provide a basis for further assessment of climate change impacts on hydrological and ecological conditions of the Small Aral Sea in the 21st Century.","[Ayzel, Georgy] Univ Potsdam, Inst Environm Sci & Geog, D-14476 Potsdam, Germany; [Ayzel, Georgy] State Hydrol Inst, St Petersburg 199004, Russia; [Ayzel, Georgy] Russian Acad Sci, Water Problems Inst, Moscow 119333, Russia; [Izhitskiy, Alexander] Russian Acad Sci, Shirshov Inst Oceanol, Moscow 117997, Russia",University of Potsdam; Russian Academy of Sciences; Institute of Water Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences; Russian Academy of Sciences; Shirshov Institute of Oceanology,"Ayzel, G (corresponding author), Univ Potsdam, Inst Environm Sci & Geog, D-14476 Potsdam, Germany.;Ayzel, G (corresponding author), State Hydrol Inst, St Petersburg 199004, Russia.;Ayzel, G (corresponding author), Russian Acad Sci, Water Problems Inst, Moscow 119333, Russia.",ayzel@uni-potsdam.de; izh@ocean.ru,"Izhitskiy, Alexander S/E-6914-2014","Izhitskiy, Alexander S/0000-0001-6156-6460",Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR) [17-05-01175]; RFBR [19-35-60005]; Russian Science Foundation [16-17-10039]; Ministry of Science and Education of Russia [0149-2019-0003]; Russian Science Foundation [19-17-13002] Funding Source: Russian Science Foundation,Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR)(Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR)); RFBR(Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR)); Russian Science Foundation(Russian Science Foundation (RSF)); Ministry of Science and Education of Russia; Russian Science Foundation(Russian Science Foundation (RSF)),"This work was undertaken within the frame of the SMASHI (Small Aral Sea Hydrological Investigation) project (http://smashiproject.github.io) and was funded by the Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR), Project Number 17-05-01175.

The IPCC (2007) Fourth Assessment Report states that warming of the climate system is unequivocal, and that this warming has likely influenced observed changes in many physical systems at the global scale. In order to meet target safety and performances levels when designing structures and infrastructure systems in the future, it is essential that current design codes and standards adapt to reflect global climate change. With the trend toward performance-based engineering, for US coastal regions, along the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico, this means a quantitative assessment of climate change impact on hurricane hazard performance levels is needed. This study couples a projected climate change scenario with state-of-the-art probabilistic event-based simulation procedures to assess the hurricane wind hazard under a worst-case climate change scenario. The hurricane wind hazard is defined herein using the hurricane intensity (maximum wind speed) and hurricane size (radius to maximum wind speed). Through Monte Carlo simulation, 10,000 years of hurricane events, under the current (2012) and future (2100) climate conditions, were generated. The hurricane intensity distribution and the joint distribution of hurricane intensity and size, under current and future climate scenarios, were then compared. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

As sessile organisms with long generation times, their adaptation to a local changing environment may rely on epigenetic modifications when allele frequencies are not able to shift fast enough. However, the current lack of knowledge on this field is remarkable, due to many challenges that researchers face when studying this issue. Huge genome sizes, absence of reference genomes and annotation, and having to analyze huge amounts of data are among these difficulties, which limit the current ability to understand how climate change drives tree species epigenetic modifications. In spite of this challenging framework, some insights on the relationships among climate change-induced stress and epigenomics are coming. Advances in DNA sequencing technologies and an increasing number of studies dealing with this topic must boost our knowledge on tree adaptive capacity to changing environmental conditions.

The analysis is undertaken using a cost-minimisation model for the entire BS region, the BALTCOST model. In the present research, the model has been extended to include greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions effects, enabling us to analyse the trade-offs between cost-effective GHG and nutrient load reductions. We run the model for four different scenarios in order to compare the environmental and economic consequences of contrasting strategies: single environmental objective management versus joint implementation strategy. The results show that implementing land-based measures with a sole focus on water quality (to meet the HELCOM's 2013 Baltic Sea Action Plan nutrient abatement targets) can produce climate change mitigation co-benefits equivalent to 2.3% of the 2005 emission level (from agriculture and waste water combined) for the entirety of the BS region. More interestingly, a joint implementation strategy can deliver further climate change mitigation benefit (i.e. up to 5.4%) at a marginal cost that is comparable to mitigation costs reported by other studies for efficient technologies. All in all the results demonstrate that a joint strategy to improve water quality and to reduce climate change is economically beneficial. Our findings show that the cost and the outcome of the implementation vary between countries. This illustrates the need to develop a joint regional policy for water and climate regulation that fully considers the asymmetry in both the expected effects and cost distribution across the countries in the region.","[Nainggolan, Doan; Hasler, Berit; Gyldenkaerne, Steen; Termansen, Mette] Aarhus Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Frederiksborgvej 399, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark; [Andersen, Hans E.] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci Catchment Sci & Environm Management, Vejlsovej 25, DK-8600 Silkeborg, Denmark",Aarhus University; Aarhus University,"Nainggolan, D (corresponding author), Aarhus Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Frederiksborgvej 399, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark.",dna@envs.au.dk,"Nainggolan, Doan/AAD-7693-2022; Hasler, Berit/F-8309-2015","Nainggolan, Doan/0000-0002-3197-7792; Hasler, Berit/0000-0003-0433-4086; Andersen, Hans Estrup/0000-0003-2465-583X; Termansen, Mette/0000-0003-4875-2810",European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) through ECOFINDERS project [264465]; Norden Top-level Research Initiative sub-programme 'Effect Studies and Adaptation to Climate Change' through the Nordic Centre of Excellence for Strategic Adaptation Research (NORD-STAR); BONUS [Art 185]; EU; Danish Innovation Fund,European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) through ECOFINDERS project; Norden Top-level Research Initiative sub-programme 'Effect Studies and Adaptation to Climate Change' through the Nordic Centre of Excellence for Strategic Adaptation Research (NORD-STAR); BONUS; EU(European Commission); Danish Innovation Fund,"The preparation of this paper has been supported by the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) through ECOFINDERS project (Grant Agreement No: 264465) and by the Norden Top-level Research Initiative sub-programme 'Effect Studies and Adaptation to Climate Change' through the Nordic Centre of Excellence for Strategic Adaptation Research (NORD-STAR).

Two main interpretations dispute the goal's reach, threatening its transformational potential. If left unresolved, the controversy may also mask trade-offs, allowing for unintentional harm to countries already vulnerable to climate change. Here we build on four methods to show that Art. 2.1(c) comprises a new meaning of 'finance' under the United Nations negotiations. In contrast to climate finance provision to developing countries (Art. 9), the climate consistency of finance flows represents a purpose that relies on support and action to transform the global financial system. Implementation of Art. 2.1(c) requires engagement by governments and non-state actors, including the financial sector. While solutions for Art. 2.1(c) will need to be adequate for countries' contexts, accounting of trade-offs should ensure some level of convergence towards a global, timely and equitable progress towards climate consistency of finance flows.

For precipitation, a wide range of climate model runs is available. However, for particular meteorological variables used for the calculation of potential evapotranspiration (ETo), availability of climate model runs is limited. It is preferred that climate model runs are considered coupled when calculating changes in precipitation and ETo amounts, in order to preserve the internal physical consistency. This results in constraints on the maximum ensemble size. In this paper, we investigate the correlation between climate change signals of precipitation and ETo. It is found that, for two medium-sized catchments in Belgium, uncoupling climate model runs used for calculation of change signals of precipitation and ETo amounts does not result in a significant bias for changes in extreme flow. With these results, future impact studies can be conducted with larger ensemble sizes, resulting in a more complete uncertainty estimation.","[De Niel, Jan; Van Uytven, E.; Willems, P.] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Civil Engn, Hydraul Sect, Leuven, Belgium",KU Leuven,"De Niel, J (corresponding author), Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Civil Engn, Hydraul Sect, Leuven, Belgium.",jan.deniel@kuleuven.be,"Willems, Patrick/A-9715-2010","Willems, Patrick/0000-0002-7085-2570; De Niel, Jan/0000-0002-6803-9679",Fund for Scientific Research (FWO) -Flanders,Fund for Scientific Research (FWO) -Flanders(FWO),The second author obtained a scholarship from the Fund for Scientific Research (FWO) -Flanders.

Additionally, uncoupled simulations are conducted with the atmospheric component of the KCM to obtain further insight into the mean-state dependence. It is found that the positive zonal wind feedback and the negative heat flux feedback, with the short-wave flux as dominant component, are strongly linearly related through sea surface temperature (SST) and differences in model physics are less important. In observations, strong zonal wind and heat flux feedbacks are caused by a convective response in the western central equatorial Pacific (Nio4 region), resulting from an eastward (westward) shift of the rising branch of the Walker Circulation (WC) during El Nio (La Nia). Many state-of-the-art climate models exhibit an equatorial cold SST bias in the Nio4 region, i.e. are in a La Nia-like mean-state. Therefore they simulate a too westward located rising branch of the WC (by up to 30A degrees) and only a weak convective response. Thus, the position of the WC determines the strength of both the amplifying wind and usually damping heat flux feedback, which also explains why biases in these two feedbacks partly compensate in many climate models. Furthermore, too weak atmospheric feedbacks can cause quite different ENSO dynamics than observed, while enhanced atmospheric feedbacks lead to a substantial improvement of important ENSO properties such as seasonal ENSO phase locking and asymmetry between El Nio and La Nia. Differences in the mean-state SST are suggested to be a major source of ENSO diversity in current climate models.","[Bayr, Tobias; Wengel, Christian; Harlass, Jan; Park, Wonsun] GEOMAR Helmholtz Ctr Ocean Res, Dusternbrooker Weg 20, D-24105 Kiel, Germany; [Latif, Mojib] Univ Kiel, Cluster Excellence Future Ocean, D-24105 Kiel, Germany; [Dommenget, Dietmar] Monash Univ, Sch Math Sci, Clayton, Vic, Australia",Helmholtz Association; GEOMAR Helmholtz Center for Ocean Research Kiel; University of Kiel; Monash University,"Bayr, T (corresponding author), GEOMAR Helmholtz Ctr Ocean Res, Dusternbrooker Weg 20, D-24105 Kiel, Germany.",tbayr@geomar.de,"Latif, Mojib/C-2428-2016; Harlass, Jan/P-4389-2019; Park, Wonsun/J-8097-2012; Dommenget, Dietmar/B-9828-2011","Latif, Mojib/0000-0003-1079-5604; Harlass, Jan/0000-0002-3993-6960; Park, Wonsun/0000-0002-6345-8428; Dommenget, Dietmar/0000-0002-5129-7719",SFB [754]; European Union's InterDec project; ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science [CE110001028]; ARC project Beyond the linear dynamics of the El Nino Southern Oscillation [DP120101442],SFB(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)); European Union's InterDec project; ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science(Australian Research Council); ARC project Beyond the linear dynamics of the El Nino Southern Oscillation(Australian Research Council),"We acknowledge the World Climate Research Program's Working Group on Coupled Modeling, the individual modeling groups of the Climate Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP3 and CMIP5), the UK Met Office, ECMWF, NOAA, ISCCP and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution for providing the data sets.

Yet, tree death remains one of the least understood processes of forest dynamics. Recently, changes in tree mortality have been observed in forests around the globe, which could profoundly affect ecosystem functioning and services provisioning to society. We describe continental-scale patterns of recent tree mortality from the only consistent pan-European forest monitoring network, identifying recent mortality hotspots in southern and northern Europe. Analyzing 925,462 annual observations of 235,895 trees between 2000 and 2012, we determine the influence of climate variability and tree age on interannual variation in tree mortality using Cox proportional hazard models. Warm summers as well as high seasonal variability in precipitation increased the likelihood of tree death. However, our data also suggest that reduced cold-induced mortality could compensate increased mortality related to peak temperatures in a warming climate. Besides climate variability, age was an important driver of tree mortality, with individual mortality probability decreasing with age over the first century of a trees life. A considerable portion of the observed variation in tree mortality could be explained by satellite-derived net primary productivity, suggesting that widely available remote sensing products can be used as an early warning indicator of widespread tree mortality. Our findings advance the understanding of patterns of large-scale tree mortality by demonstrating the influence of seasonal and diurnal climate variation, and highlight the potential of state-of-the-art remote sensing to anticipate an increased likelihood of tree mortality in space and time.","[Neumann, Mathias; Hasenauer, Hubert; Seidl, Rupert] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Silviculture, Vienna, Austria; [Mues, Volker] Univ Hamburg, Ctr Wood Sci, Hamburg, Germany; [Moreno, Adam] NASA, Ames Res Ctr, Moffett Field, CA 94035 USA","University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna; University of Hamburg; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Ames Research Center","Neumann, M (corresponding author), Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Silviculture, Vienna, Austria.",mathias.neumann@boku.ac.at,"Forests, ICP/F-7626-2019; Seidl, Rupert/ABE-6078-2020","Seidl, Rupert/0000-0002-3338-3402; Neumann, Mathias/0000-0003-2472-943X","European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for Research, Technological Development and Demonstration [311970]; Austrian Science Fund FWF [Y895-B25]","European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for Research, Technological Development and Demonstration; Austrian Science Fund FWF(Austrian Science Fund (FWF))","European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for Research, Technological Development and Demonstration, Grant/Award Number: 311970; Austrian Science Fund FWF, Grant/Award Number: Y895-B25",,63,115,119,7,122,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

Within this context, a suite of state-of-the-art RCMs was employed for the creation of probabilistic future regional climate change scenarios for Europe. Among others, one measure to determine the individual RCM-weights is their ability to reproduce the observed trends in 2 m temperature in the reanalysis (ERA40)-driven experiments for the period 1960-2000. As the reference, we used the new ENSEMBLES observational gridded dataset for Europe (E-OBS). As additional datasets for comparisons, we also used the near-surface temperature datasets from the CRU observations and from the ERA40 and NCEP/NCAR reanalysis. The analysis was performed for the land fraction of 8 different European regions, the so-called PRUDENCE regions defined within the PRUDENCE project (http://prudence.dmi.dk). Annual and seasonal linear trends in near-surface temperature were computed for each ENSEMBLES RCM, the E-OBS dataset, and for the additional datasets mentioned above. In all regions, the computed linear temperature trends based on annual mean temperatures showed smaller values for the RCMs and the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis than for both observational datasets, and in most regions also smaller values than for the ERA40 reanalysis dataset. Depending on the magnitude of the difference in linear trends between the individual RCMs and the E-OBS dataset, skill scores were assigned to each RCM. The resulting skill scores were of similar magnitude (0.7-0.9) for the different models and regions (except for Scandinavia, which had lower skill scores around 0.6-0.8). Spatially aggregated for all of Europe, and combined from annual and seasonal into one value for each RCM, these skill scores were included in the general ENSEMBLES RCM weighting system","[Lorenz, Philip; Jacob, Daniela] Max Planck Inst Meteorol, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany",Max Planck Society,"Lorenz, P (corresponding author), Free Univ Berlin, Inst Meteorol, Carl Heinrich Becker Weg 6-10, D-12165 Berlin, Germany.",Philip.Lorenz@fu-berlin.de,,,European Commission [GOCE-CT-2003-505539],European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre),"This work was supported by the European Commission Programme FP6 under the contract GOCE-CT-2003-505539 (ENSEMBLES).

The application of these methods in a climate change context is problematic since there is no clear understanding on how these methods may affect key magnitudes, for example, the climate change signal or trend, under different sources of uncertainty. Two relevant sources of uncertainty, often overlooked, are the sensitivity to the observational reference used to calibrate the method and the effect of the resolution mismatch between model and observations (downscaling effect). In the present work, we assess the impact of these factors on the climate change signal of temperature and precipitation considering marginal, temporal and extreme aspects. We use eight standard and state-of-the-art bias adjustment methods (spanning a variety of methods regarding their nature-empirical or parametric-, fitted parameters and trend-preservation) for a case study in the Iberian Peninsula. The quantile trend-preserving methods (namely quantile delta mapping (QDM), scaled distribution mapping (SDM) and the method from the third phase of ISIMIP-ISIMIP3) preserve better the raw signals for the different indices and variables considered (not all preserved by construction). However, they rely largely on the reference dataset used for calibration, thus presenting a larger sensitivity to the observations, especially for precipitation intensity, spells and extreme indices. Thus, high-quality observational datasets are essential for comprehensive analyses in larger (continental) domains. Similar conclusions hold for experiments carried out at high (approximately 20 km) and low (approximately 120 km) spatial resolutions.","[Casanueva, Ana; Herrera, Sixto] Univ Cantabria, Dept Matemat Aplicada & Ciencias Computac, Meteorol Grp, Santander, Spain; [Iturbide, Maialen; Gutierrez, Jose M.] Univ Cantabria, CSIC, Inst Fis Cantabria, Meteorol Grp, Santander, Spain; [Lange, Stefan] Leibniz Assoc, Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res PIK, Potsdam, Germany; [Jury, Martin; Maraun, Douglas] Graz Univ, Wegener Ctr Climate & Global Change, Graz, Austria; [Jury, Martin] CNS, BSC, Earth Sci Dept, Barcelona, Spain; [Dosio, Alessandro] European Commiss, JRC, Ispra, Italy",Universidad de Cantabria; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); Universidad de Cantabria; CSIC - Instituto de Fisica de Cantabria (IFCA); Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; University of Graz; Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya; Barcelona Supercomputer Center (BSC-CNS); European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site,"Gutierrez, JM (corresponding author), Univ Cantabria, CSIC, Inst Fis Cantabria, Meteorol Grp, Santander, Spain.",gutierjm@ifca.unican.es,"Gutiérrez, José M./C-5754-2009; Dosio, Alessandro/U-9093-2017; Casanueva, Ana/L-4055-2015; Maraun, Douglas/S-7255-2017; Gutiérrez, José/GSJ-1846-2022; García, Sixto Herrera/A-2573-2015; Iturbide, Maialen/P-9101-2017","Dosio, Alessandro/0000-0002-6365-9473; Casanueva, Ana/0000-0002-7568-0229; Maraun, Douglas/0000-0002-4076-0456; García, Sixto Herrera/0000-0002-5384-179X; Gutierrez, Jose Manuel/0000-0002-2766-6297; Jury, Martin/0000-0003-0590-7843; Iturbide, Maialen/0000-0002-5048-0941","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme [641816, 774652]",Horizon 2020 Framework Programme,"Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, Grant/Award Numbers: 641816, 774652",,44,29,29,2,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1530-261X,,,ATMOS SCI LETT,Atmos.

Here we show that TA-sector climate changes forced by increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) levels are sensitive to model resolution. Two versions of a climate model employing greatly varying atmospheric resolution and exhibiting very different warm bias strength are compared. The version with high atmospheric resolution features a small SST bias and simulates an eastward amplified SST warming over the equatorial Atlantic, in line with the observed SST trends since the mid-20th century. On the contrary, the version with coarse atmospheric resolution exhibits a large SST bias and projects relatively uniform SST changes across the equatorial Atlantic. In both model versions, the warming pattern resembles the pattern of interannual SST variability simulated under present-day conditions. Atmospheric changes also vastly differ among the two climate model versions. In the version with small SST bias, a deep atmospheric response is simulated with a major change in the Walker circulation and strongly enhanced rainfall over the equatorial region, whereas the atmospheric response is much weaker and of rather different character in the model with large SST bias. This study suggests that higher atmospheric resolution in climate models may enhance global warming projections over the TA sector.","[Park, W.; Latif, M.] GEOMAR Helmholtz Ctr Ocean Res Kiel, Kiel, Germany; [Latif, M.] Univ Kiel, Kiel, Germany",Helmholtz Association; GEOMAR Helmholtz Center for Ocean Research Kiel; University of Kiel,"Park, W (corresponding author), GEOMAR Helmholtz Ctr Ocean Res Kiel, Kiel, Germany.",wpark@geomar.de,"Park, Wonsun/J-8097-2012","Park, Wonsun/0000-0002-6345-8428",InterDec project The potential of seasonal-to-decadal-scale inter-regional linkages to advance climate predictions of the JPI CLIM Belmont-Forum; RACE Regional Atlantic Circulation and Global Change Project of the BMBF; Projekt DEAL,InterDec project The potential of seasonal-to-decadal-scale inter-regional linkages to advance climate predictions of the JPI CLIM Belmont-Forum; RACE Regional Atlantic Circulation and Global Change Project of the BMBF(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); Projekt DEAL,"This study was supported by the InterDec project The potential of seasonal-to-decadal-scale inter-regional linkages to advance climate predictions of the JPI CLIM Belmont-Forum, and by the RACE Regional Atlantic Circulation and Global Change Project of the BMBF.

This paper provides a first evaluation of the performance of state-of-the-art Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) global climate models (GCMs) in simulating climate extremes over Australia. Here, we evaluate how well 37 individual CMIP6 GCMs simulate the spatiotemporal patterns of 12 climate extremes over Australia by comparing the GCMs against gridded observations (Australian Gridded Climate Dataset). This evaluation is crucial for informing, interpreting, and constructing multimodel ensemble future projections of climate extremes over Australia, climate-resilience planning, and GCM selection while conducting exercises like dynamical downscaling via GCMs. We find that temperature extremes (maximum-maximum temperature -TXx, number of summer days -SU, and number of days when maximum temperature is greater than 35 degrees C -Txge35) are reasonably well-simulated in comparison to precipitation extremes. However, GCMs tend to overestimate (underestimate) minimum (maximum) temperature extremes. GCMs also typically struggle to capture both extremely dry (consecutive dry days -CDD) and wet (99th percentile of precipitation -R99p) precipitation extremes, thus highlighting the underlying uncertainty of GCMs in capturing regional drought and flood conditions. Typically for both precipitation and temperature extremes, UKESM1-0-LL, FGOALS-g3, and GCMs from Met office Hadley Centre (HadGEM3-GC31-MM and HadGEM3-GC31-LL) and NOAA (GFDL-ESM4 and GFDL-CM4) consistently tend to show good performance. Our results also show that GCMs from the same modelling group and GCMs sharing key modelling components tend to have similar biases and thus are not highly independent.","[Nishant, Nidhi; Di Virgilio, Giovanni] Univ New South Wales, Climate Change Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Nishant, Nidhi; Di Virgilio, Giovanni; Ji, Fei] Univ New South Wales, Australian Res Council Ctr Excellence Climate Ext, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Di Virgilio, Giovanni; Ji, Fei; Tam, Eugene; Beyer, Kathleen; Riley, Matthew L.] NSW Dept Planning & Environm, Sci Econ & Insights Div, Sydney, NSW 2141, Australia; [Beyer, Kathleen] Univ Tasmania, Sch Geog Planning & Spatial Sci, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney; University of New South Wales Sydney; University of Tasmania,"Nishant, N (corresponding author), Univ New South Wales, Climate Change Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.;Nishant, N (corresponding author), Univ New South Wales, Australian Res Council Ctr Excellence Climate Ext, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",n.nidhi@unsw.edu.au,"Riley, Matthew/K-9038-2018","Riley, Matthew/0000-0002-9181-782X; Nishant, Nidhi/0000-0003-1792-7366",NSW Climate Change Fund,NSW Climate Change Fund,This research was funded by NSW Climate Change Fund.,,86,0,0,5,5,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4433,,ATMOSPHERE-BASEL,Atmosphere,SEP,2022,9,,,,,,1478,10.3390/atmos13091478,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos13091478,,,28,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,4S4AP,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000857385900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

There is strong observational and modeling evidence that multidecadal AMOC variability is a crucial driver of the observed AMV and associated climate impacts and an important source of enhanced decadal predictability and prediction skill. The AMOC-AMV linkage is consistent with observed key elements of AMV. Furthermore, this synthesis also points to a leading role of the AMOC in a range of AMV-related climate phenomena having enormous societal and economic implications, for example, Intertropical Convergence Zone shifts; Sahel and Indian monsoons; Atlantic hurricanes; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; Pacific Decadal Variability; North Atlantic Oscillation; climate over Europe, North America, and Asia; Arctic sea ice and surface air temperature; and hemispheric-scale surface temperature. Paleoclimate evidence indicates that a similar linkage between multidecadal AMOC variability and AMV and many associated climate impacts may also have existed in the preindustrial era, that AMV has enhanced multidecadal power significantly above a red noise background, and that AMV is not primarily driven by external forcing. The role of the AMOC in AMV and associated climate impacts has been underestimated in most state-of-the-art climate models, posing significant challenges but also great opportunities for substantial future improvements in understanding and predicting AMV and associated climate impacts.","[Zhang, Rong] NOAA, Geophys Fluid Dynam Lab, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA; [Sutton, Rowan] Univ Reading, Dept Meteorol, Natl Ctr Atmospher Sci, Reading, Berks, England; [Danabasoglu, Gokhan; Yeager, Stephen G.] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Climate & Global Dynam Lab, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [Kwon, Young-Oh] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Phys Oceanog, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [Marsh, Robert] Univ Southampton, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci, Natl Oceanog Ctr, Southampton, Hants, England; [Amrhein, Daniel E.] Univ Washington, Sch Oceanog, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Amrhein, Daniel E.] Univ Washington, Dept Atmospher Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Little, Christopher M.] Atmospher & Environm Res Inc, Lexington, MA USA",National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); NERC National Centre for Atmospheric Science; University of Reading; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution; NERC National Oceanography Centre; University of Southampton; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; Atmospheric & Environmental Research,"Zhang, R (corresponding author), NOAA, Geophys Fluid Dynam Lab, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA.",Rong.Zhang@noaa.gov,"Zhang, Rong/D-9767-2014","Zhang, Rong/0000-0002-8493-6556; Amrhein, Daniel/0000-0002-8442-1528; Danabasoglu, Gokhan/0000-0003-4676-2732; Sutton, Rowan/0000-0001-8345-8583","National Science Foundation (NSF) [OCE-1242989]; Department of Energy [DE-SC0019492]; NSF Collaborative Research EaSM2 grant [OCE-1243015]; National Center for Atmospheric Research; National Science Foundation [1852977]; NSF postdoctoral fellowship; US AMOC Science Team; U.K.-U.S. RAPID program; NERC [NE/M005127/1, ncas10014, ncas10016, NE/M005909/1] Funding Source: UKRI",National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); NSF Collaborative Research EaSM2 grant; National Center for Atmospheric Research; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NSF postdoctoral fellowship(National Science Foundation (NSF)); US AMOC Science Team; U.K.-U.S. RAPID program; NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"We thank the joint support from the US AMOC Science Team and the U.K.-U.S. RAPID program for this review paper.

After this situation, Colombian government and river basin authorities started developing plans and preparing actions for adaptation to climate change. Together with Dutch institutes a demonstration study and capacity building program was executed in 2013-2014. A systematic analysis of future extreme discharges (as a proxy for the risks of flooding) for the upper and middle Magdalena river basin and water shortages for the Coello sub catchment was done using state of the art downscaling and hydrological modeling tools. In this analysis plausible future projections of climate (based on IPCC fifth assessment), land use and water demand (based on expert workshops and literature) were used to explore consequences of climate change. Recent maps, data and expertise of Colombian partners contributed for necessary input data and to validate the tools used. The study is presenting main results and is discussing its limitations and replicability. Climate scenarios show a persistent increase in the occurrence of extreme rainfall events and that, as a consequence, extreme discharges like during the recent floods in 2011 are likely to increase as well. The return period of the 2011 discharge is already quite high under current climate and might increase by a factor five under climate change. For water shortages the results are more ambiguous showing both the possibility of an increase and decrease of the unmet water demand depending on different future scenarios, the water use category and location within the catchment. The unmet demand is however also under the current climate substantial. The question whether this unmet demand is critical or not could not be answered. The modest length of the reference period in comparison with time period of the ENSO phenomenon, the relatively restricted modeling effort (only using hydrological and no hydrodynamic and damage-cost models) are limitations to keep in mind when interpreting these results. There are no principle barriers for replication the methodology in countries like Colombia that in addition is steadily increasing its data, modeling and knowledge capacities.

Here we review the current state of the art on the methodologies to forecast future climate, potential changes in renewable energy production and main findings regarding the role of renewables in the decarbonisation of the energy supply. Most studies used a climate model and power production equations to estimate future renewable output. The largest variation in power production estimated was for the long-term climate change scenarios, with non-significant variations reported for the shortterm. The highest variability was found for wind power followed by hydro, both in the long-term, and overall low variability for solar in any period. Additionally, future decarbonisation efforts point to investments in wind power as one of the main pillars of reducing fossil fuel dependency. Current knowledge gaps about the uncertainty of modelling results and the combined effects of climate change on renewable energy resources. Future studies should focus on increasing the resolution of climate models and improving input data, as well as assess the entire electricity production system and not concentrate on a single energy source, which will aid in defining decarbonisation strategies.","[Russo, M.

Simulations were performed using CESM1(WACCM), a coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation model with fully interactive stratospheric chemistry, dynamics (including an internally generated quasi-biennial oscillation), and a sophisticated treatment of sulfate aerosol formation, microphysical growth, and deposition. The objectives are defined as maintaining three temperature features at their 2020 levels against a background of the RCP8.5 scenario over the period 2020-2099. These objectives are met using a feedback mechanism in which the rate of sulfur dioxide injection at each of the four locations is adjusted independently every year of simulation. Even in the presence of uncertainties, nonlinearities, and variability, the objectives are met, predominantly by SO2 injection at 30 degrees N and 30 degrees S. By the last year of simulation, the feedback algorithm calls for a total injection rate of 51Tg SO2 per year. The injections are not in the tropics, which results in a greater degree of linearity of the surface climate response with injection amount than has been found in many previous studies using injection at the equator. Because the objectives are defined in terms of annual mean temperature, the required geongineering results in overcooling during summer and undercooling during winter. The hydrological cycle is also suppressed as compared to the reference values corresponding to the year 2020. The demonstration we describe in this study is an important step toward understanding what geoengineering can do and what it cannot do. Plain Language Summary Understanding what geoengineering can and cannot do is crucial for narrowing uncertainties in the range of potential responses to future climate change. Part of this effort is to demonstrate the capability of meeting specified climate objectives in a climate model in the presence of uncertainty in climate response. Here we provide the first demonstration of a strategy for meeting three simultaneous global temperature objectives via stratospheric sulfate aerosol geoengineering, using a state-of-the-art climate model that represents key processes relevant to the potential climate responses. We show that the objectives can be met successfully using an algorithm we have developed, and we also demonstrate some potential side effects, which could be potential objectives for which we did not control.","[Kravitz, Ben] Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Atmospher Sci & Global Change Div, Richland, WA 99354 USA; [MacMartin, Douglas G.] Cornell Univ, Mech & Aerosp Engn, Ithaca, NY USA; [MacMartin, Douglas G.] CALTECH, Dept Comp & Math Sci, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Mills, Michael J.; Tilmes, Simone; Lamarque, Jean-Francois; Vitt, Francis] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Atmospher Chem Observat & Modeling Lab, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [Richter, Jadwiga H.; Tilmes, Simone; Tribbia, Joseph J.] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Climate & Global Dynam Lab, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Pacific Northwest National Laboratory; Cornell University; California Institute of Technology; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA,"Kravitz, B (corresponding author), Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Atmospher Sci & Global Change Div, Richland, WA 99354 USA.",ben.kravitz@pnnl.gov,"MacMartin, Douglas G/A-6333-2016; Lamarque, Jean-Francois/L-2313-2014; Kravitz, Ben/P-7925-2014; MacMartin, Douglas/AAB-5314-2020; Mills, Michael/B-5068-2010","MacMartin, Douglas G/0000-0003-1987-9417; Lamarque, Jean-Francois/0000-0002-4225-5074; Kravitz, Ben/0000-0001-6318-1150; Tilmes, Simone/0000-0002-6557-3569; Mills, Michael/0000-0002-8054-1346",Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA); U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC05-76RL01830]; National Science Foundation; Office of Science (BER) of the U.S. Department of Energy,Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)(United States Department of DefenseDefense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)); U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Office of Science (BER) of the U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)),"This research was developed with funding from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA).

However, emphasis on the science of climate change has overshadowed studies focusing on human interpretations of climate history, of adaptation and resilience, and of explorations of the institutions and cultural coping strategies that may have helped people adapt to climate changes in the past. Moreover, although the idea of climate change has been subject to considerable scrutiny by the physical sciences, recent climate scholarship has highlighted the need for a re-examination of the cultural and spatial dimensions of climate, with contributions from the humanities and social sciences. Establishing a multidisciplinary dialogue and approach to climate research past, present, and future has arguably never been more important. This article outlines developments in historical climatology research and considers examples of integrated multidisciplinary approaches to climate, climatic variability, and climate change research, conducted across the physical sciences, social sciences, humanities, and the arts. We highlight the international Atmospheric Circulation Reconstructions over the Earth (ACRE) initiative as one example of such an integrated approach. Initially, ACRE began as a response from climate science to the needs of the agricultural sector in Queensland, Australia for a longer, more spatially, and temporally-complete database of the weather. ACRE has now evolved to embrace an international group of researchers working together across disciplines to integrate their efforts into a four-dimensional (4D) dynamical global historical climate-quality reanalysis (reconstruction).

State-of-the-art SSA parameterizations in global climate models (GCMs) are typically modeled using near-surface wind speed, sea surface temperature (SST), and precipitation. However, these have non-trivial biases in CMIP3 and CMIP5 GCMs over the tropical Pacific Ocean that can contribute to biases in the simulated SSA. This study investigates the impacts of falling ice radiative effects on the biases of the aforementioned modeled parameters and the resulting modeled SSA biases. We compare the CMIP5 modeled SSA against satellite observations from MISR and MODIS using a pair of sensitivity experiments with falling ice radiative effects on and off in the CESM1-CAM5 model. The results show that when falling ice radiative effects are not taken into account, models have weaker surface wind speeds, warmer SSTs, excessive precipitation, and diluted sea surface salinity (SSS) over the Pacific trade-wind regions, leading to underestimated SSA. In the tropical Pacific Ocean, the inclusion of falling ice radiative effects leads to improvements in the modeled near-surface wind speeds, SSTs, and precipitation through cloud-precipitation-radiation-circulation coupling, which results in more representative patterns of SSA and reduces the SSA biases by similar to 10% to 15% relative to the satellite observations. Models including falling ice radiative effects in CMIP5 produce smaller biases in SSA than those without falling ice radiative effects. We suggest that one of the causes of these biases is likely the failure to account for falling ice radiative effects, and these biases in turn affect the direct and indirect effects of SSA in the GCMs.","[Chen, Yi-Chun; Lee, Wei-Liang] Acad Sinica, Res Ctr Environm Changes, Taipei, Taiwan; [Li, Jui-Lin F.; Diner, David J.; Garay, Michael J.; Jiang, Jonathan H.; Kalashnikova, Olga, V] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA USA; [Wang, Yi-Hui] Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA; [Yu, Jia-Yuh] Natl Cent Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, Taoyuan, Taiwan",Academia Sinica - Taiwan; California Institute of Technology; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL); California State University System; California Polytechnic State University San Luis Obispo; National Central University,"Chen, YC (corresponding author), Acad Sinica, Res Ctr Environm Changes, Taipei, Taiwan.",yichunchen@gate.sinica.edu.tw,"Garay, Michael/AAJ-8106-2020; Lee, Wei-Liang/AAG-1728-2020; Kalashnikova, Olga V/E-6818-2019; CHEN, YI-CHUN/AAQ-4516-2021; Diner, David/ABA-2209-2021; Yu, Jia-Yuh/Y-9365-2019","Garay, Michael/0000-0002-1374-5074; Kalashnikova, Olga V/0000-0002-1330-1529; CHEN, YI-CHUN/0000-0001-7997-8578; Diner, David/0000-0001-8102-7616; ","RCEC, Academia Sinica; Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under contracts of ATMOS COMP 2013 [NNH12ZDA001N-CCST]; NASA Making Earth System Data Records for Use in Research Environments (MEaSUREs) programs","RCEC, Academia Sinica; Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under contracts of ATMOS COMP 2013; NASA Making Earth System Data Records for Use in Research Environments (MEaSUREs) programs","YCC acknowledge RCEC, Academia Sinica for supporting this study.

Using statistical Generalized Linear Models, observed temperature and wheat production data, we show an increase in magnitude, frequency and areal extent of heat stress episodes in the IGP region during 1967-2018. Such episodes comprise of temperatures exceeding a senescence-inducing threshold. Further, using a copula-based multivariate framework, we probabilistically assess wheat production conditioned on heat stress indicators, both in the historical period and also in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) future projections. Probabilistic estimates of below-average wheat production under scenario-averaged heat stress conditions are expected to rise by 8%-27% under the SSP5-8.5 scenario, with Punjab showing the largest increase. Quantitative links between heat stress indicators and loss of crop yield highlight increased agricultural vulnerability in India under climate change. Plain Language Summary The three states of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh in the Indo-Gangetic Plains are the largest wheat producers in India, playing a crucial role in ensuring food security of this densely populated country. Wheat, a winter crop, is reported to be sensitive to heat stress because of rising temperatures and climate change. However, in previous studies, the sensitivity of wheat yield has been mainly explored with respect to the magnitude of temperature. Here, based on statistical analysis of observed temperature and actual wheat production data, we show that the magnitude, frequency and areal extent of agricultural heat stress events are increasing in India's wheat belt, with frequency showing the most pronounced trend. Further, we establish a quantitative link between crop loss and these three heat stress indicators in a multivariate, probabilistic framework. This probabilistic approach is used to obtain likelihoods of reduced wheat yield in future, using state-of-art climate model projections. Under climate change, chances of below-average wheat production rise by 8%-27% in the worst-case scenario. Thus, our results quantify rising agricultural vulnerability in India's wheat-belt under climate change and variability. Key Points Increase in magnitude, frequency and areal extent of heat stress on wheat cultivation in India; frequency has the most pronounced trend Quantitative links established between yield and heat stress magnitude, frequency and areal extent in observed and projected climate Probabilistic estimates of below-average wheat production rise by 8%-27% in the worst case, with largest impact in Punjab","[Zachariah, Mariam; Mondal, Arpita] Indian Inst Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India; [Mondal, Arpita] Indian Inst Technol, Interdisciplinary Program Climate Studies, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India; [AghaKouchak, Amir] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Irvine, CA USA; [AghaKouchak, Amir] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Irvine, CA USA",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Bombay; Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Bombay; University of California System; University of California Irvine; University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Mondal, A (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.;Mondal, A (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol, Interdisciplinary Program Climate Studies, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.",marpita@civil.iitb.ac.in,,"Mondal, Arpita/0000-0002-7622-8306; AghaKouchak, Amir/0000-0003-4689-8357","Industrial Research & Consultancy Centre Fellowship, IIT Bombay [15IRCCSG036]","Industrial Research & Consultancy Centre Fellowship, IIT Bombay","The authors would like to thank India Meteorological Department for making the observed rainfall and temperature data publicly available at .

Advancing the current understanding and simulation of the MJO using state-of-the-art climate data and modeling systems is thus a necessary goal for improving MJO prediction capability. MJO variability is assessed in NOAA/NCEP reanalyses and two versions of the Climate Forecast System (CFS), CFS version 1 (CFSv1) and its update version 2 (CFSv2). The analysis leans on a variety of diagnostic procedures and includes MJO sensitivity to varying El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phases. It is found that significant improvements have been realized in the representation of MJO variations in the new NCEP Climate Forecast System reanalysis (CFSR) as evidenced by outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) power spectral analysis and more coherent propagation characteristics of precipitation and 850-hPa zonal winds over the Eastern Hemisphere in CFSR-only depictions. Conversely, while modest improvements are realized in the CFSv2 as compared to CFSv1, in general the simulation of the MJO continues to be a challenge. Both versions produce strong eastward propagating variance of convection and wind fields in the intraseasonal frequency band. However, the simulated MJO propagates slower than the observed with difficulties traversing the Maritime Continent into the western Pacific, as noted in many previous modeling studies. The CFS shows robust intraseasonal simulations over the west Pacific during El Nino years with diminished simulation capability over the Indian Ocean during La Nina years. This is likely a manifestation of the preference for La Nina MJO activity to occur over the Indian Ocean and the simulation challenges over that domain.","[Weaver, Scott J.; Wang, Wanqiu; Chen, Mingyue; Kumar, Arun] NOAA NWS NCEP, Climate Predict Ctr, Camp Springs, MD 20746 USA",National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Weaver, SJ (corresponding author), NOAA NWS NCEP, Climate Predict Ctr, 5200 Auth Rd,Rm 605, Camp Springs, MD 20746 USA.",scott.weaver@noaa.gov,", AK/B-6517-2008",,,,,,29,71,72,0,16,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0894-8755,,,J CLIMATE,J.

This new field produces increasing numbers of large geo-referenced networks to be analysed. Particular focus lies currently on the network analysis of the complex statistical interrelationship structure within climatological fields. The standard procedure for such network analyses is the extraction of network measures in combination with static standard visualisation methods. Existing interactive visualisation methods and tools for geo-referenced network exploration are often either not known to the analyst or their potential is not fully exploited. To fill this gap, we illustrate how interactive visual analytics methods in combination with geovisualisation can be tailored for visual climate network investigation. Therefore, the paper provides a problem analysis relating the multiple visualisation challenges to a survey undertaken with network analysts from the research fields of climate and complex systems science. Then, as an overview for the interested practitioner, we review the state-of-the-art in climate network visualisation and provide an overview of existing tools. As a further contribution, we introduce the visual network analytics tools CGV and GTX, providing tailored solutions for climate network analysis, including alternative geographic projections, edge bundling, and 3-D network support. Using these tools, the paper illustrates the application potentials of visual analytics for climate networks based on several use cases including examples from global, regional, and multi-layered climate networks.","[Nocke, T.; Donges, J.

Here we use two largely independent data sets of cloud and surface downwelling radiation observations derived by satellite remote sensing (2007-2010) to evaluate simulated clouds and radiation over both polar ice sheets and oceans in state-of-the-art atmospheric reanalyses (ERA-Interim and Modern Era Retrospective-Analysis for Research and Applications-2) and the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) climate model ensemble. First, we show that, compared to Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System-Energy Balanced and Filled, CloudSat-CALIPSO better represents cloud liquid and ice water path over high latitudes, owing to its recent explicit determination of cloud phase that will be part of its new R05 release. The reanalyses and climate models disagree widely on the amount of cloud liquid and ice in the polar regions. Compared to the observations, we find significant but inconsistent biases in the model simulations of cloud liquid and ice water, as well as in the downwelling radiation components. The CMIP5 models display a wide range of cloud characteristics of the polar regions, especially with regard to cloud liquid water, limiting the representativeness of the multimodel mean. A few CMIP5 models (CNRM, GISS, GFDL, and IPSL_CM5b) clearly outperform the others, which enhances credibility in their projected future cloud and radiation changes over high latitudes. Given the rapid changes in polar regions and global feedbacks involved, future climate model developments should target improved representation of polar clouds. To that end, remote sensing observations are crucial, in spite of large remaining observational uncertainties, which is evidenced by the substantial differences between the two data sets.","[Lenaerts, Jan T.

These groups aimed to determine whether there would be a Francis Effect, in which U.S. Conservatives (and Conservative Catholics in particular) would show greater concern about the negative effects of global climate change. Here, we first provide context by discussing the history of political polarization in the U.S. over global climate change. Then, we review the published literature and publicly available data that aimed to examine potential influences ofLaudato Si'on people's climate change attitudes. Taken together, the available scholarship provides strong evidence that U.S. publics were differentially responsive to the Pope's messaging (with political Conservatives expressing less climate change concern and viewing Pope Francis as less credible), but there is correlational evidence of an overall Francis Effect. U.S. population data collected following the encyclical's release show small, potentially temporary, increases in perceptions of papal credibility, climate change concern, and the perspective that global climate change is a moral issue.

However, observed and potential non-stationarity in floods can result in costly over design or dangerous under-design. Despite substantial attention, evidence from the literature makes clear there is no consensus methodology for estimating design variables under climate change. Practical guidance remains elusive. This paper presents a review of the challenges and advances in design of infrastructure for floods under non-stationarity. First, potential sources of non-stationarity in time series of floods are described to provide context and motivation. Second, methods for estimating design floods that rely on the stationary assumption are presented and their limitations are discussed. Third, methods for estimating design floods that assume non-stationarity resulting from climate change are summarized. Finally, the inadequacies of current design methodologies in view of the pervasive uncertainties are assessed and strategies to manage the consequences of those uncertainties are presented.","[Francois, B.; Schlef, K.

Yet our knowledge of how to promote and bring about such deep transformative changes in the minds and behaviours of individuals and societies is still limited. As climate change unravels and the planet becomes increasingly connected, societies will need to articulate a shared purpose that is both engaging and respectful of cultural diversity. Thus, there is a growing need to 'raise the temperature' of integration between multiple ways of knowing climate change. We have reviewed a range of literatures and synthesized them in order to draw out the perceived role of the arts in fostering climate transformations. Our analysis of climate-related art projects and initiatives shows increased engagement in recent years, particularly with the narrative, visual and performing arts. The arts are moving beyond raising awareness and entering the terrain of interdisciplinarity and knowledge co-creation.

Due to PE's inherent microphysical dependencies, definitions and estimates vary immensely. Consequently, PE's sensitivity to greenhouse warming and implications for climate change are poorly understood. Here, we quantify PE's role in climate change by defining a simple index epsilon as the ratio of surface precipitation to condensed water path. This macroscopic metric is reconcilable with microphysical PE measures and higher epsilon is associated with stronger mean Walker circulation. We further find that state-of-the-art climate models disagree on the sign and magnitude of future epsilon changes. This sign disagreement originates from models' convective parameterizations. Critically, models with increasing epsilon under greenhouse warming, in line with cloud-resolving simulations, show greater slowdown of the large-scale Hadley and Walker circulations and a two-fold greater increase in extreme rainfall than models with decreasing epsilon. Falling raindrops play an essential but as-yet unquantified role in planetary climate change. Here the authors use the concept of precipitation efficiency to establish that raindrops play a critical role in predicting future tropical atmospheric circulation and extreme precipitation.","[Li, Ryan L.; Studholme, Joshua H.

It is found that the quality of the climate simulations is highly dependent on the domain size. Moreover, the choice of an optimal version is more complex than usually thought, the less appropriate domain having an intermediate size (about 3000 km X 3000 km), and the best versions nearly cover a quarter of the Northern Hemisphere. The use of periodically reinitialized trajectories does improve the climate of suboptimal models but leads to unrealistic dynamical behaviors. The implications for regional climate simulations are briefly discussed.","Inst Royal Meteorol Belgique, B-1180 Brussels, Belgium",Royal Meteorological Institute of Belgium,"Vannitsem, S (corresponding author), Inst Royal Meteorol Belgique, Ave Circulaire 3, B-1180 Brussels, Belgium.",svn@oma.be,"Vannitsem, Stephane/R-7328-2019","Vannitsem, Stephane/0000-0002-1734-1042",,,,,11,55,55,0,2,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0894-8755,1520-0442,,J CLIMATE,J.

It has been emphasized that the implementation of information and communication technologies in the process of preparing future specialists in the field of music art in the system of continuous artistic education is one of the important factors in enriching their professional and personal experience. The purpose of informatization of the permanent system of artistic education is to increase the efficiency of learning through the information enlargement and the improvement of its methods of application, as well as the focus on the use of information technology in the educational process of higher education and professional activities. It is noted that the reorientation of modern artistic education from discrete to permanent requires the development and experimental testing of new forms of didactic interaction with musical and pedagogical workers, aimed at creating a positive motivation of specialists in musical art until the acquisition and improvement of informational competencies, continuous improvement of professional and personal experience and professional skill based on self-education activities. It is proved that expediency and efficiency of information technologies in art education are closely connected with the notion of information culture. The essential component of the information culture of a music teacher is the ability to use information and communication technologies effectively both in the musical and educational process and in the process of self-education and self-improvement. Particular attention is drawn to the fact that the creation of an innovative information and creative educational environment in a higher educational establishment depends largely on an innovative climate, the characteristics of which are often crucial for the realization of innovative goals.","[Popovych, Nataliia M.] Mukachevo State Univ, Dept Pedag Mus Educ & Performance Art, Mukachevo, Ukraine",Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; Mukachevo State University,"Popovych, NM (corresponding author), Mukachevo State Univ, Dept Pedag Mus Educ & Performance Art, Mukachevo, Ukraine.",popovicnatalia06@gmail.com,"Popovych, Nataliia/AAU-5544-2020","Popovych, Nataliia/0000-0001-7822-6980",,,,,9,1,1,2,9,"NATL ACAD PEDAGOGICAL SCIENCES UKRAINE, INST INFO TECHNOL & LEARNING TOOLS",KYIV,"VUL M BERLYNSKOHO 9, KYIV, 04060, UKRAINE",2076-8184,,,INF TECHNOL LEARN TO,Inf.

It has, however, also been conceived as an ongoing gateway tactic to curb long-term climate change and simultaneously secure social and environmental justice. Divestment has attracted global attention and is currently employed by numerous universities, religious institutions, art galleries, museums, and national and local governments, in various countries, including Scotland. However academic analysis of the movement remains underdeveloped. This article addresses such absence by giving a voice to the motives, tactics, and rationales as expressed by campaigners themselves. It identifies the collective action frames constructed by Scottish fossil fuel divestment campaigns in order to facilitate mobilisation and alignment with other climate change movements. A key premise of this article is to also explore the power of such frames to motivate action and to assess the extent to which divestment campaign groups can impact government discourse and policy. As such the article concludes by considering whether and how far divestment frames and discourses may have come to inform the climate change policy of the devolved Scottish Government.","[Muncie, Ella] Univ Leicester, Sch Media Commun & Sociol, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England",University of Leicester,"Muncie, E (corresponding author), Univ Leicester, Sch Media Commun & Sociol, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England.",em471@leicester.ac.uk,"Muncie, Ella/AAC-3519-2022","Muncie, Ella/0000-0003-2926-6745",,,,,47,1,1,2,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",2190-6483,2190-6491,,J ENVIRON STUD SCI,J.

The team used recent sediment samples from Indian Ocean and Red Sea that contained healthy and unhealthy foraminifera specimens to create 3D specimen models. These models were made using traditional sculpture techniques, photogrammetry, and 3D printing to show different states of foraminifera dissolution and corrosion from ocean acidification. The end result of this project resulted in nine interactive pieces which were part of the exhibition Drift & Migrate open to the public during the month of November 2019 in the exhibition hall of the Faculty of Fine Arts (UCM). The 3D models of foraminifera were displayed with educational graphics and blind-accesible explanatory signage (Braille) to share the scientific facts of foraminifera and their role in the ocean ecosystem.

However, productivity and disturbances are intrinsically linked because 1) disturbances directly affect forest productivity (e.g. via a reduction in leaf area, growing stock or resource-use efficiency), and 2) disturbance susceptibility is often coupled to a certain development phase of the forest with productivity determining the time a forest is in this specific phase of susceptibility. The objective of this paper is to provide an overview of forest productivity changes in different forest regions in Europe under climate change, and partition these changes into effects induced by climate change alone and by climate change and disturbances. We present projections of climate change impacts on forest productivity from state-of-the-art forest models that dynamically simulate forest productivity and the effects of the main European disturbance agents (fire, storm, insects), driven by the same climate scenario in seven forest case studies along a large climatic gradient throughout Europe. Our study shows that, in most cases, including disturbances in the simulations exaggerate ongoing productivity declines or cancel out productivity gains in response to climate change. In fewer cases, disturbances also increase productivity or buffer climate-change induced productivity losses, e.g. because low severity fires can alleviate resource competition and increase fertilization. Even though our results cannot simply be extrapolated to other types of forests and disturbances, we argue that it is necessary to interpret climate change-induced productivity and disturbance changes jointly to capture the full range of climate change impacts on forests and to plan adaptation measures.","[Reyer, Christopher P.

The present study is aimed at achieving this objective by hybridising two mathematical techniques, namely synthetic superensemble (SSE) and supervised principal component regression (SPCR) on six state-of-the art Global Climate Models (GCMs). The performance of the mathematical model is evaluated using correlation analysis, the root mean square error, and the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency index. Results feature reasonable improvement over central India, which is a zone of maximum rainfall activity in the summer monsoon season. The study also highlights improvement in the monthly prediction of rainfall over raw GCMs (15-20% improvement) with exceptional improvement in July. The developed model is also examined for anomalous years of monsoon and it is found that the model is able to capture the signs of anomalies over different gridpoints of the Indian domain.

The CCF was designed as a surcharge value to be added to all new technical flood protection facilities, such as dams, protection walls, and retention areas. This paper deconstructs the conditions and processes that led to the creation of this new policy instrument. Following the instrument choice framework, the paper analyzes in a heuristic manner, the institutions, actors, discourses, and decision context that were part of this process from the early 1990s to 2004, when the instrument was introduced. In order to better understand the scope of this regional instrument, the paper also briefly depicts four non-representative cases of flood risk and protection management, where the instrument was either applied or avoided. The article closes with an assessment of the CCF, concluding that the innovativeness of this instrument faded once the overarching sectoral paradigm shifted from technical flood protection to more comprehensive flood risk management.","[Jara, Melani Pelaez] Albert Ludwigs Univ Freiburg, Inst Environm Social Sci & Geog, D-79085 Freiburg, Germany",University of Freiburg,"Jara, MP (corresponding author), Albert Ludwigs Univ Freiburg, Inst Environm Social Sci & Geog, D-79085 Freiburg, Germany.",melani.pelaez@envgov.uni-freiburg.de,,"Pelaez-Jara, Melani/0000-0002-9020-0676","AUSTRIAN CLIMATE AND ENERGY FUND [KR14AC7K11809]; Baden-Wuerttemberg Ministry of Science, Research and Art; University of Freiburg","AUSTRIAN CLIMATE AND ENERGY FUND; Baden-Wuerttemberg Ministry of Science, Research and Art; University of Freiburg","This research was funded by the AUSTRIAN CLIMATE AND ENERGY FUND, grant KR14AC7K11809.

Precipitation tends to increase in northern Europe and decrease in southern Europe, with variable trends in central Europe. The climate scenarios for Germany suggest an increase in precipitation in western Germany and a decrease in eastern Germany, and a shift of precipitation from summer to winter. When investigating the effects of climate change, impacts on water resources are among the main concerns. In this study, the first German-wide impact assessment of water fluxes dynamics under climate change is presented in a spatially and temporally distributed manner using the state-of-the-art regional climate model, Statistical Regional (STAR) model and the semi-distributed process-based eco-hydrological model, soil and water integrated model (SWIM). All large river basins in Germany (lower Rhine, upper Danube, Elbe, Weser and Ems) are included. A special focus of the study was on data availability, homogeneity of data sets, related uncertainty propagation in the model results and scenario-related uncertainty. After the model calibration and validation (efficiency from 0.6 to 0.9 in 80% of cases) the water flow components were simulated at the hydrotope level, and the spatial distributions were compared with those in the Hydrological Atlas of Germany. The actual evapotransipration is likely to increase in most parts of Germany, while total runoff generation may decrease in south and east regions. The results for the second scenario period 2051-2060 show that water discharge in all six rivers would be 8-30% lower in summer and autumn compared with the reference period, and the strongest decline is expected for the Saale, Danube and Neckar. Higher winter flow is expected in all of these rivers, and the increase is most significant for the Ems (about 18%). However, the uncertainty of impacts, especially in winter and for high water flows, remains high. Copyright.

Building on governance literature about long-term and complex policy problems, we develop a conceptual matrix based on the dimensions knowledge and power to systematically study the peer-reviewed literature on climate adaptation governance. We find that about a quarter of the reviewed journal articles do not address the knowledge or power dimension of the governance of climate change adaptation, about half of the articles discuss either the knowledge or the power dimension, and another quarter discuss both knowledge and power. The articles that do address both knowledge and power (1) conceptualize the governance of climate adaptation mainly as a complex system of regulatory frameworks and technical knowledge, (2) assume that regulatory systems can be easily adapted to new knowledge, (3) pay little attention to fluid or unorganized forms of power, e. g., negotiation, and knowledge, e. g., learning, and (4) largely neglect the interplay between the two. We argue that more research on this interplay is needed, and we discuss how puzzling and powering are a promising pair of concepts to study this.","[Vink, Martinus J.; Dewulf, Art; Termeer, Catrien] Wageningen Univ, Publ Adm & Policy Grp, NL-6700 AP Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research,"Vink, MJ (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ, Publ Adm & Policy Grp, NL-6700 AP Wageningen, Netherlands.",,"Dewulf, Art/C-1271-2010; Dewulf, Art/ABA-7434-2020; Termeer, Katrien/C-6057-2015","Dewulf, Art/0000-0002-4171-7644; Dewulf, Art/0000-0002-4171-7644; ",,,,,77,58,58,1,69,RESILIENCE ALLIANCE,WOLFVILLE,"ACADIA UNIV, BIOLOGY DEPT, WOLFVILLE, NS B0P 1X0, CANADA",1708-3087,,,ECOL SOC,Ecol.

Findings show that academic social climate was higher in the studio than in the regular classes in social connections, students' involvement, teacher support, and order and organisation; while academic social climate measures were higher in the regular classes in teacher control and in the orientation of learning material. The highest academic social climate measures in both studio and classes were students' involvement and competence, and the lowest measures were teacher support, and order and organisation.

In this paper the potential impacts of climate change on ski areas in Tyrol (Austria, Italy) are investigated. A ski season and snowmaking simulation model SkiSim2' was applied to 111 ski areas. Model results suggest that all ski areas could ensure a 100-days season until the 2030s to the 2040s (high/low emission scenario) assuming a 100% snowmaking coverage and state-of-the-art snowmaking system. The Christmas holidays are a particularly sensitive season period, where already in the 2020s some ski areas do not fulfil economic thresholds. A warming greater than 3 degrees C would force most ski areas to close their business not considering developments in snowmaking technology and economic thresholds of snowmaking costs. Regarding the snow demand to ensure a 100-days season independent of any technological limits, snow production would have to be multiplied by up to a factor of 4. It is questionable whether all ski areas will be able to afford the increasing snowmaking costs and therefore the most vulnerable regions should rethink their touristic positioning.","[Steiger, Robert] MCI, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; [Stoetter, Johann] Univ Innsbruck, Inst Geog, Innsbruck, Austria",University of Innsbruck,"Steiger, R (corresponding author), MCI, Weiherburggasse 8, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria.",robert.steiger@mci.edu,"Steiger, Robert/N-5724-2014; Steiger, Robert/D-4796-2019","Steiger, Robert/0000-0002-1752-6450; Steiger, Robert/0000-0002-1752-6450; Stotter, Johann/0000-0002-7750-988X",,,,,43,50,51,1,54,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1461-6688,1470-1340,,TOURISM GEOGR,Tour.

A 30-year hindcast was performed and evaluated against observational records consisting of long-term ground-based meteorological observations, automatic weather stations, radiosoundings, satellite records, stake measurements and ice cores. Reasonable agreement regarding the surface and upper-air climate is achieved by the COSMO-CLM2 model, comparable to the performance of other state-of-the-art climate models over the AIS. Meteorological variability of the surface climate is adequately simulated, and biases in the radiation and surface mass balance are small.

This study presents an assessment from the CanSISE Network of the ability of the second-generation Canadian Earth System Model (CanESM2) and the Canadian Seasonal to Interannual Prediction System (CanSIPS) to simulate and predict snow and sea ice from seasonal to multi-decadal timescales, with a focus on the Canadian sector. To account for observational uncertainty, model structural uncertainty, and internal climate variability, the analysis uses multi-source observations, multiple Earth system models (ESMs) in Phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5), and large initial-condition ensembles of CanESM2 and other models. It is found that the ability of the CanESM2 simulation to capture snow-related climate parameters, such as cold-region surface temperature and precipitation, lies within the range of currently available international models. Accounting for the considerable disagreement among satellite-era observational datasets on the distribution of snow water equivalent, CanESM2 has too much springtime snow mass over Canada, reflecting a broader northern hemispheric positive bias. Biases in seasonal snow cover extent are generally less pronounced. CanESM2 also exhibits retreat of springtime snow generally greater than observational estimates, after accounting for observational uncertainty and internal variability. Sea ice is biased low in the Canadian Arctic, which makes it difficult to assess the realism of long-term sea ice trends there. The strengths and weaknesses of the modelling system need to be understood as a practical tradeoff: the Canadian models are relatively inexpensive computationally because of their moderate resolution, thus enabling their use in operational seasonal prediction and for generating large ensembles of multidecadal simulations. Improvements in climate-prediction systems like CanSIPS rely not just on simulation quality but also on using novel observational constraints and the ready transfer of research to an operational setting. Improvements in seasonal forecasting practice arising from recent research include accurate initialization of snow and frozen soil, accounting for observational uncertainty in forecast verification, and sea ice thickness initialization using statistical predictors available in real time.","[Kushner, Paul J.] Univ Toronto, Dept Phys, Toronto, ON M5S 1A7, Canada; [Mudryk, Lawrence R.; Merryfield, William; Brown, Ross; Derksen, Chris; Flato, Greg; Fyfe, John C.; Gillett, Nathan; Howell, Stephen; Laliberte, Frederic; Sigmond, Michael; Sospedra-Alfonso, Reinel; Tandon, Neil F.] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Div Climate Res, Toronto, ON M3H 5T4, Canada; [Ambadan, Jaison T.; Berg, Aaron] Univ Guelph, Dept Geog, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Bichet, Adeline] CNRS, LGGE, MEOM, F-38041 Grenoble, France; [Dery, Stephen J.] Univ Northern British Columbia, Dept Environm Sci, Prince George, BC V2N 4Z9, Canada; [Dirkson, Arlan] Univ Victoria, Sch Earth & Ocean Sci, Victoria, BC V8W 2Y2, Canada; [Fletcher, Christopher G.; Thackeray, Chad] Univ Waterloo, Dept Geog & Environm Management, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; [Haas, Christian] York Univ, Dept Earth & Space Sci & Engn, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada; [Haas, Christian] Alfred Wegener Inst, Climate Sci Div, D-27570 Bremerhaven, Germany; [McCusker, Kelly] Univ Washington, Dept Atmospher Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Tremblay, Bruno] McGill Univ, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Montreal, PQ H3A 0B9, Canada; [Zwiers, FrancisW.] Univ Victoria, Pacific Climate Impacts Consortium, Victoria, BC V8P 5C2, Canada","University of Toronto; Environment & Climate Change Canada; University of Guelph; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); University of Northern British Columbia; University of Victoria; University of Waterloo; York University - Canada; Helmholtz Association; Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar & Marine Research; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; McGill University; University of Victoria","Kushner, PJ (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Phys, Toronto, ON M5S 1A7, Canada.",paul.kushner@utoronto.ca,"Derksen, Chris/S-9828-2017; Kushner, Paul J/H-6716-2016; Fletcher, Christopher G/I-4168-2012; Thackeray, Chad/ABD-8474-2021; Sigmond, Michael/K-3169-2012; Berg, Aaron/AAU-3547-2021","Derksen, Chris/0000-0001-6821-5479; Kushner, Paul J/0000-0002-6404-4518; Fletcher, Christopher G/0000-0002-4393-5565; Thackeray, Chad/0000-0002-3757-9015; Sigmond, Michael/0000-0003-2191-9756; Berg, Aaron/0000-0001-8438-5662; Bichet, Adeline/0000-0003-1409-1620; Dirkson, Arlan/0000-0002-4493-0117; Sospedra-Alfonso, Reinel/0000-0002-4472-5607; McCusker, Kelly/0000-0001-5914-0559; Brown, Ross/0000-0001-7196-2686",Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada's Climate Change and Atmospheric Research Program; Environment and Climate Change Canada; Pacific Climate Impacts Consortium; University of Toronto,Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada's Climate Change and Atmospheric Research Program(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); Environment and Climate Change Canada; Pacific Climate Impacts Consortium; University of Toronto(University of Toronto),"This work represents Deliverable 1 of the CanSISE Network.

Starting from an analysis of the multiple forms of invisibilization of the contemporary ecosocial crisis (Herrero 2013, Riechmann 2011), I explore the intersections between ecology-related art forms and collaborative processes. In particular, referring to the potential of art to reconfigure the sensible and distribute forms of visibility (Ranciere 2008) together with its ability to address complex issues such as environmental and from a post-anthropocentric perspective (Demos 2017), I examine the work of artists and groups currently active in the Americas such as Carolina Caycedo (Colombia), The Harrison Studio (United States) and Desert Art Lab (United States). Through a critical analysis of their artistic projects and semi-structured interviews with artists and curators, I study the artists' intentionality and the different collaborative strategies they use to make the impacts of the extractivist model visible together with the social struggles for the preservation of ecosystems and indigenous knowledge systems, and the processes of resilience and adaptation of non-human organisms to anthropogenic climate change. The chosen geopolitical context is especially significant because of the pervasiveness of the neoliberal paradigm that has characterized it in recent decades, with the consequent erosion of both social and environmental rights. At the same time, the presence of countercultural movements linked to ecology, feminism and the defense of the native cultures of the Americas has allowed the emergence of alternative discourses and models of coexistence that have nurtured and inspired the artistic manifestations our study revolves around.","[Sgaramella, Chiara] Univ Politecn Valencia, Ctr Invest Arte & Entorno, Valencia, Spain",Universitat Politecnica de Valencia,"Sgaramella, C (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Valencia, Ctr Invest Arte & Entorno, Valencia, Spain.",,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,0,UNIV POLITECNICA VALENCIA,VALENCIA,"CAMINO VERA S-N, VALENCIA, 46022, SPAIN",,,978-84-9048-766-2,,,,2019,,,,,670,676,,10.4995/ANIAV.2019.8981,http://dx.doi.org/10.4995/ANIAV.2019.8981,,,7,"Art; Humanities, Multidisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Art; Arts & Humanities - Other Topics,BS7GA,,Bronze,,,12/21/22,WOS:000759859900094,View Full Record in Web of Science

Climate projections are produced with increasingly complex models that attempt to represent key processes in the Earth system, including atmospheric and oceanic circulations, convection, clouds, snow, sea ice, vegetation, and interactions with the carbon cycle. Uncertainties in the representation of these processes feed through into a range of projections from the many state-of-the-art climate models now being developed and used worldwide. For example, despite major improvements in climate models, the range of equilibrium global warming due to doubling carbon dioxide still spans a range of more than 3. Here a promising way to make use of the ensemble of climate models to reduce the uncertainties in the sensitivities of the real climate system is reviewed. The emergent constraint approach uses the model ensemble to identify a relationship between an uncertain aspect of the future climate and an observable variation or trend in the contemporary climate. This review summarizes previous published work on emergent constraints and discusses the promise and potential dangers of the approach. Most importantly, it argues that emergent constraints should be based on well-founded physical principles such as the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. This review will stimulate physicists to contribute to the rapidly developing field of emergent constraints on climate projections, bringing to it much needed rigor and physical insights.","[Williamson, Mark S.; Cox, Peter M.; Nijsse, Femke J.

Climate change (CC) may lead to new trade-offs between agricultural functions or aggravate existing ones, but suitable agricultural management may maintain or even improve the ability of agroecosystems to supply these functions. Hence, it is necessary to identify relevant drivers (e. g., cropping practices, local conditions) and their interactions, and how they affect agricultural functions in a changing climate. The goal of this study was to use a modeling framework to analyze the sensitivity of indicators of three important agricultural functions, namely crop yield (food and fiber production function), soil erosion (soil conservation function), and nutrient leaching (clean water provision function), to a wide range of agricultural practices for current and future climate conditions. In a two-step approach, cropping practices that explain high proportions of variance of the different indicators were first identified by an analysis of variance-based sensitivity analysis. Then, most suitable combinations of practices to achieve best performance with respect to each indicator were extracted, and trade-offs were analyzed. The procedure was applied to a region in western Switzerland, considering two different soil types to test the importance of local environmental constraints. Results show that the sensitivity of crop yield and soil erosion due to management is high, while nutrient leaching mostly depends on soil type. We found that the influence of most agricultural practices does not change significantly with CC; only irrigation becomes more relevant as a consequence of decreasing summer rainfall. Trade-offs were identified when focusing on best performances of each indicator separately, and these were amplified under CC. For adaptation to CC in the selected study region, conservation soil management and the use of cropped grasslands appear to be the most suitable options to avoid tradeoffs.","[Klein, Tommy; Holzkaemper, Annelie; Calanca, Pierluigi; Fuhrer, Juerg] Agroscope Res Stn ART, Air Pollut Climate Grp, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland; [Klein, Tommy; Holzkaemper, Annelie; Calanca, Pierluigi; Fuhrer, Juerg] Univ Bern, Oeschger Ctr Climate Change Res, Bern, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Research Station Agroscope; University of Bern,"Klein, T (corresponding author), Agroscope Res Stn ART, Air Pollut Climate Grp, Reckenholzstr 191, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland.",tommy.klein@alumni.ulg.ac.be,,"Calanca, Pierluigi/0000-0003-3113-2885",Swiss National Science Foundation [NRP61]; EU [505539],Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission); EU(European Commission),This study was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation in framework of the National Research Program NRP61.

Reliable estimates of how the Antarctic climate system would behave under a range of scenarios of future external climate forcing are thus a high priority. Output from new model simulations coordinated as part of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) provides an opportunity for a comprehensive analysis of the latest generation of state-of-the-art climate models following a wider range of experiment types and scenarios than previous CMIP phases. Here the main broad-scale 21st century Antarctic projections provided by the CMIP6 models are shown across four forcing scenarios: SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5. End-of-century Antarctic surface-air temperature change across these scenarios (relative to 1995-2014) is 1.3, 2.5, 3.7 and 4.8 degrees C. The corresponding proportional precipitation rate changes are 8, 16, 24 and 31%. In addition to these end-of-century changes, an assessment of scenario dependence of pathways of absolute and global-relative 21st century projections is conducted. Potential differences in regional response are of particular relevance to coastal Antarctica, where, for example, ecosystems and ice shelves are highly sensitive to the timing of crossing of key thresholds in both atmospheric and oceanic conditions. Overall, it is found that the projected changes over coastal Antarctica do not scale linearly with global forcing. We identify two factors that appear to contribute: (a) a stronger global-relative Southern Ocean warming in stabilisation (SSP2-4.5) and aggressive mitigation (SSP1-2.6) scenarios as the Southern Ocean continues to warm and (b) projected recovery of Southern Hemisphere stratospheric ozone and its effect on the mid-latitude westerlies. The major implication is that over coastal Antarctica, the surface warming by 2100 is stronger relative to the global mean surface warming for the low forcing compared to high forcing future scenarios.","[Bracegirdle, Thomas J.; Naughten, Kaitlin A.] British Antarctic Survey, Madingley Rd, Cambridge CB3 0ET, England; [Krinner, Gerhard] Univ Grenoble Alpes, CNRS, Inst Geosci Environm IGE, Grenoble, France; [Tonelli, Marcos; Wainer, Ilana] Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Oceanog, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Haumann, F.

Depending on the region, global warming may reinforce these environmental changes by reducing air-sea oxygen fluxes, intensifying internal nutrient cycling, and increasing river-borne nutrient loads. The development of appropriate management plans to effectively protect the marine environment requires projections of future marine ecosystem states. However, projections with regional climate models commonly suffer from shortcomings in the driving global General Circulation Models (GCMs). The differing sensitivities of GCMs to increased greenhouse gas concentrations affect regional projections considerably. In this study, we focused on one of the most threatened coastal seas, the Baltic Sea, and estimated uncertainties in projections due to climate model deficiencies and due to unknown future greenhouse gas concentration, nutrient load and sea level rise scenarios. To address the latter, simulations of the period 1975-2098 were performed using the initial conditions from an earlier reconstruction with the same Baltic Sea model (starting in 1850). To estimate the impacts of climate model uncertainties, dynamical downscaling experiments with four driving global models were carried out for two greenhouse gas concentration scenarios and for three nutrient load scenarios, covering the plausible range between low and high loads. The results suggest that changes in nutrient supply, in particular phosphorus, control the long-term (centennial) response of eutrophication, biogeochemical fluxes and oxygen conditions in the deep water. The analysis of simulated primary production, nitrogen fixation, and hypoxic areas shows that uncertainties caused by the various nutrient load scenarios are greater than the uncertainties due to climate model uncertainties and future greenhouse gas concentrations. In all scenario simulations, a proposed nutrient load abatement strategy, i.e., the Baltic Sea Action Plan, will lead to a significant improvement in the overall environmental state. However, the projections cannot provide detailed information on the timing and the reductions of future hypoxic areas, due to uncertainties in salinity projections caused by uncertainties in projections of the regional water cycle and of the mean sea level outside the model domain.","[Saraiva, Sofia; Meier, H.

This paper explores how interdisciplinary collaboration can form new understandings of, and communication about, environmental change. On Australia's Great Barrier Reef, mass coral bleaching prompts researchers to consider how our work can contribute to environmental stewardship that more effectively addresses the causes and consequences of climate change. Here, we report on one element of an ongoing collaboration involving researchers working in the fields of coastal geomorphology, human geography and art. In the spirit of geohumanities as an interdisciplinary approach to understanding places, we explore the work of narrative as a device for engaging with and communicating about the environmental challenge of coral reef degradation. Through independent and plaited narratives based on field research on the Great Barrier Reef, we undertake a deconstructive practice of uncommoning to consider what interdisciplinary collaboration enables, and how it opens up possibilities for engaging with, and communicating about, environmental crises. Sharing a curiosity about the island environment, each participant uses metaphors to evoke landscape features; however, they each work through different imaginative and emotional connections to place, by: reducing observations to measurements, evoking emotional responses, and provoking thinking about the multifarious, often global, processes contributing to the state of the environment.","[Hamylton, Sarah M.] Univ Wollongong, Sch Earth Atmospher & Life Sci, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia; [Gibbs, Leah] Univ Wollongong, Sch Geog & Sustainable Communities, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia; [Williams, Kim] Univ Wollongong, Sch Creat Arts, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia; [Ihlein, Lucas] Univ Wollongong, Creat Arts, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia",University of Wollongong; University of Wollongong; University of Wollongong; University of Wollongong,"Hamylton, SM (corresponding author), Univ Wollongong, Sch Earth Atmospher & Life Sci, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia.",shamylto@uow.edu.au; leah@uow.edu.au; kimw@uow.edu.au; lucasi@uovv.edu.au,,"Williams, Kim/0000-0001-8217-3500; Ihlein, Lucas/0000-0003-4873-2326; Gibbs, Leah/0000-0003-3231-9238",University of Wollongong Global Challenges Program; Australian Academy of Sciences,University of Wollongong Global Challenges Program; Australian Academy of Sciences,This work was supported by the University of Wollongong Global Challenges Program and The Australian Academy of Sciences.,,60,0,0,0,2,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2373-566X,2373-5678,,GEOHUMANITIES,Geohumanities,2-Jul,2020,2,,,,394,412,,10.1080/2373566X.2020.1819167,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/2373566X.2020.1819167,,,19,Geography,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Geography,WL7BZ,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000710557900010,View Full Record in Web of Science

Specifically, we ask: (1) do climate conditions with no modern analogue negatively affect the accuracy of ecosystem reconstructions? (2) are bioclimate envelope model projections biased towards under-predicting forested ecosystems? (3) given a palaeoecological perspective, are potential habitat projections for the 21st century within model capabilities? Location Western North America. Methods We used an ensemble classifier modelling approach (RandomForest) to spatially project the climate space of modern ecosystem classes throughout the Holocene (at 6000, 9000, 11,000, 14,000, 16,000, and 21,000 YBP) using palaeoclimate surfaces generated by two general circulationmodels (GFDL and CCM1). The degree of novel arrangement of climate variables was quantified with the multivariate Mahalanobis distance to the nearest modern climatic equivalent. Model projections were validated against biome classifications inferred from 1460 palaeoecological records. Results Model accuracy assessed against independent palaeoecology data is generally low for the present day, increases for 6000 YBP, and then rapidly declines towards the last glacial maximum, primarily due to the under-prediction of forested biomes. Misclassifications were closely correlated with the degree of climate dissimilarity from the present day. For future projections, no-analogue climates unexpectedly emerged in the coastal Pacific Northwest but were absent throughout the rest of the study area. Main conclusions Bioclimate envelope models could approximately reconstruct ecosystem distributions for the mid-to late-Holocene but proved unreliable in the Late Pleistocene. We attribute this failure to a combination of no-analogue climates and a potential lack of niche conservatism in tree species. However, climate dissimilarities in future projections are comparatively minor (similar to those of the mid-Holocene), and we conclude that no-analogue climates should not compromise the accuracy of model predictions for the next century.","[Roberts, David R.; Hamann, Andreas] Univ Alberta, Dept Renewable Resources, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H1, Canada",University of Alberta,"Roberts, DR (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Dept Renewable Resources, 751 Gen Serv Bldg, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H1, Canada.",drr3@ualberta.ca,,"Roberts, David/0000-0002-3437-2422; Hamann, Andreas/0000-0003-2046-4550",NSERC [RGPIN-330527-07]; Alberta Ingenuity Grant [200500661],NSERC(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); Alberta Ingenuity Grant,We thank Art Dyke for providing his palaeoecological database and for permitting the use of his previously-published images.

In particular, ensemble prediction experiments are based on the generation of multiple model simulations to explore, statistically, the existing uncertainties in weather and climate forecast. In this paper, we present a GRID application consisting of a state-of-the-art climate model. The main goal of the application is to provide a tool that can be used by a climate researcher to run ensemble-based predictions on the GRID for sensitivity studies. One of the main duties of this tool is the management of a workflow involving long-term jobs and data management in a user-friendly way. In this paper we show that, due to weaknesses of current GRID middleware, this management is complex task. Those weaknesses made necessary the development of a robust workflow adapted to the requirements of the climate application. As an illustrative scientific challenge, the application is applied to study the El Nino phenomenon, by simulating an El Nino year with different forcing conditions and analyzing the precipitation response over south-American countries subject to flooding risk.","[Fernandez-Quiruelas, V.; Fernandez, J.; Cofino, A.

The latemedieval (Gothic) period in northern Europe is also, according to the evidence presented here, marked by a transition from warm and sunny to cooler and cloudier conditions. It is within the context of this climate change that we consider one of the most important features in Gothic churches-interior day-lighting-during the transitional period (the thirteenth to the end of the fifteenth centuries) between the Medieval Warm Period (MWP) and the Little Ice Age (LIA). This paper seeks to determine whether increasingly cloudy conditions over northern continental Europe, in part due to a shift in North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) phase, may have influenced the use of more white glass in the fourteenth century. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time an extensive daylighting dataset has been collected in medieval sacred interiors. From an analysis of these illuminance and luminance data collected in European churches and cathedrals, we find that high-translucency glazing is associated with limited lighting gains compared to full-colour programs under sunny conditions but substantial lighting improvements (up to an order of magnitude) for cloudy conditions. Additionally, we find that backlighting from direct sunlight produces significant obscuration of some of the iconographical glass when interiors are dominated by high-translucency glazing, further suggesting that these interiors are not ideal for sunny conditions.","[Simmons, C.

The decadal predictions are performed in both retrospective (hindcast) and forecast modes. Specifically, the full set of prediction experiments consists of 3-member ensembles of 30-year simulations, starting at 5-year intervals from 1960 to 2005, using historical radiative forcing conditions for the 1960-2005 period, followed by RCP4.5 scenario settings for the 2006-2035 period. The ocean initial states are provided by ocean reanalyses differing by assimilation methods and assimilated data, but obtained with the same ocean model. The use of alternative ocean reanalyses yields the required perturbation of the full three-dimensional ocean state aimed at generating the ensemble members spread. A full-value initialization technique is adopted. The predictive skill of the system appears to be driven to large extent by trends in the radiative forcing. However, after detrending, a residual skill over specific regions of the ocean emerges in the near-term. Specifically, natural fluctuations in the North Atlantic sea-surface temperature (SST) associated with large-scale multi-decadal variability modes are predictable in the 2-5 year range. This is consistent with significant predictive skill found in the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation over a similar timescale. The dependency of forecast skill on ocean initialization is analysed, revealing a strong impact of details of ocean data assimilation products on the system predictive skill. This points to the need of reducing the large uncertainties that currently affect global ocean reanalyses, in the perspective of providing reliable near-term climate predictions.","[Bellucci, A.; Gualdi, S.; Masina, S.; Storto, A.; Fogli, P.; Navarra, A.] Ctr Euromediterraneo Cambiamenti Climat, I-40127 Bologna, Italy; [Gualdi, S.; Masina, S.; Scoccimarro, E.; Navarra, A.] Ist Nazl Geofis & Vulcanol, Bologna, Italy; [Cagnazzo, C.] CNR, Rome, Italy; [Manzini, E.] Max Planck Inst Meteorol, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany",Istituto Nazionale Geofisica e Vulcanologia (INGV); Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Max Planck Society,"Bellucci, A (corresponding author), Ctr Euromediterraneo Cambiamenti Climat, Viale A Moro 44, I-40127 Bologna, Italy.",alessio.bellucci@cmcc.it,"Storto, Andrea/AAH-3823-2019; Cagnazzo, Chiara/C-7194-2015; Scoccimarro, Enrico/AAV-6281-2020; Fogli, Pier Giuseppe/E-9486-2015; Masina, Simona/B-4974-2012; Gualdi, Silvio/F-3061-2015","Storto, Andrea/0000-0003-3856-8905; Scoccimarro, Enrico/0000-0001-7987-4744; Fogli, Pier Giuseppe/0000-0001-7997-6273; Gualdi, Silvio/0000-0001-7777-8935; MASINA, Simona/0000-0001-6273-7065; cagnazzo, chiara/0000-0002-2054-0448; BELLUCCI, Alessio/0000-0003-3766-1921","EU FP7 COMBINE Project [226520]; Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research; Ministry for Environment, Land and Sea through the Project GEMINA","EU FP7 COMBINE Project; Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR)); Ministry for Environment, Land and Sea through the Project GEMINA","The authors gratefully acknowledge the support from the EU FP7 COMBINE Project (Grant Agreement number 226520) and the Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research and Ministry for Environment, Land and Sea through the Project GEMINA.

An econometric model of electricity demand is used, in conjunction with climate projections from a state-of-the-art Global Circulation Model with a regional focus on the Eastern Mediterranean. Annual electricity demand is projected to rise by about 6% compared to a 'no climate change' case. Although these additional power requirements are not very remarkable on an annual basis, total costs up to 2050, which may exceed 730 million Euros at today's prices, imply that the country may need to forgo one or two years of economic growth in order to cope with extra electricity needs due to climate change. This outlook indicates that a reasonable future energy path in regions with Mediterranean climate would involve substantial deployment of solar-powered electricity generation, which can meet peak load requirements while reducing the country's energy dependence. Moreover, this forecast highlights the need for adaptation to climate change through investments in the improvement of the energy performance of the building stock. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This study investigates both the possible causes and climatic impacts of this SWA intermodel spread. The intermodel spread of global-mean SWA largely originates from the intermodel difference in water vapor shortwave absorptivity. Hence, we alter the water vapor shortwave absorptivity in the Community Earth System Model, version 1, with the Community Atmosphere Model, version 4 (CESM1-CAM4). Increasing the water vapor shortwave absorptivity leads to a reduction in global-mean precipitation and a La Nina-like cooling over the tropical Pacific. The global-mean atmospheric energy budget suggests that the precipitation is suppressed as a way to compensate for the increased SWA. The precipitation reduction is driven by the weakened surface winds, stabilized planetary boundary layer, and surface cooling. The La Nina-like cooling over the tropical Pacific is attributed to the zonal asymmetry of climatological evaporative damping efficiency and the low cloud enhancement over the eastern basin. Complementary fixed SSTs simulations suggest that the latter is more fundamental and that it primarily arises from atmospheric processes. Consistent with our experiments, the CMIP5/6 models with a higher global-mean SWA tend to produce tropical Pacific toward a more La Nina-like mean state, highlighting the possible role of water vapor shortwave absorptivity for shaping the mean-state climate patterns.","[Kim, Hanjun; Kang, Sarah M.] UNIST, Sch Urban & Environm Engn, Ulsan, South Korea; [Pendergrass, Angeline G.] Cornell Univ, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Ithaca, NY USA; [Pendergrass, Angeline G.] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Boulder, CO 80307 USA",Ulsan National Institute of Science & Technology (UNIST); Cornell University; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA,"Kang, SM (corresponding author), UNIST, Sch Urban & Environm Engn, Ulsan, South Korea.",skang@unist.ac.kr,", Sarah/CAA-3536-2022; Kang, Sarah M./F-9117-2011",", Sarah/0000-0003-4635-275X; ",National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - South Korean government (MSIT) [NRF-2020R1A2C2101503]; National Center for Atmospheric Research - National Science Foundation (NSF) [1947282]; Regional and Global Model Analysis (RGMA) component of the Earth and Environmental System Modeling Program of the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Biological and Environmental Research (BER) via NSF [IA 1844590],National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - South Korean government (MSIT); National Center for Atmospheric Research - National Science Foundation (NSF); Regional and Global Model Analysis (RGMA) component of the Earth and Environmental System Modeling Program of the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Biological and Environmental Research (BER) via NSF,"This work has been supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) Grant NRF-2020R1A2C2101503 funded by the South Korean government (MSIT).

Such a forecast system is the backbone of any successful climate service, which should provide advanced warning to government, industry, and communities, and thereby help reduce the impacts of adverse climatic conditions. In this study, we present the Next Generation (NextGen) seasonal forecast system which was recently adopted by the National Meteorological Agency (NMA) of Ethiopia. NextGen is based on a calibrated multi-model ensemble (CMME) approach that uses state-of-the-art general circulation models (GCM) from the North American MultiModel Ensemble project. A canonical correlation analysis-based regression is used to calibrate the predictions from the GCMs against observations. The calibrated GCMs are then combined with equal weight to make final CMME predictions. A hindcast skill assessment of the CMME predictions has been depicted in this study for three rainy seasons in Ethiopia, namely Belg: Feb to May, Kiremt: Jun to Sep, and Bega: Oct to Jan. Over the region, the resulting forecasts are characterized by moderate skill at lead-1 for all three seasons. NextGen forecasting system shows that Bega rain-benefiting areas demonstrate the highest deterministic and probabilistic skill when compared to Kiremt and Belg rainy areas. The real-time experimental forecast of Kiremt2020 was conducted using NextGen by NMA and proved quite successful in capturing precipitation anomalies comparable to observations.","[Acharya, Nachiketa] Penn State Univ, Dept Meteorol & Atmospher Sci, Ctr Earth Syst Modeling Anal & Data, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Ehsan, Muhammad Azhar; Hall, Kyle Joseph Chen] Columbia Univ, Int Res Inst Climate & Soc, Earth Inst, Palisades, NY USA; [Admasu, Adrajow; Teshome, Asaminew] Natl Meteorol Agcy Ethiopia, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Admasu, Adrajow] Netherlands Red Cross, Climate Ctr, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Columbia University,"Acharya, N (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Dept Meteorol & Atmospher Sci, Ctr Earth Syst Modeling Anal & Data, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",dr.nachiketaacharya@gmail.com,"Ehsan, Muhammad Azhar/AAF-6576-2020",,,,,,44,4,4,1,2,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2405-8807,,,CLIM SERV,Clim.

However, growing impacts of climate change are of the utmost concern for the integrity of many sites. Here, we inventory the glaciers present in natural World Heritage sites for the first time. We found 19,000 glaciers in 46 sites located all over the world. We analyze their recent evolution, current state, and project their mass change over the 21st century. Our results are based on a comprehensive review of the literature as well as a state-of-the-art glaciological model for computing glacier responses up to 2100. Illustrating the strong influence of CO2 emission scenarios and human actions on future ice loss magnitude, we project the wastage of 33% to 60% of the 2017 cumulative ice volume of 12,000 km(3) of World Heritage glaciers by 2100. Furthermore, we expect complete glacier extinction in 8 to 21 of the investigated World Heritage sites until the end of the century, depending on the climate scenario. We suggest that World Heritage glaciers should be considered as analogs to endangered umbrella, keystone, and flagship species, whose conservation would secure wider environmental and social benefits at global scale.","[Bosson, J-B; Osipova, E.] IUCN, World Heritage Programme, Gland, Switzerland; [Huss, M.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Lab Hydraul Hydrol & Glaciol VAW, Zurich, Switzerland; [Huss, M.] Univ Fribourg, Dept Geosci, Fribourg, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; University of Fribourg,"Bosson, JB (corresponding author), IUCN, World Heritage Programme, Gland, Switzerland.",jeanbaptiste.bosson@gmail.com,,"Huss, Matthias/0000-0002-2377-6923; Bosson, Jean-Baptiste/0000-0003-4732-4945; Osipova, Elena/0000-0002-0084-4209",,,,,60,30,31,4,24,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",,2328-4277,,EARTHS FUTURE,Earth Future,APR,2019,4,,,,469,479,,10.1029/2018EF001139,http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2018EF001139,,,11,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,HX4UU,,"Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000467396900011,View Full Record in Web of Science

Earlier studies that assess the forecast skill of short-term climate extremes (STCE), primarily using a single ensemble global climate model, are reviewed. This chapter details an assessment of the skill of STCE prediction by a state-of-the-art multimodel ensemble, the North American Multi-Model Ensemble (NMME), including forecasts for 5th and 95th percentile seasonal events in maximum, minimum, and mean 2 m temperature. Area-aggregate forecast-observation gridpoint anomaly correlations for forecasts of extremes are found to be higher than area-aggregate anomaly correlations for all forecasts, confirming the results of earlier studies. Assessment of the forecast skill for extremes using the Symmetric Extremal Dependence Index reveals several geographic areas where model forecasts are substantially more skillful than a climatological forecast. This chapter also includes a discussion of potential predictability of STCE, examined using perfect-model studies, and sources of predictability, including major climate modes, that may present windows of forecast opportunity.","[Becker, Emily J.] NOAA, Climate Predict Ctr, College Pk, MD 20740 USA; [Becker, Emily J.] INNOVIM LLC, College Pk, MD USA",National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Becker, EJ (corresponding author), NOAA, Climate Predict Ctr, College Pk, MD 20740 USA.;Becker, EJ (corresponding author), INNOVIM LLC, College Pk, MD USA.",,,"Becker, Emily/0000-0002-5533-9891",,,,,50,1,1,0,0,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",0065-8448,,978-1-119-06803-7; 978-1-119-06784-9,GEOPHYS MONOGR SER,,,2017,,,,,347,359,,,,10.1002/9781119068020,,13,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Book Citation Index – Science (BKCI-S),Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,BK7CW,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000441184400022,View Full Record in Web of Science

A warmer climate with more frequent and intense extremes could result in supply reliability issues. Here, (i) a robust framework to highlight the interdependencies between hydropower, water availability, and climate change is proposed, (ii) the state-of-the art literature on the projected impacts of climate change on hydropower in sub-Saharan Africa is reviewed, and (iii) supporting evidence on past trends and current pathways of power mix diversification, drought incidence, and climate change projections is provided. We find that only few countries have pursued a diversification strategy away from hydropower over the last three decades, while others' expansion plans will reinforce the dependency. This will occur irrespective of the fact that some of the largest river basins have experienced a significant drying during the last century. Agreement is found on likely positive impacts of climate change on East Africa's hydropower potential, negative impacts in West and Southern Africa, and substantial uncertainty in Central Africa. Irrespective of the absolute change in gross technical potential, more frequent and intense extremes are projected. One possible paradigm to increase resilience and fulfil the pledges of the Paris Agreement is a synergetic planning and management of hydropower and variable renewables. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The project, titled Wedding Route, is an immersive installation that deals with the overlapping of knowledge gained from the natural sciences and arts, while also questioning politics, ecology, technology. Wedding Route deals with the life cycle and migration of the critically endangered European eel. No matter where they live, once sexually mature, they turn into a silvery color and make their final arduous journey back to Sargasso Sea, driven by their instinct. Lake Ohrid (the largest in Macedonia) is currently being artificially populated with eels, as this animal has been unable to migrate into the lake's waters since 1962 when the first hydroelectric dam was built. Globally, the European eel population faces rapid declination, and its story is very much that of man-made borders, overfishing and death caused by habitat decline and climate change, hence preventing its millions of years old migration back to the Sargasso Sea. Through an inter and trans-disciplinary approach that combines art, science, and technology, working with moving pictures, sound, and installation, Pulejkova aims to build subjective narratives relying on scientific data and principles. The project and its outcome is a pure example of speculative pragmatism, since through theoretical exploration and artistic visual simulation of the location and the appearance of the act of eel spawning (since scientists have so far only speculated on the occurrence of this mysterious event) she offers a pragmatic discussion on ecology, migration, and politics in general.","[Frangovska, Ana] Natl Gallery RN Macedonia, Skopje, North Macedonia; [Frangovska, Ana] Fac Philosophy, Inst Art Hist & Archeol, Skopje, North Macedonia",,"Frangovska, A (corresponding author), Natl Gallery RN Macedonia, Skopje, North Macedonia.;Frangovska, A (corresponding author), Fac Philosophy, Inst Art Hist & Archeol, Skopje, North Macedonia.",anafrangovska@gmail.com,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,2,"SINGIDUNUM UNIV, FAC MEDIA & COMMUNICATIONS",BELGRADE,"KARADORDEVA 65, BELGRADE, 11000, SERBIA",2217-9666,2406-1654,,AM J ART MEDIA STUD,Am.

Where harvested under natural or cultivated conditions, truffles can have a significant socioeconomic impact and may even form a key component of cultural identity. Although some aspects of truffle biology and ecology have been elucidated recently, the role of abiotic, environmental and climatic factors in the production andmaturation of their fruitbodies is still largely unknown. Based on 36-year-long, continuous records of Mediterranean truffle yield, we demonstrate that decreased summer precipitation together with increased summer temperatures significantly reduce the fungus' subsequent winter harvest. Using state-of-the-art climate model projections, we predict that a significant decline of 78-100% in southern European truffle production is likely to occur between 2071 and 2100. The additional threats of forecasted heatwaves, forest fires, pest and disease outbreaks are discussed along with socioeconomic and ecological consequences of a warmer and dryer future climate. Our results emphasize the need for unravelling the direct and indirect effects of climate change on Europe's truffle sector and underline the importance of conservation initiatives at local to international scales.

Paintings and petroglyphs can be found within caves and rock shelters or in open-air contexts and for that reason they are not isolated from the processes acting at the Earth surface. Consequently, rock art represents a sort of ecosystem because it is part of the complex and multidirectional interplay between the host rock, pigments, environmental parameters, and microbial communities. Such complexity results in several processes affecting rock art; some of them contribute to its destruction, others to its preservation. To understand the effects of such processes an interdisciplinary scientific approach is needed. In this contribution, we discuss the many processes acting at the rock interface-where rock art is present-and the multifaceted possibilities of scientific investigations-non-invasive or invasive-offered by the STEM disciplines. Finally, we suggest a sustainable approach to investigating rock art allowing to understand its production as well as its preservation and eventually suggest strategies to mitigate the risks threatening its stability.","[Zerboni, Andrea; Wu, Ying-Li] Univ Milan, Dipartimento Sci Terra A Desio, Via L Mangiagalli 34, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Villa, Federica; Cappitelli, Francesca] Univ Milan, Dipartimento Sci Alimenti Nutr & Ambiente, Via L Mangiagalli 34, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Solomon, Tadele] EHA Ethiopian Heritage Author, Addis Ababa 1000, Ethiopia; [Trentini, Andrea; Rizzi, Alessandro] Dipartimento Informat G Degli Antoni, Via Celoria 18, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Gallinaro, Marina] Sapienza Univ Roma, Dipartimento Sci Antichita, I-00185 Rome, Italy",University of Milan; University of Milan; Sapienza University Rome,"Zerboni, A (corresponding author), Univ Milan, Dipartimento Sci Terra A Desio, Via L Mangiagalli 34, I-20133 Milan, Italy.;Gallinaro, M (corresponding author), Sapienza Univ Roma, Dipartimento Sci Antichita, I-00185 Rome, Italy.",andrea.zerboni@unimi.it; federica.villa@unimi.it; ying.wu@unimi.it; tasebe@gmail.com; andrea.trentini@unimi.it; alessandro.rizzi@unimi.it; francesca.cappitelli@unimi.it; marina.gallinaro@uniroma1.it,"Villa, Federica/B-8787-2017","Villa, Federica/0000-0003-2930-4684; Cappitelli, Francesca/0000-0003-1237-1813; Trentini, Andrea/0000-0002-8629-3056","CHROMA Project (SEED 2019 Grant from the University of Milano); European Union [795744]; (H)ORIGN Project - Italian Ministry of Education [RBSI142SRD]; Italian Ministry of Education, University, and Research (MIUR); Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Ministry of Education in Taiwan","CHROMA Project (SEED 2019 Grant from the University of Milano); European Union(European Commission); (H)ORIGN Project - Italian Ministry of Education; Italian Ministry of Education, University, and Research (MIUR)(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR)); Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs(Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation (Italy)); Ministry of Education in Taiwan(Ministry of Education, Taiwan)","This contribution is part of the activities supported by the CHROMA Project (SEED 2019 Grant from the University of Milano entrusted to A.Z.).

However, the existing univariate bias correction methods often fail to account for such dependences. While the multivariate bias correction methods have been developed to address this issue, they do not consistently outperform the univariate methods due to various assumptions. In this study, using 20 state-of-the-art coupled general circulation models (GCMs) daily mean, maximum and minimum temperature (T-mean, T-max and T-min) from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6), we comprehensively evaluated the Super Resolution Deep Residual Network (SRDRN) deep learning model for climate downscaling and bias correction. The SRDRN model sequentially stacked 20 GCMs with single or multiple input-output channels, so that the biases can be efficiently removed based on the relative relations among different GCMs against observations, and the intervariable dependences can be retained for multivariate bias correction. It corrected biases in spatial dependences by deeply extracting spatial features and making adjustments for daily simulations according to observations. For univariate SRDRN, it considerably reduced larger biases of T-mean in space, time, as well as extremes compared to the quantile delta mapping (QDM) approach. For multivariate SRDRN, it performed better than the dynamic Optimal Transport Correction (dOTC) method and reduced greater biases of T-max and T-min but also reproduced intervariable dependences of the observations, where QDM and dOTC showed unrealistic artifacts (T-max < T-min). Additional studies on the deep learning-based approach may bring climate model bias correction and downscaling to the next level.","[Wang, Fang; Tian, Di] Auburn Univ, Dept Crop Soil & Environm Sci, Auburn, AL 36849 USA",Auburn University System; Auburn University,"Tian, D (corresponding author), Auburn Univ, Dept Crop Soil & Environm Sci, Auburn, AL 36849 USA.",tiandi@auburn.edu,,"Tian, Di/0000-0001-7752-947X","NOAA RESTORE program [NA19NOS4510194]; Alabama Agricultural Experiment Station; Hatch program of the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) [1012578]; USDA NIFA Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (AFRI) program [1019690, AL-80NSSC21M0138]; National Science Foundation [ACI-1548562]",NOAA RESTORE program; Alabama Agricultural Experiment Station; Hatch program of the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA); USDA NIFA Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (AFRI) program; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This study is supported in part by the NOAA RESTORE program (No. NA19NOS4510194), by the Alabama Agricultural Experiment Station and the Hatch program of the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) (No. 1012578), by the USDA NIFA Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (AFRI) program (No. 1019690) and by the NASA EPSCoR R3 program support (No. AL-80NSSC21M0138).

Given the demonstrated sensitivity of malaria transmission to vector capacity, this work tests response functions to fluctuations in land surface temperature and precipitation. Methods: This study of regional sensitivity of malaria incidence to year-to-year climate variations used an extended Macdonald Ross compartmental disease model (to compute malaria incidence) built on top of a global Anopheles vector capacity model (based on 10 years of satellite climate data). The predicted incidence was compared with estimates from the World Health Organization and the Malaria Atlas. The models and denominator data used are freely available through the Eclipse Foundation's Spatiotemporal Epidemiological Modeller (STEM). Results: Although the absolute scale factor relating reported malaria to absolute incidence is uncertain, there is a positive correlation between predicted and reported year-to-year variation in malaria burden with an averaged root mean square (RMS) error of 25% comparing normalized incidence across 86 countries. Based on this, the proposed measure of sensitivity of malaria to variations in climate variables indicates locations where malaria is most likely to increase or decrease in response to specific climate factors. Bootstrapping measures the increased uncertainty in predicting malaria sensitivity when reporting is restricted to national level and an annual basis. Results indicate a potential 20x improvement in accuracy if data were available at the level ISO 3166-2 national subdivisions and with monthly time sampling. Conclusions: The high spatial resolution possible with state-of-the-art numerical models can identify regions most likely to require intervention due to climate changes. Higher-resolution surveillance data can provide a better understanding of how climate fluctuations affect malaria incidence and improve predictions. An open-source modelling framework, such as STEM, can be a valuable tool for the scientific community and provide a collaborative platform for developing such models.","[Edlund, Stefan; Davis, Matthew; Douglas, Judith V.; Kaufman, James H.] IBM Corp, Almaden Res Ctr, San Jose, CA 95120 USA; [Kershenbaum, Arik] Univ Haifa, Dept Evolutionary & Environm Biol, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel; [Waraporn, Narongrit] King Mongkuts Univ Technol, Sch Informat Technol, Bangkok, Thailand; [Lessler, Justin] Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA",International Business Machines (IBM); University of Haifa; King Mongkuts University of Technology North Bangkok; King Mongkuts University of Technology Thonburi; Johns Hopkins University; Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health,"Kaufman, JH (corresponding author), IBM Corp, Almaden Res Ctr, 650 Harry Rd, San Jose, CA 95120 USA.",jhkauf@us.ibm.com,"Kershenbaum, Arik/C-3552-2012","Kershenbaum, Arik/0000-0003-0464-0243; Lessler, Justin/0000-0002-9741-8109; Kaufman, James/0000-0002-7049-7134",Eclipse Foundation,Eclipse Foundation,We thank the Eclipse Foundation for its support of the STEM Project.

Besides the electric motor, the Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system is another major contributor to the power consumption that may influence the EV battery lifetime and driving range. In the state-of-the-art methodologies for battery management systems, the battery performance is monitored and improved. While in the automotive climate control, the passenger's thermal comfort is the main objective. Hence, the influence of the HVAC power on the battery behavior for the purpose of jointly optimized battery management and climate control has not been considered. In this article, we propose an automotive climate control methodology that is aware of the battery behavior and performance, while maintaining the passenger's thermal comfort. In our methodology, battery parameters and cabin temperature are modeled and estimated, and the HVAC utilization is optimized and adjusted with respect to the electric motor and HVAC power requests. Therefore, the battery stress reduces, while the cabin temperature is maintained by predicting and optimizing the system states in the near-future. We have implemented our methodology and compared its performance to the state-of-the-art in terms of battery lifetime improvement and energy consumption reduction. We have also conducted experiments and analyses to explore multiple control window sizes, drive profiles, ambient temperatures, and modeling error rates in the methodology. It is shown that our battery-aware climate control can extend the battery lifetime by up to 13.2% and reduce the energy consumption by up to 14.4%.","[Vatanparvar, Korosh; Al Faruque, Mohammad Abdullah] Univ Calif Irvine, 5440 Engn Hall, Irvine, CA 92697 USA",University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Vatanparvar, K (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, 5440 Engn Hall, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",kvatanpa@uci.edu; alfaruqu@uci.edu,,"Al Faruque, Mohammad Abdullah/0000-0002-5390-0497",,,,,54,9,9,0,24,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"2 PENN PLAZA, STE 701, NEW YORK, NY 10121-0701 USA",1539-9087,1558-3465,,ACM T EMBED COMPUT S,ACM Trans.

The sample group consisted of 53 gifted students studying in a Science and Art Center located in Anatolia in the 2018-2019 academic year. As data collection tool, the draw-write-tell technique was used. The drawings of the students were grouped into four categories as causes of climate change and global warming, their results, recommendations and unacceptable drawings; whereas, the compositions of the students and the focus group interviews were collected under three categories including causes, results and recommendations as a result of content analysis. The research results suggested that while the perception levels of gifted students about the causes and possible results of climate change and global warming were high, their perception level about the solution of these problems was quite low. In addition, it was determined that students had misconceptions about climate change and global warming.

Elucidating the mechanisms responsible for interglacial changes in the ocean carbon inventory provides constraints on natural carbon sources and sinks and their climate sensitivity, which are essential for assessing potential future changes. However, the mechanisms leading to modifications of the ocean's carbon budget during this period remain poorly documented and not well understood. Using a state-of-the-art Earth system model, we analyze the changes in oceanic carbon dynamics by comparing two quasi-equilibrium states: the early, warm Eemian (125 ka) versus the cooler, late Eemian (115 ka). We find considerably reduced ocean dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC; - 314 : 1 PgC) storage in the warm climate state at 125 ka as compared to 115 ka, mainly attributed to changes in the biological pump and ocean DIC disequilibrium components. The biological pump is mainly driven by changes in interior ocean ventilation timescales, but the processes controlling the changes in ocean DIC disequilibrium remain difficult to assess and seem more regionally affected. While the Atlantic bottom-water disequilibrium is affected by the organization of sea-ice-induced southern-sourced water (SSW) and northern-sourced water (NSW), the upper-layer changes remain unexplained. Due to its large size, the Pacific accounts for the largest DIC loss, approximately 57% of the global decrease. This is largely associated with better ventilation of the interior Pacific water mass. However, the largest simulated DIC differences per unit volume are found in the SSWs of the Atlantic. Our study shows that the deep-water geometry and ventilation in the South Atlantic are altered between the two climate states where warmer climatic conditions cause SSWs to retreat southward and NSWs to extent further south. This process is mainly responsible for the simulated DIC reduction by restricting the extent of DIC-rich SSW, thereby reducing the storage of biological remineralized carbon at depth.","[Kessler, Augustin; Tjiputra, Jerry] Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, NORCE Norwegian Res Ctr, POB 22, N-5838 Bergen, Norway; [Galaasen, Eirik Vinje; Ninnemann, Ulysses Silas] Univ Bergen, Dept Earth Sci, Bergen, Norway; [Galaasen, Eirik Vinje; Ninnemann, Ulysses Silas] Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, Bergen, Norway",Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research; Norwegian Research Centre (NORCE); University of Bergen; Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research,"Kessler, A (corresponding author), Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, NORCE Norwegian Res Ctr, POB 22, N-5838 Bergen, Norway.",augustin.kessler@norceresearch.no,"Tjiputra, Jerry/AAB-5896-2022","Galaasen, Eirik Vinje/0000-0002-6851-9066; Tjiputra, Jerry/0000-0002-4600-2453","Research Council of Norway [254964, 239965]; Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research project BIGCHANGE; Norwegian Metacenter for Computational Science and Storage Infrastructure (Notur/Norstore) [nn2345k, ns2345k, nn1002k, ns1002k]",Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway); Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research project BIGCHANGE; Norwegian Metacenter for Computational Science and Storage Infrastructure (Notur/Norstore),"We thank Victor Brovkin and the two anonymous referees for their positive and constructive comments, which helped to clarify the manuscript.

While in some climate-relevant sectors, such as the transport sector, there already is some initial research on the relationship between climate and gender, research on the climate-gender nexus in the coal sector is still underdeveloped, and the few existing studies focus on dichotomous relations (gender-coal and coal-climate). This article discusses the currently neglected climate, coal, and gender triad and develops a conceptualization along the following aspects: (i) common lines of arguments, (ii) shortcomings in predominant arguments, and (iii) the state-of-the-art regarding the climate-gender-coal triad. To illustrate this outline, it uses the empirical case of the Colombian coal sector. Based on original data obtained via semi-structured interviews, it analyzes how imminent national-level climate policies for the coal sector, i.e., an energy transition, can be made gender-responsive and thus contribute to a just transition. The empirical example shows that women are already important change agents at the local level and in informal decision-making spaces. Although more research is needed to obtain further insights and evidence, this article contributes to the findings of more recent research which allow for the assumption that addressing climate and gender simultaneously may be mutually beneficial for both policy objectives.","[Mohr, Kerstin] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Dept Econ Business Adm & Law, D-26129 Oldenburg, Germany",Carl von Ossietzky Universitat Oldenburg,"Mohr, K (corresponding author), Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Dept Econ Business Adm & Law, D-26129 Oldenburg, Germany.",mohr.kerstin@gmail.com,,,GIZ,GIZ,"I would like to express my appreciation to my colleagues Silvia Rojas Castro and Kathrin Meyer for fruitful discussions on the matter, as well as to Ana Mahecha, Natalia Daza and Maria Laura Rojas Vallejo.

The 16 ACCMIP models have a wide range of horizontal and vertical resolutions, vertical extent, chemistry schemes and [GRAPHICA] interaction with radiation and clouds. While anthropogenic and biomass burning emissions were specified for all time slices in the ACCMIP protocol, it is found that the natural emissions are responsible for a significant range across models, mostly in the case of ozone precursors. The analysis of selected present-day climate diagnostics (precipitation, temperature, specific humidity and zonal wind) reveals biases consistent with state-of-the-art climate models. The model-to-model comparison of changes in temperature, specific humidity and zonal wind between 1850 and 2000 and between 2000 and 2100 indicates mostly consistent results. However, models that are clear outliers are different enough from the other models to significantly affect their simulation of atmospheric chemistry.","[Lamarque, J. -F.] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Earth Syst Lab, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [Shindell, D.

They share with the numerical weather prediction the difficulty of initializing the simulations with a realistic state of the atmosphere and the need to periodically verify different aspects of their quality, while additionally are burdened by uncertainties in feedback processes that also play a central role in constraining climate projections. Seasonal predictions have to deal also with the challenge of initializing all the components of the climate system (ocean, sea ice, and land surface). The value of skilful seasonal forecasts is obvious for many societal sectors and is currently being included in the framework of developing climate services. Seasonal forecasts will in addition be valuable by increasing the acceptance of climate projections among the general public. This advanced-review article presents an overview of the state-of-the-art in global seasonal predictability and forecasting for climate researchers and discusses fundamental advances to increase forecast quality in the near future. The article concludes with a list of challenges where seasonal forecasting is expected to focus on in the near future.

The acceptance of global warming and effects related to climate change has reinforced this evolution. In the recent past, there have been several reviews of modeling techniques that have addressed, among other things, model structure and hierarchies within models. We argue that models seeking to adequately address climate change must include a specific suite of site characteristics. These range from primary effects of climate change (temperature, CO2, and O-3 increase) to secondary effects (increase in soil temperature, microbial activity, and changes in precipitation patterns) and tertiary effects (changes in tree phenology and photosynthesis). This paper (i) compares 12 existing individual tree growth simulators designed to address climate change or related effects, (ii) proposes a set of site-related mechanisms and entities to be included in any modeling framework to address climate change, and (iii) suggests appropriate lines of research to attain the goal of a model driven by climate and able to be initialized with readily available metrics.

These buildings generate more emissions than new buildings and in most European countries, preservation principles take precedence over energy efficiency and the reduction of emissions. This research is a key topic for the mitigation of climate change and proposes a method for assessing the impact of climate change on the preservation of artworks, thermal comfort, and energy consumption. An experimental method was followed, combining analytical formulations, on-site measurements, and Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning systems in order to identify the adequate hygrothermal parameters for historic buildings. The climate change scenario predicted for 2050 was based on projected temperature variation. The case studies were Baroque churches, historic buildings located in the south of Europe. Data obtained from a monitoring campaign carried out in these churches was used to validate dynamic simulation models. The churches analysed showed an increase in cooling demand and a decrease in heating demand. Furthermore, in order to ensure human comfort and the preservation of artworks, it was necessary to implement active systems in operation for 12-hour periods. These results suggest an energy overconsumption, as the energy consumption for human comfort and artwork preservation was 50% higher than the energy consumption of active systems for the preservation of valuable historic objects. In addition, the annual energy consumption decreases for future scenarios for 2050 in the case of artwork preservation and thermal comfort, but increases by almost 15% for the preservation of works of art due to higher level relative humidity. Before historic buildings can be adapted, it is essential to understand the influence of the future climate on their design, construction, and environmental conditions.","[Munoz Gonzalez, C.

For example, the dollar value of carbon dioxide emissions due to anthropogenic climate damages, known as the social cost of carbon dioxide (SC-CO2), can be computed via the widely used DICE (Dynamic Integrated model of Climate and the Economy) JAM by solving an open-loop optimal control problem. The results of such an open-loop decision-making strategy, however, do not fully reflect the impacts of uncertainty in the dynamic response of the global climatic system to radiative forcing. In this paper, we propose an implementation of the DICE JAM based on model predictive control (MPC). This MPC-based approach draws a clear distinction between the climate model used by DICE for mitigation planning purposes, and the true global climate herein captured by a low-order emulation of a model drawn from a state-of-the-art climate model ensemble (CMIP5, the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project). The closed-loop control methodology in this paper thereby quantifies the impact of parametric climate model uncertainty (plant model mismatch) on estimates of the SC-CO2 obtained from DICE.

Model variations plus uncertainties in the future climate change scenarios create a big challenge for such evaluation. In this work, we developed a statistical crop model using the historical yield data between 19812010 from the National Bureau of Statistics; and analyzed the impact of temperature and precipitation change on the crop yields in six different regions of China based on ensemble climate predictions from CMIP5 (the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5). Our results suggest that crop productionss per unit sown area in Eastern, Centural-South, and Southwest China were all negetively impacted by increasing temperature, while in Northwest China the yield was positively correlated with both temperature and precipitation change. The sensitivity of crop yield to climate warming tends to increase from north to south and from inner land to coast regions. Future projections with a medium greenhouse gas mitigation scenario (RCP4.5) showed that without sufficient adaptation measures the crop yield in China would experience a 3.4-8.0% reduction in 2030s. Our approach used over 20 ensemble predictions from six state-of-the-art climate models thus reduced the overall uncertainty and provided a consistant albeit conservative assessment of the climate impact.","Zhejiang Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Hangzhou 310003, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University,"Gao, CC (corresponding author), Zhejiang Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Hangzhou 310003, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",gaocc@zju.edu.cn,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,11,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2334-3168,,978-1-4673-2494-6,INT CONF AGRO-GEOINF,,,2012,,,,,208,212,,,,,,5,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Remote Sensing",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Engineering; Remote Sensing,BCZ34,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000312156100044,View Full Record in Web of Science

The ESMs, however, often show substantial bias in simulated marine biogeochemistry which can potentially introduce an undesirable bias in physical ocean fields through biogeophysical interactions. This study examines how and how much the chlorophyll bias in a state-of-the-art ESM affects the mean and seasonal cycle of tropical Pacific sea-surface temperature (SST). The ESM used in the present study shows a sizeable positive bias in the simulated tropical chlorophyll. We found that the correction of the chlorophyll bias can reduce the ESM's intrinsic cold SST mean bias in the equatorial Pacific. The biologically-induced cold SST bias is strongly affected by seasonally-dependent air-sea coupling strength. In addition, the correction of chlorophyll bias can improve the annual cycle of SST by up to 25%. This result suggests a possible modeling approach in understanding the two-way interactions between physical and chlorophyll biases by biogeophysical effects.","[Lim, Hyung-Gyu; Kug, Jong-Seong] Pohang Univ Sci & Technol POSTECH, Div Environm Sci & Engn, 77 Cheongam Ro, Pohang 790784, South Korea; [Park, Jong-Yeon] Princeton Univ, Atmospher & Ocean Sci Program, 201 Forrestal Rd, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA; [Park, Jong-Yeon] NOAA, Geophys Fluid Dynam Lab, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA",Pohang University of Science & Technology (POSTECH); National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Princeton University; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Kug, JS (corresponding author), Pohang Univ Sci & Technol POSTECH, Div Environm Sci & Engn, 77 Cheongam Ro, Pohang 790784, South Korea.;Park, JY (corresponding author), Princeton Univ, Atmospher & Ocean Sci Program, 201 Forrestal Rd, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA.;Park, JY (corresponding author), NOAA, Geophys Fluid Dynam Lab, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA.",jongyeon@princeton.edu; jskug1@gmail.com,"Lim, Hyung-Gyu/GYD-9716-2022; Lim, Hyung-Gyu/AAK-6808-2021; park, jongyeon/AAR-1563-2021","Lim, Hyung-Gyu/0000-0002-0746-5332; KUG, JONG-SEONG/0000-0003-2251-2579",Korea Meteorological Administration Research and Development Program [KMIPA 2015-1041]; National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2017R1A2B3011511]; Hyundai Motor Chung Mong-Koo Foundation,Korea Meteorological Administration Research and Development Program(Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA)); National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea); Hyundai Motor Chung Mong-Koo Foundation,This study was supported by the Korea Meteorological Administration Research and Development Program under Grant KMIPA 2015-1041 and National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF-2017R1A2B3011511).

Data subsets may be retrieved, and limited (and non-standard) metadata queries made. Data are abstracted from storage only to a limited degree. We present an alternate data access mechanism, the Grid Access Data Service (GADS), better suited to Grid applications. Requirements of data abstracted from storage, rich metadata models, flexible delivery, security, and orchestrated workflows all suggest a Web Service solution. The GADS Web Service has two operations: a querying mechanism, and a request mechanism. Three metadata models are required: one for the abstract representation of climate data, one for characterizing data usage, and one for describing data storage artifacts. A compatibility interface has been layered on the Web Service to provide DODS/OlPeNDAP functionality.

In particular, an increase in flooding and extreme erosion events is foreseeable as a result of an anticipated increase in the frequency and severity of storms. In the absence of timely and strategic intervention, climate change is taking us closer to more uncertain (non-linear, stochastic) and potentially more catastrophic climatic impacts. This paper develops a state-of-the-art modelling framework to assess the economic impact of erosion hazards on critical infrastructure and evaluate their vulnerability and resilience to differing storm regimes. This framework is trialled on a UK town (Cockermouth, NW England) that has experienced significant storm-related erosion and flood damage in recent years, highlighting its ability to determine current and future erosion hazard to critical infrastructure. A hydro-sedimentary model is used to simulate fluvial and hillslope sediment erosion and deposition caused by extreme storms within river catchments (sheet, rill, gully and channel bank and bed erosion). The model is applied for current climate conditions and for two future epochs (2021-2040 & 2061-2080) to assess changing erosion hazard to critical infrastructure. Climate conditions for the two epochs are obtained using the UKCP18 high resolution realisation projections under emission scenario RCP8.5. The economic loss caused by these hazards is projected based on new, non-linear depth-cost curves derived from previous assessments. The results show that: 1) due to a warming climate, total rainfall in the Cockermouth area (and likely across the UK) may be higher for all storm durations and annual exceedance probabilities, until epoch 2061-2080 when the rainfall regime may shift towards shorter duration events with higher rainfall and longer duration events with less rainfall; 2) the total area that undergoes flooding, erosion and sediment deposition, and the magnitude of the hazard, may increase as the climate shifts; 3) the economic damage caused by erosion and deposition is positively related to rainfall total, and the highest costs are likely to be associated with damage caused to bridges (102-130 pound million), followed by sediment deposition in the urban fabric (9-82 pound million), and erosion damage to agricultural land (16-26 pound million), buildings (0.4-18 pound million) and roads (0.4-4 pound million); and 4) the Estimated Annual Damage costs suggest that investment in bridges (4-6 pound million) in the Cockermouth area is required now to ensure their resilience to extreme storm events, and interventions are likely to be needed within the next 20 years to prevent high economic costs associated with significant sediment deposition in the urban fabric (0.3-4 pound million) and damage to roads (0.08-0.1 pound million) and agricultural land (0.6-2 pound million). This new framework can help support operational (immediate) and strategic (medium to long term i.e. 10+ years) erosion control decision making through the provision of an assessment of the scale and consequences of erosion.","[Li, Xiaorong; Cooper, James R.; Plater, Andrew J.] Univ Liverpool, Sch Environm Sci, Liverpool L69 7ZT, Merseyside, England; [Li, Xiaorong] Swansea Univ, Coll Engn, Energy & Environm Res Grp, Swansea SA2 8PP, W Glam, Wales",University of Liverpool; Swansea University,"Li, XR (corresponding author), Univ Liverpool, Sch Environm Sci, Liverpool L69 7ZT, Merseyside, England.;Li, XR (corresponding author), Swansea Univ, Coll Engn, Energy & Environm Res Grp, Swansea SA2 8PP, W Glam, Wales.",xiaorongli.912@gmail.com,,,UK Natural Environment Research Council [NE/S01697X/1]; NERC [NE/S01697X/1] Funding Source: UKRI,UK Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),This work was supported by the UK Natural Environment Research Council research grant: 'Erosion Hazards in River Catchments: Making Critical Infrastructure More Climate Resilient' (NE/S01697X/1) .

Taking the CO2 fertilization into account, we find increasing yield levels (in the range of 10-24%) and sharp increases in production risks for an illustrative climate change scenario that suggests a marked increase in temperature and decrease in summer rainfall. Climate change-induced increases in the coefficients of variation of grassland yields are in the range of 21 and 50%. This finding underpins that additional risk management strategies are needed to cope with climate-change impacts on grassland production. The outputs from the grassland model are evaluated economically using certainty equivalents, i.e., accounting for mean quasi rents and production risks. To identify potential risk management strategies under current and future climatic conditions, we consider adjustments of production intensity and farm-level yield insurance. The impact of climate change on production intensities is found to be ambiguous: farmers' will increase intensity under unconstrained production conditions, but will decrease production intensity in the presence of a cross-compliance scheme. Our results also show that the considered insurance scheme is a powerful tool to manage climate risks in grassland production under current and future conditions because it can reduce the coefficients of variation of quasi rents by up to 50%. However, we find that direct payments tend to reduce farmers' incentives to use such insurance scheme.","[Finger, Robert] ETH, Zurich, Switzerland; [Calanca, Pierluigi] Agroscope Reckenholz Tanikon Res Stn ART, Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Swiss Federal Research Station Agroscope; Swiss Federal Research Station for Agroecology & Agriculture,"Finger, R (corresponding author), ETH, Zurich, Switzerland.",rofinger@ethz.ch,"Finger, Robert/A-6248-2011","Finger, Robert/0000-0002-0634-5742",EU [EVK2-CT2001-00132],EU(European Commission),"The paper is a contribution to the activities of the National Centre for Competence in Research (NCCR) Climate.

The approach is based on downscaling the Weibull parameters of wind speed probability distributions from AOGCM-derived 500 hPa relative vorticity and sea-level pressure gradients, and is demonstrated to generate accurate depictions of the wind climate during the transfer function conditioning period. Bootstrapping is used to develop 100 realizations for each downscaling period and these are used to assess the uncertainty in the results due to stochastic effects in the AOGCM-derived downscaling predictors. Projected changes in the wind speed probability distribution vary with the AOGCMs from which the predictors are derived, but generally it is shown that mean wind speeds, 90th percentile wind speeds and energy density are slightly lower in the 2081-2100 climate projection period than during 1961-1990 at the majority of the 46 stations studied. Conversely it is found that there is no significant difference between conditions during 2046-2065 and 1961-1990 based on the ensemble of downscaling results. Equally, the winter time of 2046-2065 is largely indistinguishable from 1961-1990 for the majority of stations, while the winters of 2081-2100 appear to be associated with lower mean and 90th percentile wind speeds and energy density.","Indiana Univ, Atmospher Sci Program, Dept Geog, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; Riso Natl Lab, Dept Wind Energy & Atmospher Phys, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Technical University of Denmark,"Pryor, SC (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Atmospher Sci Program, Dept Geog, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",spryor@indiana.edu,"Schoof, Justin/ABB-5950-2020; Barthelmie, Rebecca J/A-7693-2018; Schoof, Justin/AAD-6219-2022; Pryor, Sara C/AAB-9141-2021","Barthelmie, Rebecca J/0000-0003-0403-6046; Schoof, Justin/0000-0002-2313-7267; Pryor, S.C./0000-0003-4847-3440",,,,,46,68,70,1,13,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0936-577X,1616-1572,,CLIM RES,Clim.

The result shows the complexity of vulnerabilities that are not only climate change impacts, but more importantly, the socio-economic sensitivity, the insufficient infrastructure system, and limited adaptive capacity. Adaptation responses, correspondingly, address primarily current vulnerabilities rather than future climate change impacts. Local climate change adaptation in developing countries, therefore, cannot separate from socio-economic development and capacity enhancement.

This chapter reviews recent progress in our understanding of the global monsoon (GM) system and its associated precipitation changes in the present and future warming climates. The GM can be viewed as an integrated system of all regional monsoons over the globe that are driven by solar forcing and bounded by the planetary-scale overturning circulation. The GM precipitation (GMP), defined as the total summer monsoon precipitation amount within the GM area (GMA), experienced multi-decadal variability in the twentieth century. The observed GMP over land shows a slightly increasing trend from 1900 throughout the 1940s, and then a downward trend from the 1950s until the end of the 1970s; there was no clear trend after 1980. The GMP over the ocean has had more uncertainty over the past three decades, and trends are inconsistent among different global rainfall datasets. In the twenty-first century, the GMP is expected to increase robustly, based on the projections by the state-of-the-art coupled models that participated in Phases 3 and 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP3 and CMIP5). The change in GMP under global warming is primarily due to changes to the hydrological cycle induced by warmer temperatures. The increase in water vapor contributes positively to moisture convergence and surface evaporation over the GMA, but is partly offset by the weakening of the monsoon circulation.","[Hsu, Pang-Chi] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Int Lab Climate & Environm Change, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Hsu, Pang-Chi] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Coll Atmospher Sci, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Hsu, Pang-Chi] Univ Hawaii, Int Pacific Res Ctr, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA",Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; University of Hawaii System,"Hsu, PC (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Int Lab Climate & Environm Change, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.;Hsu, PC (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Coll Atmospher Sci, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",pangchi@hawaii.edu,,,,,,,55,8,8,0,3,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2352-0698,2352-0701,978-3-319-21650-8; 978-3-319-21649-2,SPRINGER CLIMATE,,,2016,,,,,7,24,,10.1007/978-3-319-21650-8_2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-21650-8_2,10.1007/978-3-319-21650-8,,18,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Book Citation Index – Science (BKCI-S),Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,BL2FP,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000448914800003,View Full Record in Web of Science

These studies all suggest that a 300 to 600 ppm doubling of the atmosphere's CO2 concentration could raise the planet's mean surface air temperature by only about 0.4 degrees C. Even this modicum of warming may never be realized, however, for it could be negated by a number of planetary cooling forces that are intensified by warmer temperatures and by the strengthening of biological processes that are enhanced by the same rise in atmospheric CO2 concentration that drives the warming. Several of these cooling forces have individually been estimated to be of equivalent magnitude, but of opposite sign, to the typically predicted greenhouse effect of a doubling of the air's CO2 content, which suggests to me that little net temperature change will ultimately result from the ongoing buildup of CO2 in Earth's atmosphere. Consequently, I am skeptical of the predictions of significant CO2-induced global warming that are being made by state-of-the-art climate models and believe that much more work on a wide variety of research fronts will be required to properly resolve the issue.","US Water Conservat Lab, Phoenix, AZ 85040 USA",,"Idso, SB (corresponding author), US Water Conservat Lab, 4331 E Broadway, Phoenix, AZ 85040 USA.",sidso@uswcl.ars.ag.gov,,,,,,,211,23,23,10,54,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0936-577X,1616-1572,,CLIM RES,Clim.

The focus is on the extent to which correcting biases in atmospheric tendencies improves the model's climatology, variability, and ultimately forecast skill at subseasonal and seasonal time scales. Results are presented for the NASA GMAO GEOS model in both uncoupled (atmosphere only) and coupled (atmosphere-ocean) modes. For the uncoupled model, the focus is on correcting a stunted North Pacific jet and a dry bias over the central United States during boreal summerlong-standing errors that are indeed common to many current AGCMs. The results show that the tendency bias correction (TBC) eliminates the jet bias and substantially increases the precipitation over the Great Plains. These changes are accompanied by much improved (increased) storm-track activity throughout the northern midlatitudes. For the coupled model, the atmospheric TBCs produce substantial improvements in the simulated mean climate and its variability, including a much reduced SST warm bias, more realistic ENSO-related SST variability and teleconnections, and much improved subtropical jets and related submonthly transient wave activity. Despite these improvements, the improvement in subseasonal and seasonal forecast skill over North America is only modest at best. The reasons for this, which are presumably relevant to any forecast system, involve the competing influences of predictability loss with time and the time it takes for climate drift to first have a significant impact on forecast skill.","[Chang, Y.; Schubert, S.

The article draws on several creative projects as a springboard for environmental discourse. Notably, it discusses British artist Kate Pattison's work on glaciers, Eve Mosher's High Water Line project, and a work involving a local urban river system. Environmental communication transmitted through artmaking may speak to the problem of inaction in a way that employs soft persuasion and affective poetics.

The achievement of an affordable and sustainable equilibrium between available water resources and irrigation demand is essentially related to the planning and implementation of evidencebased adaptation strategies and actions. The present study proposed a state-of-the art conceptual framework and computational methodology to assess the potential water scarcity risk, due to changes in climate trends and variability, on irrigated croplands. The model has been tested over the irrigated agriculture of Puglia Region, a semi-arid territory with the largest agricultural production in Southern Italy. The methodology, based on the Regional Risk Assessment (RRA) approach, has been applied within a scenariobased hazard framework. Regional climate projections, under alternative greenhouse gas concentration scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) and for two different timeframes, 2021-2050 and 2041-2070 compared to the baseline 1976-2005 period, have been used to drive hydrological simulations of river inflow to the most important reservoirs serving irrigation purposes in Puglia. The novelty of the proposed RRA-based approach does not simply rely on the concept of risk as combination of hazard, exposure and vulnerability, but rather elaborates detailed (scientific and conceptual) framing and computational description of these factors, to produce risk spatial pattern maps and related statistics distinguishing the most critical areas (risk hot spots).. The application supported the identification of the most affected areas (i.e. Capitanata Reclamation Consortia under RCP8.5 2041-2070 scenario), crops (fruit trees and vineyards), and, finally, the vulnerability pattern of irrigation systems and networks. The implemented assessment singled out future perspectives of water scarcity risk levels for irrigated agriculture by the administrative extent where individual bodies are in charge of the coordination of public and private irrigation activities (i.e. Reclamation Consortia). Based on the outcomes of the proposed methodology, tailored and knowledgebased adaptation strategies and related actions can be developed, to reduce the risk at both agronomic level (i. e. preferring crops with low vulnerability score, as olive groves) and at structural level (i. e. differentiating the water stocks and supplies and reducing losses and inefficiencies).

The present paper provides a critical review of the current state-of-the-art methods for assessing the impacts of climate change on precipitation at the urban catchment scale. Downscaling of results from global circulation models or regional climate models to urban catchment scales are needed because these models are not able to describe accurately the rainfall process at suitable high temporal and spatial resolution for urban drainage studies. The downscaled rainfall results are however highly uncertain, depending on the models and downscaling methods considered. This uncertainty becomes more challenging for rainfall extremes since the properties of these extremes do not automatically reflect those of average precipitation. In this paper, following an overview of some recent advances in the development of innovative methods for assessing the impacts of climate change on urban rainfall extremes as well as on urban hydrology and hydraulics, several existing difficulties and remaining challenges in dealing with this assessment are discussed and further research needs are described.

Changes in environmental conditions such as the increase of the average temperature, or the UV-B radiation, are likely to influence the fate and behavior of POPs, ultimately affecting human exposure. The state of the art of the impact of climate change on environmental concentrations of POPs, as well as on human health risks, is here reviewed. Research gaps are also identified, while future studies are suggested. Climate change and POPs are a hot issue, for which wide attention should be paid not only by scientists, but also and mainly by policy makers. Most studies reported in the scientific literature are focused on legacy POPs, mainly polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and pesticides. However, the number of investigations aimed at estimating the impact of climate change on the environmental levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) is scarce, despite of the fact that exposure to PAHs and photo-degradation byproducts may result in adverse health effects. Furthermore, no data on emerging POPs are currently available in the scientific literature. In consequence, an intensification of studies to identify and mitigate the indirect effects of the climate change on POP fate is needed to minimize the human health impact. Furthermore, being this a global problem, interactions between climate change and POPs must be addressed from an international perspective. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Accurate estimates of future forest productivity are crucial to predict the carbon sequestration and wood provision potential of forests. Since long, forest managers have used empirical yield tables as a cost-effective and reliable way to predict forest growth. However, recent climate change-induced growth shifts raised doubts about the long-term validity of these yield tables. In this study, we propose a methodology to improve available yield tables of 11 tree species in the Netherlands and Flanders, Belgium. The methodology uses scaling functions derived from climate-sensitive process-based modelling (PBM) that reflect state-of-the-art projections of future growth trends. Combining PBM and stand information from the empirical yield tables for the region of Flanders, we found that for the period 1987-2016 stand productivity has on average increased by 13% compared to 1961-1990. Furthermore, simulations indicate that this positive growth trend is most likely to persist in the coming decades, for all considered species, climate or site conditions. Nonetheless, results showed that local site variability is equally important to consider as the in-or exclusion of the CO2 fertilization effect or different climate projections, when assessing the magnitude of forests' response to climate change.Our projections suggest that incorporating these climate change-related productivity changes lead to a 7% increase in standing stock and a 22% increase in sustainably potentially harvestable woody biomass by 2050.

The aim is to: (i) identify the state-of-the-art scientific approaches of adaptation of urban drainage networks to climate change; (ii) assess whether or not these approaches incorporated monetization of the adaptation practices and the assodated costs/benefits; and ( iii) define a novel approach (Blueprint) for the future development and assessment of urban drainage network adaptation to climate change and other drivers. First, the motivation is provided that makes urban drainage adaptation a globally relevant issue. Second, the main impacts of climate change on precipitation, flooding and urban drainage systems are discussed. Then, current practices are described. Finally, a blueprint for an integrated urban adaptation framework to climate change and other drivers is proposed. Our research indicated that future quantity and quality of urban runoff is not widely addressed in the scientific literature. The Storm Water Management Model is the most widely used software in modeling adaptation options. Solutions such as plans of maintenance and rehabilitation, public awareness, flood forecasting and warning, mobility measures and insurance measures are not widely reflected in the literature. Uncertainties of climate projections and bias correction methods are still significant, and uncertainties of socio-economic scenarios, hydrologic and hydrodynamic models, and adaptation options are not fully addressed. Finally, environmental cost and benefits associated with the ecosystem services provided by the adaptation options are not fully addressed. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we use a collection of millennial-length GCM simulations to examine the transient and equilibrium responses of the AMOC to an abrupt quadrupling of atmospheric carbon dioxide. We find that GCMs consistently simulate an AMOC weakening during the first century but exhibit diverse behaviors over longer time scales, showing different recovery levels. To explain the AMOC behavior, we use a thermal-wind expression, which links the overturning circulation to the meridional density difference between deep-water formation regions and the Atlantic basin. Using this expression, we attribute the evolution of the AMOC on different time scales to changes in temperature and salinity in distinct regions. The initial AMOC shoaling and weakening occurs on centennial time scales and is attributed to a warming of the deep-water formation region. A partial recovery of the AMOC occurs over the next few centuries, and is linked to a simultaneous warming of the Atlantic basin and a positive high-latitude salinity anomaly. The latter reduces the subsurface stratification and reinvigorates deep-water formation. GCMs that exhibit a prolonged AMOC weakening tend to have smaller high-latitude salinity anomalies and increased Arctic sea ice loss. After multiple millennia, the AMOC in some GCMs is stronger than the initial state due to warming of the low-latitude Atlantic. These results highlight the importance of considering high-latitude freshwater changes when examining the past and future evolution of the AMOC evolution on long time scales. Significance StatementThe long-term response of the ocean's global overturning circulation to warming remains poorly understood largely because it is expensive to run state-of-the-art climate models. This study makes use of a unique collection of millennial-length climate simulations from different climate models to examine the response of the Atlantic overturning circulation to warming on long time scales. We find that climate models consistently simulate a weakening of the Atlantic overturning circulation during the first century after warming, but disagree on long-term changes, showing different recovery levels of the Atlantic overturning circulation. Using a simple expression, which emulates the evolution of the Atlantic overturning circulation in climate models, we show that climate models with little to no recovery tend to have a small North Atlantic salinity anomaly while climate models with a stronger recovery tend to have a large North Atlantic salinity anomaly. These results highlight the importance of monitoring high-latitude freshwater sources throughout the twenty-first century and considering the relative role of temperature and salinity changes when examining the future and past evolution of the Atlantic overturning circulation on long time scales.","[Bonan, David B.; Thompson, Andrew F.; Sun, Shantong] CALTECH, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Newsom, Emily R.] Univ Oxford, Oxford, England; [Rugenstein, Maria] Colorado State Univ, Ft Collins, CO USA",California Institute of Technology; University of Oxford; Colorado State University,"Bonan, DB (corresponding author), CALTECH, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",,,"Bonan, David/0000-0003-3867-6009; Sun, Shantong/0000-0002-6932-5589","American Meteorological Society (AMS) Graduate Fellowship; National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program (NSF) [DGE-1745301]; NSF [OCE-1756956, OCE-2023259]; NERC [NE/P019218/1]",American Meteorological Society (AMS) Graduate Fellowship; National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program (NSF); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"The research would not have been possible without the efforts of the contributors to the LongRunMIP project, which is freely available at http://www.longrunmip.org/.

The first geologic subject of the prehistoric that is discussed is the Birdman' of Lascaux as an originary figure in human origins. The second subjects are the Gwion Gwion figures that were painted with the living pigments' of bacteria and fungi that continue to reproduce over geologic time to produce an image of human identity. This foray into the Palaeolithic imagination is done for two reasons: firstly, to examine the conceptual and corporeal genealogy of geologic subjectivity through an inquiry into originary and symbolic images; secondly, to examine geomorphic aesthetics as a space of inquiry within the apprehension of the Anthropocene. Methodologically, this paper moves beyond the boundary-work of hybridity to argue for the consideration of a queer ecology where subjects emerge as a constellation between inhuman time, nonhuman forces, and geologic materialities. In the opening of subject positions to nonhuman and inhuman forces, as both interior and prior to the emergence of identity, this paper argues that subjectivity always contains both an anterior and interior nonhuman excess; a surplus to identity that opens to non-normative arrangements that queries origins to suggest a queer genealogy, rather than an exceptional model of human subjectivity. In abandoning the assumption of discrete, identity-making autopoetic subjects, I explore the possibilities for apprehending a nonlocal, inhuman dimension of subjectivity that is difficult to accommodate in a relational ontology. Ecologies of subjectivities are discussed through the rock images to argue that the human is both constituted and riven by the torques of nonlocal forces in both identity and etiology, and this needs to constitute a new ontology of in/human sociality. I conclude that aesthetics possess an untimely quality that allows a passage into the radically incommensurate time of the geologic and therefore provide a possible site and mode of sensibility for engaging with the temporal and material contractions of the Anthropocene.","Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Geog, London E1 4NS, England",University of London; Queen Mary University London,"Yusoff, K (corresponding author), Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Geog, Mile End Rd, London E1 4NS, England.",k.yusoff@qmul.ac.uk,,,,,,,68,64,64,0,32,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1474-4740,1477-0881,,CULT GEOGR,Cult.

While cultural sites are especially important to local and Indigenous communities, a stall in coordinated global action means adaptation at a local scale is often unsupported. In response, this paper produces a practical climate change risk analysis methodology designed for independent, community-scale management of cultural sites. It builds on existing methods that prioritise sites most at risk from climate impacts, proposing a field survey that integrates an assessment of the relative cultural value of sites with assessment of exposure and sensitivity to climate impacts. The field survey also stands as a monitoring program and complements an assessment of organisational adaptive capacity. The preliminary field survey was tested by Indigenous land managers in remote northern Australia at midden and rock art sites threatened by sea level rise, extreme flood events and a range of non-climactic hazards. A participatory action research methodology-incorporating planning workshops, semi-structured interviews and participant observations-gave rise to significant modifications to the preliminary field survey as well as management prioritisation of 120 sites. The field survey is anticipated to have global application, particularly among marginalised and remote Indigenous communities. Well-planned and informed participation, with community control, monitoring and well-informed actions, will contribute significantly to coordinated global and regional adaptation strategies.","[Carmichael, Bethune; Brockwell, Sally; Webb, Bob] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Carmichael, Bethune] Charles Darwin Univ, Alice Springs, NT, Australia; [Wilson, Greg; Namarnyilk, Ivan] Djelk Indigenous Protected Area, Maningrida, NT, Australia; [Nadji, Sean; Hunter, Fred] Kakadu Natl Pk, Jabiru, NT, Australia; [Bird, Deanne] Univ Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland",Australian National University; Charles Darwin University; University of Iceland,"Carmichael, B (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT, Australia.;Carmichael, B (corresponding author), Charles Darwin Univ, Alice Springs, NT, Australia.",bethune.carmichael@cdu.edu.au,"Bird, Deanne/G-7130-2015","Bird, Deanne/0000-0001-8556-0987","Australian Research Council [LP110201128, DP120100512]; Australian National University; Charles Darwin University",Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Australian National University(Australian National University); Charles Darwin University,"The authors would like to thank the following for their generous assistance: Djelk and KNP Traditional Owners including rangers Patricia Gibson, Darryl Redford, Obed Namirrik, Alfie Galaminda, Bobbie-Sheena Wilson, Felina Campion, Simon Dempsey, Jackie Cahill, Jonathan Nadji, Natasha Nadji, Jeffrey Lee, Bobby Maranlgurra and Kadeem May; KNP cultural heritage manager Gabrielle O'Loughlin; Djelk support staff Dominic Nicholls, Alys Stevens, Anthony Staniland and Ricky Archer; and for the critical feedback, Apolline Kohen, Colin Pardoe, Rolf Gerritsen and Jack Fenner.

It also remains crucial in building sustainable adaptive capacities, particularly in cities of the global north. It however remains largely unknown in urban Africa about planning agencies' perspectives on climate change adaptation-urban planning conundrum, and corresponding policy responses. This paper thus examines urban planners' perspectives and planning responses on managing climate change impacts and building adaptive capacities in Accra, Ghana. Using a review of four relevant urban planning and climate change policies, and interviews with five urban planning agencies in Accra, findings indicate that urban planning regimes are less efficient, more reactionary, and unsustainable in building resilience and adaptive capacities to climate change impacts. The findings show evidence of weak institutional and stakeholder coordination, inadequate funds and institutional logistics and human capacity, which have contributed to the inability to manage 'normal' climate change impacts such as floods and build resilience to them. The paper concludes with suggestions for building resilience to climate change impacts and incorporating adaptation concerns into urban planning efforts in Ghana.","[Asibey, Michael Osei; Adutwum, Isaac Osei; Tagnan, Jacob Nchagmado] KNUST, Coll Art & Built Environm, Fac Built Environm, Dept Planning, Kumasi, Ghana; [Mintah, Frank] Univ Bern, Inst Geog, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Wireko-Gyebi, Rejoice Selorm] Univ Energy & Nat Resources, Dept Planning & Sustainabil, Sunyani, Ghana; [Yevugah, Lily Lisa] Univ Energy & Nat Resources, Dept Geosci, Sunyani, Ghana; [Agyeman, Kwasi Osei] Christian Serv Univ Coll, Dept Planning & Dev, Kumasi, Ghana; [Abdul-Salam, Abdulai Jahanfo] Ohio Univ, Dept Geog, Athens, OH USA",Kwame Nkrumah University Science & Technology; University of Bern; University System of Ohio; Ohio University,"Asibey, MO (corresponding author), KNUST, Coll Art & Built Environm, Fac Built Environm, Dept Planning, Kumasi, Ghana.",asibeymichael@yahoo.com; lily.yevugah@uenr.edu.gh; koseiagyeman@csuc.edu.gh; aa512821@ohio.edu,"Asibey, Michael Osei/P-2396-2016","Asibey, Michael Osei/0000-0002-5534-2695",,,,,60,0,0,10,10,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0264-2751,1873-6084,,CITIES,Cities,DEC,2022,,,,,,,103950,10.1016/j.cities.2022.103950,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cities.2022.103950,,,12,Urban Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Urban Studies,4U2NR,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000858637500007,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, vulnerable communities do not fully benefit from existing technology, whereas they are disproportionally impacted by climate change. This chapter assesses how technology can shape limits to adaptation and how to report on this injustice as part of key global agreements. We develop an access, use and innovation of technology framework. As a case on a relevant technology, we test it on transboundary early warning systems in South Asia. We find that only a limited set of the state-of-the-art technologies available globally is accessed and used. Insufficient capacity and funding result in the bare minimum, largely copycat type of technology. As climate change progresses, demands on technology increase, whereas, if no action is taken, the technology remains the same widening the adaptation deficit. A better understanding of the crossover from disaster risk reduction to climate adaptation and the emerging policy domain of loss and damage allows trade-offs in terms of reducing risks through greater investment in technologies for adaptation versus absorbing risks and then financing curative or transformative loss and damage measures. We argue that attention to especially distributive, compensatory and procedural climate justice principles, in terms of distributing technology, building capacity and providing finance, can help to motivate support for widening the technology spectrum available to developing countries. We propose as part of comprehensive risk management that, first, an inventory should be developed how of technologies shape soft and hard adaptation limits. Second, technology for climate justice might be included in the adaptation communications to support reporting on the expected and experienced impact of measures on loss and damage, at a sufficiently disaggregated level. Third, soft adaptation limits should be levelled by making technology research, innovation and design equitable between those countries having capacity and those not, recognising the commitment to leave no one behind.","[van den Homberg, Marc; McQuistan, Colin] Pract Act, Rugby, England",,"van den Homberg, M (corresponding author), Pract Act, Rugby, England.",marcjchr@gmail.com; colin.mcquistan@practicalaction.org.uk,"van den Homberg, Marc/AGY-9332-2022","van den Homberg, Marc/0000-0003-1436-254X",Zurich Flood Resilience Alliance,Zurich Flood Resilience Alliance,"The Zurich Flood Resilience Alliance supported this work.

The Korean government also established the 2030 Greenhouse Gas Reduction Roadmap in 2016 and included carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) technology in the new energy industry sector as a CCU technology. The Korean government recognizes the importance of CCUS technology as a mid- to long-term measure to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and implements policies related to technological development. The United States (U.S.), Germany, and China also expect CCUS technology to play a major role in reducing greenhouse gases in the industrial sector in terms of climate and energy policy. This study analyzed the CCU-related policies and technological trends in the U.S., Germany, and China, including major climate and energy plans, driving roadmaps, some government-led projects, and institutional support systems. This work also statistically analyzed 447 CCU and CCUS projects in Korea between 2010 and 2017.

Analyses of rock art content and engraving stratigraphy indicate that the iconic Jubbah style had a long tradition among pre-pastoral hunters and continued to be used by early herders. We also identify a distinct body of rock art that pre-dates the Jubbah style and may be associated with a nearby Epipalaeolithic site. Our systematic dataset identifies a body of Bronze Age rock art that is further supported by the material culture and radiocarbon dates obtained from the remains of disturbed cairns. The rock art in Jubbah appears to have been created throughout the Holocene occupation of the oasis and similarities in the representation of animals, choice of location and content of rock art scenes are evident from the Bronze Age to the early modern period, and perhaps into the twentieth century. Moreover, rock art and epigraphy suggest that occupation phases in Jubbah were sustained long enough for the repeated development of unique local characteristics throughout the Holocene.","[Guagnin, Maria; Petraglia, Michael] Max Planck Inst Sci Human Hist, Dept Archaeol, Jena, Germany; [Shipton, Ceri] Univ Cambridge, McDonald Inst Archaeol Res, Cambridge, England; [al-Rashid, Moudhy] Univ Oxford, Wolfson Coll, Oxford, England; [Moussa, Fares] Univ Edinburgh, Archaeol, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [El-Dossary, Sarah; Bin Sleimah, Mona; Alsharekh, Abdullah] King Saud Univ, Dept Archaeol, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; [Guagnin, Maria] Univ Oxford, Res Lab Archaeol & Hist Art, Oxford, England; [Shipton, Ceri] British Inst Eastern Africa, Nairobi, Kenya",University of Cambridge; University of Oxford; University of Edinburgh; King Saud University; University of Oxford,"Guagnin, M (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Sci Human Hist, Dept Archaeol, Jena, Germany.;Guagnin, M (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Res Lab Archaeol & Hist Art, Oxford, England.",guagnin@shh.mpg.de,"Alsharekh, Abdullah M/AAH-3718-2019; Petraglia, Michael/ABA-9748-2021","Petraglia, Michael/0000-0003-2522-5727; Guagnin, Maria/0000-0002-7995-8611",European Research Council [295719],European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)European Commission),"European Research Council, Grant/Award Number: 295719",,50,24,24,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0905-7196,1600-0471,,ARAB ARCHAEOL EPIGR,Arab.

Dust can modify the Earth's energy budget, provide long-range transport of nutrients, and influence land surface processes via erosion. Consequently, effective modeling of the climate system, particularly at regional scales, requires a reasonably accurate representation of dust emission, transport, and deposition. Here we evaluate African dust in 23 state-of-the-art global climate models used in the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. We find that all models fail to reproduce basic aspects of dust emission and transport over the second half of the twentieth century. The models systematically underestimate dust emission, transport, and optical depth, and year-to-year changes in these properties bear little resemblance to observations. These findings cast doubt on the ability of these models to simulate the regional climate and the response of African dust to future climate change.","[Evan, Amato T.; Doherty, Owen] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Evan, Amato T.; Flamant, Cyrille] CNRS, Lab Atmospheres, Observat Spatiales, Paris, France; [Evan, Amato T.; Flamant, Cyrille] Univ Paris 06, Paris, France; [Fiedler, Stephanie] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England",University of California System; University of California San Diego; Scripps Institution of Oceanography; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Cite; UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; University of Leeds,"Evan, AT (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",aevan@ucsd.edu,"Evan, Amato/GZL-2684-2022","Evan, Amato/0000-0003-2812-3750; Fiedler, Stephanie/0000-0001-8898-9949",French Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) of the national Programme Investissements d'Avenir [ANR-10-LABX-18-01]; Laboratoire d'excellence Institute Pierre Simon Laplace (L-IPSL); Research in Paris program; National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration Climate Program Office [NA11OAR4310157],French Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) of the national Programme Investissements d'Avenir(French National Research Agency (ANR)); Laboratoire d'excellence Institute Pierre Simon Laplace (L-IPSL); Research in Paris program; National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration Climate Program Office,"We acknowledge Ian Eisenman, Kerstin Schepanski, and two anonymous reviewers for comments on the methodologies and the satellite emission map used in this study.

Global climate change coupled with human activities is eroding the mountain regions of the world at an alarming rate. The various types of erosion can be classified as water erosion, aeolian erosion, glaciered erosion, gravity erosion and man-made erosion. Tectonic activity also plays a major role towards mountain erosion. Soil erosion along with debris flow and rock falling not only causes loss of human life and property, but also affects the climatic condition of the mountain regions. Mountain erosion mitigation and protection methods include wire mesh fencing with inclusion of brush layers and brush mats on fascines, constructing check dams and slope benches and application of bioengineering works such as plantation and vegetation growth. This study consists of the global scenario with some of the state-of-the-art methods for mitigation and mappings of mountain erosion. The erosion in mountainous regions can be controlled with the help of suitable vegetation and plant growth, with installation of special bioengineered materials. However, public awareness is also considered as an important factor. Moreover, it is found that mapping the rate of erosion greatly helps to make proper action plan against the erosion process.","VSS Univ Technol, Burla 768018, Sambalpur, India",Veer Surendra Sai University of Technology,"Patel, A (corresponding author), VSS Univ Technol, Burla 768018, Sambalpur, India.",anjanp14@gmail.com,"Patel, Anjan/O-4749-2015","Patel, Anjan/0000-0003-2645-613X",,,,,39,7,7,3,31,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1866-6280,,,ENVIRON EARTH SCI,Environ.

Whether the Indian Ocean plays an active role or simply responds passively to the wind and heat flux variability generated elsewhere remains somewhat of an open question. Here we attempt a fairly comprehensive review of the literature relating to the Indian Ocean variability at all time-scales and to the current understanding of the role of this tropical ocean in the coupled climate system. Despite an investigative history of more than a century, it is fair to say that the role of the Indian Ocean in regional monsoon variability, the most important climate process in this sector, remains to be fully understood and remains an active area of diagnostic and modeling research. This translates into limited success of the state-of-the-art monsoon forecast systems, statistical. and dynamical. Much attention in the last few years has be en focused on the east-west mode of variability, referred to as the dipole or the zonal mode. While there is incontrovertible evidence that the Indian Ocean plays an active role in some of these dipole/zonal mode events, the self-sustainability of this mode and its impact on regional and global climate is still a matter of debate. The most significant impediment to improving the predictive understanding of the region is the fact that at all time-scales sea surface temperature variability of the Indian Ocean is most often in the range of observational errors. The need for coordinated and sustained observations and diagnostic studies along with continued investigations using a hierarchy of models has been well-recognized, because monsoons form an integral part of the global climate system and the ENSO cycles. It is thus hoped that the role of the Indian Ocean in the coupled climate system will be much better quantified in the coming years, leading to significant improvements in regional coupled climate forecasts.","Univ Hawaii, SOEST, IPRC, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA",University of Hawaii System,"Annamalai, H (corresponding author), Univ Hawaii, SOEST, IPRC, 1680 East West Rd,POST Bldg 401, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",hanna@hawaii.edu; ragu@essic.umd.edu,", Nobody/M-9571-2019",,,,,,246,76,80,0,14,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",0065-8448,,0-87590-412-2,GEOPHYS MONOGR SER,,,2004,,,,,213,246,,,,,,34,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences; Oceanography,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences; Oceanography,BBJ25,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000225756500013,View Full Record in Web of Science

Since metropolitan planning strategies have been considered as important mechanisms for achieving urban sustainability in this period, this research has sought to investigate the importance of these master plans in the delivery of urban responses to climate change. For this purpose, the study has employed a qualitative research methodology with the application of a comparative case study and the progression of a conceptual framework for evaluating climate policies in metropolitan plans of two selected citiesLondon and Melbourne. The study's results suggest that both the London Plan' and Plan Melbourne' incorporate critical elements to enhance climate governance, including the promotion of coordination principles, innovative technologies, a participatory planning approach and a long-term planning scale. However, the review identified a consistent omission of key principles as identified through the proposed matrix for analysing the climate policies of a city's government, which include risk assessment tools, monitoring systems, distribution, impact frame and accountability. Moreover, the research also revealed the lack of vertical integration in policy formulation and implementation of Plan Melbourne'. Our study suggests that a city's governance structure influences the way it undertakes its climate actions and the potential efficacy of these on a metropolitan scale.","[Thi Minh Phuong Nguyen] Univ South Australia, Sch Art Architecture & Design, Discipline Urban & Reg Planning, Level 3,Kaurna Bldg,City West Campus,GPO Box 2471, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia; [Davidson, Kathryn] Univ Melbourne, Fac Architecture Bldg & Design, Parkville Campus, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Gleeson, Brendan] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Sustainable Soc Inst, Melbourne Sch Design, Level 3,Bldg 133,Masson Rd,Parkville Campus, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia",University of South Australia; University of Melbourne; University of Melbourne,"Nguyen, TMP (corresponding author), Univ South Australia, Sch Art Architecture & Design, Discipline Urban & Reg Planning, Level 3,Kaurna Bldg,City West Campus,GPO Box 2471, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia.",thi_minh_phuong.nguyen@mymail.unisa.edu.au; davidson.k@unimelb.edu.au; brendan.gleeson@unimelb.edu.au,,"Gleeson, Brendan/0000-0001-7264-7397; Nguyen, Thi Minh Phuong/0000-0003-3590-8695",,,,,81,8,8,2,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0309-1317,1468-2427,,INT J URBAN REGIONAL,Int.

Long-term memory (LTM) with a fluctuation exponent (or Hurst exponent) close to 0.9 occurs mainly in high-latitude oceans, which are also characterized by high potential predictability. Next, explicit prediction experiments for various time steps are conducted on a gridpoint basis using an autocorrelation predictor. In regions with LTM, prediction skills are beyond that expected from red noise persistence-exceptions occur in some areas in the southern oceans and over the Northern Hemisphere continents.

Changes in regional climate, due to urbanization and global greenhouse gas concentrations, may affect the ecology of mosquitoes and mosquito-transmitted pathogens. The effects of changes in climate on mosquito population dynamics are complex but critical and urgent for implementing more effective public health policies. This study quantified the impact of urbanization and global climate change on the population of the mosquito species, Culex quinquefasciatus, in the Pearl River Delta region in southern China-an area that has undergone substantial urbanization and is expected to experience changes in climate. This study employed a mechanistic model to simulate mosquito population dynamics under various greenhouse gas emission and land-cover change scenarios based on climate data provided by a state-of-the-art regional climate model. Our results show a 12.6% decrease in the annual mosquito population in newly urbanized areas and a 5.9% increase in the annual mosquito population in existing urban areas. Furthermore, changing climate conditions are projected to cause a 15-17% reduction in the total annual mosquito population; however, the change will not be uniform throughout the year. Peak months exhibit a reduction in population, whereas non-peak months show a significant increase. These findings suggest mosquito control strategies may need to be adjusted to respond to the impacts of urbanization and climate change on mosquito population dynamics to maximize effectiveness. Region specific, quantitative analyses of environmental impacts on mosquito-borne disease ecology, like this study, are needed to provide policy makers with a scientific reference to guide the formation of effective transmission intervention strategies.","[Wang, Yongli; Yim, Steve Hung Lam; Yang, Yuanjian] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Inst Environm Energy & Sustainabil, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Yim, Steve Hung Lam] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Geog & Resource Management, Shatin, N.t., Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Yim, Steve Hung Lam] Chinese Univ Hong Kon, Stanley Ho Big Data Decis Analyt Res Ctr, Shatin, N.t., Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Morin, Cory W.] Univ Washington, Dept Global Hlth, Seattle, WA USA",Chinese University of Hong Kong; Chinese University of Hong Kong; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Yim, SHL (corresponding author), Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Inst Environm Energy & Sustainabil, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.;Yim, SHL (corresponding author), Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Geog & Resource Management, Shatin, N.t., Hong Kong, Peoples R China.;Yim, SHL (corresponding author), Chinese Univ Hong Kon, Stanley Ho Big Data Decis Analyt Res Ctr, Shatin, N.t., Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",steveyim@cuhk.edu.hk,"yang, yang/HGT-7999-2022; yang, yang/GWB-9426-2022",,Vice-Chancellor&apos;s Discretionary Fund of The Chinese University of Hong Kong [4930744] Funding Source: Medline,Vice-Chancellor&apos;s Discretionary Fund of The Chinese University of Hong Kong,,,59,11,12,5,35,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0020-7128,1432-1254,,INT J BIOMETEOROL,Int.

Formal processes to decision-making under uncertainty weigh the ability of a decision rule to achieve multiple and sometimes conflicting objectives in an evaluation procedure. Increasingly, computer simulation models are being applied for this reason, so that the effectiveness of decisions can be evaluated before actually implementing them in reality. In this paper, we develop a simple stochastic simulation model of beach recession under climate change in Australia and evaluate decision rules for beach replenishment in the context of three management objectives: (i) to reduce beach recession, (ii) reduce variation in beach recession, and (iii) do so cost-effectively. Results indicate that a decision to intervene and replenish the beach based on a trigger level would be effective at maintaining shoreline position, with relatively little variation, but did so at a relatively high cost of multiple interventions. A decision procedure to intervene at a fixed period resulted in greater shoreline position variation but constrained management efforts and costs. This structured approach offers an evidence-based process to decision-making that lays bare the assumptions upon which decisions are made. This, in turn, allows for a more complete analysis of all the uncertainties and better outcomes.","[Little, L.

The main objective of this study was to analyse whether certain characteristics of tourism accommodation. Several factors have been analysed such as types of accommodation, type of guests, orientation on wellness and SPA, accommodation locations in the coastal or continental regions, the seasonality of the business, as well as the possession of a clearly defined environmental policy determine the beliefs and attitudes of managers on climate change issues and the impact of climate change and tourist accommodation. The survey was focused on 1,084 facilities, representing the total population of all facilities categorized by type as hotels and apart-hotels, tourist resorts and tourist apartments, as well as camps and marinas in the Republic of Croatia. Consequently, the beliefs and attitudes of managers in tourist accommodation are the result of various characteristics of those facilities. Stronger pro-ecological attitudes and higher levels of ecological awareness about climate change and the connection between climate change and tourist accommodation are shown by managers working in: tourist accommodation facilities of a higher category, tourist accommodation facilities located in coastal regions; tourist accommodation facilities that work all year round; tourist accommodation facilities that have a strong orientation towards the spa/wellness amenities; tourist accommodation facilities that have a clearly defined quality control policy and environmental protection; as well as tourist accommodation facilities aimed at organized groups and family holidaymakers.","[Racz, Aleksandar] Univ Appl Hlth Sci, Mlinarska 38, Zagreb, Croatia; [Jurdana, Dora Smolcic] Univ Rijeka, Fac Tourism & Hosp Management, Primorska 41, Opatij, Ika, Croatia; [Grzinic, Jasmina] Fac Econ & Tourism Dr Mijo Mirkov, Preradov 1-1, Pula, Croatia",University of Rijeka,"Racz, A (corresponding author), Univ Appl Hlth Sci, Mlinarska 38, Zagreb, Croatia.",aleksandar.racz@zvu.hr; doras@fmtu.hr; jloncar@unipu.hr,,,,,,,30,0,0,1,3,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2020,,,,,1286,1299,,,,,,14,"Business; Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BS5EP,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000728402200094,View Full Record in Web of Science

Wind-waves and swell climatology have shown an increasing trend over this region, having direct implications on the coastal zone dynamics surrounding the mainland and island features. The present study aims to investigate the wave-current-surge interaction characteristics over a shallow continental shelf region between India and Sri Lanka using the state-of-art coupled ADCIRC-SWAN model. In particular, a case study performed during tropical cyclone Madi (2013) demonstrates the extreme wave-current-surge interaction mechanism over varying nearshore bathymetric features. Study investigated the wave reflection and transmission characteristics in both the absence and presence of the proposed navigation channel (known as Sethusamudram project) in a coastal vulnerability context. Construction of the channel may result in westward shift of hazardous coastal water zones attributed to storm tides. The navigation channel expects to enhance both extreme waves and storm surge by 1% and 4%, respectively. Synthetic experiments, considering an increase in sea level rise by 0.4 m expected by 2050, indicate that wave activity can increase by 3% with marginal variations in storm tide. Simulations performed with a 7% rise in tropical cyclone intensity reveals a substantial increase in storm surge (10%) and significant wave (20%) heights along the coastal belt.

The fingerprints of these drivers in ET change, however, have not previously been detected due to the lack of these three scenarios from global climate models (GCMs). Here we applied an optimal fingerprint method to detect and attribute ET change by integrated utilization of state-of-the-art global ecosystem models and GCMs. Results indicate that CLI provides the greatest contribution to increasing ET, and its fingerprint is detectable at different timescales. CO2 reduces ET in most areas covered by forests. LUC decreases ET over the tropics, while increases ET over temperate and high-latitude regions. To further subdivide the impacts of CLI, we extend the Budyko framework to quantify the contribution of precipitation (P) and potential evapotranspiration (PET) and find that the dominant role of CLI mainly depends on the contribution of P.","[Liu, Jianyu; You, Yuanyuan; Feng, Xingyu] China Univ Geosci, Sch Geog & Informat Engn, Lab Crit Zone Evolut, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China; [Liu, Jianyu] State Key Lab Water Resources & Hydropower Engn S, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China; [Li, Jianfeng] Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Dept Geog, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Sitch, Stephen] Univ Exeter, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Exeter EX4 4RJ, Devon, England; [Gu, Xihui; Kong, Dongdong] China Univ Geosci, Sch Environm Studies, Dept Atmospher Sci, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China; [Nabel, Julia E.

The shoreline behavior near such inlets is generally studied with the help of a suitable numerical model. Such models are run on the basis of historical data of waves and other information. However, the waves in future may show different strength and pattern than the past as a result of the climate change induced by global warming. It is thus necessary that the model input should correspond to future or projected data of wind and waves. In this work, we have used the wind information from a state-of-the-art regional climate model, CORDEX RegCM-4, of future 25 years in order to run a shoreline evolution model and have derived the longshore sediment transport rate as well as the shoreline change rate around Chilika inlets. These future values are compared with corresponding ones of the past 25 years. It is found that at the given location, mean wind might go up by 20%, and this could raise the mean significant wave height strongly by 32%. The direction and frequency of occurrence of waves would also change, and this in turn will cause an increase in the net littoral drift by 41% and net accumulated drift over the entire cross-shore width by 84%. Interestingly, the present site where accretion was prevalent in the past may see erosion in future at the rate of about 1 m per year.","[Gopikrishna, B.] Cent Water & Power Res Stn, Pune, Maharashtra, India; [Deo, M.

These locations provided a wide range of environments for testing and validation of the crop growth (CROPGRO) model considered in this study with observed changes in soils, rainfall and other weather parameters. Model predicted satisfactorily the trends of days to flowering, maturity and grain yields. The deviations of simulated results were within +/-15% of the measurements. Validated CROPGRO model has been used to simulate the impact of climate change on soybean production in India. The projected scenarios for the Indian subcontinent as inferred from three state-of-the-art global climate models (GCMs) have been used in the present study. There was a decrease (ranging between about 10 and 20%) in soybean yield in all the three future scenarios when the effect of rise in surface air temperature at the time of the doubling of CO2 concentration was considered. The results obtained on the mitigatory option for reducing the negative impacts of temperature increases indicate that delaying the sowing dates would be favorable for increased soybean yields at all the locations in India. Sowing in the second season would also be able to mitigate the detrimental effects of future increases in surface temperature due to global warming at some locations. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Essential findings, derived from validating procedures are summarized and changes in variables between the control and perturbed experiments are examined. The resulting findings have been used in selecting the most proper methods of generating climate change projections for assessing possible hydrological and agricultural impacts of climate change in selected exposure units. The following weather variables have been studied: Daily extreme temperatures, daily mean temperature, daily sum of global solar radiation, and daily precipitation amounts. Due to some discrepancies revealed, the temperature series for changed climate conditions (2xCO(2)) have bee created with the help of temperature differences between the control and perturbed runs, and the precipitation series have been derived from an incremental scenario based on an intercomparison of the GCMs' precipitation performance in the region. Solar radiation simulated by the ECHAM was not available and, therefore, it was generated using regression techniques relating monthly means of daily extreme temperatures and global radiation sums. The scenarios published in the paper consist of monthly means of all temperatures, their standard deviations, and monthly means of solar radiation and precipitation amounts Daily weather series, the necessary input to impact models, are created (i) by the additive or multiplicative modification of observed weather daily series or (ii) by generating synthetic time series with the help of a weather generator whose parameters have been modified in accord with the suggested climate change scenarios.","Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Atmospher Phys, Prague, Czech Republic; Charles Univ Prague, Fac Math & Phys, KMOP, Prague, Czech Republic",Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Charles University Prague,"Nemesova, I (corresponding author), Bocni 2-1401, Prague 14131 4, Czech Republic.",ivanan@ufa.cas.cz,"Dubrovsky, Martin/G-4526-2014",,,,,,33,7,7,0,4,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0039-3169,1573-1626,,STUD GEOPHYS GEOD,Stud.

The inclusion of martial arts and combat sports (MA&CS) in formal physical education (PE) has been suggested by many authors, although there is no strong evidence as yet of the benefits of its practice for students. This study aimed to describe the effects of the development of two MA&CS teaching units (judo and capoeira) on the motivational climate, enjoyment and attitudes toward violence of PE students, and to compare these effects with those experienced by students receiving team sports teaching units (football and basketball). Methodology. A quasi-experimental, pre-post (two groups), longitudinal study design was followed, involving 221 students aged between 13 and 16. The experimental group (n = 105) developed MA&CS teaching units, while the control group (n = 116) developed team sport, teaching units. A peer motivational climate questionnaire, the amusement/boredom in physical education scale and the attitudes toward violence scale psychological assessment tools were used. Statistical analyses included means and standard deviations, two-way equivalent multifactorial ANOVA and effect sizes Results: MA&CS teaching units significantly improved the classroom motivational climate involving tasks/learning, and students' attitudes toward unjustified violence. The post-test inter-group comparison showed that the experimental group rejected unjustified violence to a higher degree than the control group (p=.014, d=.81).

In this climate, the problems of relief for socially disadvantaged persons and social participation and inclusion have assumed a renewed and enhanced urgency and in this article, I would like to consider a method of resolving the issues of social exclusion based not on a shift in economic assistance or the welfare system, but on the present state of cultural policy. Lying at the root of that idea is Creative City Theory, which calls for the regeneration of urban areas through creative cultural activities (industries), but the specific aim of this article is to deepen practical research on the intersecting fields of creative culture and social inclusion. While carefully investigating cultural policies pursued in the city of Osaka during the 10-year period between 1999 and 2008, I will elucidate the limits of the old style of urban cultural governance pursued there by detailing the process whereby independent, socially inclusive arts activities developed in Osaka, beginning first by looking at the failures of contemporary arts-focused cultural policies (stage one) and then focusing on the independent efforts of urban citizens to confront and overcome those setbacks (stage two). Then, in light of this new trend, I will suggest a desirable form in which this collaboration between local government and urban citizen can be carried out in the future. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

However, noncritical use of historical datasets can create pitfalls, resulting in misleading findings that may become entrenched as accepted knowledge. We demonstrate pitfalls in the content, use and interpretation of historical datasets in research into climate and society interaction through a systematic review of recent studies on the link between climate and (a) conflict incidence, (b) plague outbreaks and (c) agricultural productivity changes. We propose three sets of interventions to overcome these pitfalls, which involve a more critical and multidisciplinary collection and construction of historical datasets, increased specificity and transparency about uncertainty or biases, and replacing inductive with deductive approaches to causality. This will improve the validity and robustness of interpretations on the long-term relationship between climate and society.

This study investigates the future water availability in the Langtang basin, Central Himalayas, Nepal under climate change scenarios using state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) techniques. The daily snow area for the region was derived from MODIS images. The outputs of climate models were used to project the temperature and precipitation until 2100. Three ML models, including Gated recurrent unit (GRU), Long short-term memory (LSTM), and Recurrent neural network (RNN), were developed for snowmelt runoff prediction, and their performance was compared based on statistical indicators. The result suggests that the mean temperature of the basin could rise by 4.98 degrees C by the end of the century. The annual average precipitation in the basin is likely to increase in the future, especially due to high monsoon rainfall, but winter precipitation could decline. The annual river discharge is projected to upsurge significantly due to increased precipitation and snowmelt, and no shift in hydrograph is expected in the future. Among three ML models, the LSTM model performed better than GRU and RNN models. In summary, this study depicts severe future climate change in the region and quantifies its effect on river discharge. Furthermore, the study demonstrates the suitability of the LSTM model in streamflow prediction in the data-scarce HKH region. The outcomes of this study will be useful for water resource managers and planners in developing strategies to harness the positive impacts and offset the negative effects of climate change in the basin.","[Thapa, Samit; Li, Haizhi; Fu, Donglei; Shi, Xiaofei; Yabo, Stephen; Lu, Lu; Qi, Hong] Harbin Inst Technol, State Key Lab Urban Water Resource & Environm, Harbin, Peoples R China; [Thapa, Samit; Li, Bo; Fu, Donglei; Shi, Xiaofei; Yabo, Stephen; Lu, Lu; Qi, Hong] Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Environm, Harbin, Peoples R China; [Li, Haizhi] Heilongjiang Prov Environm Monitoring Ctr Stn, Harbin, Peoples R China; [Shi, Xiaofei] CASIC Intelligence Ind Dev Co Ltd, Beijing 100854, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Wei] Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Harbin, Peoples R China",Harbin Institute of Technology; Harbin Institute of Technology; Harbin Institute of Technology,"Qi, H (corresponding author), Harbin Inst Technol, State Key Lab Urban Water Resource & Environm, Harbin, Peoples R China.;Zhang, W (corresponding author), Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Harbin, Peoples R China.",hongqi@hit.edu.cn; weizhang@hit.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [51979066]; State Key Laboratory of Urban Water Resource and Environment, Harbin Institute of Technology [2018TS01]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); State Key Laboratory of Urban Water Resource and Environment, Harbin Institute of Technology(Harbin Institute of Technology)","We express our thanks to the Department of hydrology and meteorology, Nepal for providing local hydrometeorological data and the Regional database system, ICIMOD for providing climate data for this work.

The best forecast is complicated to find and hence has not yet been explored in the CMs. Recent advances in deep learning methods have provided an exceptional ability to investigate intricate weather patterns from big climate data. In this article, a hybrid climate learning model (HCLM) is proposed that utilizes both the CM and the deep learning models for improving the rainfall forecast. More specifically, a probabilistic multilayer perceptron (PMLP) network evaluates multiple forecasts from the CM-generated forecasts and selects the best one. The selected forecast is next passed onto a hybrid deep long short-term memory (HD-LSTM) network, which looks back and learns the relationship of the selected forecast with corresponding rainfall and temperature observations to produce the next-day rainfall forecast. The experimental results from various climate zones in Australia show that the HCLM outperforms existing state-of-the-art climate and deep learning models.","[Madhukumar, Neethu; Wang, Eric] James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Cairns, Qld 4878, Australia; [Zhang, Yi-Fan] Univ Queensland, Queensland Alliance Agr & Food Innovat, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Xiang, Wei] La Trobe Univ, Sch Engn & Math Sci, Melbourne, Vic 3086, Australia",James Cook University; University of Queensland; La Trobe University,"Xiang, W (corresponding author), La Trobe Univ, Sch Engn & Math Sci, Melbourne, Vic 3086, Australia.",neethu.madhukumar@my.jcu.edu.au; eric.wang@jcu.edu.au; yifan.zhang@uq.edu.au; w.xiang@latrobe.edu.au,,"Xiang, Wei/0000-0002-0608-065X",Beijing Natural Science Foundation [L182032],Beijing Natural Science Foundation(Beijing Natural Science Foundation),This work was supported by the Beijing Natural Science Foundation under Grant L182032.,,29,1,1,8,47,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2327-4662,,,IEEE INTERNET THINGS,IEEE Internet Things J.,1-May,2021,9,,,,7270,7278,,10.1109/JIOT.2020.3040736,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2020.3040736,,,9,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,RQ9XY,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000642765500014,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, researchers know little about the climate change knowledge and experiences elementary students bring to the classroom. We aimed to engage and explore elementary students' ideas about how they see climate change in their everyday lives using a combination of science and arts-based pedagogies. Methods: We conducted a photovoice and transformative experience informed study with 22 fifth-graders. Data collected includes student generated photographs, student reflections, a post-survey targeting transformative experience, and transcripts of activities throughout the unit. We analysed the photographs, interviews, activities, and survey using qualitative and quantitative techniques. Results: Students' photographs represent a diverse range of local depictions and scientific explanations of climate change. In addition, we saw that photovoice helped students to construct hope about their futures in relation to the changing climate and fostered a transformative experience. Conclusions: We recommend expanding the use of photovoice as a teaching and research method to understand how students' think about the world, and what mechanisms motivate and support them in making meaningful connections between their in- and out-of-school experiences.","[Herrick, Imogen R.] Univ Southern Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA; [Lawson, Michael A.] Kansas State Univ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; [Matewos, Ananya M.] St Norbert Coll, De Pere, WI 54115 USA",University of Southern California; Kansas State University,"Herrick, IR (corresponding author), Univ Southern Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA.",iherrick@usc.edu,,"Lawson, Michael/0000-0003-0954-9799; Matewos, Ananya/0000-0003-0090-1864; Herrick, Imogen Rose/0000-0001-6202-6087",University of Southern California's Rossier School of Education Internal Research Funds,University of Southern California's Rossier School of Education Internal Research Funds,This work was supported by the University of Southern California's Rossier School of Education Internal Research Funds,,62,3,3,1,3,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2059-0776,2059-0784,,EDUC DEV PSYCHOL,Educ.

The intensity of the Lorenz energy cycle, the Carnot efficiency, the material entropy production, and the degree of irreversibility of the system change monotonically with the CO2 concentration. Moreover, these quantities feature an approximately linear behaviour with respect to the logarithm of the CO2 concentration in a relatively wide range. These generalized sensitivities suggest that the climate becomes less efficient, more irreversible, and features higher entropy production as it becomes warmer, with changes in the latent heat fluxes playing a predominant role.

I examine how the artworks and artists use symbolism, metaphor, and other aesthetic devices to convey messages about their lived experience of sea ice and climate change. Stories told by artists about their artworks emphasize the importance of adaptation and interconnectedness and embrace themes about transformation and renewal. The insights provided by the artists participating in this research are crucial in the context of bridging knowledge systems to enhance our understanding of and potential responses to environmental change. Connecting with the intangible aspects of knowledge systems, such as emotional response, values, and identity, is an ongoing challenge; yet, accounting for these aspects of knowledge is a critical component of salient and legitimate environmental governance.

This warming is affecting the ice/rock interface temperature, the primary driver of avalanching glacier instability on steep slopes. Prediction of future potential instability therefore requires appropriate modeling of the thermal evolution of these glaciers. Application of a state-of-the-art model to a glacier in the French Alps (Taconnaz) has provided the first evaluation of the temperature evolution of a cold hanging glacier through this century. Our observations and three-dimensional modeling of the glacier response (velocity, thickness, temperature, density, and water content) to climate change indicate that Taconnaz glacier will become temperate and potentially unstable over a large area by the end of the 21st century. The risk induced by this glacier hazard is high for the populated region below and makes observation and modeling of such glaciers a priority.","[Gilbert, A.; Vincent, C.; Gagliardini, O.; Krug, J.] CNRS, LGGE UMR5183, Grenoble, France; [Gilbert, A.; Vincent, C.; Gagliardini, O.; Krug, J.] Univ Grenoble Alpes, LGGE UMR5183, Grenoble, France; [Gilbert, A.] Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada; [Gagliardini, O.] Inst Univ France, Paris, France; [Berthier, E.] Univ Toulouse, CNRS, LEGOS, Toulouse, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Simon Fraser University; Institut Universitaire de France; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Laboratoire d'Etudes en Geophysique et oceanographie spatiales,"Gilbert, A (corresponding author), CNRS, LGGE UMR5183, Grenoble, France.",adrieng@sfu.ca,"Berthier, Etienne/B-8900-2009; Gilbert, Adrien/F-9354-2018; Gagliardini, Olivier/GQQ-1222-2022","Berthier, Etienne/0000-0001-5978-9155; Gilbert, Adrien/0000-0001-9009-5143; Gagliardini, Olivier/0000-0001-9162-3518; KRUG, Jean/0000-0002-1420-1343",ACQWA [212250]; GLARISKALP European program; GLACIOCLIM,ACQWA; GLARISKALP European program; GLACIOCLIM,This study was funded by the ACQWA (212250) and GLARISKALP European programs.

Statistical treatments of multi-model uncertainties are often limited to simple ESM averaging approaches. Sometimes models are weighted by how well they reproduce historical climate observations. Here, we propose a novel approach to multi-model combination and uncertainty quantification. Rather than averaging a discrete set of models, our approach samples from a continuous distribution over a reduced space of simple model parameters. We fit the free parameters of a reduced-order climate model to the output of each member of the multi-model ensemble. The reduced-order parameter estimates are then combined using a hierarchical Bayesian statistical model. The result is a multi-model distribution of reduced-model parameters, including climate sensitivity. In effect, the multi-model uncertainty problem within an ensemble of ESMs is converted to a parametric uncertainty problem within a reduced model. The multi-model distribution can then be updated with observational data, combining two independent lines of evidence. We apply this approach to 24 model simulations of global surface temperature and net top-of-atmosphere radiation response to abrupt quadrupling of carbon dioxide, and four historical temperature data sets. Our reduced order model is a 2-layer energy balance model. We present probability distributions of climate sensitivity based on (1) the multi-model ensemble alone and (2) the multi-model ensemble and observations.","[Jonko, Alexandra] Los Alamos Natl Lab, Earth & Environm Sci Div, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA; [Urban, Nathan M.; Nadiga, Balu] Los Alamos Natl Lab, Comp Computat & Stat Sci Div, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Los Alamos National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Los Alamos National Laboratory,"Jonko, A (corresponding author), Los Alamos Natl Lab, Earth & Environm Sci Div, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA.",ajonko@lanl.gov,"Jonko, Alex/ABB-2591-2021","Urban, Nathan/0000-0002-2264-3512; Jonko, Alexandra/0000-0001-6026-5527","U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Science (Biological and Environmental Research), Early Career Research program","U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Science (Biological and Environmental Research), Early Career Research program","This research was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Science (Biological and Environmental Research), Early Career Research program.

The potential extent of inundation caused by a 25-year return period flood in future climate patterns will increase by approximately 150% compared with those produced by the most severe flood in the present-day climate (1979-2003).

Neglecting this Langmuir mixing process may contribute to the common shallow bias in mixed layer depth in regions of the Southern Ocean and the Northern Atlantic in most state-of-the-art climate models. In this study, a third generation wave model, WAVEWATCH III, has been incorporated as a component of the Community Earth System Model, version 1.2 (CESM1.2). In particular, the wave model is now coupled with the ocean model through a modified version of the K-Profile Parameterization (KPP) to approximate the influence of Langmuir mixing. Unlike past studies, the wind-wave misalignment and the effects of Stokes drift penetration depth are considered through empirical scalings based on the rate of mixing in LES. Wave-Ocean only experiments show substantial improvements in the shallow biases of mixed layer depth in the Southern Ocean. Ventilation is enhanced and low concentration biases of pCFC-11 are reduced in the Southern Hemisphere. A majority of the improvements persist in the presence of other climate feedbacks in the fully coupled experiments. In addition, warming of the subsurface water over the majority of global ocean is observed in the fully coupled experiments with waves, and the cold subsurface ocean temperature biases are reduced.

Indeed, polar bear visuals now often mean nothing but climate change. Why do polar bear images, as a particular type of climate change imagery, continue to thrive and to circulate - and indeed, to haunt - our imaginings of climate change? This paper seeks to understand the tangled social, cultural, political, and scientific histories of polar bear visuals through defining a new concept, a 'visual metonym'. This concept is worked through using a longitudinal analysis of visual evidence arising from political, social, scientific, and cultural domains and using a hauntological approach that is sensitive to the spectre-like nature of polar bear imagery. This reveals three periods in which the work that polar bear visuals has undertaken has changed: polar bear (1990s-mid-2000s), political bear (mid-2000s), and climate bear (mid-2000s onwards). By the time of the 'climate bear' period, polar bear images had become entrenched and irreducible from (i.e., they haunt) climate change. As polar bear images came to stand in for much wider debates - of climate scepticism and political (in)action - they became a visual metonym. The paper concludes by presenting the visual metonym concept as a way to explore and understand how particular image types gain power, agency, and meaning and how they come to act as signalling devices representing complex engagements with contemporary issues. The visual metonym concept can be used to understand, interrogate, and critique naturalised and pervasive issue-led imagery.","[O'Neill, Saffron] Univ Exeter, Geog, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Amory Bldg,Rennes Dr, Exeter, Devon, England",University of Exeter,"O'Neill, S (corresponding author), Univ Exeter, Geog, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Amory Bldg,Rennes Dr, Exeter, Devon, England.",s.oneill@exeter.ac.uk,,"O'Neill, Saffron/0000-0002-9062-6247",Leverhulme Trust [RF-2021-599],Leverhulme Trust(Leverhulme Trust),Leverhulme Trust [Grant number: RF-2021-599].,,86,0,0,13,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0020-2754,1475-5661,,T I BRIT GEOGR,Trans.

The RCCI is a qualitative index that can synthesize a large number of climate model projections, and it is suitable for identifying those regions where climate change could be more pronounced in a warmer climate. The reliability and uncertainties of the results are evaluated by using numerous state-of-the-art general circulation models (GCMs) and forcing scenarios from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phases 3 and 5. The results show that southern Amazonia and the central-western region and western portion of Minas Gerais state in Brazil are persistent climate change hotspots through different forcing scenarios and GCM datasets. In general, as the scenarios vary from low- to high-level forcing, the area of high values of RCCI increase and the magnitude intensify from central-western and southeast Brazil to northwest South America. In general, the climatic hotspots identified in this study are characterized by an increase of mean surface air temperature, mainly in the austral winter; by an increase of interannual temperature variability, predominantly in the austral summer; and by a change in the mean and interannual variability of precipitation during the austral winter.","[Torres, Roger Rodrigues] Natl Inst Space Res CPTEC INPE, Ctr Weather Forecast & Climate Studies, BR-12630000 Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Torres, Roger Rodrigues] Fed Univ Itajuba IRN UNIFEI, Nat Resources Inst, BR-37500903 Itajuba, MG, Brazil; [Marengo, Jose Antonio] Natl Inst Space Res CCST INPE, Ctr Earth Syst Sci, BR-12630000 Sao Paulo, Brazil",,"Torres, RR (corresponding author), Fed Univ Itajuba IRN UNIFEI, Nat Resources Inst, Av BPS 1303, BR-37500903 Itajuba, MG, Brazil.",roger.torres@unifei.edu.br,"Torres, Roger Rodrigues/G-1043-2012","Torres, Roger Rodrigues/0000-0002-5684-3125",Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES); Brazil's Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq); Amazonia Security Agenda Project led by CIAT; GCP; Climate and Development Knowledge Network; projects Rede-CLIMA; National Institute of Science and Technology for Climate Change (INCT-CC); FAPESP-Assessment of Impacts and Vulnerability to Climate Change in Brazil; Strategies for Adaptation Options project [2008/581611],Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); Brazil's Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); Amazonia Security Agenda Project led by CIAT; GCP; Climate and Development Knowledge Network; projects Rede-CLIMA; National Institute of Science and Technology for Climate Change (INCT-CC); FAPESP-Assessment of Impacts and Vulnerability to Climate Change in Brazil; Strategies for Adaptation Options project,"We are thankful to two anonymous reviewers that provided suggestions that considerably improved the quality of the manuscript.

Community shifts in benthic fauna are likely to result from changes in key physicochemical drivers, such as ocean warming, but there is little ecological data on most Arctic species to support any specific predictions as to how vulnerable they are, or how future communities may be structured. We used a species distribution modeling approach (MaxEnt) to project changes over the 21st century in suitable habitat area for different species of benthic fauna by combining presence observations from the OBIS database with environmental data from a coupled climate-ocean model (SINMOD). Projected mean % habitat losses over taxonomic groups were small (0-11%), and no significant differences were found between Arctic, boreal, or Arcto-boreal groups, or between calcifying and non-calcifying groups. However, suitable habitat areas for 14 of 78 taxa were projected a change by over 20%, and several of these taxa are characteristic and/or habitat-forming fauna on some Arctic shelves, suggesting a potential for significant ecosystem impacts. These results highlight the weakness of general statements regarding vulnerability of taxa on biogeographic or presumed physiological grounds, and suggest that more basic biological data on Arctic taxa are needed for improved projections of ecosystem responses to climate change.","[Renaud, Paul E.] Akvaplan Niva, Tromso, Norway; [Renaud, Paul E.] Univ Ctr Svalbard, Dept Arctic Biol, Longyearbyen, Norway; [Wallhead, Phil; Bellerby, Richard G.

To respond to this need, in 2012 the European Space Agency (ESA) released the first multi-decadal, global satellite-observed soil moisture (SM) dataset as part of its Climate Change Initiative (CO) program. This product, named ESA CCI SM, combines various single-sensor active and passive microwave soil moisture products into three harmonised products: a merged ACTIVE, a merged PASSIVE, and a COMBINED active + passive microwave product. Compared to the first product release, the latest version of ESA CCI SM includes a large number of enhancements, incorporates various new satellite sensors, and extends its temporal coverage to the period 1978-2015. In this study, we first provide a comprehensive overview of the characteristics, evolution, and performance of the ESA CCI SM products. Based on original research and a review of existing literature we show that the product quality has steadily increased with each successive release and that the merged products generally outperform the single-sensor input products. Although ESA CCI SM generally agrees well with the spatial and temporal patterns estimated by land surface models and observed in-situ, we identify surface conditions (e.g., dense vegetation, organic soils) for which it still has large uncertainties. Second, capitalising on the results of >100 research studies that made use of the ESA CCI SM data we provide a synopsis of how it has contributed to improved process understanding in the following Earth system domains: climate variability and change, land-atmosphere interactions, global biogeochemical cycles and ecology, hydrological and land surface modelling, drought applications, and meteorology. While in some disciplines the use of ESA CCI SM is already widespread (e.g. in the evaluation of model soil moisture states) in others (e.g. in numerical weather prediction or flood forecasting) it is still in its infancy. The latter is partly related to current shortcomings of the product, e.g., the lack of near-real-time availability and data gaps in time and space. This study discloses the discrepancies between current ESA CCI SM product characteristics and the preferred characteristics of long-term satellite soil moisture products as outlined by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS), and provides important directions for future ESA CCI SM product improvements to bridge these gaps.

The objectives of the analysis are to determine whether climate models have sufficient spatial resolution to have an accurate representation of the storm tracks that affect precipitation. They investigate if there is a significant statistical difference in modeled precipitation between a medium-resolution (~112-km horizontal resolution) and a high-resolution (~25-km horizontal resolution) version of a state-of-the-art AGCM (EC-EARTH), if either model resolution gives a better representation of precipitation in the current climate, and what processes are responsible for the differences in modeled precipitation. The authors find that the high-resolution model gives a more accurate representation of northern and central European winter precipitation. The medium-resolution model has a larger positive bias in precipitation in most of the northern half of Europe. Storm tracks are better simulated in the high-resolution model, providing for a more accurate horizontal moisture transport and moisture convergence. Using a decomposition of the precipitation difference between the medium- and high-resolution model in a part related and a part unrelated to a difference in the distribution of vertical atmospheric velocity, the authors find that the smaller precipitation bias in central and northern Europe is largely unrelated to a difference in vertical velocity distribution. The smaller precipitation amount in these areas is in agreement with less moisture transport over this area in the high-resolution model. In areas with orography the change in vertical velocity distribution is found to be more important.","[van Haren, Ronald; Haarsma, Reindert J.; Van Oldenborgh, Geert Jan; Hazeleger, Wilco] Royal Netherlands Meteorol Inst, NL-3730 AE De Bilt, Netherlands; [van Haren, Ronald; Hazeleger, Wilco] Netherlands eSci Ctr, NL-1098 XG Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Hazeleger, Wilco] Wageningen Univ, Meteorol & Air Qual Sect, NL-6700 AP Wageningen, Netherlands",Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute; Wageningen University & Research,"van Haren, R (corresponding author), Netherlands eSci Ctr, Sci Pk 140, NL-1098 XG Amsterdam, Netherlands.",r.vanharen@esciencecenter.nl,"van Oldenborgh, Geert Jan/A-4176-2011","van Oldenborgh, Geert Jan/0000-0002-6898-9535; Haarsma, Rein/0000-0001-7171-2687; Hazeleger, Wilco/0000-0002-4566-958X",Dutch research program Knowledge for Climate,Dutch research program Knowledge for Climate,We thank the reviewers for their valuable comments which helped to considerably improve the quality of the paper.

Manhattan, Berlin and New Delhi all need to take action to adapt to climate change and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. While case studies on these cities provide valuable insights, comparability and scalability remain sidelined. It is therefore timely to review the state-of-the-art in data infrastructures, including earth observations, social media data, and how they could be better integrated to advance climate change science in cities and urban areas. We present three routes for expanding knowledge on global urban areas: main-streaming data collections, amplifying the use of big data and taking further advantage of computational methods to analyse qualitative data to gain new insights. These data-based approaches have the potential to upscale urban climate solutions and effect change at the global scale. Technical summary. Cities have an increasingly integral role in addressing climate change. To gain a common understanding of solutions, we require adequate and representative data of urban areas, including data on related greenhouse gas emissions, climate threats and of socio-economic contexts. Here, we review the current state of urban data science in the context of climate change, investigating the contribution of urban metabolism studies, remote sensing, big data approaches, urban economics, urban climate and weather studies. We outline three routes for upscaling urban data science for global climate solutions: 1) Mainstreaming and harmonizing data collection in cities worldwide; 2) Exploiting big data and machine learning to scale solutions while maintaining privacy; 3) Applying computational techniques and data science methods to analyse published qualitative information for the systematization and understanding of first-order climate effects and solutions. Collaborative efforts towards a joint data platform and integrated urban services would provide the quantitative foundations of the emerging global urban sustainability science.","[Creutzig, Felix; Lamb, William F.; Minx, Jan] Mercator Res Inst Global Commons & Climate Change, Berlin, Germany; [Creutzig, Felix; Lohrey, Steffen] Tech Univ Berlin, Sustainabil Econ Human Settlements, Berlin, Germany; [Bai, Xuemei] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Baklanov, Alexander] World Meteorol Org WMO, Geneva, Switzerland; [Dawson, Richard] Univ Newcastle, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England; [Dhakal, Shobhakar] Asian Inst Technol, Bangkok, Thailand; [McPhearson, Timon] New Sch, Urban Syst Lab, New York, NY USA; [McPhearson, Timon] Cary Inst Ecosyst Studies, Milbrook, NY USA; [McPhearson, Timon] Stockholm Resilience Ctr, Stockholm, Sweden; [Munoz, Esteban] UN Environm, Paris, France; [Walsh, Brenna] Future Earth, Montreal, PQ, Canada",Technical University of Berlin; Australian National University; Newcastle University - UK; Asian Institute of Technology; The New School; Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies; Stockholm University,"Creutzig, F (corresponding author), Mercator Res Inst Global Commons & Climate Change, Berlin, Germany.;Creutzig, F (corresponding author), Tech Univ Berlin, Sustainabil Econ Human Settlements, Berlin, Germany.",creutzig@mcc-berlin.net,"; Creutzig, Felix/B-8691-2016; Bai, Xuemei/A-5443-2012","Nieland, Simon/0000-0002-1116-0646; Creutzig, Felix/0000-0002-5710-3348; Baklanov, Alexander/0000-0002-5396-8440; Bai, Xuemei/0000-0001-6556-8041; Lamb, William F./0000-0003-3273-7878; Nagel, Kai/0000-0003-2775-6898; Minx, Jan Christoph/0000-0002-2862-0178; Lohrey, Steffen/0000-0001-7881-9102",Urban Resilience to Extreme Weather-Related Events Sustainability Research Network (URExSRN; NSF) [SES 1444755],Urban Resilience to Extreme Weather-Related Events Sustainability Research Network (URExSRN; NSF),"Material for this paper was prepared for, and presented at a special session of, the IPCC Cities and Climate Change Conference, 5-7th March 2018.

He helped organize several exhibitions of Mexican art in the United States. In addition, he wrote influential articles on Mexican art and artists for American, French, and Mexican newspapers and periodicals, including the Freeman, Harper's Monthly Magazine, Creative Art, Parnassus, Art News, Art in America, Virginia Quarterly Review, the Nation, the New York Times, L'Amour et l'Art, Gazette des Beaux-Arts, Cuadernos Americanos, Letras de Mexico, El Hijo Prodigo, and Mexico Moderno. He also included references to Mexican artists Diego Rivera and Jose Clemente Orozco in his books The Masters of Modern Art; Ananias; and Queer Thing, Painting. Finally, he contributed a short piece, Relaciones entre la cultura notreamericana y la obra de Diego Rivera, for the book 50 anos de su labor artistica, published in 1951. Pach was a vitally important figure in the introduction and dissemination of Mexican art to international audiences from the 1920s through the early 1950s. Indeed, art historian Margarita Nieto ascribed the enthusiasm for Mexican culture to two phenomena, one being the overall American cultural climate and the other the presence in Mexico of an American intellectual who has only recently been 'rediscovered' by the United States, Walter Pach, who served as a bridge between the School of Mexico artists-indeed, Mexican art in general-and the North American art institutions.(1)",,,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,2,3,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV PRESS,UNIVERSITY PK,"215 WAGNER BUILDING, UNIVERSITY PK, PA 16802 USA",,,978-0-271-03740-0,,,,2011,,,,,130,+,,,,,,15,Art,Book Citation Index – Social Sciences & Humanities (BKCI-SSH),Art,BHS43,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000326572000012,View Full Record in Web of Science

We sought to compose a different kind of survey tool, one that enables STEM instructors, nonspecialists in educational research, to probe undergraduate STEM climate at their institutions in broad, exploratory terms. We accomplished this goal by assembling a diverse research team of students and faculty, those who directly shape and experience undergraduate STEM climate. We supplement our paper by including a preliminary analysis of the data from the first administration of the survey at our institution. Our goal here is chiefly pedagogical: to suggest an approach to data analysis for those implementing our survey. In sum, our project invites college STEM instructors to enter into a discussion that, though often marginalized, plays a central role in shaping their capacity to teach inclusively.","[De Grandi, Claudia; Smithline, Zachary B.; Barbour, Nathaniel; Guoah, Joyce; Caines, Helen; Mochrie, Simon G.

In this study, the accuracy of AVHRR-derived cloud properties cloud mask, cloud-top height, cloud phase and cloud liquid water path is assessed using three state-of-the-art retrieval schemes. In addition, the same retrieval schemes are applied to the AVHRR heritage channels of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to create AVHRR-like retrievals with higher spatial resolution and based on presumably more accurate spectral calibration. The cloud property retrievals were collocated and inter-compared with observations from CloudSat, CALIPSO and AMSR-E The resulting comparison exhibited good agreement in general. The schemes provide correct cloud detection in 82 to 90% of all cloudy cases. With correct identification of clear-sky in 61 to 85% of all clear areas, the schemes are slightly biased towards cloudy conditions. The evaluation of the cloud phase classification shows correct identification of liquid clouds in 61 to 97% and a correct identification of ice clouds in 68 to 95%, demonstrating a large variability among the schemes. Cloud-top height (CTH) retrievals were of relatively similar quality with standard deviations ranging from 2.1 km to 2.7 km. Significant negative biases in these retrievals are found in particular for cirrus clouds. The biases decrease if optical depth thresholds are applied to determine the reference CTH measure. Cloud liquid water path (LWP) is also retrieved well with relative low standard deviations (20 to 28 g/m(2)), negative bias and high correlations. Cloud ice water path (IWP) retrievals of AVHRR and MODIS exhibit a relative high uncertainty with standard deviations between 800 and 1400 g/m2, which in relative terms exceed 100% when normalized with the mean IWP. However, the global histogram distributions of IWP were similar to the reference dataset MODIS retrievals are for most comparisons of slightly better quality than AVHRR-based retrievals. Additionally, the choice of different near-infrared channels, 3.7 mu M as opposed to 1.6 mu m, can have a significant impact on the retrieval quality, most pronounced for IWP, with better accuracy for the 1.6 mu m channel setup. This study presents a novel assessment of the quality of cloud properties derived from AVHRR channels, which quantifies the accuracy of the considered retrievals based on common approaches and validation data. Furthermore, it assesses the capabilities of AVHRR-like spectral information for retrieving cloud properties in the light of generating climate data records of cloud properties from three decades of AVHRR measurements.

Data are obtained from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) archives, phases 3 and 5 (CMIP3 and CMIP5), using the 20C3M and historical coupled model experiments. A systematic approach is adopted, with the scope narrowed to six large-scale regions of sub-Saharan Africa within which seasonal rainfall anomalies are reasonably coherent, along with six SST modes known to affect these regions. No significant nonstationarity of the strength of these 6 x 6 teleconnections is found in observations. The capability of models to represent each teleconnection is then assessed (whereby half the teleconnections have observed SST-rainfall correlations that differ significantly from zero). A few of these teleconnections are found to be relatively easy to model, while a few more pose substantial challenges to models and many others exhibit a wide variety of model skill. Furthermore, some models perform consistently better than others, with the best able to at least adequately simulate 80%-85% of the 36 teleconnections. No improvement is found between CMIP3 and CMIP5. Analysis of atmosphere-only simulations suggests that the coupled model teleconnection errors may arise primarily from errors in their SST climatology and variability, although errors in the atmospheric component of teleconnections also play a role. Last, no straightforward relationship is found between the quality of a model's teleconnection to Africa and its SST or rainfall biases or its resolution. Perhaps not surprisingly, the causes of these errors are complex, and will require considerable further investigation.","Met Off Hadley Ctr, Exeter EX1 3PB, Devon, England",Met Office - UK; Hadley Centre,"Rowell, DP (corresponding author), Met Off Hadley Ctr, FitzRoy Rd, Exeter EX1 3PB, Devon, England.",dave.rowell@metoffice.gov.uk,"Rowell, David P/AAF-3674-2019","Rowell, David P/0000-0002-6727-1732",U.K. Department for International Development,U.K. Department for International Development,"This document is an output from a project funded by the U.K. Department for International Development for the benefit of developing countries.

This low species diversity may be due to the permanent low temperature even during summer time. Beside low temperature, Antarctic plants must be able to cope with other severe physiological stressors such as desiccation, low soil water availability, and high irradiance. However, these factors are found in other cold areas of the globe. Thus, what is so special about these two species that has enabled them to be the only successful flowering plants in the Antarctica? Although this question has been addressed in other articles, we still lack of an integrative ecophysiological framework that helps to disentangle what it is unique of these species in terms of adaptations to the Antarctic environments, and how these adaptations will help or preclude their responses to future climate change. Several adaptations seem to help to withstand the Antarctic climate: xerophytic anatomical characteristics, sufficient freezing tolerance, ability to maintain positive net photosynthesis at near 0 degrees C, adequate management of excess photosynthetic active radiation, resistance to photoinhibitory conditions, tolerance to water stress, and ability to form associations with endophytes that help in their mineral nutrition. Besides the very effective stress tolerance strategies, several ecophysiological traits show considerable response flexibility. The evidence reviewed here indicates that small increases in air temperature may be beneficial in terms of photosynthetic performance. However, increased frequency of leaf temperatures over 20 degrees C could be harmful affecting photosynthesis and reducing the ability of these plants to tolerate freezing temperatures and photoprotection at low temperatures, attributes by which they are able to colonize these very harsh environment.","[Cavieres, Lohengrin A.; Sanhueza, Carolina; Sierra-Almeida, Angela; Corcuera, Luis J.] Univ Concepcion, Fac Ciencias Nat & Oceanog, Dept Bot, Concepcion, Chile; [Cavieres, Lohengrin A.; Sanhueza, Carolina; Sierra-Almeida, Angela] IEB, Santiago, Chile; [Saez, Patricia] Univ Concepcion, Fac Ciencias Forest, Ctr Biotecnol, Dept Silvicultura, Concepcion, Chile; [Rabert, Claudia; Alberdi, Miren; Bravo, Leon A.] Univ La Frontera, Fac Ciencias Agr & Forest, Dept Ciencias Agron & Recursos Nat, Lab Fisiol & Biol Mol Vegetal,Inst Agroind, Casilla 54-D, Temuco, Chile; [Rabert, Claudia; Alberdi, Miren; Bravo, Leon A.] Univ La Frontera, Ctr Plant Soil Interact & Nat Resources Biotechno, Sci & Technol Bioresource Nucleus, Casilla 54-D, Temuco, Chile",Universidad de Concepcion; Universidad de Concepcion; Universidad de La Frontera; Universidad de La Frontera,"Cavieres, LA (corresponding author), IEB, Santiago, Chile.",lcaviere@udec.cl,"Bravo, León/AAO-8437-2020; Sierra-Almeida, Angela/F-8409-2014; Bravo, Leon/H-9251-2018; Sanhueza, Carolina/AAG-7456-2019; Cavieres, Lohengrin/A-9542-2010","Bravo, León/0000-0003-4705-4842; Sierra-Almeida, Angela/0000-0002-4207-0950; Bravo, Leon/0000-0003-4705-4842; Cavieres, Lohengrin/0000-0001-9122-3020; Rabert, Claudia/0000-0001-8179-9245",PIA-ART [11-02]; F ICM [P05-002]; CONICYT [PFB-023],PIA-ART; F ICM; CONICYT(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)),Research funded by PIA-ART 11-02.

While they have growing public and private support, the realizable benefits and unintended consequences of NbCS are not well understood. At regional scales where policy decisions are often made, NbCS benefits are estimated from soil and tree survey data that can miss important carbon sources and sinks within an ecosystem, and do not reveal the biophysical impacts of NbCS for local water and energy cycles. The only direct observations of ecosystem-scale carbon fluxes, for example, by eddy covariance flux towers, have not yet been systematically assessed for what they can tell us about NbCS potentials, and state-of-the-art remote sensing products and land-surface models are not yet being widely used to inform NbCS policymaking or implementation. As a result, there is a critical mismatch between the point- and tree-scale data most often used to assess NbCS benefits and impacts, the ecosystem and landscape scales where NbCS projects are implemented, and the regional to continental scales most relevant to policymaking. Here, we propose a research agenda to confront these gaps using data and tools that have long been used to understand the mechanisms driving ecosystem carbon and energy cycling, but have not yet been widely applied to NbCS. We outline steps for creating robust NbCS assessments at both local to regional scales that are informed by ecosystem-scale observations, and which consider concurrent biophysical impacts, future climate feedbacks, and the need for equitable and inclusive NbCS implementation strategies. We contend that these research goals can largely be accomplished by shifting the scales at which pre-existing tools are applied and blended together, although we also highlight some opportunities for more radical shifts in approach.","[Novick, Kimberly A.; Barnes, Mallory; Cala, Daniela S.] Indiana Univ, ONeill Sch Publ & Environm Affairs, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Metzger, Stefan] Battelle Mem Inst, Natl Ecol Observ Network, Boulder, CO USA; [Anderegg, William R.

We discuss the status of TC simulation across multiple time scales, from intraseasonal, seasonal, and decadal, to climate change. One of the limitations on the simulation of TCs in climate models has been, and continues to be, balancing the high resolution necessary to accurately simulate TCs themselves with the need to run simulations for many years and using many ensemble members. Several approaches to inferring TC activity indirectly, rather than relying on the models own under-resolved TCs, are reviewed, including the use of TC genesis indices based on the large-scale environment and downscaling methods such as the use of regional climate models and statistical-dynamical techniques. We also provide an update on the status of climate change projections from the current class of models, where it is feasible to directly track the model's TCs. While there has been great progress in the capability of climate models to simulate TCs and provide useful forecasts and projections across multiple time scales, there remains much work to be done. We list some of the sources of uncertainty and model sensitivity, describe where improvements are necessary, and provide a few suggestions for promising research directions.

We present a novel approach that combines pollen-based REVEALS estimates of plant cover with climate, anthropogenic land-cover and dynamic vegetation modelling results. This is used to quantify the relative impacts of land use and climate on Holocene vegetation at a sub-continental scale, i.e. northern and western Europe north of the Alps. We use redundancy analysis and variation partitioning to quantify the percentage of variation in vegetation composition explained by the climate and land-use variables, and Monte Carlo permutation tests to assess the statistical significance of each variable. We further use a similarity index to combine pollen based REVEALS estimates with climate-driven dynamic vegetation modelling results. The overall results indicate that climate is the major driver of vegetation when the Holocene is considered as a whole and at the sub-continental scale, although land use is important regionally. Four critical phases of land-use effects on vegetation are identified. The first phase (from 7000 to 6500 BP) corresponds to the early impacts on vegetation of farming and Neolithic forest clearance and to the dominance of climate as a driver of vegetation change. During the second phase (from 4500 to 4000 BP), land use becomes a major control of vegetation. Climate is still the principal driver, although its influence decreases gradually. The third phase (from 2000 to 1500 BP) is characterised by the continued role of climate on vegetation as a consequence of late-Holocene climate shifts and specific climate events that influence vegetation as well as land use. The last phase (from 500 to 350 BP) shows an acceleration of vegetation changes, in particular during the last century, caused by new farming practices and forestry in response to population growth and industrialization. This is a unique signature of anthropogenic impact within the Holocene but European vegetation remains climatically sensitive and thus may continue to respond to ongoing climate change.

On one hand, it is important to assess the reliability of such models and how their response to increased greenhouse gas concentrations may depend on the parameters and parameterizations chosen; on the other, it is fundamental to improve our ability to validate and compare model results in a robust, compact, and meaningful way. Understanding how sensitive climate models are to changes in their parameters is of fundamental importance when addressing the problem of modeled climate sensitivity. Here a quadratic metamodel that uses a polynomial approximation to describe the parameter dependency is presented together with its application to the Community Atmospheric Model, CAM, in its two latest versions. Furthermore, the application of complex network analysis to climate fields is briefly summarized and a novel methodology that allows for robust model intercomparisons is presented together with a set of metrics to quantify the topological properties of model outputs.

The basis of the analysis is information taken from a climate change simulation performed with a state-of-the-art general circulation model (the Hadley Centre model). First, it is shown that the model is unable to reproduce accurately the statistics of daily maximum and minimum temperature at the site. Second, using a re-analysis data set, downscaling models are developed to predict site temperature from large-scale free atmosphere variables derived from the sea level pressure and 500 hPa geopotential height fields. In particular, the relative performances of linear models and non-linear artificial neural networks are compared using a set of rigorous validation techniques. It is shown that even a simple configuration of a 2-layer non-linear neural network significantly improves on the performance of a linear model. Finally, the non-linear neural network model is initialised with general circulation model output to construct scenarios of daily temperature at the present day (1970-79) and for a future decade (2090-99). These scenarios are analysed with special attention to the comparison of the frequencies of heat waves (days with maximum temperature greater than 35 degreesC) and cold spells (days with minimum temperature below 5 degreesC).","Univ E Anglia, Climat Res Unit, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England",University of East Anglia,"Trigo, RM (corresponding author), Univ E Anglia, Climat Res Unit, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",,"Trigo, Ricardo M/B-7044-2008; Trigo, Ricardo/Q-8391-2019","Trigo, Ricardo M/0000-0002-4183-9852; Trigo, Ricardo/0000-0002-4183-9852; Palutikof, Jean/0000-0002-5248-6925",,,,,43,67,68,1,8,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0936-577X,,,CLIMATE RES,Clim.

A metho-pedagogical paradigm is mobilized as a framework to consider how drama is put to work, methodologically and pedagogically, at a time of climate emergency and pandemic. This framework is illustrated across two vignettes, which attend to the social challenges and impacts of emergent drama-based ethnographic research across two years of the study, in varying geographic locations with different cultural orientations, in live classrooms and in virtual theatre spaces. Attention, risk, desire, trust and reciprocity emerge as important proposals for engaging in arts-led research with youth in these times.","[Gallagher, Kathleen; Balt, Christine; Cardwell, Nancy; Valve, Lindsay] Univ Toronto, Curriculum Teaching & Learning Ontario Inst Studi, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Gallagher, Kathleen] Univ Toronto, Ctr Drama Theatre & Performance Studies, Toronto, ON, Canada",University of Toronto; University of Toronto,"Gallagher, K (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Ctr Drama Theatre & Performance Studies, Fac Arts & Sci, 79 St George St Rm 220, Toronto, ON M5S 2E5, Canada.",kathleen.gallagher@utoronto.ca,,,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [4352019-0298],Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),This work was supported by a Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada Insight Grant: 4352019-0298.,,44,0,0,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0951-8398,1366-5898,,INT J QUAL STUD EDUC,Int.

While scientific knowledge is critical to confront and resolve contradictions that reproduce unsustainable practices at the coast and to spark global societal change toward sustainability, it is not enough in itself to catalyze large scale behavioral change. People learn, understand and generate knowledge in different ways according to their experiences, perspectives, and culture, amongst others, which shape responses and willingness to alter behavior. Historically, there has been a strong connection between art and science, both of which share a common goal to understand and describe the world around us as well as provide avenues for communication and enquiry. This connection provides a clear avenue for engaging multiple audiences at once, evoking emotion and intuition to trigger stronger motivations for change. There is an urgent need to rupture the engrained status quo of disciplinary divisions across academia and society to generate transdisciplinary approaches to global environmental challenges. This paper describes the evolution of an art-science collaboration (Catching a Wave) designed to galvanize change in the Anthropocene era by creating discourse drivers for transformations that are more centered on society rather than the more traditional science-policy-practice nexus.","[Paterson, Shona K.] Brunel Univ London, Coll Business Arts & Social Sci, Uxbridge, Middx, England; [Paterson, Shona K.; Le Tissier, Martin; Whyte, Hester] Univ Coll Cork, Int Project Off, Future Earth Coasts, MaREI,ERI, Cork, Ireland; [Le Tissier, Martin; Whyte, Hester] Univ Coll Cork, Environm Res Inst, SFI Res Ctr Energy Climate & Marine, MaREI, Cork, Ireland; [Robinson, Lisa B.] East Carolina Univ, Sch Art & Design, Greenville, NC 27858 USA; [Thielking, Kristin] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Art & Design, Stevens Point, WI 54481 USA; [Ingram, Mrill] Univ Wisconsin, Ctr Integrated Agr Syst, Madison, WI USA; [McCord, John] East Carolina Univ, Coastal Studies Inst, Wanchese, NC USA",Brunel University; University College Cork; University College Cork; University of North Carolina; East Carolina University; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Stevens Point; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of North Carolina; East Carolina University,"Paterson, SK (corresponding author), Brunel Univ London, Coll Business Arts & Social Sci, Uxbridge, Middx, England.;Paterson, SK (corresponding author), Univ Coll Cork, Int Project Off, Future Earth Coasts, MaREI,ERI, Cork, Ireland.",shonakoren.paterson@brunel.ac.uk,"Le Tissier, Martin/ABB-9457-2020","Paterson, Shona/0000-0003-3107-585X; Le Tissier, Martin/0000-0003-2542-390X","Future Earth Coasts; East Carolina University (College of Fine Arts and Communication Research and Creative Activity Awards); University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point (Research and Creative Activities Grant) [3218.07]; Marine Institute, Ireland [NT/19/45]; Brunel University London (QR-GCRF) [NT/19/45]","Future Earth Coasts; East Carolina University (College of Fine Arts and Communication Research and Creative Activity Awards); University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point (Research and Creative Activities Grant); Marine Institute, Ireland; Brunel University London (QR-GCRF)","The research reported on in this paper was funded in part by Future Earth Coasts, by East Carolina University (College of Fine Arts and Communication Research and Creative Activity Awards) and by the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point (Research and Creative Activities Grant #3218.07).

This work concerns the development of a deep learning model for analyzing and predicting spatial time series, considering both satellite derived and model-based data assimilation processes. To that end, we propose the Embedded Temporal Convolutional Network (E-TCN) architecture, which integrates three different networks, namely an encoder network, a temporal convolutional network, and a decoder network. The model accepts as input satellite or assimilation model derived values, such as land surface temperature and soil moisture, with monthly periodicity, going back more than fifteen years. We use our model and compare its results with the state-of-the-art model for spatiotemporal data, the ConvLSTM model. To quantify performance, we explore different cases of spatial resolution, spatial region extension, number of training examples and prediction windows, among others. The proposed approach achieves better performance in terms of prediction accuracy, while using a smaller number of parameters compared to the ConvLSTM model. Although we focus on two specific environmental variables, the method can be readily applied to other variables of interest.","[Villia, Maria Myrto; Tsagkatakis, Grigorios; Tsakalides, Panagiotis] Fdn Res & Technol Hellas FORTH, Inst Comp Sci, Iraklion 70013, Greece; [Moghaddam, Mahta] Univ Southern Calif, Dept Elect Engn, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Tsakalides, Panagiotis] Univ Crete, Dept Comp Sci, Hraklion 70013, Greece",University of Southern California; University of Crete,"Tsagkatakis, G (corresponding author), Fdn Res & Technol Hellas FORTH, Inst Comp Sci, Iraklion 70013, Greece.",mahta@usc.edu; mahta@usc.edu; mahta@usc.edu; mahta@usc.edu,"; Tsakalides, Panagiotis/O-2063-2015","Tsagkatakis, Grigorios/0000-0001-6498-9450; Moghaddam, Mahta/0000-0001-5304-2616; Tsakalides, Panagiotis/0000-0003-4918-603X",European Commission [842560],European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre),"This research work was partially supported by the Marie Sklodowska-Curie project (https://sites.google.com/view/calchas-eu, accessed on 1 December 2021) CALCHAS (contract no.842560) of the H2020 Framework Program of the European Commission.",,35,0,0,5,7,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1424-8220,,SENSORS-BASEL,Sensors,MAR,2022,5,,,,,,1851,10.3390/s22051851,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s22051851,,,19,"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation,ZW4UO,35270998,"Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000771210200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

While much has been written about promising practices of participatory action research with various marginalized communities, there remains a dearth of participatory action research literature that focuses on trans* people, a population often under attack in current socio-political climates. In this paper, we report on a participatory action research project, in which a trans* artist worked closely with trans* youth participants (n = 5) to assist them through a creative project. Using a queer theoretical lens and drawing from the concept of queer world-making, the participants recast cultural representations about what it means to be trans* in their chosen artistic medium. This paper suggests that art can serve as a transformative research practice with trans* youth. Our findings suggest that the rhetorical binary of trans* vulnerability and resilience does not adequately represent lived experience. We make this argument by demonstrating the following processes through which youths engaged art in this participatory action research project: (1) countering normative discourses of what it means to be trans*, (2) promoting self- reflection and expression, and (3) facilitating queer counterpublics. In so doing, we make an argument for art as a qualitative research process that holds much promise in uncovering and challenging the normative discourse and developing a much more complex and nuanced understanding of what it means to be trans* youth.","[Asakura, Kenta; Lundy, Jess; Tierney, Cara] Carleton Univ, 509 Dunton Tower,1125 Colonel Dr, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada; [Black, Dillon] Univ Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada",Carleton University; University of Ottawa,"Asakura, K (corresponding author), Carleton Univ, 509 Dunton Tower,1125 Colonel Dr, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada.",kenta.asakura@carleton.ca,,"Asakura, Kenta/0000-0002-9277-6441",Social Sciences & Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC) Insight Development Program [403-2016-00180],Social Sciences & Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC) Insight Development Program,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This project was funded by the Social Sciences & Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC) Insight Development Program (#403-2016-00180).",,50,3,3,0,19,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1473-3250,1741-3117,,QUAL SOC WORK,Qual.

In the middle atmosphere (50 - 100 km), beyond the reach of balloons or satellites, thermal signatures of CO2 radiation and wave activity have been largely missing from climate model inputs. This paper outlines an instrument to advance the state of the art in atmospheric climate projection by providing critical global measurements of middle-atmosphere temperatures and waves with a CubeSat-scale imaging spectrograph. The CM2 will remotely sense middle-atmosphere temperatures and waves at similar to 90 km by analyzing spectra of intrinsically bright molecular oxygen emissions at near-infrared wavelengths in the O2 atmospheric band. The core instrument will be a miniaturized imaging spectrograph based on a monolithic spatial heterodyne spectrometer (SHS). This spectrograph will have sensitivity and spectral resolution to extract temperatures with 10 degrees K precision and waves with 4 km scale resolution along a similar to 200 km cross-track swath. The SHS is significantly more robust than conventional interferometers, and thus better suited to space-based observation. Acquiring high-resolution middle-atmosphere temperature, tidal, and wave data on a daily, global basis will significantly improve climate models, and will help assess long-term greenhouse gas mitigation policy impact on upper-atmosphere thermal signatures. The CM2 program will also establish the efficacy of high-resolution CubeSat-based broadband (near-IR to UV) spectroscopy for application to other atmospheric research missions.","[Doe, Richard A.] SRI Int, 333 Ravenswood Ave, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA",SRI International,"Doe, RA (corresponding author), SRI Int, 333 Ravenswood Ave, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA.",steve@sci-sol.com,,,,,,,33,5,5,1,5,SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING,BELLINGHAM,"1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010 USA",0277-786X,1996-756X,978-0-81948-763-6,PROC SPIE,,,2011,,,,,,,81530Q,10.1117/12.894460,http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.894460,,,12,Astronomy & Astrophysics; Optics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Astronomy & Astrophysics; Optics,BXZ18,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000297670900022,View Full Record in Web of Science

Typically, the mean over all model simulations is considered as the optimal prediction, with the underlying assumption that different models provide statistically independent information evenly distributed around the true state. However, there is reason to believe that this is not the best assumption. Coupled models are of comparable complexity and are constructed in similar ways. Some models share parts of the same code and some models are even developed at the same center. Therefore, the limitations of these models tend to be fairly similar, contributing to the well-known problem of common model biases and possibly to an unrealistically small spread in the outcomes of model predictions. This study attempts to quantify the extent of this problem by asking how many models there effectively are and how to best determine this number. Quantifying the effective number of models is achieved by evaluating 24 state-of-the-art models and their ability to simulate broad aspects of twentieth-century climate. Using two different approaches, the amount of unique information in the ensemble is calculated and the effective ensemble size is found to be much smaller than the actual number of models. As more models are included in an ensemble, the amount of new information diminishes in proportion. Furthermore, this reduction is found to go beyond the problem of same center models and systemic similarities are seen to exist across all models. The results suggest that current methodologies for the interpretation of multimodel ensembles may lead to overly confident climate predictions.","[Pennell, Christopher; Reichler, Thomas] Univ Utah, Dept Atmospher Sci, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA",Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah,"Reichler, T (corresponding author), Univ Utah, Dept Atmospher Sci, 135 S 1460 E,Rm 819 WBB, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA.",thomas.reichler@utah.edu,,"Reichler, Thomas/0000-0002-5004-0110","Office of Science, U.S. Department of Energy; NSF [ATM0532280]; NOAA [OAR-OGP-2006-2000116]","Office of Science, U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA)","We acknowledge Huug van den Dool for useful discussions, Junsu Kim for providing data and code, the modeling groups for providing the CMIP3 data for analysis, the Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison for collecting and archiving the model output, and the JSC/CLIVAR Working Group on Coupled Modelling for organizing the model data analysis activity.

Moderate climate anomalies and extremes are diagnosed with two indicators of heat stress and drought computed over maize growing regions during the most relevant period of maize growth. The calibrated model linearly combines these two indicators into a single Combined Stress Index. The Combined Stress Index explains 50% of the observed global production variability in the period 1980-2010. We apply the model on an ensemble of high-resolution global climate model simulations. Global maize losses, due to extreme climate events with 10-year return times during the period 1980-2010, will become the new normal already at 1.5 degrees C global warming levels (approximately 2020s). At 2 degrees C warming (late 2030s), maize areas will be affected by heat stress and drought never experienced before, affecting many major and minor production regions. Plain Language Summary Global warming is negatively affecting several aspects of ecosystems and societies. This study analyzes the impact of climate on global and regional maize production in the past and in the future. The effects of warmer temperatures and lack of rain on maize production is first analyzed from reported national maize production time series, and these relationships are then projected into the future, using state-of-the-art global climate model simulations. The worse climate events causing the larger maize production losses observed in the past will become normal already at the global warming level of 1.5 degrees C compared to the preindustrial period. Our findings highlight the importance of Paris Agreement mitigation goals to hold the increase of global temperature well below 2 degrees C and pursuing efforts to limit increase to 1.5 degrees C, as well as the need of identifying and adopting efficient adaptation measures.","[Zampieri, M.; Ceglar, A.; Dentener, F.; Dosio, A.; Naumann, G.; van den Berg, M.; Toreti, A.] European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Ispra, Italy",European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site,"Zampieri, M (corresponding author), European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Ispra, Italy.",matteo.zampieri@ec.europa.eu,"Dosio, Alessandro/U-9093-2017; Naumann, Gustavo/L-6758-2017","Dosio, Alessandro/0000-0002-6365-9473; Naumann, Gustavo/0000-0002-8767-5099; ZAMPIERI, Matteo/0000-0002-7558-1108; Dentener, Frank/0000-0001-7556-3076; Toreti, Andrea/0000-0002-1983-2523",Helix Climate High-End cLimate Impacts and eXtremes project (HELIX; FP7) [603864],Helix Climate High-End cLimate Impacts and eXtremes project (HELIX; FP7),"M.Z. conceived the idea and designed the study; A.

The purpose of the study is to describe its main features and to provide a preliminary assessment of its mean climatology. CNRM-CM5.1 includes the atmospheric model ARPEGE-Climat (v5.2), the ocean model NEMO (v3.2), the land surface scheme ISBA and the sea ice model GELATO (v5) coupled through the OASIS (v3) system. The main improvements since CMIP3 are the following. Horizontal resolution has been increased both in the atmosphere (from 2.8A degrees to 1.4A degrees) and in the ocean (from 2A degrees to 1A degrees). The dynamical core of the atmospheric component has been revised. A new radiation scheme has been introduced and the treatments of tropospheric and stratospheric aerosols have been improved. Particular care has been devoted to ensure mass/water conservation in the atmospheric component. The land surface scheme ISBA has been externalised from the atmospheric model through the SURFEX platform and includes new developments such as a parameterization of sub-grid hydrology, a new freezing scheme and a new bulk parameterisation for ocean surface fluxes. The ocean model is based on the state-of-the-art version of NEMO, which has greatly progressed since the OPA8.0 version used in the CMIP3 version of CNRM-CM. Finally, the coupling between the different components through OASIS has also received a particular attention to avoid energy loss and spurious drifts. These developments generally lead to a more realistic representation of the mean recent climate and to a reduction of drifts in a preindustrial integration. The large-scale dynamics is generally improved both in the atmosphere and in the ocean, and the bias in mean surface temperature is clearly reduced. However, some flaws remain such as significant precipitation and radiative biases in many regions, or a pronounced drift in three dimensional salinity.","[Voldoire, A.; Salas y Melia, D.; Decharme, B.; Senesi, S.; Beau, I.; Alias, A.; Chevallier, M.; Deque, M.; Douville, H.; Planton, S.; Saint-Martin, D.; Tyteca, S.; Alkama, R.; Belamari, S.; Braun, A.; Chauvin, F.] CNRS, Meteofrance, CNRM, GAME, Toulouse, France; [Sanchez-Gomez, E.; Cassou, C.; Valcke, S.; Fernandez, E.; Maisonnave, E.; Moine, M-P.; Coquart, L.] CNRS, CERFACS, Toulouse, France; [Deshayes, J.] CNRS, LPO, Brest, France; [Madec, G.] IPSL, LOCEAN, Paris, France; [Madec, G.] NOC, Southampton, Hants, England; [Szopa, S.] CNRS, LSCE CEA, Gif Sur Yvette, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Meteo France; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CERFACS; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Ifremer; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite de Bretagne Occidentale; Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle (MNHN); UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Universite Paris Cite; NERC National Oceanography Centre; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; CEA; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Voldoire, A (corresponding author), CNRS, Meteofrance, CNRM, GAME, Toulouse, France.",aurore.voldoire@meteo.fr,"Decharme, Bertrand/Z-4563-2019; Coquart, Laure/AAI-1284-2021; SZOPA, Sophie/F-8984-2010; madec, gurvan/E-7825-2010; Alkama, Ramdane/ABF-9937-2021; CASSOU, Christophe/AAP-6409-2020; Saint-Martin, David/P-7006-2018; PLANTON, Serge S/L-3112-2016","Decharme, Bertrand/0000-0002-8661-1464; SZOPA, Sophie/0000-0002-8641-1737; madec, gurvan/0000-0002-6447-4198; Alkama, Ramdane/0000-0001-9864-2084; Saint-Martin, David/0000-0002-8478-6914; Senesi, Stephane/0000-0003-0892-5967; Deshayes, Julie/0000-0002-1462-686X",European Commission [226520]; Meteo-France; CNRS; Cerfacs; NERC [noc010010] Funding Source: UKRI; Natural Environment Research Council [noc010010] Funding Source: researchfish,European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre); Meteo-France; CNRS(Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)); Cerfacs; NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"This work was funded by the European Commission's 7th Framework Programme, under Grant Agreement number 226520, COMBINE project.

As a result, update of Intensity-Duration-Frequency (IDF) curves considering climate change is essential for adaptation of water-related structures to climate change. The present work reviews the main challenges regarding the update of IDF curves considering climate change. A wide literature search was conducted in scientific databases. More than one hundred articles published between 2001 and 2021 have been reviewed and are summarized and discussed. The main aims of the present work were to: (i) identify the state-of-the-art scientific approaches regarding IDF curve update under climate change projections; (ii) assess whether or not these approaches incorporate uncertainty (i.e., uncertainty related to climate models, statistical downscaling techniques, temporal resolution of data, theoretical distribution selection etc.); and (iii) and to propose general guidelines for updating IDF curves based on climate projections. First, the motivation is presented that makes IDF curve renewal a global issue. Second, current practices are described and reviewed and the main impacts of climate change on short precipitation extremes around the world are shortly discussed. Finally, limitations and future research needs are discussed.","[Tsihrintzis, Vassilios A.] Natl Tech Univ Athens, Sch Rural Surveying & Geoinformat Engn, Ctr Assessment Nat Hazards & Proact Planning, 9 Iroon Polytech St, Athens 15780, Greece; Natl Tech Univ Athens, Sch Rural Surveying & Geoinformat Engn, Lab Reclamat Works & Water Resources Management, 9 Iroon Polytech St, Athens 15780, Greece",National Technical University of Athens; National Technical University of Athens,"Tsihrintzis, VA (corresponding author), Natl Tech Univ Athens, Sch Rural Surveying & Geoinformat Engn, Ctr Assessment Nat Hazards & Proact Planning, 9 Iroon Polytech St, Athens 15780, Greece.",tsihrin@survey.ntua.gr,,,European Union (European Social Fund-ESF) [MIS-5000432],European Union (European Social Fund-ESF)(European Social Fund (ESF)European Commission),"This research is co-financed by Greece and the European Union (European Social Fund-ESF) through the Operational Programme << Human Resources Development, Education and Lifelong Learning >> in the context of the project `Strengthening Human Resources Research Potential via Doctorate Research' (MIS-5000432), implemented by the State Scholarships Foundation (IKY).",,199,3,3,4,10,IWA PUBLISHING,LONDON,"REPUBLIC-EXPORT BLDG, UNITS 1 04 & 1 05, 1 CLOVE CRESCENT, LONDON, ENGLAND",1606-9749,1607-0798,,WATER SUPPLY,Water Supply,MAY,2022,5,,,,4951,4974,,10.2166/ws.2022.152,http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/ws.2022.152,,22-Mar,24,"Engineering, Environmental; Environmental Sciences; Water Resources",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,1S1XA,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000775226800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

These calls betray some fundamental misunderstandings about the 2500-year-old art of rhetoric. Once these are dispelled, it becomes apparent that what we need for effective climate-science debate is not less rhetoric but more: that is, more sensitivity to the political frame within which every debate takes place and how that frame shapes deliberation; more awareness of the unstated values and assumptions supporting statements made on all sides; more ways to link climate to stakeholders' daily lives, values, and decisions. This article briefly introduces readers to the history and theory of rhetoric for two purposes: (1) explaining the various and sometimes contradictory ways in which this ancient discipline shapes the communication of climate science and (2) providing readers with a few simple but powerful tools for coping with climate debates.

This economic model describes farmers' decision making with respect to input use and accounts for production levels, production risks, fodder quality as determined by the grassland composition, and environmental protection. We apply the bio-economic model to an intensively managed grassland system with a geographic focus on the Swiss Plateau. Our results show an increase of future production risks in grassland production due to climate change. Projected changes in yield levels, grassland composition and optimal responses of risk-averse farmers are dependent on the assumptions concerning cross-compliance obligations, forage quality and particularly on the assumed effect of elevated CO2 concentrations: Grasslands yields will increase under future climatic conditions only if the benefits of rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations are taken into account. Without this potential benefit, climate change will lead to less intensive input use and lower grassland yields. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Here I investigate the representation of the global energy balance in 40 state-of-the-art global climate models participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6). In the CMIP6 multi-model mean, the magnitudes of the energy balance components are often in better agreement with recent reference estimates compared to earlier model generations on a global mean basis. However, the inter-model spread in the representation of many of the components remains substantial, often on the order of 10-20 Wm(-2) globally, except for aspects of the shortwave clear-sky budgets, which are now more consistently simulated by the CMIP6 models. The substantial inter-model spread in the simulated global mean latent heat fluxes in the CMIP6 models, exceeding 20% (18 Wm(-2)), further implies also large discrepancies in their representation of the global water balance. From a historic perspective of model development over the past decades, the largest adjustments in the magnitudes of the simulated present-day global mean energy balance components occurred in the shortwave atmospheric clear-sky absorption and the surface downward longwave radiation. Both components were gradually adjusted upwards over several model generations, on the order of 10 Wm(-2), to reach 73 and 344 Wm(-2), respectively in the CMIP6 multi-model means. Thereby, CMIP6 has become the first model generation that largely remediates long-standing model deficiencies related to an overestimation in surface downward shortwave and compensational underestimation in downward longwave radiation in its multi-model mean.","[Wild, Martin] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, CH-8001 Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Wild, M (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, CH-8001 Zurich, Switzerland.",martin.wild@env.ethz.ch,"Keyes, Dennis/AAZ-9285-2021; Wild, Martin/J-8977-2012",,"Swiss National Science Foundation [200021_135395, 200020_159938, 200020_188601]; Federal Office of Meteorology and Climatology MeteoSwiss; CMIP6; ESGF",Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission); Federal Office of Meteorology and Climatology MeteoSwiss; CMIP6; ESGF,"I am grateful to Prof. Atsumu Ohmura for many stimulating discussions on the global energy balance, as well as to Prof. Christoph Schar and Dr. Doris Folini for their continuous support.

Design/methodology/approach - Investments to reduce emissions must be made in the coming decades to avoid the risks posed by climate change. If these investments are made wisely, then costs will be manageable, stability in markets as well as energy security will be achieved, and even rural development and economic growth may be stimulated. The authors call attention to the need for modeling of climate change impacts by combining the outputs from appropriately designed crop simulation models with economic analyses. Combining natural science and economics in a compatible fashion at local scale will play an essential role in advancing communication and information exchange. Findings - There are key differences in drivers or determinants of mitigation and adaptation potential and decisions at different scales, which means that different actors, different timescales and different spatial scales of decision making must be specifically considered. Understanding of the potential impacts of climate change requires disaggregation of the agricultural sector with appropriate detail. A critical trade-off exists between area-wide spatial coverage and an explicit consideration of local peculiarities. Originality/value - The authors suggest that a much stronger effort must be made to meld natural science crop modeling approaches with economic analyses, to include spatially explicit consideration of conventional crop production along with 1st and 2nd generation bioenergy crops, and the evaluation not only of best guess scenarios of change, but also potential system impacts of extreme scenarios.","[Trung Thanh Nguyen; Tenhunen, John] Univ Bayreuth, Bayreuth Ctr Ecol & Environm Res BayCEER, Bayreuth, Germany",University of Bayreuth,"Nguyen, TT (corresponding author), Univ Bayreuth, Bayreuth Ctr Ecol & Environm Res BayCEER, Bayreuth, Germany.",thanh.nguyen@uni-bayreuth.de,"Nguyen, Trung Thanh/D-3448-2009","Nguyen, Trung Thanh/0000-0003-4507-724X",,,,,112,9,9,1,21,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-8692,1756-8706,,INT J CLIM CHANG STR,Int.

The concept provides important opportunities to help examine how rapid and fundamental change to address contemporary global challenges can be facilitated. This paper contributes to discussions about transformation by providing a social science, arts and humanities perspective to open up discussion and set out a research agenda about what it means to transform and the dimensions, limitations and possibilities for transformation. Key focal areas include: (1) change theories; (2) knowing whether transformation has occurred or is occurring; (3) knowledge production and use; (4) governance; (5) how dimensions of social justice inform transformation; (6) the limits of human nature; (7) the role of the utopian impulse; (8) working with the present to create new futures; and (9) human consciousness. In addition to presenting a set of research questions around these themes the paper highlights that much deeper engagement with complex social processes is required; that there are vast opportunities for social science, humanities and the arts to engage more directly with the climate challenge; that there is a need for a massive upscaling of efforts to understand and shape desired forms of change; and that, in addition to helping answer important questions about how to facilitate change, a key role of the social sciences, humanities and the arts in addressing climate change is to critique current societal patterns and to open up new thinking. Through such critique and by being more explicit about what is meant by transformation, greater opportunities will be provided for opening up a dialogue about change, possible futures and about what it means to re-shape the way in which people live.","[Fazey, Ioan; Moug, Peter; Holm, Lorens; Lyon, Christopher; Moss, Anna; Rao-Williams, Jennifer] Univ Dundee, Sch Social Sci, Ctr Environm Change & Human Resilience, Dundee, Scotland; [Allen, Simon] Univ Edinburgh, Sch GeoSci, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Beckmann, Kate] Heriot Watt Univ, Sch Built Environm, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Blackwood, David; Falconer, Ruth] Abertay Univ, Sch Sci Engn & Technol, Dundee, Scotland; [Bonaventura, Mike] Crichton Carbon Ctr, Dumfries, Scotland; [Burnett, Kathryn] Univ West Scotland, Sch Media Culture & Soc, Ayr, Scotland; [Danson, Mike] Heriot Watt Univ, Dept Business Management, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Gagnon, Alexandre S.] Univ West Scotland, Sch Sci & Sport, Paisley, Renfrew, Scotland; [Harkness, Rachel] Univ Aberdeen, Sch Social Sci, Aberdeen, Scotland; [Hodgson, Anthony] Univ Hull, Ctr Syst Studies, Kingston Upon Hull, N Humberside, England; [Hodgson, Anthony] Int Futures Forum, Aberdour, Scotland; [Irvine, Katherine N.] James Hutton Inst, Social Econ & Geog Sci, Aberdeen, Scotland; [Low, Ragne] ClimateXChange, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Moran, Clare] Univ Cambridge, Ctr Sci & Policy, Cambridge, England; [Naylor, Larissa] Univ Glasgow, Sch Geog & Earth Sci, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [O'Brien, Karen] Univ Oslo, Dept Sociol & Human Geog, Oslo, Norway; [Russell, Shona] Univ St Andrews, Sch Management, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland; [Skerratt, Sarah] Scotlands Rural Coll, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Wolstenholme, Ruth] Sniffer, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland",University of Dundee; University of Edinburgh; Heriot Watt University; University of Abertay Dundee; Heriot Watt University; University of West Scotland; University of Aberdeen; University of Hull; James Hutton Institute; University of Cambridge; University of Glasgow; University of Oslo; University of St Andrews; Scotland's Rural College,"Fazey, I (corresponding author), Univ Dundee, Sch Social Sci, Ctr Environm Change & Human Resilience, Dundee, Scotland.",i.fazey@dundee.ac.uk,"Gagnon, Alexandre S/AAB-6465-2020; Lyon, Christopher/T-9426-2019; Gagnon, Alexandre S/AFO-7218-2022; Fazey, Ioan/ABB-3403-2021; Gagnon, Alexandre S/C-2942-2013; Gagnon, Alexandre/AFC-8654-2022; Naylor, Larissa/E-7301-2014","Gagnon, Alexandre S/0000-0002-1301-6015; Gagnon, Alexandre S/0000-0002-1301-6015; Burnett, Kathryn A./0000-0001-7329-6699; Moug, Peter/0000-0002-5156-8865; Russell, Shona/0000-0002-3473-5019; Holm, Lorens/0000-0003-0615-6404; Lyon, Christopher/0000-0003-2319-2933; Blackwood, David/0000-0003-1467-6792; Naylor, Larissa/0000-0002-4065-2674",,,,,187,114,114,6,42,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

The analytic framework is used to explore the long-run growth prospects for Egypt in a changing climate. Based on a review of existing estimates of climate change impacts on agricultural productivity, labour productivity and the potential losses due to sea-level rise for the country, the model is used to simulate the effects of climate change on aggregate consumption, investment and income up to 2050. Available cost estimates for adaptation investments are employed to explore adaptation strategies. The simulation analysis suggests that in the absence of policy-led adaptation investments, real GDP towards the middle of the century will be 6.5% lower than in a hypothetical baseline without climate change. A combination of adaptation measures, that include coastal protection investments for vulnerable sections along the low-lying Nile delta, support for changes in crop management practices and investments to raise irrigation efficiency, could reduce the GDP loss in 2050 to around 2.6%. Further work along these lines for developing countries in climate change hotspot regions deserves a high priority on the research agenda in economic modelling. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Although targeting near-term climate forcers (NTCFs), defined here as aerosols, tropospheric ozone, and precursor gases, should improve air quality, NTCF reductions will also impact climate. Prior assessments of the impact of NTCF mitigation on air quality and climate have been limited. This is related to the idealized nature of some prior studies, simplified treatment of aerosols and chemically reactive gases, as well as a lack of a sufficiently large number of models to quantify model diversity and robust responses. Here, we quantify the 2015-2055 climate and air quality effects of non-methane NTCFs using nine state-of-the-art chemistry-climate model simulations conducted for the Aerosol and Chemistry Model Intercomparison Project (AerChemMIP). Simulations are driven by two future scenarios featuring similar increases in greenhouse gases (GHGs) but with weak (SSP3-7.0) versus strong (SSP3-7.0-lowNTCF) levels of air quality control measures. As SSP3-7.0 lacks climate policy and has the highest levels of NTCFs, our results (e.g., surface warming) represent an upper bound. Unsurprisingly, we find significant improvements in air quality under NTCF mitigation (strong versus weak air quality controls). Surface fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone (O-3) decrease by -2.2 +/- 0.32 mu g m(-3) and -4.6 +/- 0.88 ppb, respectively (changes quoted here are for the entire 2015-2055 time period; uncertainty represents the 95 % confidence interval), over global land surfaces, with larger reductions in some regions including south and southeast Asia. Non-methane NTCF mitigation, however, leads to additional climate change due to the removal of aerosol which causes a net warming effect, including global mean surface temperature and precipitation increases of 0.25 +/- 0.12 K and 0.03 +/- 0.012 mm d(-1), respectively. Similarly, increases in extreme weather indices, including the hottest and wettest days, also occur. Regionally, the largest warming and wetting occurs over Asia, including central and north Asia (0.66 +/- 0.20 K and 0.03 +/- 0.02 mm d(-1)), south Asia (0.47 +/- 0.16 K and 0.17 +/- 0.09 mm d(-1)), and east Asia (0.46 +/- 0.20 K and 0.15 +/- 0.06 mm d(-1)). Relatively large warming and wetting of the Arctic also occur at 0.59 +/- 0.36 K and 0.04 +/- 0.02 mm d(-1), respectively. Similar surface warming occurs in model simulations with aerosol-only mitigation, implying weak cooling due to ozone reductions. Our findings suggest that future policies that aggressively target non-methane NTCF reductions will improve air quality but will lead to additional surface warming, particularly in Asia and the Arctic. Policies that address other NTCFs including methane, as well as carbon dioxide emissions, must also be adopted to meet climate mitigation goals.","[Allen, Robert J.] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA;

Despite this massive expansion, irrigation is still overlooked in most state-of-the-art Earth system models (ESMs) involved in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6). To our knowledge, only three CMIP6 models represent irrigation activities: CESM2, GISS-E2-1-G, and NorESM2-LM. Here, we investigate the role of irrigation on historical climate at global and regional scales by analyzing trends of key surface climate variables in CMIP6 simulations during 1900-2014. The three models including irrigation show distinct behavior from the 15 models without irrigation over intensively irrigated areas (i.e., >50% of grid cell area is equipped by irrigation): both annual (months that correspond to monthly air temperature higher than 274 K) mean latent heat flux (LHF) and soil moisture increase over time, in contrast to the models without irrigation that show no trend or even a negative trend. The positive LHF trend over intensively irrigated areas in the irrigation-on models is consistent with three satellite-based LHF products. While annual (considering the warmest month in a year) warming trends are found in these regions for most of the no-irrigation models, the increase in LHF induces a cooling trend for the models with irrigation, which was not confirmed by observational air temperature data sets. These findings, supported by satellite data, indicate the importance of improved representation of land management in the next generation of ESM.","[Al-Yaari, A.] Univ Grenoble Alpes, UMR 5001, Inst Geosci Environm IGE, IRD,CNRS,Grenoble INP, Grenoble, France; [Ducharne, A.] Sorbonne Univ, UMR 7619, METIS, Case 105, Paris, France; [Ducharne, A.; Cheruy, F.] Sorbonne Univ, CNRS, IPSL Inst Pierre Simon Lapl, Paris, France; [Thiery, W.] Vrije Univ Brussel, Dept Hydrol & Hydraul Engn, Brussels, Belgium; [Cheruy, F.] IPSL Univ, LMD Lab Meteorol Dynam, Sorbonne Univ, Ecole Polytech,ENS,Inst Polytech Paris, Paris, France; [Lawrence, D.] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Earth Sciences & Astronomy (INSU); Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Institut National Polytechnique de Grenoble; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Vrije Universiteit Brussel; UDICE-French Research Universities; PSL Research University Paris; Ecole Normale Superieure (ENS); Sorbonne Universite; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA,"Al-Yaari, A (corresponding author), Univ Grenoble Alpes, UMR 5001, Inst Geosci Environm IGE, IRD,CNRS,Grenoble INP, Grenoble, France.",amen.alyaari@gmail.com,"Al-Yaari, Amen/B-1444-2016; Lawrence, David/C-4026-2011","Al-Yaari, Amen/0000-0001-7530-6088; Lawrence, David/0000-0002-2968-3023; Thiery, Wim/0000-0002-5183-6145",CNES (Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales) through the Science TOSCA (Terre Ocean Surfaces Continentales et Atmosphere) program; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) [ANR-21-SOIL-0001],CNES (Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales) through the Science TOSCA (Terre Ocean Surfaces Continentales et Atmosphere) program; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)(French National Research Agency (ANR)),This research work was funded by the CNES (Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales) through the Science TOSCA (Terre Ocean Surfaces Continentales et Atmosphere) program.

The Baltic Sea overturning circulation is then analyzed. The analysis shows that this circulation decreases between the end of the 20th century and the end of the 21st century, and that the decrease is amplified in the case of the strongest greenhouse gas emission scenarios, which corresponds with the highest warming cases. The reasons behind this decrease in overturning circulation are investigated. A strong increase of thermal stratification is noticed at the level of the Baltic Sea mixed layer. Based on buoyancy flux considerations, we demonstrate that the decrease in overturning circulation coincides with the increase of thermal stratification. Evidence shows that the underlying process is linked to a smaller erosion of the halocline due to a higher shielding, itself linked with a stronger and longer seasonal thermocline. This theory works if surface wind mixing is not taken into account directly in the computation of buoyancy fluxes.","[Hordoir, Robinson; Hoglund, Anders; Pemberton, Per; Schimanke, Semjon] SMHI, S-60176 Norrkoping, Sweden",Swedish Meteorological & Hydrological Institute,"Hordoir, R (corresponding author), SMHI, S-60176 Norrkoping, Sweden.",robinson.hordoir@smhi.se,"Hordoir, Robinson/AAZ-6174-2020",,"BONUS [Art 185]; Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agriculture Sciences and Spatial Planning (FORMAS) [292 985, 219-2013-2041]; SmartSea project of the Strategic Research Council of Academy of Finland [292 985]","BONUS; Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agriculture Sciences and Spatial Planning (FORMAS)(Swedish Research Council Formas); SmartSea project of the Strategic Research Council of Academy of Finland","This work was part of the projects BONUS Stormwinds and BONUS BIO-C3, funded jointly by BONUS (Art 185) and the Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agriculture Sciences and Spatial Planning (FORMAS, grants no 292 985 and no 219-2013-2041).

These include initiatives aiming to achieve widespread behavioral change towards reduction of greenhouse gas emissions as well as pursuing education regarding adaptation measures. While awareness of the issue of climate change is now pervasive, and actions are being taken at all levels of society, there is still much to do if international goals are to be met. Games and gamification offer one approach to foster both behavioral change and education. In this paper, we investigate the state-of-the-art of game-based climate change engagement through a systematic literature review of 64 research outputs comprising 56 different gamified approaches. Our analysis of the literature reveals a trend of promising findings in this nascent and growing area of research, suggesting the potential to impact multiple engagement dimensions simultaneously, as well as create an engaging gameful experience. Overall, the corpus appears to offer a fruitful balance in foci between climate science, mitigation, and adaptation, as well as a variety of formats in game-based approaches (i.e. digital, analog, and hybrid). However, shortcomings were also observed, such as geographic and demographic imbalances and the short duration of interventions. The reviewed studies yield a large number of results indicating climate change engagement through gamification, especially in the form of cognitive engagement, affect towards climate change-related topics, and in-game behavioral engagement with others. Nevertheless, heterogeneity in terms of contexts, designs, outcomes, and methods, as well as limited rigor in research designs and reporting, hinders drawing overall conclusions. Based on our review, we provide guidelines regarding contexts, interventions, results, and research quality and internal validity for advancing the space of game-based interventions for climate change engagement.","[Fernandez Galeote, Daniel; Legaki, Nikoletta-Zampeta; Hamari, Juho] Tampere Univ, Fac Informat Technol & Commun Sci, Gamificat Grp, Tampere, Finland; [Rajanen, Mikko; Rajanen, Dorina] Univ Oulu, INTERACT Res Unit, Oulu, Finland; [Langley, David J.] Univ Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands; [Langley, David J.] TNO Netherlands Org Appl Sci Res, The Hague, Netherlands",Tampere University; University of Oulu; University of Groningen; Netherlands Organization Applied Science Research,"Galeote, DF (corresponding author), Tampere Univ, Fac Informat Technol & Commun Sci, Gamificat Grp, Tampere, Finland.",daniel.fernandezgaleote@tuni.fi,"Hamari, Juho/E-4989-2016; Rajanen, Mikko/K-8465-2013","Hamari, Juho/0000-0002-6573-588X; Fernandez Galeote, Daniel/0000-0002-5197-146X; Langley, David/0000-0002-7652-8886; Legaki, Nikoletta-Zampeta/0000-0002-2707-8364; Rajanen, Mikko/0000-0002-3281-7029",Finnish Cultural Foundation [00200246]; Nessling Foundation [202100217]; Academy of Finland Flagship Programme (Forest-Human-Machine Interplay (UNITE)) [337653]; European Union [840809],Finnish Cultural Foundation(Finnish Cultural FoundationFinnish IT center for science); Nessling Foundation; Academy of Finland Flagship Programme (Forest-Human-Machine Interplay (UNITE)); European Union(European Commission),"This work was supported by the Finnish Cultural Foundation (Grant Number 00200246), the Nessling Foundation (Project Number 202100217), the Academy of Finland Flagship Programme (337653-Forest-Human-Machine Interplay (UNITE)), and the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program through the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions Individual Fellowship (ID 840809).",,98,4,4,11,37,IOP Publishing Ltd,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1748-9326,,,ENVIRON RES LETT,Environ.

Critically, decadal climate prediction relies on the skill of state-of-the-art climate models to reliably represent these low-frequency climate variations. We undertake a systematic evaluation of the simulation of the IPO in the suite of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5) models. We track the IPO in pre-industrial (control) and all-forcings (historical) experiments using the IPO tripole index (TPI). The TPI is explicitly aligned with the observed spatial pattern of the IPO, and circumvents assumptions about the nature of global warming. We find that many models underestimate the ratio of decadal-to-total variance in sea surface temperatures (SSTs). However, the basin-wide spatial pattern of positive and negative phases of the IPO are simulated reasonably well, with spatial pattern correlation coefficients between observations and models spanning the range 0.4-0.8. Deficiencies are mainly in the extratropical Pacific. Models that better capture the spatial pattern of the IPO also tend to more realistically simulate the ratio of decadal to total variance. Of the 13% of model centuries that have a fractional bias in the decadal-to-total TPI variance of 0.2 or less, 84% also have a spatial pattern correlation coefficient with the observed pattern exceeding 0.5. This result is highly consistent across both IPO positive and negative phases. This is evidence that the IPO is related to one or more inherent dynamical mechanisms of the climate system.","[Henley, Benjamin J.; King, Andrew D.; Karoly, David J.; Freund, Mandy] Univ Melbourne, Sch Earth Sci, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Henley, Benjamin J.; King, Andrew D.; Karoly, David J.; Gallant, Ailie J.

Literatures on corporate giving rationales, concepts of disaster and donor activity in disasters provide an underpinning. The article seeks to make connections between this high profile if short-lived business giving and the funding of the arts that is sought from business; and to draw tentative lessons for arts funding when seeking business support. The giving accounts in the wake of the Tsunami from a non-probability sample 1 of 56 UK companies and 16 non-UK companies were examined. Reported online to the UK charity Business in the Community, these accounts were accessed in February 2005 and scrutinized thematically. Concurrently, company financial profiles to accompany giving figures were constructed. Although linkages between donation levels and financial performance were lacking, emerging themes included the role of employees, influencing company giving and creating a climate of expectation of firms' contributions. These developments may have important implications for business funding for the arts, where leading philanthropists are prominent as individuals in the giving landscapes; but employees' collective involvement is not marked. Alternatively, cultivation of employees as would-be donors, indirectly via their firms, may be a more secure, if lower level route to funding for some arts organizations than dependence on high profile business leaders. The article considers alternative scenarios for company giving in disaster contexts, including as a sustained and lasting giving theme or as company support as a 'one-off ' event, rock-star style. The likely development of employee power as a key element in company giving is explored; and its wider meanings for funding in arts settings, (where the giver as rock star heroine/hero is also prominent) are considered.","[Harrow, Jenny] City Univ London, Cass Business Sch, Voluntary Sect Management, 106 Bunhill Row, London EC1Y 8TZ, England",City University London,"Harrow, J (corresponding author), City Univ London, Cass Business Sch, Voluntary Sect Management, 106 Bunhill Row, London EC1Y 8TZ, England.",j.harrow@city.ac.uk,"Palmer, Paul I/F-7008-2010","Palmer, Paul I/0000-0002-1487-0969",,,,,70,3,4,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0954-8963,1469-3690,,CULT TRENDS,Cult.

The Baltic region has a vast potential for the development of bioeconomy due to the existing opportunities for biomass production and advances in microbiology leading to process- and product innovations in biomass production and utilization. The development of sustainable bioeconomy in the Baltic region, however, requires a flexible and timely adaptation to climate change. Based on an overview of the relevant state-of-the-art literature, the article explores the implications of the development of bioeconomy for the adaptation to and the mitigation of climate change in the Baltic region. The paper elaborates on actions that may facilitate the sustainability of bioeconomy in the region. It concludes that scientific collaboration across borders in the Baltic region can accelerate innovations to successfully adapt bioeconomy to climate change.

A state-of-the-art Support Vector Machine Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM-RFE) algorithm is proposed in this paper for GCM selection. The ranking of GCMs obtained using SVM-RFE was compared to that obtained using entropy-based similarity assessment index known as Symmetrical Uncertainty (SU). The study was conducted in the sub-Himalayan region of Pakistan where a reliable projection of climate is highly significant for water resources management in the entire western part of South Asia. The RF-based regression model was employed to generate a multi-model ensemble (MME) mean of the top-ranked GCMs. The MME mean projection was utilized to estimate the spatiotemporal changes in annual precipitation in comparison with precipitation of 1961-2000 for various representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios. The SVM-RF selected five GCMs (MIROC5, EC-EARTH, CNRM-CM5, BCC-CSM1.1(m) and BCC-CSM1.1) as most suitable for climate change projections in the study area. Obtained results were found to collaborate well with the results of multiple conventional statistical metrics. The MME mean projections revealed precipitation alteration between -1% and 18% during 2020-2059, and 0 and 24% during 2060-2099 for different RCPs. Precipitation was projected to increase up to 20% in the north whereas a decrease up-to -16% in the south.","[Iqbal, Zafar; Shahid, Shamsuddin; Ahmed, Kamal; Ismail, Tarmizi; Khan, Najeebullah] Univ Teknol Malaysia UTM, Sch Civil Engn, Fac Engn, Johor Baharu 81310, Malaysia; [Virk, Zeeshan Tahir] Water Program Leadership Environm & Dev LEAD, Islamabad, Pakistan; [Ahmed, Kamal; Khan, Najeebullah] Lasbela Univ Agr Water & Marine Sci LUAWMS, Fac Water Resource Management, Uthal 90150, Balochistan, Pakistan; [Johar, Waqas] Natl Univ Sci & Technol NUST, NUST Inst Civil Engn, Islamabad, Pakistan",Universiti Teknologi Malaysia; National University of Sciences & Technology - Pakistan,"Iqbal, Z (corresponding author), Univ Teknol Malaysia UTM, Sch Civil Engn, Fac Engn, Johor Baharu 81310, Malaysia.",zafar.thalvi@gmail.com,"SHAHID, SHAMSUDDIN/B-5185-2010; Ismail, Tarmizi/AAO-3422-2020; Iqbal, Zafar/HDM-5923-2022","SHAHID, SHAMSUDDIN/0000-0001-9621-6452; Ismail, Tarmizi/0000-0002-6748-4703; ",Higher Education Commission (HEC) of Pakistan; Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia (FRGS) [R.J130000.7851.5F092],"Higher Education Commission (HEC) of Pakistan(Higher Education Commission of Pakistan); Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia (FRGS)(Ministry of Education, Malaysia)",The authors would like to acknowledge the Higher Education Commission (HEC) of Pakistan and the Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia (FRGS) for providing financial support to conduct this research through grant No R.J130000.7851.5F092.

It finds that funding for energy and climate research remains concentrated within the European Commission, United Kingdom and United States. Climate change adaptation research is the most funded general area, and the specific topics of energy efficiency, climate resilience, and climate information systems, managing climate risks, energy storage, carbon dioxide removal and solar energy are the most funded technologies. There is significant diversity in the disciplines funded, with the social sciences supported almost as much as the engineering and physical sciences and meaningful amounts of funding disbursed to the arts and humanities and the life sciences.

Participants were drawn from Senior Secondary 1-3 students, as well as their teachers, all from secondary schools across the rural and urban geographical divide. Sociographical factors that have considerable effects on awareness of climate change and willingness to adopt pro-environmental behaviour were ascertained using the instrument Awareness of Climate Change and Pro-Environmental Behaviour Willingness Questionnaire (ACCPEBWQ), made up of 44 items on a 4-point Likert type format. A sample of 312 students and 56 teachers was used for the study with descriptive, mean, t test, ANOVA statistics, and correlation techniques employed in data analysis. Gender of students shows a significant difference in awareness of climate change and willingness to embrace pro-environmental behaviour, with male students showing both higher awareness and willingness to engage in pro-environmental behaviour. For teachers, though no significant effects were established for different variables tested in the study, they had a significantly higher awareness of climate change mean scores than students. There was a high positive and significant relationship between the level of awareness of climate change and the level of willingness to adopt pro-environmental behaviour.

Instrumental records demonstrate that the global mean temperature has a significant increasing trend during the 20(th) century and in the latest 50 years the warming become faster. In the meantime, the global sea level has a strong increasing trend, as well as the snow coverage of Northern Hemisphere showed an obvious downward trend. Moreover, the global warming plays a key role in significantly affecting the climate system and social-economy on both global and regional scales, such as sea level rise, melting of mountain glaciers and ice sheets, desertification, deforestation, increase of weather extremes (typhoon, hurricane and rainstorm) and so on.

After conceptualizing Eco-art as an example of a new type of antiprofit-in the sense of agonistic communication, putting existing (unsustainable) power structures and symbolic order into question-we examine the project FOR FOREST, which transformed a local football stadium in Central Europe into a large public art installation, where 300 trees were transplanted over the existing football pitch. The qualitative analysis of (social) media content in the exhibition period, complemented by interviews (N = 15) with central stakeholders, offered insights into three problematizing fields of discourse. With our contribution, we show the potential of Eco-art for sustainability communication in handling dissensus with agonism and its important role in demystifying sustainability by moving from ignorance to resonance.","[Weder, Franzisca] Univ Queensland, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Voci, Denise] Univ Klagenfurt, Klagenfurt, Austria",University of Queensland; University of Klagenfurt,"Weder, F (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",f.weder@uq.edu.au; denise.voci@aau.at,"Voci, Denise/ABC-4823-2021",,,,,,73,1,1,2,5,USC ANNENBERG PRESS,LOS ANGELES,"UNIV SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA, KERCKHOFF HALL, 734 W ADAMS BLVD, MC7725, LOS ANGELES, CA 90089 USA",1932-8036,,,INT J COMMUN-US,Int.

Through relatively high evapotranspiration, they affect surface water and energy exchange with the atmosphere directly influencing the physical climate. Through CH4, CO2 and N2O fluxes, they regulate the biogeochemical cycles, indirectly influencing the physical climate. However, current models do not explicitly include the water table, present under all large and stable wetlands; model wetlands are identified as flat land with wet soil resulting from precipitation events. That is, the wetlands are only 'wetted' from above but not from below by the high water table. Furthermore, without the knowledge of the water table position, estimates of CH4 and other gases (e.g., CO2 and N2O) are poorly constrained. We present a simple hydrologic framework for simulating wetlands based on water table depth. A synthesis of hydrologic controls on wetlands highlights the key role that groundwater plays. It directly feeds wetlands, supports surface-water fed wetlands by maintaining a saturated substrate, and links land drainage to sea level by impeding drainage in lowlands. Forced by routine climate model output (precipitation-evapotranspiration-surface runoff), land topography, and sea level, we simulate the present-day water table in North America at the 1 km scale. We validate the simulation with water table observations and compare regions of shallow water table to mapped wetlands. Our results show that the framework captures the salient features of wetland distribution and extent at regional and continental scales, a direct result of large-scale groundwater convergence that nourishes the lowlands even in arid climates. The low requirement of forcing and computation make the framework easy to adopt in climate and earth system models for simulating wetland responses to climate and sea level change for the present, paleo reconstructions, and future projections.","[Fan, Ying] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, New Brunswick, NJ 08854 USA; [Miguez-Macho, Gonzalo] Univ Santiago de Compostela, Nonlinear Phys Grp, Galicia 15782, Spain",Rutgers State University New Brunswick; Universidade de Santiago de Compostela,"Fan, Y (corresponding author), Rutgers State Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, New Brunswick, NJ 08854 USA.",yingfan@rci.rutgers.edu; gonzalo@fmares.usc.es,"Miguez-Macho, Gonzalo/AAA-3295-2019; Miguez-Macho, Gonzalo/K-7008-2017","Miguez-Macho, Gonzalo/0000-0002-4259-7883; Miguez-Macho, Gonzalo/0000-0002-4259-7883; Fan, Ying/0000-0002-0024-7965","US National Science Foundation; Spanish Ministry of Education and Science; Rutgers University; supercomputer center (Centro de Supercomputacion de Galicia, CESGA) at Santiago de Compostela, Galicia, Spain","US National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Spanish Ministry of Education and Science(Spanish Government); Rutgers University; supercomputer center (Centro de Supercomputacion de Galicia, CESGA) at Santiago de Compostela, Galicia, Spain","This work is supported by the US National Science Foundation, Ramon y Cajal program of the Spanish Ministry of Education and Science, Rutgers University Academic Excellence Fund, and the supercomputer center (Centro de Supercomputacion de Galicia, CESGA) at Santiago de Compostela, Galicia, Spain.

Uncertain model parameters are typically calibrated in order to increase the agreement of the model with available observations. The common practice is to adjust uncertain model parameters manually, often referred to as expert tuning, which lacks objectivity and transparency in the use of observations. These shortcomings often haze model inter-comparisons and hinder the implementation of new model parameterizations. Methods which would allow to systematically calibrate model parameters are unfortunately often not applicable to state-of-the-art climate models, due to computational constraints facing the high dimensionality and non-linearity of the problem. Here we present an approach to objectively calibrate a regional climate model, using reanalysis driven simulations and building upon a quadratic metamodel presented by Neelin et al. (2010) that serves as a computationally cheap surrogate of the model. Five model parameters originating from different parameterizations are selected for the optimization according to their influence on the model performance. The metamodel accurately estimates spatial averages of 2 m temperature, precipitation and total cloud cover, with an uncertainty of similar magnitude as the internal variability of the regional climate model. The non-linearities of the parameter perturbations are well captured, such that only a limited number of 20-50 simulations are needed to estimate optimal parameter settings. Parameter interactions are small, which allows to further reduce the number of simulations. In comparison to an ensemble of the same model which has undergone expert tuning, the calibration yields similar optimal model configurations, but leading to an additional reduction of the model error. The performance range captured is much wider than sampled with the expert-tuned ensemble and the presented methodology is effective and objective. It is argued that objective calibration is an attractive tool and could become standard procedure after introducing new model implementations, or after a spatial transfer of a regional climate model. Objective calibration of parameterizations with regional models could also serve as a strategy toward improving parameterization packages of global climate models. Citation: Bellprat, O., S.

Constructionist science studies have put forward the concept of 'co-production' to understand how knowledge claims become stable, authoritative, get institutionalised and reorder science and society. Moreover, knowledge and structures of power are co-evolutionary. Exercises in constructing futures are interesting practices where what is and what ought are enmeshed, and where knowledge claims may in turn be performative for societal reordering. This article presents a conceptual framework to understand the transformation of knowledge claims about the future in more analytical detail. Five concepts are suggested to aid the analysis of transformations: reduction, extension, rhetorical packaging, modification and redefinition. This conceptual framework is used to present a qualitative, in-depth study about the transformation of the volatile issue of urban warming in the face of climate change in the Netherlands, and the related knowledge claims on the future of this issue. As this case makes clear, the constant erosion of legitimacy for urban warming as a matter of collective concern is important to understand the transformation of knowledge claims. Also, the context and organisational embedding in which the projects originated had direct consequences for the construction of relevant knowledge on future urban warming. Moreover, the pre-existing methodologies science brings to the production of knowledge functioned as important templates which transformed the issue of urban warming. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper explains how continual processing of ambient relative humidity (RH) data monitored in museums or historical buildings is used to assess quantitatively the climate-induced physical damage risk to art objects. The software continually decomposes RH data into a set of elementary sinusoidal RH fluctuations using discrete Fourier transform. The user needs to provide basic characterisation of objects in the collection. Then each elementary sinusoidal RH fluctuation is transformed, using the precalculated database, into an elementary strain fluctuation experienced by the object. The complete strain history is calculated by the superposition of all elementary strain fluctuations. The risk of damage can be assessed by comparing strain against a critical level selected-the damage criterion. Wooden panels have been selected to illustrate the approach, and its reliability was demonstrated by comparison with the strain versus time histories obtained by full finite element modelling. The proposed approach based on the analysis of moisture response of objects is significant progress to current practices of evaluating climate parameters themselves.","[Kupczak, Arkadiusz; Bratasz, Lukasz; Kozlowski, Roman] Polish Acad Sci, Jerzy Haber Inst Catalysis & Surface Chem, Niezapominajek 8, PL-30239 Krakow, Poland; [Jedrychowski, Mariusz] Natl Museum Krakow, Krakow, Poland; [Lukomski, Michal] Getty Conservat Inst, Los Angeles, CA USA",Polish Academy of Sciences; Jerzy Haber Institute of Catalysis & Surface Chemistry,"Kupczak, A (corresponding author), Polish Acad Sci, Jerzy Haber Inst Catalysis & Surface Chem, Niezapominajek 8, PL-30239 Krakow, Poland.",nckupcza@cyf-kr.edu.pl,,"Bratasz, Lukasz/0000-0002-5277-2606; Kupczak, Arkadiusz/0000-0001-8702-6307","Getty Conservation Institute; Narodowe Centrum Badan i Rozwoju [PBS2/A9/24/2013]; Jerzy Haber Institute of Catalysis and Surface Chemistry, Polish Academy of Sciences","Getty Conservation Institute; Narodowe Centrum Badan i Rozwoju(National Centre for Research & Development, Poland); Jerzy Haber Institute of Catalysis and Surface Chemistry, Polish Academy of Sciences","Getty Conservation Institute, Grant/Award Number: Managing Collection Environments Initiative; Narodowe Centrum Badan i Rozwoju, Grant/Award Number: PBS2/A9/24/2013; Jerzy Haber Institute of Catalysis and Surface Chemistry, Polish Academy of Sciences, Grant/Award Number: Statutory research fund",,18,1,1,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0039-2103,1475-1305,,STRAIN,Strain,APR,2019,2,,SI,,,,e12311,10.1111/str.12311,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/str.12311,,,12,"Materials Science, Characterization & Testing",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Materials Science,HP1MJ,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000461430700002,View Full Record in Web of Science

One hundred articles of particular interest for Nordic climates were retrieved and their findings summarized. It is found that the vast majority of green roof research has been conducted on a theoretical basis, or with practical measurements on green roof test beds or isolated components. There is scarcely any literature on the operation of full-scale, building-implemented green roofs, and no articles were found on the building technical performance of aged green roofs.

Important climate indices such as the El Nino Southern Oscillation Index (ENSO) or the North Atlantic Oscillation Index (NAO) are usually derived by evaluating scalar fields at fixed locations or regions where these extremal values occur most frequently today. However, under climate change, dynamic circulation changes are likely to cause shifts in the intensity, frequency and location of underlying physical phenomena. In case of the NAO for instance, climatologists are interested in the position and intensity of the Icelandic Low and the Azores High as their interplay strongly influences the European climate, especially during the winter season. To robustly extract and track such highly variable features without a-priori region information, we present a topology-based method for dynamic extraction of such uncertain critical points on a global scale. The system additionally integrates techniques to visualize the variability within the ensemble and correlations between features. To demonstrate the utility of our VTK+TTK-based software framework, we explore a 150-year climate projection consisting of 100 ensemble members and particularly concentrate on sea level pressure fields.

Due to its natural and strategic situation, Tabriz has always been in the attention of governments throughout history; travellers and tourists have mentioned Tabriz as a city that has beautiful gardens. But, the earthquakes and wars have left no remains of those beautiful gardens. This investigation, by a comparative study of the climates in Iran and the effect of those climates on the formation of gardens and garden design, tries to identify the features and characteristics of gardens in cold and dry climate. The method of study is interpretive-historical on the basis of written documents and historic features and field study of existing gardens in this climate. The results show that, with respect to natural substrate, vegetation, the form of water supply, and the general form of the garden; gardens in dry and cold climate are different from gardens in other climates.","[Ebrahimi, Ahad Nejad; Nazarzadeh, Farnaz; Nazarzadeh, Elnaz] Tabriz Islamic Art Univ, Tabriz, Iran",,"Ebrahimi, AN (corresponding author), Tabriz Islamic Art Univ, Tabriz, Iran.",Ebrahimiahad@gmail.com,"Ebrahimi, Ahad Nejad/G-8559-2018","Ebrahimi, Ahad Nejad/0000-0001-6025-1942",,,,,36,0,0,0,4,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",2631-6862,1938-7806,,ARCHNET-IJAR,Archnet-IJAR,NOV,2016,3,,,,193,212,,,,,,20,Architecture,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Architecture,EF8EK,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000390561400011,View Full Record in Web of Science

(Clim Res 54(3): 197-207, 2010. doi: 10.3354/cr01117g) reported a significant decreasing trend of snowfall occurrence in the Northern Iberian Peninsula since the mid 70s. The study was based on observations of annual snowfall frequency (measured as the annual number of snowfall days NSD) from a network of 33 stations ranging from 60 to 1350 m. In the present work we analyze the skill of Regional Climate Models (RCMs) to reproduce this trend for the period 1961-2000 (using both reanalysis- and historical GCM-driven boundary conditions) and the trend and the associated uncertainty of the regional future projections obtained under the A1B scenario for the first half of the twenty-first century. In particular, we consider the regional simulation dataset from the EU-funded ENSEMBLES project, consisting of thirteen state-of-the-art RCMs run at 25 km resolution over Europe. While ERA40 severely underestimates both the mean NSD and its observed trend (-2.2 days/decade), the corresponding RCM simulations driven by the reanalysis appropriately capture the interannual variability and trends of the observed NSD (trends ranging from -3.4 to -0.7, -2.1 days/decade for the ensemble mean). The results driven by the GCM historical runs are quite variable, with trends ranging from -8.5 to 0.2 days/decade (-1.5 days/decade for the ensemble mean), and the greatest uncertainty by far being associated with the particular GCM used. Finally, the trends for the future 2011-2050 A1B runs are more consistent and significant, ranging in this case from -3.7 to -0.5 days/decade (-2.0 days/decade for the ensemble mean), indicating a future significant decreasing trend. These trends are mainly determined by the increasing temperatures, as indicated by the interannual correlation between temperature and NSD (-0.63 in the observations), which is preserved in both ERA40- and GCM-driven simulations.","[Pons, M.

Five Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) General Circulation Models (GCMs) using three different Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) have been downscaled with the coupled atmosphere-ice-ocean model RCA4-NEMO. Validation of sea surface temperature (SST) against different datasets suggests that the model results are well within the spread of observational datasets. The ensemble mean SST with a bias of less than 1 C is the solution that fits the observations best and underlines the importance of ensemble modeling. The exchange of momentum, heat, and freshwater between atmosphere and ocean in the regional, coupled model compares well with available datasets. The climatological seasonal cycles of these fluxes are within the 95% confidence limits of the datasets. Towards the end of the 21st century the projected North Sea SST increases by 1.5 C (RCP 4.5), and 4 C (RCP 8.5), respectively. Under this change the North Sea develops a specific pattern of the climate change signal for the air-sea temperature difference and latent heat flux in the RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios. In the RCP 8.5 scenario the amplitude of the spatial heat flux anomaly increases to 5 W/m at the end of the century. Different hypotheses are discussed that could contribute to the spatially non-uniform change in air-sea interaction. The most likely cause for an increased latent heat loss in the central western North Sea is a drier atmosphere towards the end of the century. Drier air in the lee of the British Isles affects the balance of the surface heat budget of the North Sea. This effect is an example of how regional characteristics modulate global climate change. For climate change projections on regional scales it is important to resolve processes and feedbacks at regional scales.","[Dieterich, Christian; Wang, Shiyu; Schimanke, Semjon; Groger, Matthias; Hordoir, Robinson; Samuelsson, Patrick; Liu, Ye; Axell, Lars; Hoglund, Anders; Meier, H.

Hydrogen is an indirect climate gas which induces perturbations of methane, ozone, and stratospheric water vapour, three potent greenhouse gases. Using data from a state-of-the-art global numerical model, here we calculate the hydrogen climate metrics as a function of the considered time-horizon and derive a 100-year Global Warming Potential of 12.8 +/- 5.2 and a 20-year Global Warming Potential of 40.1 +/- 24.1. The considered scenarios for a future hydrogen transition show that a green hydrogen economy is beneficial in terms of mitigated carbon dioxide emissions for all policy-relevant time-horizons and leakage rates. In contrast, the carbon dioxide and methane emissions associated with blue hydrogen reduce the benefit of a hydrogen economy and lead to a climate penalty at high leakage rate or blue hydrogen share. The leakage rate and the hydrogen production pathways are key leverages to reach a clear climate benefit from a large-scale transition to a hydrogen economy. Transitioning to a hydrogen economy has the potential to mitigate carbon dioxide emissions. The hydrogen leakage rate and the production pathways appear, based on simulations with a global model, as key leverages to reach a clear climate benefit from a large-scale transition to a hydrogen economy.","[Hauglustaine, Didier] Univ Paris Saclay, Lab Sci Climat & Environm LSCE, CEA CNRS UVSQ, Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Paulot, Fabien] NOAA, Geophys Fluid Dynam Lab, Princeton, NJ USA; [Collins, William] Univ Reading, Dept Meteorol, Reading, Berks, England; [Derwent, Richard] rdscientific, Newbury, Berks, England; [Sand, Maria] Ctr Int Climate & Environm Res Oslo CICERO, Oslo, Norway; [Boucher, Olivier] Inst Pierre Simon Laplace IPSL, Paris, France",UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; CEA; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Reading; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Cite,"Hauglustaine, D (corresponding author), Univ Paris Saclay, Lab Sci Climat & Environm LSCE, CEA CNRS UVSQ, Gif Sur Yvette, France.",didier.hauglustaine@lsce.ipsl.fr,,"Paulot, Fabien/0000-0001-7534-4922",Research Council of Norway [320240]; Direction Generale de l'Aviation Civile (DGAC) [2021-39],Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway); Direction Generale de l'Aviation Civile (DGAC),"The authors would like to thank the three anonymous reviewers for their insightful comments which improved the manuscript.

With growing international pressure to curb global emissions through the 2015 Paris Agreement and mounting climate change-related losses in agriculture, countries are in need of an increasingly robust agricultural policy framework. This paper takes an in-depth look at the agricultural sector in Viet Nam, contributing to a better understanding of the main bottlenecks in implementing the Paris Agreement, evaluating the relevance and impact of selected barriers for the implementation of current climate policies and their implications for nationally determined contribution (NDC) design. To address these questions, an exploratory mixed method approach was employed: (i) identifying and mapping key policies, (ii) reviewing global literature sources on barriers, (iii) conducting stakeholder interviews (n = 25), and (iv) follow-up quantitative surveys (n = 16). The interviews revealed numerous barriers within Viet Nam's institutional setting that acted to impede the creation and implementation of climate policy. As seen in other countries, insufficient inter-ministry collaboration and information sharing restricted the overall success of climate policy, with poor representation of non-lead ministries in drafting and inadequate channels for bottom-up engagement also considered major constraints. These coupled with gaps in financing make for fragmented policies that often lack clear implementation guidelines, particularly at a local level. The NDC process presents an opportunity for Viet Nam to coordinate their cross-sector climate response around a single international agreement, facilitating greater inter-ministry information and data sharing, while utilizing the technical and financial support provided through international partners to build capacity in this vital area.","[Giles, James; Grosjean, Godefroy; Le Coq, Jean-Francois; Bui, Vinh Le; Laderach, Peter] Int Ctr Trop Agr, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Giles, James; Grosjean, Godefroy; Le Coq, Jean-Francois; Bui, Vinh Le; Laderach, Peter] CGIAR Res Program Climate Change Agr & Food Secur, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Le Coq, Jean-Francois] Univ Perpignan Domitian, Univ Montpellier 3, French Agr Res Ctr Int Dev CIRAD, UMR ART DEV,CNRS, Montpellier, France; [Huber, Bernhard] Deutsch Gesell Int Zusammenarbeit GmbH, Bonn, Germany; [Bui, Vinh Le] Vietnam Natl Univ Agr, Fac Land Management, Dept Land Adm, Hanoi, Vietnam",Alliance; International Center for Tropical Agriculture - CIAT; CGIAR; AgroParisTech; CIRAD; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Paul-Valery; Universite Perpignan Via Domitia; Universite de Montpellier; Vietnam National University of Agriculture (VNUA),"Giles, J (corresponding author), Int Ctr Trop Agr, Hanoi, Vietnam.;Giles, J (corresponding author), CGIAR Res Program Climate Change Agr & Food Secur, Wageningen, Netherlands.",j.giles@cgiar.org,,,CGIAR Fund; German development cooperation; Centre for International Migration and Development (CIM) of GIZ; Centre for International Migration and Development (CIM) of German Federal Employment Agency; German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development; Tropical Agriculture Association Award Fund (TAAF),CGIAR Fund(CGIAR); German development cooperation; Centre for International Migration and Development (CIM) of GIZ; Centre for International Migration and Development (CIM) of German Federal Employment Agency; German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development; Tropical Agriculture Association Award Fund (TAAF),"This work was implemented as part of the CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS), which is carried out with support from CGIAR Fund Donors and through bilateral funding agreements.

Of particular interest is the Athabasca River basin, a highly biologically productive basin that includes one of the largest boreal freshwater inland river deltas in the world and serves as habitat for many fish species. Earlier melt events, higher winter and spring flows and lower summer flows are expected as a consequence of climate change in this basin. Here, we model changes in river flow and water temperature under changing climate scenarios through the integration of a physically-based semi-distributed hydrological model and a 1D stream water temperature model forced by climate change scenarios. The modeled changes in streamflow and water temperature are used to predict changes in habitat suitability for the Athabasca Rainbow Trout (ART) (Oncorhynchus mykiss), a unique ecotype of trout considered as a 'species at risk'. The results indicate that future flow decreases in most of the basin can lead to reduced flow velocities and water depths making current ART habitat suboptimal. Also, warming low-land habitats and increasing water temperatures will increase metabolic rates and stress fish forcing them to migrate upstream to cooler waters confining their habitat range.","[Morales-Marin, L.

The simulated climate reproduces the general large-scale circulation in the atmosphere reasonably well, except for a positive bias in the high latitude sea level pressure distribution. Also, by introducing an updated turbulence scheme in the atmosphere model a persistent cold bias has been eliminated. For the ocean part, the model drifts in sea surface temperatures and salinities are considerably reduced compared to earlier versions of BCM. Improved conservation properties in the ocean model have contributed to this. Furthermore, by choosing a reference pressure at 2000 m and including thermobaric effects in the ocean model, a more realistic meridional overturning circulation is simulated in the Atlantic Ocean. The simulated sea-ice extent in the Northern Hemisphere is in general agreement with observational data except for summer where the extent is somewhat underestimated. In the Southern Hemisphere, large negative biases are found in the simulated sea-ice extent. This is partly related to problems with the mixed layer parametrization, causing the mixed layer in the Southern Ocean to be too deep, which in turn makes it hard to maintain a realistic sea-ice cover here. However, despite some problematic issues, the pre-industrial control simulation presented here should still be appropriate for climate change studies requiring multi-century simulations.","[Ottera, O.

In this cross-sectional study, the stages of change from the Transtheoretical Model (TTM) are applied to environmentally-significant behavior. We develop and test a new scale - the Climate Change Stages of Change Questionnaire (CCSOCQ) - for measuring five discrete stages involved in changing behavior to address climate change (precontemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, and maintenance). In total, 3,469 middle-school students (M-age = 13.4) and 347 schoolteachers completed the CCSOCQ and a measure of engagement with sustainable development. Analyses indicated the CCSOCQ captured the five stages outlined by the TTM and had adequate psychometric properties. Further supporting predictions of the TTM, engagement with sustainable development was lowest in the precontemplation stage and highest in the action stage. We conclude the TTM has potential for describing how and why people alter their behavior to address climate change.

By solving an optimal control problem for a nonlinear, time-varying system, IAMs enable the determination of economically optimal pathways for emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2). Central to any IAM is a climate model capturing the dynamic response of global surface temperature to changes in net downward radiative forcing due to the atmospheric accumulation of heat-trapping greenhouse gases. The transient climate response (TCR), defined as the temperature change at the time of CO2 doubling under a scenario in which CO2 concentrations increase by 1 % y r(-1), plays a central role in quantifying the economic impacts of climate change on policy-relevant timescales. In this paper, we propose an optimization-based methodology for computing the parameters of a climate model in such a way that the resulting model exhibits a specified TCR. The methodology developed in this paper targets the climate model parameterization employed in DICE (Dynamic Integrated model of Climate and the Economy), a widely-studied IAM for which TCR is only indirectly specified. Results reported herein enable policymakers using DICE to compute optimal CO2 emissions pathways which directly reflect the TCR of state-of-the-art climate models documented in the most recent (Fifth) Assessment Report (AR5) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).","[Hafeez, Salman; Weller, Steven R.; Kellett, Christopher M.] Univ Newcastle, Sch Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia",University of Newcastle,"Hafeez, S (corresponding author), Univ Newcastle, Sch Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia.",salman.hafeez@uon.edu.au; steven.weller@newcastle.edu.au; chris.kellett@newcastle.edu.au,"Kellett, Christopher M/C-1815-2008","Kellett, Christopher M/0000-0002-8309-6807",,,,,32,4,4,1,3,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-1-9221-0790-9,,,,2016,,,,,282,287,,,,,,6,Automation & Control Systems,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Automation & Control Systems,BH5WB,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000401523200053,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, whether or not it can also be improved by the direct use of a state-of-the-art GCM with very fine resolution, close to that of an RCM, and, if so, which is the better approach, are open questions. These questions are important for understanding and using these two kinds of simulation approaches, but have not yet been investigated. Accordingly, the present reported work compared simulation results over China from a very-fine-resolution GCM (VFRGCM) and from RCM dynamical downscaling. The results showed that: (1) The VFRGCM reproduces the climatologies and trends of both air temperature and precipitation, as well as inter-monthly variations of air temperature in terms of spatial pattern and amount, closer to observations than the coarse-resolution version of the GCM. This is not the case, however, for the inter-monthly variations of precipitation. (2) The VFRGCM captures the climatology, trend, and inter-monthly variation of air temperature, as well as the trend in precipitation, more reasonably than the RCM dynamical downscaling method. (3) The RCM dynamical downscaling method performs better than the VFRGCM in terms of the climatology and inter-monthly variation of precipitation. Overall, the results suggest that VFRGCMs possess great potential with regard to their application in climate simulation in the future, and the RCM dynamical downscaling method is still dominant in terms of regional precipitation simulation.","[Guo, Donglin; Wang, Huijun] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Nansen Zhu Int Res Ctr, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Wang, Huijun] Chinese Acad Sci, Climate Change Res Ctr, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Wang, Huijun] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteoro, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology","Guo, DL (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Nansen Zhu Int Res Ctr, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.",guodl@mail.iap.ac.cn,"Donglin, Guo/F-2514-2014",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [41130103, 41421004, 41405087]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This research was jointly supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 41130103, 41421004 and 41405087).

To this end, the research activity has given answer to a need for a contextualization of the urban phenomena and the state of the art on sustainable development and climate proof urban resilience, pointing out the French context as an emblematic scope of study through a literature review of European best practices of eco-district. In consistency with this research framework, the study has developed a case study analysis, focusing on the description and evaluation of four best practices of French EcoQuartiers. The methodology adopted has selected with an inductive method the mitigation and adaptation strategies developed in the implementation of the French emblematic eco-quartiers, combining the official sources of the projects with on-site visits and surveys in order to define an experimental proposal of a grid of methodological-operational references relating to eco-districts. Furthermore, the discussion points out the potentials and limits of the proposed framework, related on the one hand to the quality, innovation, integration, and dissemination of the design solutions, and on the other hand to the economic and social costs of the EcoQuartiers that find a synthesis in the concept of greentrification.

Changes in land management are one way to adapt to future climatic conditions, including land-use changes and local adjustments of agricultural practices. In previous studies, options for adaptation have mostly been explored by testing alternative scenarios. Systematic explorations of land management possibilities using optimization approaches were so far mainly restricted to studies of land and resource management under constant climatic conditions. In this study, we bridge this gap and exploit the benefits of multi-objective regional optimization for identifying optimum land management adaptations to climate change. We design a multi-objective optimization routine that integrates a generic crop model and considers two climate scenarios for 2050 in a meso-scale catchment on the Swiss Central Plateau with already limited water resources. The results indicate that adaptation will be necessary in the study area to cope with a decrease in productivity by 0-10 %, an increase in soil loss by 25-35 %, and an increase in N-leaching by 30-45 %. Adaptation options identified here exhibit conflicts between productivity and environmental goals, but compromises are possible. Necessary management changes include (i) adjustments of crop shares, i.e. increasing the proportion of early harvested winter cereals at the expense of irrigated spring crops, (ii) widespread use of reduced tillage, (iii) allocation of irrigated areas to soils with low water-retention capacity at lower elevations, and (iv) conversion of some pre-alpine grasslands to croplands.","[Klein, Tommy; Holzkaemper, Annelie; Calanca, Pierluigi; Fuhrer, Juerg] Air Pollut & Climate Grp, Agroscope Res Stn Reckenholz Tanikon ART, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland; [Klein, Tommy; Holzkaemper, Annelie; Calanca, Pierluigi; Fuhrer, Juerg] Univ Bern, Oeschger Ctr Climate Change Res, Bern, Switzerland; [Klein, Tommy] Climate Corp, San Francisco, CA 94103 USA; [Seppelt, Ralf] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Computat Landscape Ecol, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany",Swiss Federal Research Station Agroscope; University of Bern; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ),"Klein, T (corresponding author), Air Pollut & Climate Grp, Agroscope Res Stn Reckenholz Tanikon ART, Reckenholzstr 191, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland.",tommy.klein@alumni.ulg.ac.be,"Seppelt, Ralf/E-6056-2010","Seppelt, Ralf/0000-0002-2723-7150; Calanca, Pierluigi/0000-0003-3113-2885",Swiss National Foundation [406140_125957/1],Swiss National Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),This work is part of the AGWAM project (No. 406140_125957/1) financed by the Swiss National Foundation in the framework of the National Research Program 61.,,91,49,52,0,79,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-2973,1572-9761,,LANDSCAPE ECOL,Landsc.

Our analysis suggests that the negotiation process resulted in collective decisions for more collaborative adaptation measures than could be expected from individual preferences previous to the planning session. Based on the results, it is plausible that the provided information enhanced integrative agreements by leading stakeholders to realize that they were mutually interdependent, both in acquiring individual benefits as well as in implementing the measures at the landscape level.

Urban climate services require multi-disciplinary and multi-sectorial approaches and new paradigms in urban climate modelling. This paper classifies the required urban input data for both mesoscale state-of-the-art Urban Canopy Models (UCMs) and microscale Obstacle Resolving Models (ORM) into five categories and reviews the ways in which they can be obtained. The first two categories are (1) land cover, and (2) building morphology. These govern the main interactions between the city and the urban climate and the Urban Heat Island. Interdependence between morphological parameters and UCM geometric hypotheses are discussed. Building height, plan and wall area densities are recommended as the main input variables for UCMs, whereas ORMs require 3D building data. Recently, three other categories of urban data became relevant for finer urban studies and adaptation to climate change: (3) building design and architecture, (4) building use, anthropogenic heat and socio-economic data, and (5) urban vegetation data. Several methods for acquiring spatial information are reviewed, including remote sensing, geographic information system (GIS) processing from administrative cadasters, expert knowledge and crowdsourcing. Data availability, data harmonization, costs/efficiency tradeoffs and future challenges are then discussed.","[Masson, Valery; de Munck, Cecile; Lemonsu, Aude; Schoetter, Robert] Univ Toulouse, Meteo France, CNRS, CNRM, Toulouse, France; [Heldens, Wieke; Esch, Thomas; Zeidler, Julian] German Remote Sensing Data Ctr Land Surface, DLR, Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany; [Bocher, Erwan; Petit, Gwendall] CNRS, Lab STICC, Vannes, France; [Bonhomme, Marion; Tornay, Nathalie] Res Lab Architecture, Toulouse, France; [Bucher, Benedicte] Univ Paris Est, LaSTIG, IGN, St Mande, France; [Burmeister, Cornelia; Pavlik, Dirk] GEO NET Umweltconsulting GmbH, Dresden, Germany; [Hidalgo, Julia] Natl Ctr Sci Res CNRS, LISST Lab, Toulouse, France; [Kanani-Suehring, Farah; Maronga, Bjoern] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Hannover, Germany; [Kwok, Yu-Ting] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Levy, Jean-Pierre] LATTS, Paris, France; [See, Linda] IIASA, Laxenburg, Austria; [Votsis, Athanasios] Finnish Meteorol Inst, Helsinki, Finland",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Meteo France; Universite de Toulouse; Helmholtz Association; German Aerospace Centre (DLR); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Gustave-Eiffel; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Leibniz University Hannover; Chinese University of Hong Kong; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Ecole des Ponts ParisTech; Universite Gustave-Eiffel; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); Finnish Meteorological Institute,"Masson, V (corresponding author), Univ Toulouse, Meteo France, CNRS, CNRM, Toulouse, France.",valery.masson@meteo.fr,"Votsis, Athanasios/AAB-1817-2021; Kwok, Yu Ting/ABD-7450-2020","Kwok, Yu Ting/0000-0002-3612-748X; Hidalgo, Julia/0000-0002-1764-0536; Votsis, Athanasios/0000-0001-5878-7684",German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) [01LP1601]; FP7 [617754]; French National Agency of Research through the project applied Modelling and urbAn Planning laws: Urban Climate and Energy (MApUCE) [ANR-13-VBDU-0004]; European Union [690462],German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); FP7; French National Agency of Research through the project applied Modelling and urbAn Planning laws: Urban Climate and Energy (MApUCE); European Union(European Commission),"Coauthors Burmeister, Esch, Heldens, Kanani-Suhring, Maronga, Pavlik and Zeidler express their gratitude to the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) for funding grant 01LP1601 within the framework of Research for Sustainable Development (FONA; www.fona.de).Coauthor See would like to acknowledge the support of the FP7-funded ERC project CrowdLand (Grant no 617754).

An appropriate representation of soil moisture dynamics in global climate models is therefore important. Recently, a first multidecadal, observation-based soil moisture dataset has become available that provides information on soil moisture dynamics from satellite observations (ECVSM, essential climate variable soil moisture). The present study investigates the potential and limitations of this new dataset for several applications in climate model evaluation. We compare soil moisture data from satellite observations, reanalysis and simulations from a state-of-the-art land surface model and analyze relationships between soil moisture and precipitation anomalies in the different dataset. Other potential applications like model parameter optimization or model initialization are not investigated in the present study. In a detailed regional study, we show that ECVSM is capable to capture well the interannual and intraannual soil moisture and precipitation dynamics in the Sahelian region.

Together with changing consumption pattern, population growth will lead to increasing food demand. The question arises whether or not the Earth is capable of fulfilling this demand. In this study, we approach this question by estimating the carrying capacity of current agricultural systems (K-C), which does not measure the maximum number of people the Earth is likely to feed in the future, but rather allows for an indirect assessment of the increases in agricultural productivity required to meet demands. We project agricultural food production under progressing climate change using the state-of-the-art dynamic global vegetation model LPJmL, and input data of 3 climate models. For 1990 to 2100 the worldwide annual caloric yield of the most important 11 crop types is simulated. Model runs with and without elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations are performed in order to investigate CO2 fertilization effects. Country-specific per-capita caloric demands fixed at current levels and changing demands based on future GDP projections are considered to assess the role of future dietary shifts. Our results indicate that current population projections may considerably exceed the maximum number of people that can be fed globally if climate change is not accompanied by significant changes in land use, agricultural efficiencies and/or consumption pathways. We estimate the gap between projected population size and K-C to reach 2 to 6.8 billion people by 2100. We also present possible caloric self-supply changes between 2000 and 2100 for all countries included in this study. The results show that predominantly developing countries in tropical and subtropical regions will experience vast decreases of self-supply. Therefore, this study is important for planning future large-scale agricultural management, as well as the critical assessment of population projections, which should take food-mediated climate change feedbacks into account.

At a time when deep changes in society are needed in order to respond to climate change and related sustainability issues, there are calls for greater connectivity between science and society, and for more inclusive and disruptive forms of knowledge creation and engagement. The contention of this paper is that the forces and structures that create a disconnect between science and society must be 'transgressed'. This paper introduces a concept of Transgressive Action Research as a methodological innovation that enables the co-creation of counter hegemonic pathways towards sustainability. Through the method of the Living Spiral Framework, fieldwork reflexions from the Colombian case study of the international T-Learning project were elicited, uncovering and explicating the transgressive learning qualities needed to respond to climate change. As part of a larger action-research project, this paper combines the arts with the social sciences, demonstrating how the concept of 'Transgressive Action Research' can enable co-researchers to engage in disruptive and transformative processes, meeting the need for more radical approaches to addressing the urgent challenges of climate change.","[Macintyre, Thomas; Tassone, Valentina; Wals, Arjen E.

Historical climate data from 1889 to 2008 and 12 GCMs downscaling scenarios were integrated in the tool. Daily climate change data used were based on state-of-the-art statistical downscaling methods which allow for the description of fine scale structures. Development of GIS functionality within CCASAT involves the selection of mapping projection, boundary allocation, interpolation and a graphical display of the spatial data. Several mapping projections and data interpolation were implemented in CCASAT. All interpolation methods were tested using cross validation and users can review these analyses and select the best interpolation method to plot their data. To demonstrate the GIS functionality in CCASAT, the impacts of climate change on wheat flowering in the NSW wheat belt was investigated as a case study. A non-intercepted spherical equation described well the relationship between the semi-variance in changes of annual long-term hot days (d(h), T-max >= 28 degrees C) and the lag-distance. Cross validations showed that ordinary Kriging methods were the best scheme for interpolation of this index. The results showed that the number of hot days in 2050 during the winter crop growing season (1 May-30 November) would increase by up to 28 days, while frost days (T-min <= 2 degrees(C)) would decrease by up to 29 days. Predicted changes in the winter-genotype wheat flowering dates ranged from 5 days later in the northwestern corner and 10 days earlier in south-eastern corner of the NSW wheat belt. Spring-genotype wheat flowering is projected to be earlier by up to 7 days. The delay in the winter-genotype wheat flowering date is due to the delay in the completion of vernalisation in the warmer conditions. The analysis showed that number of frost days at flowering are not projected to change dramatically in the future, however an increase in hot days during wheat flowering is projected to have serious implications. This case study demonstrates that selecting suitable genotype wheat is the key adaptation strategy for the impacts of climate change on wheat cropping. Spring wheat genotypes are likely to become predominate in future climate, while winter genotype will only be viable in areas where sufficient days of cool temperature exist for completion of vernalisation. Breeding strategies should focus on releasing early-sowing genotypes that do not require vernalisation.","[Liu, D.

But just as the earlier critique of fashion seemed finally to have been supplanted, certain basic arguments around dress and makeup nevertheless resurfaced within contemporary feminism. The current neoliberal climate has led to the ever-increasing consumption of fashionable' goods, provoking unease and encouraging the contested protectionist discourse' within feminism to shield young women from just such excesses. Meanwhile, the fashion world itself, arguably more powerful than ever, has across the last twenty years continued a process of legitimising itself through its various modes of alliance with the art world; it has even hijacked elements of feminist practice in the pursuit of publicity. This article suggests that the fashion industry and contemporary feminism are nonetheless alike in one significant respect: neither have properly engaged with the needs of an ageing population. It is an omission that this article will seek to examine through a discussion of the recent portraits of Cindy Sherman, an artist of great interest to feminist scholars, in whose earlier work there was a discernible anti-fashion' element. Now fashionable' herself, a leading figure in the global art world, she has collaborated with the fashion industry in rather different ways. Her portraits' of 2012, in which she reconfigured herself as imaginary Manhattan socialites in or beyond middle age, and a later series, exhibited in 2016, where she appears as a series of ageing, anonymous movie stars', reveal more general ideological tensions surrounding the representation of women, the ageing process and the fashionable ideal. It is the dissection of these tensions that underpin this article, for while Sherman's work has been the subject of academic debate across a forty year period, her use and critique of the fashionable image has not been examined alongside an exploration of the expanding activities of the fashion industry itself; nor have her recent images of ageing women been examined within this more general context.","[Gibson, Pamela Church] Univ Arts, London Coll Fash, London, England",University of Arts London,"Gibson, PC (corresponding author), Univ Arts, London Coll Fash, London, England.",p.church-gibson@fashion.arts.ac.uk,,,,,,,48,1,1,1,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0816-4649,1465-3303,,AUST FEMINIST STUD,Aust.

This dataset contains many missing values, particularly for periods before the mid-twentieth century, although recent years are also incomplete. Here we demonstrate that artificial intelligence can skilfully fill these observational gaps when combined with numerical climate model data. We show that recently developed image inpainting techniques perform accurate monthly reconstructions via transfer learning using either 20CR (Twentieth-Century Reanalysis) or the CMIP5 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5) experiments. The resulting global annual mean temperature time series exhibit high Pearson correlation coefficients (>= 0.9941) and low root mean squared errors (<= 0.0547 degrees C) as compared with the original data. These techniques also provide advantages relative to state-of-the-art kriging interpolation and principal component analysis-based infilling. When applied to HadCRUT4, our method restores a missing spatial pattern of the documented El Nino from July 1877. With respect to the global mean temperature time series, a HadCRUT4 reconstruction by our method points to a cooler nineteenth century, a less apparent hiatus in the twenty-first century, an even warmer 2016 being the warmest year on record and a stronger global trend between 1850 and 2018 relative to previous estimates. We propose image inpainting as an approach to reconstruct missing climate information and thereby reduce uncertainties and biases in climate records. An artificial intelligence-based method may infill gaps in historical temperature data more effectively than conventional techniques. Application of this method reveals a stronger global warming trend between 1850 and 2018 than estimated previously.","[Kadow, Christopher] German Climate Comp Ctr DKRZ, Hamburg, Germany; [Kadow, Christopher; Ulbrich, Uwe] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Meteorol, Berlin, Germany; [Hall, David Matthew] NVIDIA, Santa Clara, CA USA",Free University of Berlin; Nvidia Corporation,"Kadow, C (corresponding author), German Climate Comp Ctr DKRZ, Hamburg, Germany.;Kadow, C (corresponding author), Free Univ Berlin, Inst Meteorol, Berlin, Germany.",kadow@dkrz.de,"Kadow, Christopher/G-2396-2017; Ulbrich, Uwe/A-1070-2014","Kadow, Christopher/0000-0001-6537-3690; Ulbrich, Uwe/0000-0001-7558-6622",,,,,60,37,39,11,66,NATURE PORTFOLIO,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",1752-0894,1752-0908,,NAT GEOSCI,Nat.

It is likely that the depictions of the fan palms were motivated by their importance for the population (food, medicine, construction).

The downscaled meteorological data are used to drive two hydrology models: the Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting model and the variable infiltration capacity model. These two models differ in their spatial resolution, computational time step, and degree and objective of calibration, thus producing significantly different simulations of current and future streamflow. However, the projected percentage changes in monthly streamflows through mid-21st Century generally did not differ, with the exceptions of streamflow during low flow months, and extreme low flows. These findings suggest that for physically based hydrology models applied to snow-dominated basins in Mediterranean climate regimes like the Sierra Nevada, California, model formulation, resolution, and calibration are secondary factors for estimating projected changes in extreme flows (seasonal or daily). For low flows, hydrology model selection and calibration can be significant factors in assessing impacts of projected climate change.","[Maurer, Edwin P.] Santa Clara Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Santa Clara, CA 95053 USA; [Brekke, Levi D.; Pruitt, Tom] Bur Reclamat, Tech Serv Ctr, Denver, CO USA",Santa Clara University,"Maurer, EP (corresponding author), Santa Clara Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Santa Clara, CA 95053 USA.",emaurer@engr.scu.edu,"Maurer, Edwin P/C-7190-2009","Maurer, Edwin P/0000-0001-7134-487X","Office of Science, U.S. Department of Energy","Office of Science, U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE))","We acknowledge the modeling groups, the Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison (PCMDI) and the WCRP's Working Group on Coupled Modelling (WGCM) for their roles in making available the WCRP CMIP3 multi-model dataset.

This distinctive attribute is the unique selling product or tourism product of a particular city. It could be an art form, culture, regional climate, food and festival. Literature indicates that the identity of the entire city would be affected by such tourism products. The purpose of this study is to analyse the influence of the 'image' of an Art-event to city branding. The study also examines the mediating role of 'city attachment' in the relationship between event image and city brand equity. Design/methodology/approach In all, 432 samples have been collected from visitors to one of the biggest contemporary art events in India - the Kochi-Muziris Biennale - 2018, conducted in the city of Cochin, situated in Kerala, the southernmost state of India. Findings Results show that the direct relationship between event image and city brand equity is stronger than the hypothesised path through the mediating role of city attachment. Research limitations/implications This study provides a better understanding of the event image and its importance in creating the host city's brand equity. It contributes to both the practitioners and tourism researchers.

In a federal system of government, there are a multitude of settings within a country to examine the formulation of public policy. As a result, there are opportunities for government bodies to adapt policies created by other government bodies in the same country. Narrative and interpretive methods for policy analysis are used to illustrate the policy process that regulated mixed martial arts in the United States. By analysing three policy contexts, it is demonstrated how the policy discourse evolved over time with the interaction of institutions, legitimations, stakeholders and the sociopolitical climate. By examining the lobbying efforts of the dominant organization seeking to govern the sport, the Ultimate Fighting Championship, it is shown how a sport organization can proactively work with governments rather than resist government involvement in its business.","[Berg, Brennan K.; Chalip, Laurence] Univ Texas Austin, Sport Management Program, Austin, TX 78712 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Berg, BK (corresponding author), Univ Texas Austin, Sport Management Program, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",bkb569@austin.utexas.edu,,,,,,,54,10,10,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1940-6940,1940-6959,,INT J SPORT POLICY P,Int.

In this study, the spatial distribution of diapycnal diffusivity together with its 18.6-yr oscillation estimated from a global tide model is incorporated into a state-of-the-art numerical coupled climate model to investigate its effects on climate variability over the, North Pacific and to understand the underlying physical mechanism. It is shown that a significant sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly with a period of 18.6 years appears in the Kuroshio-Oyashio Extension region; a positive (negative) SST anomaly tends to occur during strong (weak) tidal mixing. This is first induced by anomalous horizontal circulation localized around the Kuril Straits, where enhanced modulation of tidal mixing exists, and then amplified through a positive feedback due to midlatitude air-sea interactions. The resulting SST and sea level pressure variability patterns are reminiscent of those associated with one of the most prominent modes of climate variability in the North Pacific known as the Pacific decadal oscillation, suggesting the potential for improving climate predictability by taking into account the 18.6-yr modulation of tidal mixing.","[Tanaka, Yuki; Yasuda, Ichiro; Hasumi, Hiroyasu; Osafune, Satoshi] Atmosphere & Ocean Res Inst, Kashiwa, Chiba, Japan; [Tatebe, Hiroaki] Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan",Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science & Technology (JAMSTEC),"Tanaka, Y (corresponding author), Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Bunkyo Ku, Hongo 7-3-1, Tokyo 1130033, Japan.",yuki.tanaka@eps.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Osafune, Satoshi/K-4196-2012","Osafune, Satoshi/0000-0002-5042-7729; tatebe, hiroaki/0000-0002-2265-5847","Ministry of Education, Science, Sports and Culture of Japan [KAKENHI 20221002]","Ministry of Education, Science, Sports and Culture of Japan(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT))","The authors express their heartfelt gratitude to three anonymous reviewers for their invaluable comments on the original manuscript.

For twenty years it was based in Wroclaw and since 2007 in Krakow. During that time, an emphasis was placed on various issues which were reflected by the programme and the way it acted. After the analytical and new media period (in the seventies) there was a time of 'elementary photography' (the eighties). However, photography was not the only medium that was exhibited there. Often the expositions, installations and projections were presented according to a programme, such as a series entitled presence among the stones. An important initiative was Photoconferences East-West European exchange that has taken place since 1989. The largest one happened in 1991. It consisted of an international exhibition New spaces of photography and a conference The ethos of photography. A dozen or so years ago Foto-Medium-Art lost its space and it became a mobile gallery, organising exhibitions and meetings in various friendly places. Finally F-M-A settled in Krakow and at this time important questions arouse: how to find a place for the programme developed over the years in the changing cultural climate especially in times when the most widely used media has changed (digital media replaced analogue)? Is any form of continuation possible, when the former economy of means of the art form of photography has been replaced by developed multimedia and multi-layered image structures? It seems that after the media and elementary periods, F.M.A. has entered an era that is in the process of shaping.

The project named Red Apples-Green Apples (RAGA) involved a joint group of facilitators from both countries exploring the topic of climate change and the nature elements (water, air, earth and fire), first with primary school children in Cape Town and then with children in Copenhagen, through the mediums of visual arts and dance. In both countries the children and facilitators were from diverse cultural backgrounds creating potentially rich opportunities for intercultural education alongside learning about the environment through the arts. The project in its pedagogical and structural design of shared artistic experiences enabled meaningful social interaction among the children and facilitators and resulted in enhanced knowledge, understanding and appreciation of self and others. This paper will argue that arts integration educational experiences, such as RAGA, grounded in core principles of 'collaboration', 'creativity', and 'cultural diversity' have the double capacity to enrich children's learning in and through the arts as well as nurture intercultural competences for both learners and teachers in the culturally diverse classroom.","[Wilson, Lisa; Samuel, Gerard M.] Univ Cape Town, Ctr Theatre Dance & Performance Studies, Cape Town, South Africa; [Vedel, Karen A.] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Arts & Cultural Studies, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Nielsen, Charlotte Svendler] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Nutr Exercise & Sports, Copenhagen, Denmark",University of Cape Town; University of Copenhagen; University of Copenhagen,"Wilson, L (corresponding author), Univ Cape Town, Ctr Theatre Dance & Performance Studies, Cape Town, South Africa.",lisa.wilson@uct.ac.za,"Svendler Nielsen, Charlotte/D-7665-2015","Svendler Nielsen, Charlotte/0000-0003-0811-1832; Wilson, Lisa/0000-0003-3775-1476; Samuel, Gerard M./0000-0002-2096-2392","International Network Program, The Danish Agency for Science and Higher Education [513200138B]; Danish Agency for Culture and Palaces; Municipality of Copenhagen's Open School funds","International Network Program, The Danish Agency for Science and Higher Education; Danish Agency for Culture and Palaces; Municipality of Copenhagen's Open School funds","The Red Apples-Green Apples project in 2017 was initiated as part of the network entitled Knowledge Production, Archives and Artistic Research led by Karen Vedel, the Department of Arts and Cultural Studies, University of Copenhagen with funding from the International Network Program, The Danish Agency for Science and Higher Education [grant no. 513200138B].

Although the climate sensitivity of end-use electricity demand is well-established, projecting medium- and long-term future demand remains a significant challenge mostly due to a multitude of uncertainties involved in the modeling process. In this paper, we leveraged a state-of-the-art Bayesian approach to develop rigorously validated regional prediction models of the climate demand nexus conditioned on the intensity level of demand. The prediction models were developed for the residential and commercial sectors for the top eight energy-intensive states in the U.S. A key contribution of this work was to illustrate the asymmetry in the sensitivity of load to climate. More specifically, our results demonstrated a greater sensitivity of the high-intensity end-use demand to climate variability as compared to the moderate-intensity end-use demand. In addition, our results helped identify mean dew point temperature as the key predictor of the climate-sensitive portion of both residential and commercial electricity demands, irrespective of the demand intensity levels. Wind speed was identified as the second most important predictor of the high-intensity (i.e., >= 3rd quartile) end-use demand, while electricity price was found to be the key predictor of the moderate-intensity (i.e., <3rd quartile) end-use demand. The influence of precipitation on the residential and commercial sectors' moderate end-use demand was found to be more variable. Precipitation was found to influence the commercial sector's electricity demand more significantly compared to the residential sector's demand.","[Mukherjee, Sayanti] SUNY Buffalo, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, 411 Bell Hall, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA; [Vineeth, C.

However, the application of this concept in planning and enhancing climate change resilience is negligible in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). This article reviews state-of-the-art research on the potential contribution of peri-urban ecosystem services to climate change resilience in SSA and identifies research gaps for further work. This study was conducted through systematic review of articles from the Web of Science. The literature shows limited knowledge on peri-urban ecosystem services research globally and SSA in particular. The gaps in this knowledge stem from inadequate conceptualization and lack of understanding about how such knowledge can be translated into policy, planning and management and, hence, realizing development goals. In nutshell, the potential for climate change resilience of well-managed peri-urban ecosystem services includes reducing the physical exposure of peri-urban areas to floods and droughts and minimizing climate change risks through increased socio-economic resilience to hazard impacts and provision of the carbon sequestration function. However, specific peri-urban studies describing ecosystem service types and how they can be synchronized into mainstream urban planning and climate change resilience strategies are lacking in most SSA urban regions/landscapes. Therefore, case studies need to be conducted to contextualize and downscale the concept in peri-urban areas and to determine how the concept can be synchronized into broad urban planning and strategies for enhancing resilience to climate change in vulnerable urban and peri-urban communities.","[Mngumi, Lazaro Eliyah] Ardhi Univ, IHSS, POB 35176, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania; [Mngumi, Lazaro Eliyah] Swedish Univ Agr Sci SLU, Fac Nat Resources & Agr Sci, POB 7012, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden",Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences,"Mngumi, LE (corresponding author), Ardhi Univ, IHSS, POB 35176, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania.;Mngumi, LE (corresponding author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci SLU, Fac Nat Resources & Agr Sci, POB 7012, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden.",lazaromngumi@gmail.com,,"Mngumi, Lazaro/0000-0001-8668-4738",Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA),Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA),"Open access funding provided by Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences.

The ultimate aim of the system is represented by four application areas; atmospheric prediction; ocean and coupled ocean-atmosphere climate prediction; state-of-the-art ocean climate assessment; and model validation. Models are presented as the unifying glue for the system, providing a means for exploiting observed information in many different ways as well as a means for processing complicated and diverse data sets into a form which has practical applications. Monitoring, description and prediction require different supporting environments in order to exploit this potential. The overall objective of the system is broken down into a series of goals and sub-goals roughly aligned with surface, upper ocean and deep ocean applications and with modelling and information management requirements. A prioritization of these goals is presented and it is shown that ordered implementation of the elements supporting these goals will lead to a sensible, staged implementation of the observing system. The research, development and exploitation of appropriate technology is emphasised. Trade-offs and rationalisation across the elements of the ocean observing system for climate and between other climate components and ocean modules is central to the development and successful implementation. The design is presented as the first stage in a constantly evolving and maturing ocean observing system for climate applications.","BEDFORD INST OCEANOG,DARTMOUTH,NS,CANADA",Bedford Institute of Oceanography,"Smith, NR (corresponding author), BUR METEOROL RES CTR,MELBOURNE,VIC,AUSTRALIA.",,,,,,,,16,4,4,0,2,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

To predict species responses to climate change we need information not just on their environmental tolerance but also on its adaptive potential. We tested how the foundation species of rocky littoral habitats, Fucus vesiculosus, responds to combined hyposalinity and warming projected to the Baltic Sea by 2070-2099. We quantified responses of replicated populations originating from the entrance, central, and marginal Baltic regions. Using replicated individuals, we tested for the presence of within population tolerance variation. Future conditions hampered growth and survival of the central and marginal populations whereas the entrance populations fared well. Further, both the among- and within-population variation in responses to climate change indicated existence of genetic variation in tolerance. Such standing genetic variation provides the raw material necessary for adaptation to a changing environment, which may eventually ensure the persistence of the species in the inner Baltic Sea.","[Rugiu, Luca; Manninen, Iita; Rothausler, Eva; Jormalainen, Veijo] Univ Turku, Dept Biol, Sect Ecol, FIN-20014 Turku, Finland",University of Turku,"Rugiu, L (corresponding author), Univ Turku, Dept Biol, Sect Ecol, FIN-20014 Turku, Finland.",luca.rugiu@utu.fi,"Jormalainen, Veijo/B-2073-2008","Jormalainen, Veijo/0000-0001-6346-2585; Rothausler, Eva/0000-0002-3185-4290","BONUS BAMBI Project; BONUS - European Union's Seventh Programme for research, technological development and demonstration [Art 185]; BONUS - Academy of Finland [Art 185, 273623]","BONUS BAMBI Project; BONUS - European Union's Seventh Programme for research, technological development and demonstration; BONUS - Academy of Finland","We are grateful to J.

Trophic differences in response to climate change may disrupt ecological interactions and thereby threaten marine ecosystem function. Yet, we still do not have a comprehensive understanding of how different trophic levels respond to climate change stressors in marine ecosystems. By including 1278 experiments, comprising 236 different marine species from 18 different phyla in a meta-analysis of studies measuring the direct effect of ocean acidification and ocean warming on marine organisms, we found that higher trophic level species display greater tolerance to ocean acidifica-tion but greater sensitivity to warming. In contrast, marine herbivores were the most vulnerable trophic level to both acidification and warming. Such imbalances in the community and a general reduction of biodiversity and biomass in lower trophic levels can significantly disrupt the system and could drive negative bottom-up effects. In conclusion, with ocean acidification and elevated temperatures, there is an alarming risk that trophic disparity may disrupt species interactions, and thereby drive community destabilization under ocean climate change.","[Hu, Nan; Harlos, Christian; Liu, Ying] Lund Univ, Dept Biol Aquat Ecol, Lund, Sweden; [Bourdeau, Paul E.] Humboldt State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Arcata, CA 95521 USA; [Hollander, Johan] World Maritime Univ, Sasakawa Global Ocean Inst, S-21118 Malmo, Sweden; [Liu, Ying] Yunnan Univ, Sch Ecol & Environm Sci, Inst Ecol Res & Pollut Control Plateau Lakes, Kunming 650504, Yunnan, Peoples R China","Lund University; California State University System; California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt; Yunnan University","Hollander, J (corresponding author), World Maritime Univ, Sasakawa Global Ocean Inst, S-21118 Malmo, Sweden.",johan.hollander@wmu.se,,,China Scholarship Council (CSC); IUCN; Helge Ax:son Johnsons stiftelse; Nippon Foundation of Japan; Helen Riaboff Whiteley Center; Sitka Center for Art and Ecology,China Scholarship Council (CSC)(China Scholarship Council); IUCN; Helge Ax:son Johnsons stiftelse; Nippon Foundation of Japan; Helen Riaboff Whiteley Center; Sitka Center for Art and Ecology,"AcWe thank the China Scholarship Council (CSC) for supporting PhD stud-ies for Nan Hu, and Francis Neat for commenting on the manuscript.

In particular, these errors can lead to large uncertainties in the simulated climate response (both globally and regionally) to a doubling of CO2. Currently, tuning of the parameterization schemes in CGCMs is a significant part of the developed. It is not clear whether such tuning actually improves models. The tuning process is (in general) neither documented, nor reproducible. Alternative methods such as flux correcting are not used nor is it clear if such methods would perform better. In this study, ensembles of perturbed physics experiments are performed with the Globally Resolved Energy Balance (GREB) model to test the impact of tuning. The work illustrates that tuning has, in average, limited skill given the complexity of the system, the limited computing resources, and the limited observations to optimize parameters. While tuning may improve model performance (such as reproducing observed past climate), it will not get closer to the true'' physics nor will it significantly improve future climate change projections. Tuning will introduce artificial compensating error interactions between submodels that will hamper further model development. In turn, flux corrections do perform well in most, but not all aspects. A main advantage of flux correction is that it is much cheaper, simpler, more transparent, and it does not introduce artificial error interactions between submodels. These GREB model experiments should be considered as a pilot study to motivate further CGCM studies that address the issues of model tuning. Plain Language Summary State-of-the-art climate models are highly complex models of the earth's climate. To achieve optimal simulations of the present climate these climate models are tuned. The tuning process as such is not well understood and it is unclear how good it performs. Alternative approaches, such as not tuning, but introducing correction terms, are less common. The study presented here illustrates the problems that tuning of a climate model introduce and shows that the alternative, of not tuning, but introducing corrections terms, is likely to be the better strategy.","[Dommenget, Dietmar; Rezny, Michael] Monash Univ, Sch Earth Atmosphere & Environm, Clayton, Vic, Australia",Monash University,"Dommenget, D (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Sch Earth Atmosphere & Environm, Clayton, Vic, Australia.",dietmar.dommenget@monash.edu,"Dommenget, Dietmar/B-9828-2011","Dommenget, Dietmar/0000-0002-5129-7719","ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science, Australian Research Council [CE110001028]","ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science, Australian Research Council","We like to thank Duncan Ackerley and Rob Colman for helpful discussions and comments.

Understanding natural climate variability is therefore of vital importance, especially since the variability itself may change with a changing climate. Here, we quantify the magnitude and other characteristics of interannual to decadal variability in Arctic temperature and their dependence on the climate state. Moreover, we identify the processes responsible for the state dependency of the variations, using five quasi-equilibrium climate simulations of a state-of-the-art global climate model with 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 times present-day atmospheric CO2 forcing. The natural fluctuations in Arctic temperature, including their dependence on the state of the climate, are linked to anomalous atmospheric and oceanic heat transports toward the Arctic. Model results suggest that atmospheric heat transport leads (and also controls) Arctic temperature variations on interannual time scales, whereas oceanic transport is found to govern the fluctuations on decadal time scales. This time-scale transition of atmospheric to oceanic dominance for Arctic temperature variations is most obvious when there is interannual to decadal variability in Arctic sea ice cover. In warm climates (without Arctic sea ice cover), there is no correlation between oceanic transport and surface air temperature on any time scale. In cold climates (with full Arctic sea ice cover), interaction between ocean and atmosphere is limited, leaving poleward atmospheric heat transport to be the primary driver on all time scales (interannual and decadal).","[Reusen, Jesse] Inst Marine & Atmospher Res Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Reusen, Jesse; van der Linden, Eveline; Bintanja, Richard] Royal Netherlands Meteorol Inst, De Bilt, Netherlands; [Reusen, Jesse] Delft Univ Technol, Astrodynam & Space Missions, Delft, Netherlands; [van der Linden, Eveline] Wageningen Univ & Res, Water Syst & Global Change Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Bintanja, Richard] Univ Groningen, Energy & Sustainabil Res Inst Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands",Utrecht University; Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute; Delft University of Technology; Wageningen University & Research; University of Groningen,"Reusen, J (corresponding author), Inst Marine & Atmospher Res Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands.;Reusen, J (corresponding author), Royal Netherlands Meteorol Inst, De Bilt, Netherlands.;Reusen, J (corresponding author), Delft Univ Technol, Astrodynam & Space Missions, Delft, Netherlands.",jessereusen@gmail.com,,"van der Linden, Eveline/0000-0001-5052-7095",,,,,62,6,6,1,16,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0894-8755,1520-0442,,J CLIMATE,J.

Ecosystem services (ES) from mountain forests are highly relevant for human societies. ES with a direct economic support function (e.g. timber production), regulatory services (e.g. protection from natural hazards) and cultural services (e.g. recreation) are likely to be affected strongly by a rapidly changing climate. To evaluate whether adverse climate change effects on ES can be counteracted by adapting management, dynamic models and indicator-based assessments are needed. 2. We applied a forest dynamic model in case study areas of four European mountain regions and evaluated the future supply of four ES - timber production, carbon sequestration, biodiversity and protection against natural hazards - using state-of-the-art ES indicators. Forest dynamics were simulated under three management scenarios (no management, business-as-usual and alternative management) and five climate change projections for selected representative stand types in each region. We analysed potential trade-offs and synergies between ES and evaluated future changes among regions, forest stands, climate and management scenarios. 3. Impacts of climate change on the provision of multiple ES were found to be highly heterogeneous and to depend on the region, site and future climate. In the absence of large-scale natural disturbance (not considered), protection services, carbon stock and deadwood abundance (proxy for biodiversity) benefitted from no management in all regions. Negative impacts of climate change were evident for the provision of multiple ES but limited to the most severe climate scenarios and low-elevation stands. Synergies and trade-offs between the majority of ES were found to be sensitive to the choice of management strategy and - in some regions - to climate change. 4. Synthesis and applications. Management regimes in European mountain forests should be regionally adapted to stand and site conditions. Although in some cases alternative management regimes may be more suitable than current management for supporting multiple ecosystem services, adaptation options should be evaluated carefully at the local scale due to the highly different magnitude of the impacts of climate change in different regions and along elevation gradients.","[Mina, Marco; Bugmann, Harald; Cailleret, Maxime] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Environm Sci, Forest Ecol, Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Univ Str 16, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Mina, Marco] Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res WSL, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Cordonnier, Thomas] Irstea EMGR, 2 Rue Papeterie,BP 76, F-38402 St Martin Dheres, France; [Irauschek, Florian] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Silviculture, Vienna BOKU, Peter Jordan Str 82, A-1190 Vienna, Austria; [Klopcic, Matija] Univ Ljubljana, Biotech Fac, Dept Forestry & Renewable Forest Resources, Vecna Pot 83, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia; [Pardos, Marta] INIA CIFOR, Dept Silviculture & Forest Syst Management, Crtra Coruna Km 7-5, Madrid 28040, Spain","Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape Research; INRAE; University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna; University of Ljubljana; Instituto Nacional Investigacion Tecnologia Agraria Alimentaria (INIA)","Mina, M (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Environm Sci, Forest Ecol, Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Univ Str 16, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.;Mina, M (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res WSL, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland.",marco.mina@wsl.ch,"Cordonnier, Thomas/I-2586-2019; PARDOS, MARTA/A-4797-2015; Mina, Marco/H-6047-2019","Cordonnier, Thomas/0000-0003-3684-4662; PARDOS, MARTA/0000-0002-5567-5406; Mina, Marco/0000-0002-7489-7688; Bugmann, Harald/0000-0003-4233-0094; Cailleret, Maxime/0000-0001-6561-1943; Klopcic, Matija/0000-0003-2619-9073",project 'Advanced Multifunctional Forest Management in European Mountain Ranges (ARANGE)' within the European Commission's 7th Framework Program [289437],project 'Advanced Multifunctional Forest Management in European Mountain Ranges (ARANGE)' within the European Commission's 7th Framework Program,This study was financially supported by the project 'Advanced Multifunctional Forest Management in European Mountain Ranges (ARANGE)' within the European Commission's 7th Framework Program (Grant Agreement No. 289437).

LocationEurope. MethodsWe quantified propagule pressure, climate-matching and host availability by aggregating large global databases for trade, European arthropod interceptions, Koeppen-Geiger world climate classification (including the A1F1 climate change scenario until 2100) and host plant distributions for 118 quarantine arthropod species. ResultsAs expected, all the three factors, propagule pressure, climate suitability and host availability, significantly explained quarantine arthropod invasions in Europe, but the propagule pressure only had a positive effect on invasion success when considered together with climate suitability and host availability. Climate change according to the A1F1 scenario generally increased the climate suitability of north-eastern European countries and reduced the climate suitability of central European countries for pest arthropod invasions. Main conclusionsTo our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that propagule pressure interacts with other factors to drive invasions and is not alone sufficient to explain arthropod establishment patterns. European countries with more suitable climate and large agricultural areas of suitable host plants for pest arthropods should thus be more vigilant about introduction pathways. Moreover, efforts to reduce the propagule pressure, such as preventing pests from entering pathways and strengthening border controls, will become more important in north-eastern Europe in the future as the climate becomes more favourable to arthropod invasions.","[Bacon, Steven J.; Aebi, Alexandre; Calanca, Pierluigi] Res Stn ART, Agroscope Reckenholz Tanikon, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland; [Bacon, Steven J.; Bacher, Sven] Univ Fribourg, CH-1700 Fribourg, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Research Station Agroscope; Swiss Federal Research Station for Agroecology & Agriculture; University of Fribourg,"Bacher, S (corresponding author), Univ Fribourg, Chemin Musee 10, CH-1700 Fribourg, Switzerland.",sven.bacher@unifr.ch,"Bacher, Sven/F-5431-2010","Bacher, Sven/0000-0001-5147-7165; Calanca, Pierluigi/0000-0003-3113-2885",Swiss Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN),Swiss Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN),"This work was supported by a grant of the Swiss Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN) to A.

A Poststructuralist Approach to Climate Change Adaptation,ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF GEOGRAPHERS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,ACTOR-NETWORK THEORY; HUMAN-ENVIRONMENT; HYBRID-GEOGRAPHIES; HUMAN DIMENSIONS; POLITICS; VULNERABILITY; KNOWLEDGE; RISK; PERSPECTIVES; GOVERNANCE,"This article calls for a stronger engagement by geographers with the concept of socionature as a vehicle for guiding adaptation thinking in development planning. Drawing on literatures from poststructuralist geographies, it argues for a relational, hybrid ontology of climate change adaptation grounded in multiple perspectives, knowledges, and more-than-human relations. Going beyond this stance, a framework based on the idea of planning with climate change is proposed for a revised approach to adaptation that calls for more-than-social planning practices embedded in radically more integrative planning processes and the redistribution of power across the climate and planning systems. The article ends by highlighting some of the key challenges that such a project faces for scholars working in the field of planning and development research. Key Words: climate change adaptation, development, human geography, planning, poststructuralist theory.?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????Este art?culo clama por un compromiso m?s fuerte de los ge?grafos con el concepto de socionaturaleza, como veh?culo que gu?e el pensamiento de adaptaci?n en la planificaci?n del desarrollo.

Although numerous studies have already been published on this topic, there has not been compelling evidence critically assessing the impact of COVID-19 by and on climate change. The present study fills this gap by taking a more holistic approach to elaborate factors, e.g., natural and anthropogenic factors, ocean submesoscales, radiative forces, and greenhouse gas/CO2 emissions, that may affect climate change in a more prevalent and pronounced manner. Based on the statistical data collected from the NASA Earth Observatory, the European Space Agency, and the Global Carbon Project, the findings of this study reveal that the climate/environment has improved during COVID-19, including better environmental quality and water quality with low carbon emissions and sound pollution. In the lockdown during the epidemic, the emissions of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) significantly decreased because of the lower usage of transportation, decreased electricity demand, and halted industrial activities. The policy implications of this study suggested that keeping the climate healthy even in the post-COVID-19 era is a serious concern that needs to be addressed by investing in clean and green projects, ensuring green energy evolution, dealing with a large volume of medical waste, building health-ensuring and livable societies, and halting the funding of pollution. For governmental and regulatory bodies, these factors will provide a strong foundation to build safer, healthier, and environmentally friendly societies for generations to come.","[Usman, Muhammad; Husnain, Mudassir; Riaz, Aimon; Riaz, Areej; Ali, Yameen] Univ Educ Lahore, Art & Social Sci Div, Dept Econ & Business Adm, Faisalabad Campus, Faisalabad, Pakistan",,"Usman, M (corresponding author), Univ Educ Lahore, Art & Social Sci Div, Dept Econ & Business Adm, Faisalabad Campus, Faisalabad, Pakistan.",m.usman@ue.edu.pk,"Husnain, Mudassir/GXN-2515-2022; Husnain, Mudassir/AAA-5341-2021; Riaz, Areej/GYD-4279-2022; Usman, Dr. Muhammad/AAB-5622-2022; Riaz, Aimon/GXN-0522-2022","Husnain, Mudassir/0000-0002-0735-320X; Husnain, Mudassir/0000-0002-0735-320X; ",,,,,61,13,14,13,33,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0944-1344,1614-7499,,ENVIRON SCI POLLUT R,Environ.

Understanding dryland dynamics is essential to predict future climate trajectories. However, there remains large uncertainty on the extent to which drylands are expanding or greening, the drivers of dryland vegetation shifts, the relative importance of different hydrological processes regulating ecosystem functioning, and the role of land-use changes and climate variability in shaping ecosystem productivity. We review recent advances in the study of dryland productivity and ecosystem function and examine major outstanding debates on dryland responses to environmental changes. We highlight often-neglected uncertainties in the observation and prediction of dryland productivity and elucidate the complexity of dryland dynamics. We suggest prioritizing holistic approaches to dryland management, accounting for the increasing climatic and anthropogenic pressures and the associated uncertainties.","[Wang, Lixin] Indiana Univ Purdue Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA; [Jiao, Wenzhe] MIT, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [MacBean, Natasha] Western Univ, Dept Geog & Environm, London, ON, Canada; [MacBean, Natasha] Western Univ, Dept Biol, London, ON, Canada; [Rulli, Maria Cristina] Politecn Milan, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Milan, Italy; [Manzoni, Stefano] Stockholm Univ, Dept Phys Geog, Stockholm, Sweden; [Manzoni, Stefano] Stockholm Univ, Bolin Ctr Climate Res, Stockholm, Sweden; [Vico, Giulia] Swedish Univ Agr Sci SLU, Dept Crop Prod Ecol, Uppsala, Sweden; [D'Odorico, Paolo] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Western University (University of Western Ontario); Western University (University of Western Ontario); Polytechnic University of Milan; Stockholm University; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Wang, LX (corresponding author), Indiana Univ Purdue Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA.",lxwang@iupui.edu,"Wang, Lixin/A-2572-2008; MacBean, Natasha/L-2190-2015; D'Odorico, Paolo/A-5836-2008; Vico, Giulia/A-6296-2010","Wang, Lixin/0000-0003-0968-1247; MacBean, Natasha/0000-0001-6797-4836; D'Odorico, Paolo/0000-0002-0007-5833; Jiao, Wenzhe/0000-0002-2173-4041; Vico, Giulia/0000-0002-7849-2653; Rulli, Maria Cristina/0000-0002-9694-4262",Division of Earth Sciences of National Science Foundation [EAR-1554894]; NASA Carbon Cycle Program [80NSSC21K1709]; European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [101001608]; European Commission; Swedish Research Council for Sustainable Development FORMAS [2018-02787]; EU PRIMA Programme under Horizon 2020 European Union's Framework Programme for Research and Innovation (NEXUS-NESS an Art.185 initiative grant) [2042],Division of Earth Sciences of National Science Foundation; NASA Carbon Cycle Program; European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme(European Research Council (ERC)); European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre); Swedish Research Council for Sustainable Development FORMAS; EU PRIMA Programme under Horizon 2020 European Union's Framework Programme for Research and Innovation (NEXUS-NESS an Art.185 initiative grant),"We acknowledge support from Division of Earth Sciences of National Science Foundation (EAR-1554894).

Working at the intersection of sound art and politics, the two perform sonic interventions into settler colonial spaces-the National Parks system and the gallery, respectively. Belmore's Wave Sound (2017) and Nagam's Our future is in the land: If we listen to it (2017) illustrate how their sound art gravitates toward the ecological and considers what healthy and unhealthy relationships between humans and the nonhuman world-plants, animals, resources-sound like.

In such a system, ammonia vapor is adsorbed by the solid salt through reversible chemisorption reactions, and the thermal effect of the reaction and ammonia phase change is used to extract heat from a cold environment and supply heat to a warm environment. With the high latent heat and low boiling point of ammonia as a low-temperature refrigerant and the high sorption capacity of ammonia-based chemisorption reactions, chemisorption heat pumps have the potential to produce high-efficiency heating, particularly for cold climates. This review first briefly introduces the basics of ammonia-based chemisorption heat pump systems. Then, the latest development of sorbent materials, including ammoniate salts and heat-conductive porous matrix materials, are summarized with the focus on low-temperature heating conditions. The design of system components, as well as cycle configurations, in the literature are summarized. This review concludes with highlights of recent developments on these topics and suggestions of areas for further research.","[Yang, Zhiyao; Qu, Ming] Purdue Univ, Lyle Sch Civil Engn, W Lafayette, IN 47906 USA; [Gluesenkamp, Kyle R.] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, 1 Bethel Valley Rd, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Oak Ridge National Laboratory,"Gluesenkamp, KR (corresponding author), Oak Ridge Natl Lab, 1 Bethel Valley Rd, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA.",yang573@purdue.edu; mqu@purdue.edu; gluesenkampk@ornl.gov,,,"US Department of Energy's Building Technologies Office [DE-AC05-00OR22725]; UTBattelle, LLC.","US Department of Energy's Building Technologies Office(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); UTBattelle, LLC.","This work was sponsored by the US Department of Energy's Building Technologies Office under contract DE-AC05-00OR22725 with UTBattelle, LLC.

During the Holocene, the climate of the central Sahara changed from savanna to desert. This environmental background informed the experience of the engravers and underpinned the weathering of rock surfaces. To establish a link between images and climatic sequence, 2,466 individual animal engravings were analyzed with regard to the depicted species, patina and the location of the panel in relation to the dated shorelines of the al-Hayat palaeolake. Based on their patina, engravings are grouped into a broad, four-stage chronological sequence. The chronological relevance of this framework is tested in three different ways. The dates and sequence of the introduction of domestic animals match their depiction across the four engraving groups. The habitats of the depicted wild animals reflect a dramatic change from savanna to desert that is consistent with climatic records and the physical process of the patina formation. In addition, Early and Middle Pastoral engravings are shown to be in locations that correspond to the high lake levels of the African Humid period. Late Pastoral and Garamantian engravings are also recorded in areas that only became accessible once the palaeolake had dried up. Although the proposed methodology cannot provide precise dates for individual engravings, it can be used to establish a broad chronological framework that allows us to place the rock art within its archaeological context.","Univ Oxford, Res Lab Archaeol & Hist Art, Oxford OX1 2HU, England",University of Oxford,"Guagnin, M (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Res Lab Archaeol & Hist Art, New Barnett House,28 Little Clarendon St, Oxford OX1 2HU, England.",maria.guagnin@rlaha.ox.ac.uk,,"Guagnin, Maria/0000-0002-7995-8611",,,,,31,2,2,0,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0263-0338,1572-9842,,AFR ARCHAEOL REV,Afr.

The effect of climate change on present and future existence, sustainable processes, and utilizations of renewable resources have been active topics within international discourse. In order to reduce the greenhouse gases emissions from traditional materials and processes, there has been a shift to more environmental friendly alternatives. The conversion of biomass to bioenergy, including biofuels has been considered to contribute to the future of climate change mitigation, although there are concerns about carbon balance from forest utilization. Bioenergy accounts for more than one-third of all energy used in Sweden and biomass has provided about 60% of the fuel for district heating. Apart from heat and electricity supply, the transport sector, with about 30% of global energy use, has a significant role in a sustainable bioenergy system. This review presents the state of the art in the Swedish bioenergy sector based on literature and Swedish Energy Agency's current statistics. The review also discusses the overall bioenergy production and utilization in different sectors in Sweden.

ESMs include a large number of additional processes and feedbacks such as biogeochemical cycles that traditional physical climate models do not consider. Yet, some processes such as cloud dynamics and ecosystem functional response still have fairly high uncertainties. In this article, we present an overview of climate feedbacks for Earth system components currently included in state-of-the-art ESMs and discuss the challenges to evaluate and quantify them. Uncertainties in feedback quantification arise from the interdependencies of biogeochemical matter fluxes and physical properties, the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of processes, and the lack of long-term continuous observational data to constrain them. We present an outlook for promising approaches that can help to quantify and to constrain the large number of feedbacks in ESMs in the future. The target group for this article includes generalists with a background in natural sciences and an interest in climate change as well as experts working in interdisciplinary climate research (researchers, lecturers, and students). This study updates and significantly expands upon the last comprehensive overview of climate feedbacks in ESMs, which was produced 15 years ago (NRC, 2003).","[Heinze, Christoph; Gao, Shuang] Univ Bergen, Geophys Inst, Postboks 7803, N-5020 Bergen, Norway;

Ballard used a London gallery as a laboratory in which to test ideas he was toying with, ideas that eventually found their way into his 1973 novel, Crash. Ballard found that art and literature were a fecund combination. Considering the richness of his imagery and the complexity of his ideas, it is not surprising that Ballard's works have gone on to inspire artistic responses. Perhaps the most well known of these is Robert Smithson's masterpiece, Spiral Jetty, 1970. However, most works inspired by Ballard's writing respond to vague notions of things Ballardian rather than to a particular novel or short story. In this essay I will focus specifically on recent contemporary Australian artworks which were made in direct response to Ballard's 1962 novel, The Drowned World, for a 2015 exhibition I initiated and coordinated titled Mapping The Drowned World. Using my own artworks as examples, as well as work made by fellow Australian artists Roy Ananda, Jon Cattapan and Janet Tavener, I will demonstrate that art and Ballard's literature continue to make a great synergistic team: together they produce more than the sum of their parts.",,,,traceyclement@gmail.com,,,,,,,28,0,0,0,0,SCIENDO,WARSAW,"DE GRUYTER POLAND SP Z O O, BOGUMILA ZUGA 32A STR, 01-811 WARSAW, POLAND",2451-3474,,,OPEN CULT STUD,Open Cult.

Climate warming is expected to have an influence on the Baltic Sea ice and soil frost below snow-free surfaces in Finland. The future period this study focuses on is the end of the 21st century. The climate predictions used are based on state-of-the-art climate model simulations. Results of the ice-ocean model show that in the future the Baltic Sea ice cover will be smaller, the ice season will be shorter and the ice will be thinner. However, ice will still be formed every winter in the Bay of Bothnia and in the eastern part of the Gulf of Finland. The average maximum extent of the Baltic Sea ice cover in the scenario simulation would be classified as mild according to the present standards. At the end of the 21st century, the duration of the ice season will be reduced along the south and southwestern coasts of Finland to about half and in the Bay of Bothnia to 70-80% of the present. On the southwestern coast the freezing will be postponed by almost one and a half months, and the break-up of the ice will occur almost a month earlier. In the harbours, the mean ice thickness will be reduced by 10-20 cm and the maximum thickness by about 30 cm from the simulation of present day conditions to the scenario simulation. Based on the model developed in this study, the annual maximum soil frost depth below snow-free surfaces will decrease in southern and central Finland from the present approx. 100-150 cm by about 50 cm. In northern Finland the decrease will be from depths of about 200-300 cm to about 100-200 cm, depending on the station. In the future the annual maximum soil frost depth would thus be about the same in northern Finland as it is in the current climate in southern Finland. At the end of this century in southern Finland the ground will seldom be frozen in December and even in January there will be no soil frost in about half of the years. In central and northern Finland the probability of completely unfrozen ground in December-March is very small, even in the future.","Finnish Meteorol Inst, FIN-00101 Helsinki, Finland",Finnish Meteorological Institute,"Tuomenvirta, H (corresponding author), Finnish Meteorol Inst, POB 503, FIN-00101 Helsinki, Finland.",,,,,,,,26,2,2,0,2,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",,,3-540-42239-0,,,,2001,,,,,593,604,,,,,,12,"Geography, Physical; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Physical Geography; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,BT53J,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000173272300050,View Full Record in Web of Science

Significantly weak ENSO asymmetry and weakly nonlinear air-sea interaction over the tropical Pacific was found in CMIP5 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, Phase 5) climate models compared with observation. The results suggest that a weak nonlinear air-sea interaction may play a role in the weak ENSO asymmetry. Moreover, a weak nonlinearity in air-sea interaction in the models may be associated with the biases in the mean climate-the cold biases in the equatorial central Pacific. The excessive cold tongue bias pushes the deep convection far west to the western Pacific warm pool region and suppresses its development in the central equatorial Pacific. The deep convection has difficulties in further moving to the eastern equatorial Pacific, especially during extreme El Nino events, which confines the westerly wind anomaly to the western Pacific. This weakens the eastern Pacific El Nino events, especially the extreme El Nino events, and thus leads to the weakened ENSO asymmetry in climate models. An accurate mean state structure (especially a realistic cold tongue and deep convection) is critical to reproducing ENSO events in climate models. Our evaluation also revealed that ENSO statistics in CMIP5 climate models are slightly improved compared with those of CMIP3. The weak ENSO asymmetry in CMIP5 is closer to the observation. It is more evident in CMIP5 that strong ENSO activities are usually accompanied by strong ENSO asymmetry, and the diversity of ENSO amplitude is reduced.","[Sun, Yan; Wang, Fan] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Oceanol, Key Lab Ocean Circulat & Waves, Qingdao 266071, Peoples R China; [Sun, Yan; Wang, Fan] Qingdao Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol, Lab Ocean Dynam & Climate, Qingdao 266071, Peoples R China; [Sun, De-Zheng] Univ Colorado, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Boulder, CO 80305 USA; [Sun, De-Zheng] NOAA, Earth Syst Res Lab, Div Phys Sci, Boulder, CO 80305 USA","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Oceanology, CAS; Qingdao National Laboratory for Marine Science & Technology; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA","Wang, F (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Oceanol, Key Lab Ocean Circulat & Waves, Qingdao 266071, Peoples R China.;Wang, F (corresponding author), Qingdao Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol, Lab Ocean Dynam & Climate, Qingdao 266071, Peoples R China.",fwang@qdio.ac.cn,"Sun, Yan/Q-5051-2016; Wang, Fan/J-5119-2012","Wang, Fan/0000-0001-5932-7567","National Basic Research Program of China [2012CB417401]; Strategic Priority Research Program-Climate Change: Carbon Budget and Related Issues, of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA05110302]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2012M521378]; Large-scale and Climate Dynamics Program of the U.S. National Science Foundation [AGS 0553111, AGS 0852329]; Office of Global Programs of NOAA","National Basic Research Program of China(National Basic Research Program of China); Strategic Priority Research Program-Climate Change: Carbon Budget and Related Issues, of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); Large-scale and Climate Dynamics Program of the U.S. National Science Foundation; Office of Global Programs of NOAA","This work was supported by the National Basic Research Program of China under the project Structures, Variability and Climatic Impacts of Ocean Circulation and the Warm Pool in the Tropical Pacific Ocean (Grant No. 2012CB417401), the Strategic Priority Research Program-Climate Change: Carbon Budget and Related Issues, of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Grant No. XDA05110302), the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (Grant No. 2012M521378), the Large-scale and Climate Dynamics Program of the U.S. National Science Foundation (AGS 0553111 and AGS 0852329) and the Office of Global Programs of NOAA.

Despite a growing number of assessments on the national or global scale, there is still a need for regionalized studies with a high resolution to identify meso-scale vulnerability patterns. In this paper, we present an indicator-based assessment that was carried out in the Trinational Metropolitan Region Upper Rhine within the Interreg-V project Clim'Ability. The analyzed region is characterized by strong cross-border and transnational linkages, similar ecological features and climatic stressors but differing political, administrative, cultural and legal conditions. In this rather complex setting, we operationalized a state-of-the art vulnerability framework using 18 quantified indicators and aggregating them into a vulnerability index. We show that it is possible to downscale the methods used in recent assessments to a regional context with a challenging data situation and discuss strengths and uncertainties. The results are mapped for stakeholder communication purposes.

In doing so, the emphasis is on the dual role of computations in prediction and experimentation, permitting the development of physical insight and confidence in the mechanistic insight through verification. Modern climate dynamics has steadily evolved because of the ready access to computational power that has developed over the past quarter century. The landscape for state-of-the-art computational climate science is changing rapidly, however, with the drive toward greater complexity in climate models in order to more fully represent the interactions among components, the need for higher-resolution atmospheric and oceanic models to fully capture critical aspects of the variability in these components, and the advent of petascale and (eventually) exascale computing facilities. Finally, the manner in which the combination of these changes will likely alter the planning and execution of grand-challenge computational experiments and what this might mean in terms of collaborative climate science is discussed.","[Tribbia, J.] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [Navarra, A.] CMCC INGV, Bologna, Italy; [Kinter, J.

In this respect, Art Cities are among the most favorable tourist destinations, as they exhibit masterpieces of art and architecture in a cultural environment. However, the so-called phenomenon of overtourism has emerged as a significant threat to the residents' quality of life, and, consequently, the sustainability of Art Cites. This research aims to develop a management toolkit that assists site managers to control tourism flows in Art Cities and World Heritage Sites and promotes the residents' quality of life. The research methodology was developed within the framework of the Atlas Project in 2019. In this project, five European Art Cities, including Florence, Edinburgh, Bordeaux, Porto, and Santiago de Compostela, discussed their common management challenges through the shared learning method. After developing selection criteria, the Atlas' partners suggested a total of nine strategies as best practices for managing overtourism in Art Cities in multiple sections of accommodation policies, monitoring tactics, and promotional offerings. The Atlas project was conducted before the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus pandemic. Based on the current data, it is somehow uncertain when and how tourism activities will return to normal. The analysis of the Atlas findings also highlights some neglected dimensions in the current strategies in terms of environmental concerns, climate change impacts, crisis management, and cultural development plans, which require further research to boost the heritage planning process.","[De Luca, Giuseppe; Dastgerdi, Ahmadreza Shirvani] Univ Florence, Dept Architecture, Urban & Reg Planning Sect, I-50121 Florence, Italy; [Francini, Carlo] Florence World Heritage & UNESCO Relationship Off, I-50123 Florence, Italy; [Liberatore, Giovanni] Univ Florence, Dept Econ & Business Sci, I-50127 Florence, Italy",University of Florence; University of Florence,"Dastgerdi, AS (corresponding author), Univ Florence, Dept Architecture, Urban & Reg Planning Sect, I-50121 Florence, Italy.",giuseppe.deluca@unifi.it; ahmadreza.shirvanidastgerdi@unifi.it; carlo.francini@comune.fi.it; giovanni.liberatore@unifi.it,"De Luca, Giuseppe/ABG-3319-2020; Dastgerdi, Ahmadreza Shirvani/O-9539-2018","Dastgerdi, Ahmadreza Shirvani/0000-0002-5681-2222; Francini, Carlo/0000-0002-7036-2205; Liberatore, Giovanni/0000-0003-2439-5396; DE LUCA, GIUSEPPE/0000-0001-7994-2217",INTERREG Atlantic Area Program in 2019,INTERREG Atlantic Area Program in 2019,Atlas World Heritage was funded by INTERREG Atlantic Area Program in 2019.,,45,21,23,7,38,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,MAY,2020,9,,,,,,3929,10.3390/su12093929,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12093929,,,11,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,LU0TK,,"Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000537476200427,View Full Record in Web of Science

Future projections from state-of-the-art Earth System Models exhibit significant model to model differences, but decreased solubility and weakened ventilation together deplete thermocline O-2 in middle to high latitudes. In contrast, the tropical thermocline O-2 undergoes much smaller changes or even a slight increase. A suite of sensitivity experiments using a coarse resolution ocean circulation and biogeochemistry model show that ocean warming is the leading cause of global deoxygenation in the thermocline across all latitudes with secondary contributions from changes in hydrological cycles and wind stress modulating regional changes in O-2. The small O-2 changes in the tropical Pacific thermocline reflect near-complete compensation between the solubility decrease due to warming and reduction in apparent oxygen utilization (AOU). We further quantified the changes in AOU due to contributions from changes in water mass age and biological remineralization from the sensitivity experiments. The two effects almost equally contribute to the reduction of AOU in the tropical Pacific thermocline (43% for physical circulations and 57% for biology). Our results suggest that better understanding of water mass changes in the tropical oceans is key to improving projections and reducing the uncertainties of future O-2 changes. Plain Language Summary Global warming in the next hundred years could lead to a large amount of oxygen loss from the ocean. This could impact not only the marine ecosystem but also fisheries. We use model simulations to investigate how long-term climate change, such as changes in sea surface temperature, precipitation, and winds, under the anthropogenic transient could impact oceanic oxygen loss in the next hundred years. The ocean loses oxygen in most of the regions but tropical oceans could actually gain oxygen regionally. We investigate what causes these unique oxygen changes in the tropical Pacific Ocean. The counterintuitive oxygen changes in the tropical Pacific Ocean are likely due to, by an almost equal amount of effects, changes in water mass supply due to changes in circulations and changes in biological activity, that is, consumption of oxygen through respiration. Tropical oceans are sensitive to oxygen loss because of its impact on marine ecosystems. Our study could provide a better understanding of future oxygen loss in the ocean.","[Takano, Yohei; Ito, Takamitsu] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Earth & Atmospher Sci, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Takano, Yohei] Max Planck Inst Meteorol, Hamburg, Germany; [Deutsch, Curtis] Univ Washington, Sch Oceanog, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology; Max Planck Society; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Takano, Y (corresponding author), Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Earth & Atmospher Sci, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.;Takano, Y (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Meteorol, Hamburg, Germany.",yohei.takano@mpimet.mpg.de,"Ito, Takamitsu/F-3856-2010","Ito, Takamitsu/0000-0001-9873-099X","NSF [OCE-1357373, OCE-1458967, OCE-1419323]; Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation (GBMF) [3775]; European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [641816]",NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation (GBMF)(Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation); European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme,"The main part of this study is carried out during the first author's Ph.D. study at Georgia Institute of Technology.

Using a coding scheme that has been successfully employed in previous research, the coverage is examined based on several factors, for example, the dominant frame of the story, the number of stories and word count, which sources are quoted, and whether or not blame is attributed. As the salience of the issue ebbs and flows in the world press and for global populations, examining coverage in the regional press of supranational organizations (such as the EU, ASEAN, and the GCC) represents another interesting avenue for research as the potential for future conflict among nations resulting from climate change becomes more of a reality. Results show that climate change receives varied coverage in the Gulf press; researchers and government officials tend to be used as sources; roughly half of the sampled articles mention risks and discuss potential solutions. The stories tend to revolve around energy, conservation, and weather-related topics, while at the same time approximately half mention man as to blame for the problem.","[Freeman, Bradley C.] Amer Univ Dubai, Mohammed Bin Rashid Sch Commun, Al Asad St, Media City, Dubai, U Arab Emirates",American University in Dubai (AUD),"Freeman, BC (corresponding author), Amer Univ Dubai, Mohammed Bin Rashid Sch Commun, Al Asad St, Media City, Dubai, U Arab Emirates.",bfreeman@aud.edu,,"Freeman, Bradley/0000-0002-5088-4989",,,,,73,4,4,0,6,TAYLOR & FRANCIS AS,OSLO,"KARL JOHANS GATE 5, NO-0154 OSLO, NORWAY",2331-1983,,,COGENT ARTS HUMANITE,Cogent Art Humanities,,2016,,,,,,,1212690,10.1080/23311983.2016.1212690,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/23311983.2016.1212690,,,16,"Humanities, Multidisciplinary",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Arts & Humanities - Other Topics,DY3XP,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000385031500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

While measures are being applied in federal forests and large private properties, it remains unclear how small-scale private forest owners, with a property < 20 ha, perceive the possible influence of climate change and whether they will approach required activities. While in the past, the majority of private forest owners had ties to agriculture and cultivated farmland alongside their forests, recent studies revealed new trends and significant deviations from established norms and beliefs. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the motivations for forest ownership, current management practices, and perception of and adaptability to climate change, to discuss successful approaches for information campaigns, advisory services, and monetary incentives. The study applied a questionnaire with an embedded choice experiment, which obtained a thorough understanding of the salient factors influencing decision-making by surveying 919 forest owners across Austria. Results show that small-scale private forest owners are not homogenous. Three distinct segments were identified (utility oriented, recreation oriented, and tradition conscious forest owners) which reacted differently to provided management options and incentives. However, even under a worst-case scenario setting, 84% of forest owners would select some sort of management over no procedure, indicating that forest management is not generally rejected. Information campaigns should rather focus on soft management leading to attractive, stable and highly diverse forest stands resilient to climate change than on cost efficiency and financial benefits. Therefore, advisory services need to convey, that all forest measures are performed with special care and under consideration of the remaining forest and that each stand is treated individually with adequate equipment. Increasing monetary incentives, such as funding, barely influences forest owners' decision-making and are therefore deemed unfeasible and unable to motivate the owners to undertake climate change adaptation measures. The study shows that a segmentation based on management behavior and preferences rather than on predefined characteristics has the potential to define a new state of the art. Overall, climate change adaptation through tailored forest management is highly supported by the presented findings.","[Mostegl, Nina M.; Proebstl-Haider, Ulrike] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci Vienna, Inst Landscape Dev Recreat & Conservat Planning, Peter Jordan Str 82, A-1190 Vienna, Austria; [Jandl, Robert] Austrian Res Ctr Forests, Seckendorff Gudent Weg 8, A-1131 Vienna, Austria; [Haider, Wolfgang] Simon Fraser Univ, Sch Resource & Environm Management, 8888 Univ Dr, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada","University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna; Simon Fraser University","Mostegl, NM (corresponding author), Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci Vienna, Inst Landscape Dev Recreat & Conservat Planning, Peter Jordan Str 82, A-1190 Vienna, Austria.",nina.mostegl@boku.ac.at; ulrike.proebstl@boku.ac.at; robert.jandl@bfw.gv.at; whaider@sfu.ca,,,Austrian Climate and Energy Fund [B286281],Austrian Climate and Energy Fund,This work was supported by the Austrian Climate and Energy Fund (B286281) and conducted within the framework of the ACRP program.

While this is important in determining the effectiveness of the tools and advancing the state-of-the-art in visualization research, a key area that has mostly been overlooked is how well established visualization theories and principles are instantiated in practice. This is especially relevant when domain experts, and not visualization researchers, design visualizations for analysis of their data or for broader dissemination of scientific knowledge. There is very little research on exploring the synergistic capabilities of cross-domain collaboration between domain experts and visualization researchers. To fill this gap, in this paper we describe the results of an exploratory study of climate data visualizations conducted in tight collaboration with a pool of climate scientists. The study analyzes a large set of static climate data visualizations for identifying their shortcomings in terms of visualization design. The outcome of the study is a classification scheme that categorizes the design problems in the form of a descriptive taxonomy. The taxonomy is a first attempt for systematically categorizing the types, causes, and consequences of design problems in visualizations created by domain experts. We demonstrate the use of the taxonomy for a number of purposes, such as, improving the existing climate data visualizations, reflecting on the impact of the problems for enabling domain experts in designing better visualizations, and also learning about the gaps and opportunities for future visualization research. We demonstrate the applicability of our taxonomy through a number of examples and discuss the lessons learnt and implications of our findings.","[Dasgupta, Aritra] NYU, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, New York, NY 11209 USA; [Poco, Jorge; Bertini, Enrico; Silva, Claudio T.] NYU, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Brooklyn, NY 11201 USA; [Wei, Yaxing; Cook, Robert] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Div Environm Sci, Knoxville, TN USA",New York University; New York University Tandon School of Engineering; New York University; New York University Tandon School of Engineering; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Oak Ridge National Laboratory,"Dasgupta, A (corresponding author), NYU, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, New York, NY 11209 USA.",adasgupt@nyu.edu; jpocom@nyu.edu; weiy@ornl.gov; cookrb@ornl.gov; enrico.bertini@nyu.edu; csilva@nyu.edu,"Poco, Jorge/F-3344-2016; Bertini, Enrico/ABG-1278-2020; Dasgupta, Aritra/AAV-8710-2020; Dasgupta, Aritra/AAF-5223-2019; Wei, Yaxing/K-1507-2013","Poco, Jorge/0000-0001-9096-6287; Dasgupta, Aritra/0000-0002-5551-5103; Cook, Robert/0000-0001-7393-7302; Wei, Yaxing/0000-0001-6924-0078; Bertini, Enrico/0000-0002-9932-0551","DataONE project (NSF) [OCI-0830944, NSF CNS-1229185]; NASA ROSES [10-BIOCLIM10-0067]; DOE Office of Science Biological and Environmental Research (BER); MAST-DC (NASA) [NNH10AN68I]; MsTMIP (NASA) [NNH10AN68I]; NASA's Terrestrial Ecology Program",DataONE project (NSF); NASA ROSES(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); DOE Office of Science Biological and Environmental Research (BER)(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); MAST-DC (NASA); MsTMIP (NASA); NASA's Terrestrial Ecology Program(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)),"This work was supported by: the DataONE project (NSF Grant number OCI-0830944), NSF CNS-1229185, NASA ROSES 10-BIOCLIM10-0067, and DOE Office of Science Biological and Environmental Research (BER).

The reputed topics have been highly controversial during several decades. A link between the atmospheric ionization by galactic cosmic rays (GCR), which is modulated by solar activities, and global cloud cover was firstly proposed in 1997. Some researchers suggested that the GCR can stimulate the formation of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) in the atmosphere, and then the higher CCN concentrations may lead to an increase of cloud cover, resulting in a cooling of the Earth's climate, and vise versa. The CLOUD (Cosmic leaving outdoor droplets) experiment was designed to study the effect of GCR on the formation of atmospheric aerosols and clouds under precisely controlled laboratory conditions. A state-of-the-art chamber experiment has greatly advanced our scientific understanding of the aerosol formation in early stage and its nucleation processes if the GCR effect is considered or not. Many studies on the climate-GCR (or space weather) connection including the CLOUD experiment have been carried out during the several decades. Although it may not be easy to clarify the physical connection, the recent scientific approaches such as the laboratory experiments or modeling studies give some implications that the research definitively contributed to reduce the scientific uncertainties of natural and anthropogenic aerosol radiative forcing as well as to better understand the formation processes of fine particulate matters as an important parameter of air quality forecast.","[Kim, Jiyoung; Jang, Kun-Il] Korea Meteorol Adm, Natl Meteorol Satellite Ctr, Jincheon, South Korea",Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA),"Kim, J (corresponding author), Natl Meteorol Satellite Ctr, 64-18 Guam Gil, Jincheon Gun 27803, Chunbuk, South Korea.",aceasia@korea.kr,,,,,,,63,1,1,0,5,KOREAN METEOROLOGICAL SOC,SEOUL,"SHINKIL-DONG 508, SIWON BLDG 704, YONGDUNGPO-GU, SEOUL, 150-050, SOUTH KOREA",1598-3560,2288-3266,,ATMOS-KOREA,Atmos.-Korea,DEC,2017,4,,,,499,509,,10.14191/Atmos.2017.27.4.499,http://dx.doi.org/10.14191/Atmos.2017.27.4.499,,,11,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,GF3MQ,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000431860600011,View Full Record in Web of Science

The quasi-experiment was conducted in a hospital and in an administrative setting. Contrary to current information centred types of waiting management stressing clock-time' only and attempting to reduce objective waiting times, the artistic intervention follows a holistic concept by appealing to all the senses influencing felt time and social time. It comprises visual, acoustic, tactile/haptic and olfactory elements (fragrance management). The observation-oriented artistic intervention uses contemplative video works, ornamentation, relaxing fragrances and a corresponding seating design. The action-oriented room climate promotes communication and stimulating object and surface design, coupled with a subliminally stimulating fragrance environment. After a simultaneous one-week baseline measurement in both organizations, follow-up measures were conducted during one week of each type of intervention. Results are based on 482 personal interviews and 1950 observations of waiting clients: Perceived waiting time and objective waiting time correlated only moderately (rp=56) and expected waiting time was overestimated. In both waiting room settings, room transformations - compared to baseline measures - reduced waiting stress behaviour (however not perceived stress) and increased both positive overall room perception and the evaluation of specific room characteristics among clients/patients. Differences between the two room climates were not significant and effects appear to be stronger in the administrative space. The relatively short waiting times (16-20min) and high levels of waiting satisfaction at baseline might have limited the effect size of the holistic interventions. At the same time observed positive outcomes can be plausibly expected in waiting zones with much longer waiting times.","[Klingemann, Harald; Scheuermann, Arne; Staehli, Simon; Afzali, Minou] Bern Univ Appl Sci, Bern, Switzerland; [Klingemann, Harald; Scheuermann, Arne; Staehli, Simon; Afzali, Minou] Bern Univ Appl Sci, Res Unit Commun Design, Fellerstr 11, CH-3027 Bern, Switzerland; [Laederach, Kurt] Univ Hosp Bern, Bern, Switzerland; [Krueger, Birgit; Schmutz, Eric] Copa & Sordes, Basel, Switzerland; [Kern, Vero] Vero Profumo, Zurich, Switzerland",University of Bern; University Hospital of Bern,"Klingemann, H (corresponding author), Bern Univ Appl Sci, Res Unit Commun Design, Fellerstr 11, CH-3027 Bern, Switzerland.",harald.klingemann@gmail.com,,,"Swiss National Research Foundation, Division CoRe (Abteilung Interdivisionare Koordination und cooperative Forschung) [CR3113_135575]","Swiss National Research Foundation, Division CoRe (Abteilung Interdivisionare Koordination und cooperative Forschung)","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The project Waiting Times in Organizations and Artistic Interventions (Wartezeiten in Organisationen und kunstlerische Intervention) was funded by the Swiss National Research Foundation, Division CoRe (Abteilung Interdivisionare Koordination und cooperative Forschung) under grant no.

All five sites are experiencing different climate change impacts and each has been responding and adapting to these challenges in unique and locally appropriate ways. The project illustrates both the value of collaboration between different organisations, and the role of this historic environment in climate change communication and public engagement. This paper will introduce the project aims, objectives and methodology with a particular focus on the project review and web analytics for the six-month period following the project launch. Results suggest global meaningful engagement with some considerable gaps especially in low and middle-income countries.

Here we use geometric morphometric analysis of shape to examine the oft-cited painting from Arnhem Land attributed by Gunn et al. to the long-extinct species Genyornis newtoni. We compare the shape of key anatomical features in this painting to anatomical depictions of Genyornis as well as to two other possible candidates the emu and the magpie goose. Comparisons are also made to rock art depictions of these birds from northern Australia. We find that while the so-called 'Genyornis' painting does more closely resemble anatomical depictions of Genyornis than any other bird examined, all rock art images overlap in shape to such a degree that confident assignment of this image to any avian species is problematic.

The future weather file for 2080 with 90th percentile data show a large increase in overheating events and is considered too extreme. The need for active cooling in bedrooms is expected to occur around 2035 and is independent of a heat wave. Results for living rooms are more variable with thermal mass mitigating the adoption of active cooling by 40 years and 25% of the overheating in a heat wave event.

It is state-of-the-art to assume that risk reduction requires participatory management involving a broad range of stakeholders and scientists. However, there is still little knowledge about the optimal design of participatory climate change risk management processes (PRMPs), in particular with respect to considering the multitude of substantial uncertainties that are relevant for PRMPs. To support the many local to regional PRMPs that are necessary for a successful global-scale reduction of CC risks, we present a roadmap for designing such transdisciplinary knowledge integration processes. The roadmap suggests ways in which uncertainties can be comprehensively addressed within a PRMP. We discuss the concept of CC risks and their management and propose an uncertainty framework that distinguishes epistemic, ontological, and linguistic uncertainty as well as ambiguity. Uncertainties relevant for CC risk management are identified. Communicative and modeling methods that support social learning as well as the development of risk management strategies are proposed for each of six phases of a PRMP. Finally, we recommend how to evaluate PRMPs as such evaluations and their publication are paramount for achieving a reduction of CC risks.","[Doell, Petra] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Inst Phys Geog, Frankfurt, Germany; [Romero-Lankao, Patricia] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Urban Futures, RAL CSAP, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA",Goethe University Frankfurt; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA,"Doll, P (corresponding author), Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Inst Phys Geog, Frankfurt, Germany.",pdoell@em.uni-frankfurt.de,"Döll, Petra/A-3784-2009","Döll, Petra/0000-0003-2238-4546",National Science Foundation (USA),National Science Foundation (USA)(National Science Foundation (NSF)),Petra Doll acknowledges the support of Goethe University Frankfurt (Germany) and the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder (USA) for her research stay in Boulder.

During the monsoon period, the RCMs are able to capture the spatial distribution of precipitation with a maximum over the central and west coast of India, but with important biases at the regional scale on the east coast of India in Bangladesh and Myanmar. Most models are too warm in the north of India compared to the observations. This has an impact on the simulated mean sea level pressure from the RCMs, being in general too low compared to ERA-40. Those biases perturb the land sea temperature and pressure contrasts that drive the monsoon dynamics and, as a consequence, lead to an overestimation of wind speed, especially over the sea. The timing of the monsoon onset of the RCMs is in good agreement with the one obtained from observationally based gridded datasets, while the monsoon withdrawal is less well simulated. A Hovmoller diagram representation of the mean annual cycle of precipitation reveals that the meridional motion of the precipitation simulated by the RCMs is comparable to the one observed, but the precipitation amounts and the regional distribution differ substantially between the four RCMs. In summary, the spread at the regional scale between the RCMs indicates that important feedbacks and processes are poorly, or not, taken into account in the state-of-the-art regional climate models.","[Lucas-Picher, Philippe] Meteo France, Ctr Natl Rech Meteorol CNRM GAME, F-31057 Toulouse, France; [Lucas-Picher, Philippe; Christensen, Jens H.] Danish Meteorol Inst, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Saeed, Fahad; Kumar, Pankaj; Jacob, Daniela; Hagemann, Stefan] Max Planck Inst Meteorol, Hamburg, Germany; [Asharaf, Shakeel; Ahrens, Bodo] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Inst Atmospher & Environm Sci, Frankfurt, Germany; [Wiltshire, Andrew J.] Met Off Hadley Ctr Climate Predict & Res, Exeter, Devon, England",Meteo France; Danish Meteorological Institute DMI; Max Planck Society; Goethe University Frankfurt; Met Office - UK; Hadley Centre,"Lucas-Picher, P (corresponding author), Meteo France, Ctr Natl Rech Meteorol CNRM GAME, 42 Av Gaspard Coriolis, F-31057 Toulouse, France.",philippe.lucas-picher@meteo.fr,"Kumar, Pankaj/P-3840-2016; Ahrens, Bodo/A-7439-2008; Wiltshire, Andy/C-2848-2008; Christensen, Jens Hesselbjerg/C-4162-2013","Kumar, Pankaj/0000-0003-1906-9852; Ahrens, Bodo/0000-0002-6452-3180; Christensen, Jens Hesselbjerg/0000-0002-9908-8203; Asharaf, Shakeel/0000-0003-3981-7360; Lucas-Picher, Philippe/0000-0001-8707-7745","European Union [036946, 227087, 036592]; Joint DECC-Defra Met Office Hadley Centre [GA01101]; Hessian initiative for the development of scientific and economic excellence (LOEWE) at the Biodiversity and Climate Research Centre (BiK-F), Frankfurt/Main","European Union(European Commission); Joint DECC-Defra Met Office Hadley Centre; Hessian initiative for the development of scientific and economic excellence (LOEWE) at the Biodiversity and Climate Research Centre (BiK-F), Frankfurt/Main","This study was supported by funding from the European Union within the WATCH project (Contract 036946).

Accurate assessment of the effect that future climate change may pose on grain production is essential to the sustainability of agriculture. Model variations plus uncertainties in the future climate change scenarios create a big challenge for such evaluation. In this work, we developed the statistical models for six different regions in China, using the historical yield data between 1981 and 2010 from the National Bureau of Statistics combined with meteorological station observations and analyzed the impact of climate variation (i.e., temperature and precipitation changes) on the grain yields into the 2030s, based on 28 ensemble climate predictions from six state-of-the-art Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) model outputs. Our results indicate that the four crops (i.e., rice, maize, wheat, and soybean) respond similarly to the climate variation in different regions of China, with the sensitivity to warming increasing from north to south and from inner land to coast regions. In addition, the yields of all the four crops in East and Central-South China are also positively correlated with precipitation change. Future projections with a medium greenhouse gas mitigation scenario (RCP4.5) showed that the yield of the four crops in six regions of China would increase ranging from 0.02 to 1.19 hundred ton/ha, in 2030s with respect to the 2000s. Nevertheless, adaptive implementations such as appropriately improve the irrigation infrastructure in East and Central-South China could mitigate the adverse impact from future climate change.","[Zhuo, Zhihong; Gao, Chaochao; Liu, Yonghong] Zhejiang Univ, Coll Environm & Resources Sci, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University,"Gao, CC (corresponding author), Zhejiang Univ, Coll Environm & Resources Sci, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",fairyes@zju.edu.cn; gaocc@zju.edu.cn; liuyonghong123-5@163.com,,"Zhuo, Zhihong/0000-0003-2539-7692",Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China [LY12D03001]; Clean Development Mechanism Program in China [1213007],Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China(Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province); Clean Development Mechanism Program in China,This work was supported in part by Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant LY12D03001 and in part by the Clean Development Mechanism Program in China under Grant 1213007.,,33,4,4,7,52,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",1939-1404,2151-1535,,IEEE J-STARS,IEEE J.

Prominent conceptualizations of transformation suggest that crises like the pandemic may create windows of opportunity for transformative change, such as the scope and scale of systemic change required to address the climate crisis. Additionally, envisioning positive futures plays an important role in building shared commitment and inspiration for transformation, particularly if conducted in transformative spaces where actors with diverse framings and vulnerabilities can experiment with new practices and ideas. Emerging research demonstrates the potential for experimental futures methods to create such transformative spaces. In this study, we aimed to create a transformative space that builds inspiration and shared commitment for climate action while exploring the unique inflection point created by the COVID-19 pandemic. To do so, we constructed a highly creative participatory futuring process for participants involved in climate action in the Kitchener-Waterloo Region (Canada) to imagine desirable futures emerging from the crisis. Because we needed to move quickly and accommodate pandemic-related constraints to explore this unique moment in time, we also aimed to reflect on considerations for an agile futures practice in service of transformative change. Through a virtual workshop and surveys, participants envisioned future worlds in which local seeds of positive climate futures emerging during COVID-19 become mainstream. They also wrote science fiction stories of characters navigating those worlds. Observing artists depicted the futures through visual art. Reflections on our experience facilitating the process generated five considerations for a more agile futures practice in service of transformative change: adapt the ideal process to context-specific opportunities and constraints, align with strategic partners while ensuring everyone is in the room, underpin the process with values, treat everyone's contributions as knowledge, and contextualize the role of inspiration as an outcome.","[Lazurko, Anita] Univ Waterloo, Sch Environm Resources & Sustainabil, Waterloo, ON, Canada; [Keys, Patrick W.] Colorado State Univ, Sch Global Environm Sustainabil, Ft Collins, CO USA",University of Waterloo; Colorado State University,"Lazurko, A (corresponding author), Univ Waterloo, Sch Environm Resources & Sustainabil, Waterloo, ON, Canada.",,,,Balaton Group (The International Network of Resource Information Centers),Balaton Group (The International Network of Resource Information Centers),"The research was funded in part by the Balaton Group (The International Network of Resource Information Centers).

Therefore, this article aims to characterise the relevant studies, define a comparative framework to identify the current state-of-the-art and the gaps in applied general equilibrium models. Firstly, the systematic review found a total of 301 research articles from Scopus and Web of Science databases and finally analysed 154 articles based on inclusion and exclusion criteria from 67 refereed journals. The review analysis found that application of CGE model is very vital in addressing climate change mitigation issues at the national, regional and global levels. However, China attracted the most substantial research interests followed by the USA, India and Australia, among others, which are in line with their share of greenhouse gas emissions in the world. Most of the research themes focus on the carbon tax, emission reduction target, emission trading, renewable energy, energy efficiency, and carbon capture and storage as primary drivers of low carbon economy. Nevertheless, there is a trend of employing more static CGE model compared to the dynamic CGE, although application of the latter has a limitation of providing right inputs to the macroeconomic policy. Finally, research directions and gaps envision other complementary models such as dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) and agent-based model (ABM) for proper policy interventions.","[Babatunde, Kazeem Alasinrin; Said, Fathin Faizah] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Econ & Management, Sch Econ, Ukm Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia; [Babatunde, Kazeem Alasinrin] Alhikmah Univ, Coll Management Sci, Dept Econ, Ilorin, Nigeria; [Begum, Rawshan Ara] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Inst Climate Change IPI, Ukm Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia",Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia; Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia,"Babatunde, KA (corresponding author), Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Econ & Management, Sch Econ, Ukm Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia.",,"Begum, Rawshan A/C-9837-2012; Alasinrin Babatunde, Kazeem/HGF-2392-2022","Begum, Rawshan A/0000-0003-2478-8317; ",FRGS [FRGS/1/2013/TK07/UKM/02/4]; Arus Perdana [AP-2015-009],FRGS; Arus Perdana,The authors greatly acknowledged the research grants of FRGS (FRGS/1/2013/TK07/UKM/02/4) and Arus Perdana (AP-2015-009).,,124,103,103,41,201,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",1364-0321,1879-0690,,RENEW SUST ENERG REV,Renew.

This study analyzes these framing processes in Brazil and Colombia by examining the translation of global prescriptions into tangible policy instruments. It combines a policy translation analytical framework with the processes of layering, drift, conversion, and replacement. It draws on semi-structured interviews with institutional actors and it examines (i) agenda-setting and elaboration of the NAPs, (ii) the different roles and interactions of sector-based actors in agriculture and land-use, and (iii) the distinct concepts of adaptation put forward and their subsequent policy outputs in relation to national institutional trajectories. In Brazil and Colombia, the initial ambition of mainstreaming climate adaptation into sector-based policies resulted in a divergent patchwork of policies, which is characterized by limited means, capacity and other resources dedicated to coordination and implementation. Key policy insights The study examines the processes through which international prescriptions influence concrete policy outcomes. The ambition of establishing new climate policies resulted in a patchwork of policies, characterized by low levels of coordination and limited means of implementation. In Brazil, adaptation goals were layered in with existing sector-based policies with some operational capacity, while in Colombia the national adoption of several adaptation goals has not translated into implementation. The article addresses the politics of policy transfer, knowledge interpretation, and policy change. It considers the possibility of actors interacting to reframe concepts according to their ideas and interests, while also aiming to assure stability. Climate policy requires efforts to alter policy priorities at the sector level, to create cross-sectoral balances, and strengthen the means of implementation, actions which intimately relate to power relations and institutional settings.","[Milhorance, Carolina; Sabourin, Eric; Le Coq, Jean-Francois] Agr Res Ctr Int Dev CIRAD, Dept Environm & Soc, Art Dev Res Unit, Montpellier, France; [Milhorance, Carolina; Sabourin, Eric] Univ Brasilia, Ctr Sustainable Dev CDS UnB, Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Howland, Fanny; Le Coq, Jean-Francois] Int Ctr Trop Agr Alliance Biodivers CIAT, Cali, Colombia; [Sabourin, Eric; Le Coq, Jean-Francois] Montpellier Univ Excellence MUSE, Montpellier, France",CIRAD; Universidade de Brasilia; Universite de Montpellier,"Milhorance, C (corresponding author), Ctr Int Dev & Agr Res CIRAD, UMR Art Dev Dept Environm & Societies, Bur 309,TA C 113,73 Rue Jean Francois Breton, F-34398 Montpellier 5, France.",carolina.milhorance@cirad.fr,,"Howland, Fanny/0000-0002-0778-2741; Le Coq, Jean-Francois/0000-0003-1084-1973; SABOURIN, Eric/0000-0002-1171-2535",CNPq/Capes/FAPDF under the project INCT [16-2014 ODISSEIA]; French Association Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) [ANR-17-CE03-0005],CNPq/Capes/FAPDF under the project INCT; French Association Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)(French National Research Agency (ANR)),"This work was supported by CNPq/Capes/FAPDF under the project INCT [16-2014 ODISSEIA], by the French Association Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) under projects ARTIMIX [ANR-17-CE03-0005].",,78,3,3,6,6,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-3062,1752-7457,,CLIM POLICY,Clim.

In the present study, we designed wheat ideotypes based on the state-of-the-art knowledge in crop physiology to increase genetic yield potential for the 2050-climate, as projected by the HadGEM2 global climate model for the RCP8.5 emission scenario, in two high-wheat-productive countries, viz. the United Kingdom (UK) and New Zealand (NZ). Wheat ideotypes were optimized to maximize yield potential for both water-limited (IW2050) and potential (IP2050) conditions by using Sirius model and exploring the full range of cultivar parameters. On average, a 43-51% greater yield potential over the present winter wheat cv. Claire was achieved for IW2050 in the UK and NZ, whereas a 51-62% increase was obtained for IP2050. Yield benefits due to the potential condition over water-limitation were small in the UK, but 13% in NZ. The yield potentials of wheat were 16% (2.6 t ha(-1)) and 31% (5 t ha(-1)) greater in NZ than in the UK under 2050-climate in water-limited and potential conditions respectively. Modelling predicts the possibility of substantial increase in genetic yield potential of winter wheat under climate change in high productive countries. Wheat ideotypes optimized for future climate could provide plant scientists and breeders with a road map for selection of the target traits and their optimal combinations for wheat improvement and genetic adaptation to raise the yield potential.","[Senapati, Nimai; Semenov, Mikhail A.] Rothamsted Res, Dept Plant Sci, Harpenden AL5 2JQ, Herts, England; [Brown, Hamish E.] New Zealand Inst Plant & Food Res, Private Bag 4704, Christchurch, New Zealand",UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC); Rothamsted Research; New Zealand Institute for Plant & Food Research Ltd,"Senapati, N (corresponding author), Rothamsted Res, Harpenden AL5 2JQ, Herts, England.",nimai.senapati@rothamsted.ac.uk; hamish.brown@plantandfood.co.nz; mikhail.semenov@rothamsted.ac.uk,"Senapati, Nimai/R-4353-2017; Semenov, Mikhail/HCI-8667-2022; Semenov, Mikhail/W-8060-2019","Senapati, Nimai/0000-0002-0238-6694; Semenov, Mikhail/0000-0002-1561-7113; ",Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) Designing Future Wheat programme [BB/P016855/1]; BBSRC [BBS/E/C/000I0220] Funding Source: UKRI,Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) Designing Future Wheat programme(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)); BBSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)),The authors are grateful to anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments which helped us to enrich and improve the manuscript.

The circumstances in which pattern scaling methods are capable of delivering on this promise are explored by quantifying its performance in an idealized setting. Given a large ensemble that is assumed to sample the full range of variability and provide quantitative decision-relevant information, the soundness of applying the pattern scaling methodology to generate decision relevant climate scenarios is explored. Pattern scaling is not expected to reproduce its target exactly, of course, and its generic limitations have been well documented since it was first proposed. In this work, using as a particular example the quantification of the risk of heat waves in Southern Europe, it is shown that the magnitude of the error in the pattern scaled estimates can be significant enough to disqualify the use of this approach in quantitative decision-support. This suggests that future application of pattern scaling in climate science should provide decision makers not just a restatement of the assumptions made, but also evidence that the methodology is adequate for purpose in practice for the case under consideration.","[Lopez, Ana] CCCEP, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Lopez, Ana; Suckling, Emma B.; Smith, Leonard A.] London Sch Econ, Ctr Anal Time Series, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Lopez, A (corresponding author), CCCEP, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",ana.lopez@univ.ox.ac.uk,,,LSE's Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment; ESRC Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy; Economic and Social Research Council; Munich Re; NERC EQUIP project [NE/H003479/1]; ESRC [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: UKRI; NERC [NE/H003479/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: researchfish; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/H003479/1] Funding Source: researchfish,LSE's Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment; ESRC Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Munich Re; NERC EQUIP project; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"This research was supported by the LSE's Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment and the ESRC Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy, funded by the Economic and Social Research Council and Munich Re.

The methods are tested in a pseudo-proxy experiment (PPE) setup using state-of-the-art climate models (CMIP5 Earth system models) and reanalysis data from the COBE2 SST data set. The methods were applied in the virtual reality provided by global climate simulations and reanalysis data to reconstruct the past NA SSTs using pseudo-proxy records that mimic the statistical characteristics and network of Arctica islandica. The multivariate linear regression methods evaluated here are principal component regression and canonical correlation analysis. Differences in the skill of the climate field reconstruction (CFR) are assessed according to different calibration periods and different proxy locations within the NA basin. The choice of the climate model used as a surrogate reality in the PPE has a more profound effect on the CFR skill than the calibration period and the statistical reconstruction method. The differences between the two methods are clearer for the MPI-ESM model due to its higher spatial resolution in the NA basin. The pseudo-proxy results of the CCSM4 model are closer to the pseudo-proxy results based on the reanalysis data set COBE2. Conducting PPEs using noise-contaminated pseudo-proxies instead of noise-free pseudo-proxies is important for the evaluation of the methods, as more spatial differences in the reconstruction skill are revealed. Both methods are appropriate for the reconstruction of the temporal evolution of the NA SSTs, even though they lead to a great loss of variance away from the proxy sites. Under reasonable assumptions about the characteristics of the non-climate noise in the proxy records, our results show that the marine network of Arctica islandica can be used to skillfully reconstruct the spatial patterns of SSTs at the eastern NA basin.","[Pyrina, Maria; Wagner, Sebastian; Zorita, Eduardo] Helmholtz Zentrum Geesthacht, Inst Coastal Res, D-21502 Geesthacht, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Zentrum Geesthacht - Zentrum fur Material- und Kustenforschung,"Pyrina, M (corresponding author), Helmholtz Zentrum Geesthacht, Inst Coastal Res, D-21502 Geesthacht, Germany.",maria.pyrina@hzg.de,,"Wagner, Sebastian/0000-0001-5603-3897; Pyrina, Maria/0000-0002-4890-0732",European Union [604802],European Union(European Commission),"The work was carried out in the framework of the European Initial Marie Curie Training Network ARAMACC (Annually Resolved Archives of Marine Climate Change).

SEASONAL STATISTICS,JOURNAL OF CLIMATE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Important surface observations such as the daily maximum and minimum temperature, daily precipitation, and cloud ceilings often have localized characteristics that are difficult to reproduce with the current resolution and the physical parameterizations in state-of-the-art General Circulation climate Models (GCMs). Many of the difficulties can be partially attributed to mismatches in scale, local topography, regional geography and boundary conditions between models and surface-based observations. Here, we present a method, called climatological projection by model statistics (CPMS), to relate GCM grid-point free-atmosphere statistics, the predictors, to these important local surface observations. The method can be viewed as a generalization of the model output statistics (MOS) and perfect prog (PP) procedures used in numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. It consists of the application of three statistical methods: 1) principle component analysis (PCA), 2) canonical correlation, and 3) inflated regression analysis. The PCA reduces the redundancy of the predictors. The canonical correlation is used to develop simultaneous relationships between linear combinations of the predictors, the canonical variables, and the surface-based observations. Finally, inflated regression is used to related the important canonical variables to each of the surface-based observed variables. We demonstrate that even an early version of the Oregon State University two-level atmospheric GCM (with prescribed sea surface temperature) produces free-atmosphere statistics than can, when standardized using the model's internal means and variances (the MOS-like version of CPMS), closely approximate the observed local climate. When the model data are standardized by the observed free-atmosphere means and variances (the PP version of CPMS), however, the model does not reproduce the observed surface climate as well. Our results indicate that in the MOS-like version of CPMS the differences between the output of a ten-year GCM control run and the surface-based observations are often smaller than the differences between the observations of two ten-year periods. Such positive results suggest that GCMs may already contain important climatological information that can be used to infer the local climate.",,,"KARL, TR (corresponding author), NOAA,NATL ENVIRONM SATELLITE DATA & INFORMAT SERV,NATL CLIMAT DATA CTR,FED BLDG,ASHEVILLE,NC 28801, USA.",,,,,,,,0,243,250,0,13,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693",0894-8755,,,J CLIMATE,J.

Nowadays there are different approaches in terms of conservation of cultural heritage, while a specific European standardization activity in this field of conservation is essential to acquire a common unified scientific solution to the problems relevant to the cultural property. The cultural heritage monuments are exposed to weather and influence of various environmental parameters. Physicals, chemicals and biological factors interact with constitutive materials inducing changes both in its compositional and structural characteristics. A certain aspect of matter transformation is due to the metabolic activity connected with the growth of living organisms. A scientific approach is essential for the conservation of cultural heritage as a preliminary basis that will ensure effective planning of ordinary and extraordinary maintenance works, as well to assure their efficacy and durability. The scope of EN 15757:2010 is to establish standards in the field of the processes, practices, methodologies and documentation of conservation of tangible cultural heritage to support its preservation, protection and maintenance and to enhance its significance. In this paper we are focused on standardization on the characterization of deterioration processes and environmental conditions for cultural monuments in Albania (both church and mosque, primarily, but not only), with regard to indoor environmental climate conditions (temperature, relative humidity) very helpful with regards of conservation, restoration, repair and maintenance.

However, their hydrological balance and possible future changes in river flow remain poorly understood because of high meteorological variability, physical inaccessibility, and the complex interplay between climate, cryosphere, and hydrological processes. Here, we use a state-of-the art glacio-hydrological model informed by data from high-altitude observations and the latest climate change scenarios to quantify the climate change impact on water resources of two contrasting catchments vulnerable to changes in the cryosphere. The two study catchments are located in the Central Andes of Chile and in the Nepalese Himalaya in close vicinity of densely populated areas. Although both sites reveal a strong decrease in glacier area, they show a remarkably different hydrological response to projected climate change. In the Juncal catchment in Chile, runoff is likely to sharply decrease in the future and the runoff seasonality is sensitive to projected climatic changes. In the Langtang catchment in Nepal, future water availability is on the rise for decades to come with limited shifts between seasons. Owing to the high spatiotemporal resolution of the simulations and process complexity included in the modeling, the response times and the mechanisms underlying the variations in glacier area and river flow can be well constrained. The projections indicate that climate change adaptation in Central Chile should focus on dealing with a reduction in water availability, whereas in Nepal preparedness for flood extremes should be the policy priority.","[Ragettli, Silvan] ETH, Inst Environm Engn, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Immerzeel, Walter W.] Univ Utrecht, Dept Phys Geog, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands; [Pellicciotti, Francesca] Northumbria Univ, Dept Geog, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 8ST, Tyne & Wear, England",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Utrecht University; Northumbria University,"Ragettli, S (corresponding author), ETH, Inst Environm Engn, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland.",ragettli@ifu.baug.ethz.ch,,"Immerzeel, Walter/0000-0002-2010-9543; Ragettli, Silvan/0000-0001-9817-8541",Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs; US Agency for International Development High Mountain Glacier Watershed Programs Climber-Scientist Grant [CCRDCS0010]; Swiss National Science Foundation (Understanding Contrasts in High Mountain Hydrology in Asia project); Swiss State Secretariat for Education and Research [CJRP-1003]; European Research Council under the European Union's Horizon Research and Innovation Program [676819]; South Asia Research Hub of the UK Department for International Development,Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs; US Agency for International Development High Mountain Glacier Watershed Programs Climber-Scientist Grant(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); Swiss National Science Foundation (Understanding Contrasts in High Mountain Hydrology in Asia project); Swiss State Secretariat for Education and Research; European Research Council under the European Union's Horizon Research and Innovation Program; South Asia Research Hub of the UK Department for International Development,"We are grateful to all the people who assisted with the data collection.

J,"Angeler, DG",,,,"Angeler, David G.",,,Viewing biodiversity through the lens of science ... and art!,SPRINGERPLUS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Art; Science; Ecology; Biodiversity; Beta diversity; Visuals; Pixels; Education; Sustainability; Statistics,CLIMATE-CHANGE; BETA-DIVERSITY; FRAMEWORK; SUBLIME; CULTURE; FUTURE,"With global environmental sustainability at the crossroads, approaches are needed to build an ecologically literate culture for collective societal navigation through the intricacies of swift environmental change. This paper demonstrates a transdisciplinary approach, grounded at the intersection between the arts and sciences, to increase awareness and understanding of the current biodiversity crisis. It focuses on one aspect of biodiversity, beta diversity, which examines how sets of animal and plant species differ between habitats. Theory and real examples of beta diversity of aquatic animal and plant species from dried-out ponds in Mediterranean Spain are presented in pixelized visuals. These visuals are artistic expression of and build the prior knowledge about beta diversity, which is scrutinized subsequently with statistical analyses to support the artistic approach with an objectively identified and numerically underpinned presentation of structure in the visuals. The choice to examine beta diversity in theory and reality first through art and then through science is deliberate. Combined, these aspects examine biodiversity through an ecocentric, rather than a species-and habitat centric view, incorporate elements of surprise (how can aquatic species in dry ecosystems survive), and reduce uncertainty (by providing a common numerical yardstick for interpreting the visuals). Together they can optimize a goal-directed learning process in the viewers necessary for making judgments, inducing affective reactions, and facilitating memory and decision making. The approach presented here provides an integral qualitative and quantitative model useful for a broader inductive-deductive education process towards finding sustainable solutions as our planet moves swiftly to a future without historical analogue. Combined art-sciences approaches, as the one presented here, are useful to facilitate citizens' comprehension of the scientific and potential policy dimensions of environmental change, including biodiversity problems, especially because it is the general public that bears the costs of transformation and adaptation measures.","[Angeler, David G.] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Aquat Sci & Assessment, Box 7050, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden",Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences,"Angeler, DG (corresponding author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Aquat Sci & Assessment, Box 7050, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden.",david.angeler@slu.se,"Campos, Valquíria/B-8801-2012","Campos, Valquíria/0000-0001-6568-9935",,,,,62,5,5,4,31,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2193-1801,,,SPRINGERPLUS,SpringerPlus,26-Jul,2016,,,,,,,1174,10.1186/s40064-016-2831-z,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40064-016-2831-z,,,11,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;HCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics,DT7AU,27512633,"Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000381637800007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Although models predict a future narrowing of the ITCZ, uncertainties remain large regarding its future position, with most past work focusing on zonal-mean shifts. Here we use projections from 27 state-of-the-art climate models and document a robust zonally varying ITCZ response to the SSP3-7.0 scenario by 2100, with a northward shift over eastern Africa and the Indian Ocean and a southward shift in the eastern Pacific and Atlantic oceans. The zonally varying response is consistent with changes in the divergent atmospheric energy transport and sector-mean shifts of the energy flux equator. Our analysis provides insight about mechanisms influencing the future position of the tropical rain belt and may allow for more-robust projections of climate change impacts.","[Mamalakis, Antonios; Foufoula-Georgiou, Efi] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Randerson, James T.; Yu, Jin-Yi; Pritchard, Michael S.; Magnusdottir, Gudrun; Levine, Paul A.; Foufoula-Georgiou, Efi] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Smyth, Padhraic] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Comp Sci, Irvine, CA USA; [Smyth, Padhraic] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Stat, Irvine, CA USA; [Yu, Sungduk] Yale Univ, Dept Geol & Geophys, New Haven, CT USA",University of California System; University of California Irvine; University of California System; University of California Irvine; University of California System; University of California Irvine; University of California System; University of California Irvine; Yale University,"Mamalakis, A; Foufoula-Georgiou, E (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.;Foufoula-Georgiou, E (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",amamalak@uci.edu; efi@uci.edu,"Yu, Jin-Yi/AAU-9089-2020","Yu, Jin-Yi/0000-0001-6156-7623; Smyth, Padhraic/0000-0001-9971-8378; Levine, Paul/0000-0002-1248-6920; Foufoula-Georgiou, Efi/0000-0003-1078-231X; Magnusdottir, Gudrun/0000-0001-6079-5886","National Science Foundation (NSF) under the TRIPODS+ programme [DMS-1839336]; NSF under the EAGER programme [ECCS-1839441]; NASA's Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) programme [80NSSC19K0684]; DOE's Office of Science RUBISCO Science Focus Area; NSF Climate and Large-scale Dynamics (CLD) programme [AGS-1833075, AGS-173416, AGS-1912134]; NSF [DGE1633631]; UCI; NASA's IDS program; NASA's CMS program",National Science Foundation (NSF) under the TRIPODS+ programme(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NSF under the EAGER programme; NASA's Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) programme; DOE's Office of Science RUBISCO Science Focus Area(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); NSF Climate and Large-scale Dynamics (CLD) programme; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); UCI; NASA's IDS program; NASA's CMS program,"Partial support for this research was provided to E.F.-G., J.T.R. and P.S. by the National Science Foundation (NSF) under the TRIPODS+ programme (DMS-1839336).

It combines institutional data and semi-structured interviews with policymakers to elucidate the process of implementation of these instruments, with a focus on the enabling factors and (missing) connections in the policy mix. Coordination gaps between the enabling instruments and climate adaptation instruments, caused by institutional and political factors, resulted in implementation issues and a policy mix inclined to promote social vulnerability goals rather than sustainable production and climate risk management. The analysis provides insights into the challenges of achieving a coherent policy framework. It also contributes to the policy mix literature by defining criteria for a typology of interactions between policy instruments and by unpacking the functional ties of instruments in the policy mix. Key policy insights Policy coordination is a political rather than technical process. The policy mix includes climate adaptation instruments, enabling instruments, and complementary instruments, each of which play different functional roles. Both formal and informal mechanisms connect policy instruments. A policy mix analysis must be specific to both context and time. A network analysis of instrument interactions can provide methods and comparative outlooks that are more robust. Implementation gaps between the enabling instruments and climate adaptation instruments influence the resulting policy mix, which tends to promote achievement of social vulnerability goals rather than sustainable production and climate risk management.","[Milhorance, Carolina; Sabourin, Eric; Mendes, Priscylla] Univ Brasilia CDS Unb, Ctr Sustainable Dev, Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Sabourin, Eric; Le Coq, Jean-Francois] Agr Res Ctr Int Dev CIRAD UMR Art Dev, Montpellier, France; [Sabourin, Eric; Le Coq, Jean-Francois] Montpellier Univ Excellence MUSE, Montpellier, France; [Le Coq, Jean-Francois] Int Ctr Trop Agr CIAT CGIAR, Cali, Colombia",Universite de Montpellier; Universite de Montpellier; CGIAR,"Milhorance, C (corresponding author), Univ Brasilia CDS Unb, Ctr Sustainable Dev, Brasilia, DF, Brazil.",cmilhorance@gmail.com,"Milhorance, Carolina/AAY-4743-2020","Milhorance, Carolina/0000-0002-3290-8596; Le Coq, Jean-Francois/0000-0003-1084-1973; Mendes, Priscylla/0000-0001-7074-680X; SABOURIN, Eric/0000-0002-1171-2535",CNPq (Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico); CAPES (Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior); FAP-DF (Fundacao de Apoio a Pesquisa do Distrito Federal) under the project INCT [162014 ODISSEIA]; ANR (Agence Nationale de la Recherche) [ARTIMIX ANR-17-CE03-0005],CNPq (Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); CAPES (Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior)(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); FAP-DF (Fundacao de Apoio a Pesquisa do Distrito Federal) under the project INCT(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)Fundacao de Apoio a Pesquisa do Distrito Federal (FAPDF)); ANR (Agence Nationale de la Recherche)(French National Research Agency (ANR)),"This work was supported by CNPq (Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico); CAPES (Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior); FAP-DF (Fundacao de Apoio a Pesquisa do Distrito Federal) under the project INCT n degrees 162014 ODISSEIA, and by the ANR (Agence Nationale de la Recherche), under project ARTIMIX ANR-17-CE03-0005.",,65,13,13,10,33,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-3062,1752-7457,,CLIM POLICY,Clim.

Nevertheless, the amplitude of these TSI changes is very small so that recent reconstruction data suggest that low frequency variations in the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and in the thermohaline circulation may have amplified, in the North Atlantic sector and mostly in winter, the radiative changes due to TSI variations. In this study we use a state-of-the-art climate model to simulate the last millennium. We find that modelled variations of surface temperature in the Northern Hemisphere are coherent with existing reconstructions. Moreover, in the model, the low frequency variability of this mean hemispheric temperature is found to be correlated at 0.74 with the solar forcing for the period 1001-1860. Then, we focus on the regional climatic fingerprint of solar forcing in winter and find a significant relationship between the low frequency TSI forcing and the NAO with a time lag of more than 40 years for the response of the NAO. Such a lag is larger than the around 20-year lag suggested in other studies. We argue that this lag is due, in the model, to a northward shift of the tropical atmospheric convection in the Pacific Ocean, which is maximum more than four decades after the solar forcing increase. This shift then forces a positive NAO through an atmospheric wave connection related to the jet-stream wave guide. The shift of the tropical convection is due to the persistence of anomalous warm SST forcing the anomalous precipitation, associated with the advection of warm SST by the North Pacific subtropical gyre in a few decades. Finally, we analyse the response of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation to solar forcing and find that the former is weakened when the latter increases. Changes in wind stress, notably due to the NAO, modify the barotropic streamfunction in the Atlantic 50 years after solar variations. This implies a wind-driven modification of the oceanic circulation in the Atlantic sector in response to changes in solar forcing, in addition to the variations of the thermohaline circulation.","[Swingedouw, D.; Terray, L.; Cassou, C.] CERFACS, F-31057 Toulouse, France; [Voldoire, A.; Salas-Melia, D.] CNRM, F-31057 Toulouse, France; [Swingedouw, D.; Servonnat, J.] CEA Saclay, LSCE IPSL, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France",CERFACS; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; CEA; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Swingedouw, D (corresponding author), CEA Saclay, LSCE IPSL, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France.",Didier.Swingedouw@lsce.ipsl.fr,"Kushnir, Yochanan/B-4472-2013; Swingedouw, Didier/D-1408-2010; Terray, Laurent/B-8056-2008; Swingedouw, Didier/M-5471-2019; CASSOU, Christophe/AAP-6409-2020","Swingedouw, Didier/0000-0002-0583-0850; Terray, Laurent/0000-0001-5512-7074; Swingedouw, Didier/0000-0002-0583-0850; ",French Agency for National Research (ANR),French Agency for National Research (ANR)(French National Research Agency (ANR)),"We thank Hugues Goosse, Joel Guiot and Christoph Raible for very constructive discussion about the results presented here.

GLACINDIA is a multi-disciplinary project and unique, not only due to the participating institutions bringing together scientists from Norway and India, but also for the logistical challenges and the state-of-the-art science. In this particular case, we aim for detailed reconstructions of past glacier activity over the Holocene time scale (last similar to 11,700 years) emphasising different sediment parameters by means of statistical methods as well as integrating chronological uncertainties along with uncertainties of reconstructed glacier variability. We also aim to do oxygen isotope measurements on the pore water in addition to extracting lipids for leaf wax analysis in the sediment cores. A multi-proxy data set of lake sediments consisting of sedimentological, physical and geochemical analyses reflects all types of processes in the lake catchment that delivers sediments to the lake. By means of principal component analysis (PCA), it is possible to extract the main process(es) driving the sediment variability in distal glacier-fed lakes. The common signal extracted from the sediment data is indicative of the main process in the catchment and is interpreted to vary in concert with the changing glacier equilibrium-line altitude over the region. Lake Chandra Tal has, based on earlier retrieved results from cosmogenic isotope dating, the potential to contain sediments deposited over the last 13,000 years, continuously deposited since the deglaciation after the glaciers retreated during the Late Glacial period. We, therefore, aim to do continuous reconstruction of climate with high temporal resolution for a better dynamical understanding of past climate. Understanding the controls of decadal, multi-decadal and century scale climate variability is crucial for many aspects of climate predictability. Climate reconstructions are important in order to validate Earth system modelling scenarios for the future; but there is at present a scarcity of consistent observational records from the Himalayas that can be used to understand and validate the existence of climate dynamics in this region.","[Bakke, Jostein; Vasskog, Kristian; Nesje, Atle] Univ Bergen, Dept Earth Sci, N-5020 Bergen, Norway; [Bakke, Jostein; Vasskog, Kristian; Nesje, Atle] Univ Bergen, Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, N-5020 Bergen, Norway; [Ramanathan, A.

The framework rests on stochastic and physical downscaling techniques that permit one-way crossing 10(6)-10(0) m scales, with a specific emphasis on 'nesting' hydraulic assessments within a coarser-scale hydrologic model. Future climate projections for the location of Manchester watershed (MI) are obtained from an ensemble of General Circulation Models of the 3rd phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project database and downscaled to a point scale using a weather generator. To represent the natural variability of historic and future Climates, we generated continuous time series of 300 years for the locations of 3 meteorological stations located in the vicinity of the ungauged basin. To make such a multi-scale approach computationally feasible, we identified the months of May and August as the periods of specific interest based on ecohydrologic considerations. Analyses of historic and future simulation results for the identified periods show that the same median rainfall obtained by accounting for climate natural variability triggers hydrologically-mediated non-uniqueness in flow variables resolved at the hydraulic scale. An emerging challenge is that uncertainty initiated at the hydrologic scale is not necessarily preserved at smaller-scale flow variables, because of non-linearity of underlying physical processes, which ultimately can mask climate uncertainty. We stress the necessity of augmenting climate-level uncertainties of emission scenario, multi-model, and natural variability with uncertainties arising due to non-linearities in smaller-scale processes.

Its exact value is rarely known because its estimation requires a long integration time of several thousand years. We propose a method to estimate an accurate value of the equilibrium response from fully coupled climate models at a reasonable computational cost. Using this method, our state-of-the-art climate model CNRM-CM6-1 reaches a stationary state after only few hundred of years of integration. This Fast-Forward method consists of an optimal two-step forcing pathway designed using the framework of a two-layer energy balance model.

Over the past two centuries, substantial progress in our understanding of the seabed and environmental conditions has been made by studies of seabed sedimentology, hydrodynamics, and habitat mapping. As part of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) Wealth from Oceans flagship program, we have been involved in a five year study to investigate and predict the effect of possible climate change scenarios on the seabed over the next 50 yr. As an initial phase of this project we have taken the southeast region of the Australian seabed as our study area. The seabed responses to current climate and possible future climatic conditions over the next 50 yr have been simulated for the first time by a state-of-the-art numerical model, Sedsim. We found: (1) that the contribution of river-carried sediment (redistributed by marine processes) to the region's seabed, even with the wettest predicted climate change, is limited. In general, the fluvial sediment in the southeast region cannot keep pace with the action of strong marine forces, such as waves and currents. Therefore, most of the seabed suffers from erosion due to lack of sediment to distribute. This situation would get worse if the local climate swings toward the high-energy side. (2) The generally high wave energy, significant tidal currents, and frequent surges of wind-driven currents make the local seabed highly mobile and sensitive to hydrodynamic change. (3) The change of turbidite activity among different climate scenarios is insignificant with regard to the number of submarine slope failures, the areas affected, and the seabed median grain size.","[Li, F.; Dyt, C.

The World Bank's decision tree framework (DTF) for confronting climate uncertainty is one incarnation of those paradigms. In order to better represent the state of the art in climate change risk assessment and evaluation techniques, this paper proposes: (1) an update to the DTF, replacing its climate change stress test with a multidimensional stress test; and (2) the addition of a Bayesian network framework that represents joint probabilistic behavior of uncertain parameters as sensitivity factors to aid in the weighting of scenarios of concern (the combination of conditions under which a water system fails to meet its performance targets). Using the updated DTF, water system planners and project managers would be better able to understand the relative magnitudes of the varied risks they face, and target investments in adaptation measures to best reduce their vulnerabilities to change. Next steps for the DTF include enhancements in: modeling of extreme event risks; coupling of human-hydrologic systems; integration of surface water and groundwater systems; the generation of tradeoffs between economic, social, and ecological factors; incorporation of water quality considerations; and interactive data visualization.","[Ray, Patrick Alexander] Univ Cincinnati, Dept Chem & Environm Engn, Cincinnati, OH 45221 USA; [Taner, Mehmet Umit; Wi, Sungwook; Freeman, Sarah St George; Brown, Casey Matthew] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Schlef, Katherine Elizabeth] Consortium Univ Adv Hydrol Sci Inc, Cambridge, MA USA; [Khan, Hassaan Furqan] Stanford Univ, Earth Syst Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",University System of Ohio; University of Cincinnati; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; Stanford University,"Ray, PA (corresponding author), Univ Cincinnati, Dept Chem & Environm Engn, Cincinnati, OH 45221 USA.",patrick.ray@uc.edu,,"Ray, Patrick/0000-0001-9495-2317; St. George Freeman, Sarah/0000-0002-4620-6026",,,,,157,12,12,2,42,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1093-474X,1752-1688,,J AM WATER RESOUR AS,J.

It is therefore key to evaluate ENSO simulations in state-of-the-art numerical models used to study past, present, and future climate. Recently, the Pacific Region Panel of the International Climate and Ocean: Variability, Predictability and Change (CLIVAR) Project, as a part of the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP), led a community-wide effort to evaluate the simulation of ENSO variability, teleconnections, and processes in climate models. The new CLIVAR 2020 ENSO metrics package enables model diagnosis, comparison, and evaluation to 1) highlight aspects that need improvement; 2) monitor progress across model generations; 3) help in selecting models that are well suited for particular analyses; 4) reveal links between various model biases, illuminating the impacts of those biases on ENSO and its sensitivity to climate change; and to 5) advance ENSO literacy. By interfacing with existing model evaluation tools, the ENSO metrics package enables rapid analysis of multipetabyte databases of simulations, such as those generated by the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phases 5 (CMIP5) and 6 (CMIP6). The CMIP6 models are found to significantly outperform those from CMIP5 for 8 out of 24 ENSO-relevant metrics, with most CMIP6 models showing improved tropical Pacific seasonality and ENSO teleconnections. Only one ENSO metric is significantly degraded in CMIP6, namely, the coupling between the ocean surface and subsurface temperature anomalies, while the majority of metrics remain unchanged.","[Planton, Yann Y.; Guilyardi, Eric; Vialard, Jerome] Sorbonne Univ, LOCEAN IPSL, CNRS IRD MNHN, Paris, France; [Guilyardi, Eric] Univ Reading, Natl Ctr Atmospher Sci Climate, Reading, France; [Wittenberg, Andrew T.] NOAA, Geophys Fluid Dynam Lab, Princeton, NJ USA; [Lee, Jiwoo; Gleckler, Peter J.] Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, Livermore, CA 94550 USA; [Bayr, Tobias] GEOMAR Helmholtz Ctr Ocean Res, Kiel, Germany; [McGregor, Shayne; Power, Scott] Monash Univ, Sch Earth Atmosphere & Environm, Clayton, Vic, Australia; [McPhaden, Michael J.] NOAA, Pacific Marine Environm Lab, Seattle, WA 98115 USA; [Power, Scott] Australian Bur Meteorol, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Roehrig, Romain; Voldoire, Aurore] Univ Toulouse, CNRS, Meteo France, CNRM, Toulouse, France",Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle (MNHN); UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory; Helmholtz Association; GEOMAR Helmholtz Center for Ocean Research Kiel; Monash University; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Bureau of Meteorology - Australia; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Meteo France; Universite de Toulouse,"Planton, YY (corresponding author), Sorbonne Univ, LOCEAN IPSL, CNRS IRD MNHN, Paris, France.",yann.planton@noaa.gov,"Guilyardi, Eric/D-4868-2011; Wittenberg, Andrew T/G-9619-2013; Planton, Yann/GQB-1463-2022; Vialard, Jérôme/C-2809-2008","Guilyardi, Eric/0000-0002-2255-8625; Wittenberg, Andrew T/0000-0003-1680-8963; Vialard, Jérôme/0000-0001-6876-3766; Planton, Yann/0000-0002-9664-8180; McGregor, Shayne/0000-0003-3222-7042","Agence Nationale de la Recherche ARISE project [ANR-18-CE01-0012]; Belmont project GOTHAM [ANR-15-JCLI-0004-01]; European Commission's H2020 Programme Infrastructure for the European Network for Earth System Modelling Phase 3 (IS-ENES3) project [824084]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) [429334714]; Australian Research Council [FT160100162]; National Research Council (NRC) Research Associateship Award at NOAA/PMEL; U.S. Department of Energy by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory via the Regional and Global Climate Modeling Program [DE-AC52-07 NA27344]; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science Innovative and Novel Computational Impact on Theory and Experiment (DOE INCITE) program, and Office of Biological and Environmental Research (BER); National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Climate Program Office; NOAA Physical Sciences Laboratory; CNES; National Science Foundation Physical Oceanography Program; NOAA/GFDL; NOAA/NCEP; NOAA/NESDIS; NASA GMAO; NASA MAP program; Physical Oceanography program; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD; France); CMIP modeling groups","Agence Nationale de la Recherche ARISE project(French National Research Agency (ANR)); Belmont project GOTHAM; European Commission's H2020 Programme Infrastructure for the European Network for Earth System Modelling Phase 3 (IS-ENES3) project; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); National Research Council (NRC) Research Associateship Award at NOAA/PMEL; U.S. Department of Energy by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory via the Regional and Global Climate Modeling Program(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science Innovative and Novel Computational Impact on Theory and Experiment (DOE INCITE) program, and Office of Biological and Environmental Research (BER)(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Climate Program Office(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); NOAA Physical Sciences Laboratory; CNES(Centre National D'etudes Spatiales); National Science Foundation Physical Oceanography Program(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)); NOAA/GFDL(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); NOAA/NCEP; NOAA/NESDIS(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); NASA GMAO(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); NASA MAP program(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); Physical Oceanography program(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD; France); CMIP modeling groups","The authors are grateful to H.

They composed poems and made paintings about the coast and sea as means of conveying their views about climate change. Content analysis of these compositions using a count of word descriptors revealed that particular themes or messages tended to recur in both poems and paintings. Both of them depicted Ghana as a beautiful place that was suffering from the negative impacts of climate change. There were, nevertheless, differences in the ways in which these two art forms were used to convey messages. For example, poems used words to stress the national importance of the seas, their value as assets of God's creation and the need for everyone to work together in order to manage them at sustainable levels. Paintings, on the other hand, used images to identify specific causes of pollution and climate change and to illustrate the uses of the seas.

Not only could they bring science to life in the classroom, but they could provide powerful mechanisms whereby young people communicate their own views on environmental issues to other members of society, especially non-specialists.","[Gebbels, Susan] Newcastle Univ, Dove Marine Lab, Sch Marine Sci & Technol, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE30 4PZ, Tyne & Wear, England; [Hunter, Jo] Epinay Business & Enterprise Sch, S Tyneside, England; [Nunoo, Francis K.

From an activist position that considers art and the environment as a participatory collective model, this article argues for a reappraisal of human influence in complex human-non-human interactional systems. More specifically, this text, as a component of GRETA//A PLASTIC POEM, approaches oceanic and sea pollution (notably the dumping of plastics) as a form of environmental degradation that has generated a space inhabited by varied and vibrant forms of matter. In this way, the sea and the sonic space show strikingly similar potentials. In turn, Plastic Activism, which advocates for a world free of plastic pollution and its toxic impacts, is adopted as an underlying ethos and aesthetic response, with single-use plastics being incorporated into the performance artwork itself. Relational to this enquiry is sensing how we use our bodies to explore the potential thousands of distinct material ecologies embodying a sonic performative practice, especially combining the materiality of artistic and political action in public space and focal practices. In this way, the sonic space becomes comparable to a sea of sound, where complex assemblages of matter exist and intra-act to challenge the discordant systems and dynamics in which we are currently entangled.","[Espana Keller, Juliana] Alhaurin Grande, Malaga, Andalucia, Spain",,"Keller, JE (corresponding author), Alhaurin Grande, Malaga, Andalucia, Spain.",info@julianaespanakeller.com,,,,,,,36,0,0,0,1,"SINGIDUNUM UNIV, FAC MEDIA & COMMUNICATIONS",BELGRADE,"KARADORDEVA 65, BELGRADE, 11000, SERBIA",2217-9666,2406-1654,,AM J ART MEDIA STUD,Am.

Systematic and in-depth research into these issues is seldom conducted. In this research we combine qualitative and quantitative studies and use six state-of-the-art energy-economy analysis models and four long term scenarios to explore the distribution of regional contributions for climate change mitigation in the future. We focus on the energy investment gap and policy cost. The study's conclusion is that, under the assumption of carbon tax as a source of energy investment from 2025, the global positive energy investment gap in the climate change mitigation scenario will not appear until around 2035-2040. Asia and OECD90+EU (Countries from the OECD 1990, EU and its candidates) are the regions that will have a significant direct impact on the global energy investment gap under climate policies in the future. However, from the perspective of the relative value (the percentage of the energy investment gap relative to the energy investment in the Current Policies (CPol) scenario), Asia will contribute the most to the global energy investment gap under the climate stability policies. Under the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) scenario, Asia will contribute the most in the near term and REF will contribute the most in the medium term. The findings show that OECD90+EU will bear more cost in the pledges scenario, and Asia will bear more cost in the climate stability scenarios in the medium term. Contrary to the common sense expectation, the developed regions will contribute the least in terms of the proportion of the policy cost to the respective economic aggregates under the climate stability scenarios in the medium and long term, but the opposite is true in the developing regions. By and large, from the perspective of the current climate change mitigation policies, the developed regions and developing regions will achieve a win-win situation in the long run, but the relative contribution of the developed regions is not as great as was previously expected. These novel findings should prove to be useful to policy makers when developing transition strategies for climate change mitigation.","[Sun, Hongjie; Niu, Shuwen] Lanzhou Univ, Coll Earth & Environm Sci, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China; [Sun, Hongjie] Lanzhou Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Lanzhou 730050, Gansu, Peoples R China; [Sun, Hongjie] Southeast Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Nanjing 211189, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xiqiang] Chinese Acad Sci, Qilian Alpine Ecol & Hydrol Res Stn, Key Lab Ecohydrol Inland River Basin, Northwest Inst Ecoenvironm & Resources, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China",Lanzhou University; Lanzhou University of Technology; Southeast University - China; Chinese Academy of Sciences,"Sun, HJ; Niu, SW (corresponding author), Lanzhou Univ, Coll Earth & Environm Sci, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China.;Sun, HJ (corresponding author), Lanzhou Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Lanzhou 730050, Gansu, Peoples R China.;Sun, HJ (corresponding author), Southeast Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Nanjing 211189, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",sunhj15@lzu.edu.cn; shuwenn@lzu.edu.cn; wangxq@lzb.ac.cn,,"Sun, Hongjie/0000-0003-1254-9837",Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [17LZUJBWZX013]; European Union [642147],Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); European Union(European Commission),"This study was financially supported by Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (Grant no. 17LZUJBWZX013).

Modelling approaches that could support adaptive management strategies seem to be called for, not only as climate change denotes increased economic uncertainty but also because new and more reliable information becomes available as time passes and climate changes. The paper (1) provides a broad overview of state-of-the-art methods for optimal decision making under risk and uncertainty in forestry and (2) elaborates on the possible use of these methods in adaptive forest management under climate change. A survey of the current literature is carried out to identify approaches and developments that may prove most promising in relation to different challenges to the adaptive management of forest ecosystems under climate change. Most studies focusing on changing, typically increasing, risks in forest management under climate change tend to build on existing approaches about changes in risk levels contingent on climate change scenarios. Finally, we discuss what to emphasise in future studies to improve the understanding of adaptive forest management and decision support tools needed to cope with climate change.","[Yousefpour, Rasoul; Jacobsen, Jette Bredahl; Thorsen, Bo Jellesmark; Meilby, Henrik] Univ Copenhagen, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark; [Hanewinkel, Marc] Eidg Forsch Anstalt WSL, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Oehler, Karoline] European Forest Inst, Reg Off EFICENT OEF, D-79100 Freiburg, Germany","University of Copenhagen; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape Research","Yousefpour, R (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen, Rolighedsvej 23, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark.",ry@life.ku.dk,"Thorsen, Bo Jellesmark J/K-8770-2014; hanewinkel, marc/E-5639-2011; Jacobsen, Jette Bredahl/C-9354-2015; Meilby, Henrik/E-1404-2015","Thorsen, Bo Jellesmark J/0000-0002-3305-8343; hanewinkel, marc/0000-0003-4081-6621; Jacobsen, Jette Bredahl/0000-0002-1313-6228; Meilby, Henrik/0000-0002-3770-3880",,,,,144,140,142,7,112,SPRINGER FRANCE,PARIS,"22 RUE DE PALESTRO, PARIS, 75002, FRANCE",1286-4560,1297-966X,,ANN FOREST SCI,Ann.

Yet, a global implementation of such high carbon prices is unlikely to be politically feasible in the short term. Instead, most climate policies enacted so far are technology policies or fragmented and moderate carbon pricing schemes. This paper shows that ambitious climate targets can be kept within reach until 2030 despite a sub-optimal policy mix. With a state-of-the-art energy-economy model we quantify the interactions and unique effects of three major policy components: (1) a carbon price starting at US$7 per tonne of CO2 in 2015 to incentivize economy-wide mitigation, flanked by (2) support for low-carbon energy technologies to pave the way for future decarbonization, and (3) a moratorium on new coal-fired power plants to limit stranded assets. We find that such a mix limits the efficiency losses compared with the optimal policy, and at the same time lowers distributional impacts. Therefore, we argue that this instrument mix might be a politically more feasible alternative to the optimal policy based on a comprehensive carbon price alone.","[Bertram, Chrisoph; Luderer, Gunnar; Pietzcker, Robert C.; Schmid, Eva; Kriegler, Elmar; Edenhofer, Ottmar] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany; [Bertram, Chrisoph; Edenhofer, Ottmar] Tech Univ Berlin, D-10623 Berlin, Germany; [Edenhofer, Ottmar] Mercator Res Inst Global Commons & Climate Change, D-10829 Berlin, Germany",Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; Technical University of Berlin,"Bertram, C (corresponding author), Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Telegraphenberg A31, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany.",bertram@pik-potsdam.de,"Kriegler, Elmar/I-3048-2016; Luderer, Gunnar/ABF-2346-2020; Edenhofer, Ottmar/E-1886-2013; Luderer, Gunnar/G-2967-2012; Bertram, Christoph/AAT-9651-2020","Kriegler, Elmar/0000-0002-3307-2647; Luderer, Gunnar/0000-0002-9057-6155; Edenhofer, Ottmar/0000-0001-6029-5208; Luderer, Gunnar/0000-0002-9057-6155; Bertram, Christoph/0000-0002-0933-4395; Pietzcker, Robert/0000-0002-9403-6711",European Union [308329],European Union(European Commission),The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) under grant agreement no. 308329 (ADVANCE).,,30,81,82,4,57,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1758-678X,1758-6798,,NAT CLIM CHANGE,Nat.

The climate of southern Africa is predicted to be severely affected by such changes. With agriculture noted as the continent's largest economic sector, issues such as food security and land degradation are in the forefront. In the light of such concerns we review the current literature to investigate if agroforestry systems (AFS) are a suitable response to the challenges besetting traditional agricultural caused by a changing climate. The benefits bestowed by AFS are multiple, offering ecosystem services, influence over crop production and positive impacts on rural livelihoods through provisioning and income generation. Nevertheless, knowledge gaps remain. We identify outstanding questions requiring further investigation such as the interplay between trees and crops and their combination, with a discussion of potential benefits.

The study has constructed a state-of-the-art, end-to-end data processing sequence from raw climate model output to a suite of hydrologic modelling products that are served to the user community from a web-accessible database. A calibrated 1/16 degree latitude-longitude resolution implementation of the VIC hydrologic model over the Columbia River basin was used to produce historical simulations and 77 future hydrologic projections associated with three different statistical downscaling methods and three future time periods (2020s, 2040s, and 2080s). Key products from the study include summary data for about 300 river locations in the PNW and monthly Geographic Information System products for 21 hydrologic variables over the entire study domain. Results from the study show profound changes in spring snowpack and fundamental shifts from snow and mixed-rain-and-snow to rain-dominant behaviour across most of the domain. Associated shifts in streamflow timing from spring and summer to winter are also evident in basins with significant snow accumulation in winter (for the current climate). Potential evapotranspiration increases over most of the PNW in summer because of rising temperatures; however, actual evapotranspiration is reduced in all but a few areas of the domain because evapotranspiration is mostly water limited in summer, and summer precipitation decreases in the simulations. Simulated widespread increases in soil moisture recharge in fall and winter in areas with significant snow accumulation in winter (for the current climate) support hypotheses of increased landslide risk and sediment transport in winter in the future. Simulations of floods and extreme low flows increase in intensity for most of the river sites included in the study. The largest increases in flooding are in mixed-rain-and-snow basins whose current mid-winter temperatures are within a few degrees of freezing. The CBCCSP database has been a valuable public resource that has dramatically reduced costs in a number of high-visibility studies in the PNW and western United States focused on technical coordination and planning.","[Hamlet, Alan F.] Univ Notre Dame, Dept Civil & Environm Engn & Earth Sci, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Elsner, Marketa McGuire] US Bur Reclamat, Tech Serv Ctr 86 68210, Denver, CO 80225 USA; [Mauger, Guillaume S.; Lee, Se-Yeun; Tohver, Ingrid; Norheim, Robert A.] Univ Washington, Climate Impacts Grp, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Lee, Se-Yeun; Norheim, Robert A.] Univ Washington, Sch Environm & Forest Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",University of Notre Dame; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Hamlet, AF (corresponding author), Univ Notre Dame, Dept Civil & Environm Engn & Earth Sci, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA.",alan.hamlet.1@nd.edu,,"Mauger, Guillaume/0000-0003-1465-7671","PCIC at the University of Victoria, British Columbia","PCIC at the University of Victoria, British Columbia","Special thanks to Kurt Unger and Ken Slattery, who were the primary architects of the CBCCSP at WDOE.

We find that the effective climate sensitivity is a non-monotonic function of CO2 in both models, reaching a minimum at 3xCO(2) for GISS-E2.1-G, and 4xCO(2) for CESM-LE. A similar non-monotonic response is found in Northern Hemisphere surface temperature, sea-ice, precipitation, the latitude of zero precipitation-minus-evaporation, and the strength of the Hadley cell. Interestingly, the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation collapses when non-monotonicity appears and does not recover for larger CO2 forcings. Analyzing the climate response over the same CO2 range with slab-ocean versions of the same models, we demonstrate that the climate system's non-monotonic response is linked to ocean dynamics.","[Mitevski, Ivan; Chemke, Rei; Polvani, Lorenzo M.] Columbia Univ, Dept Appl Phys & Appl Math, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Orbe, Clara; Nazarenko, Larissa] NASA, Goddard Inst Space Studies, New York, NY 10025 USA; [Nazarenko, Larissa] Columbia Univ, Ctr Climate Syst Res, New York, NY USA; [Polvani, Lorenzo M.] Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY USA",Columbia University; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; Columbia University; Columbia University,"Mitevski, I (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Dept Appl Phys & Appl Math, New York, NY 10027 USA.",im2527@columbia.edu,,"Mitevski, Ivan/0000-0001-9172-3236",NASA FINESST Grant [80NSSC20K1657]; US National Science Foundation,NASA FINESST Grant; US National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This work was supported by NASA FINESST Grant 80NSSC20K1657.

Drawing on ethnographic observations, in-depth interviews, and surveys of members of Latino student organizations, I chart the distinct ways in which Latino students interact with one another and arrive at particular ethnic identities on different campuses. By applying ethnoracialization theory to mesolevel settings, I examine how students respond to external ascription as they co-construct and negotiate their ethnic-racial understandings. I identify three different patterns by which students deploy panethnic boundaries, specifically, as they adopt and define identity labels: inclusive Latino identification signifying solidarity above all, qualified Latino identification mediated through specific organizational membership, and the rejection of panethnic identities. I consider how the organizational context of each campus provides a distinct racial climate that mediates student interactions and potentially shapes the disparate identity outcomes that result. The findings suggest that, beyond providing academic experiences, colleges also provide Latino students with disparate lessons regarding who they are and where they fit in the ethnoracial hierarchy.","[Reyes, Daisy Verduzco] Univ Connecticut, Dept Sociol, Storrs, CT 06269 USA",University of Connecticut,"Reyes, DV (corresponding author), Dept Sociol, 344 Mansfield Rd Unit 1068, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.",daisy.reyes@uconn.edu,,,"University of California, All Campus Consortium for Research on Diversity; Center for the Study of Democracy at the University of California Irvine; Center for Organizational Research at the University of California Irvine; Center for Research on Latinos in Global Society at the University of California Irvine","University of California, All Campus Consortium for Research on Diversity; Center for the Study of Democracy at the University of California Irvine; Center for Organizational Research at the University of California Irvine; Center for Research on Latinos in Global Society at the University of California Irvine","I would like to thank the University of California, All Campus Consortium for Research on Diversity, the Center for the Study of Democracy, the Center for Organizational Research, and the Center for Research on Latinos in Global Society at the University of California Irvine for financial support for this project.

However, since the TP is located in the subtropics and its climate responses consist of both tropical and extratropical characteristics, a natural question to ask is how the TP would affect the ASM if it were shifted to different latitudes. A series of experiments with a state-of-the-art Earth system model demonstrates that the current location of the TP is not optimal for intensifying the ASM. When the TP is moved southward, the tropical South Asian monsoon (SAM) intensifies, associated with strengthened thermally driven atmospheric circulation, while the subtropical East Asian monsoon (EAM) weakens. When the TP is located in higher-than-current latitudes, on the other hand, the SAM weakens and the EAM intensifies. In particular, when the TP shifts northward by 8 degrees of latitude, the Asian continent witnesses the heaviest summer monsoon rainfall. Changes in the meridional location of the plateau cause substantial differences in atmospheric circulation and water vapor transport, and thus in monsoon rainfall. Significance StatementThe existence of the Tibetan Plateau (TP) enhances the Asian summer monsoon; however, the optimal positions of the TP for affecting the monsoon and its various components are unknown. This study shows that the different TP locations exert different influences on the monsoon. When the TP is shifted southward, the South Asian monsoon intensifies while the East and Southeast Asian monsoons weaken. When the TP is shifted northward, the South Asian monsoon weakens constantly while the East and Southeast Asian monsoons strengthen before they become weaker when the plateau is shifted by 12 degrees of latitude. Much of the Asian continent would witness the heaviest monsoon rainfall when the TP is shifted northward by 8 degrees of latitude.","[Wang, Junbin; Yang, Song; Wang, Ziqian] Sun Yat sen Univ, Sch Atmospher Sci, Zhuhai, Peoples R China; [Wang, Junbin; Yang, Song; Lu, Mengmeng; Wang, Ziqian] Southern Marine Sci & Engn Guangdong Lab Zhuhai, Zhuhai, Peoples R China; [Yang, Song; Lu, Mengmeng; Wang, Ziqian] Sun Yat sen Univ, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Climate Change, Nat Disaster Studies, Zhuhai, Peoples R China; [Li, Zhenning] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Div Environm & Sustainabil, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Lu, Mengmeng] Chinese Acad Meteorol Sci, Inst Climate Syst, State Key Lab Severe Weather, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wu, Guoxiong] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, State Key Lab Numer Modeling Atmospher Sci & Geoph, Beijing, Peoples R China","Sun Yat Sen University; Southern Marine Science & Engineering Guangdong Laboratory; Sun Yat Sen University; Hong Kong University of Science & Technology; Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences (CAMS); Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS","Yang, S (corresponding author), Sun Yat sen Univ, Sch Atmospher Sci, Zhuhai, Peoples R China.;Yang, S (corresponding author), Southern Marine Sci & Engn Guangdong Lab Zhuhai, Zhuhai, Peoples R China.;Yang, S (corresponding author), Sun Yat sen Univ, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Climate Change, Nat Disaster Studies, Zhuhai, Peoples R China.",yangsong3@mail.sysu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [42088101, 42175023]; Guangdong Major Project of Basic and Applied Basic Research [2020B0301030004]; Guangdong Province Key Laboratory for Climate Change and Natural Disaster Studies [2020B1212060025]; China Scholarship Council joint Ph.D. training program",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Guangdong Major Project of Basic and Applied Basic Research; Guangdong Province Key Laboratory for Climate Change and Natural Disaster Studies; China Scholarship Council joint Ph.D. training program(China Scholarship Council),"We appreciate the effective discussions with Prof. John C.

State-of-the-art ice-ocean models, by contrast, tend to simulate a surface layer that is saltier and less stratified than observed. Here, we examine decadal changes to seasonal processes that may contribute to this wide-reaching model bias using climate model simulations from the Community Earth System Model and below-ice observations from the Arctic Ice Dynamics Joint Experiment in 1975 and Ice Tethered Profilers in 2006-2012. In contrast to the observations, the models simulate salinity profiles that show relatively little variation between 1975 and 2012. We demonstrate that this bias can be mainly attributed to unrealistically deep vertical mixing in the model, creating a surface layer that is saltier than observed. The results provide insight for climate model improvement with broad implications for Arctic sea ice and ecosystem dynamics.","[Rosenblum, E.; Stroeve, J.

Climate change is an increasingly complex challenge for these territories. Tackling climate change, moreover, in a sustainable way, is a priority in the European Union, which has set several ambitious short- and long-term mitigation, adaptation, and sustainability targets. It is a central issue of how society can respond to the climate emergency that is affected by and depends on the vertical and horizontal interrelations among different stakeholders, organizations, governance actors, etc., and their activities. Countries, regions, counties, and cities around the world react by developing climate strategies. The operationalization of the high-level political agreements and discourses is uncertain, and the policies in practice should also be evaluated on regional and city levels, just as the milestones of related strategic planning processes fostering local adaptive capacity. According to regional and urban governance, it is pivotal addressing not only mitigation but adaptation issues to be able to foster sustainable regional development, also considering the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) specified in the Agenda 2030. Adaptation to climate change is increasingly becoming a priority for policy action. It also has high relevance to find the synergic interrelations towards an adaptive future. This paper evaluates the recent changes in Hungarian regional and urban planning in relation to climate policy approach and reports a state of adaptation oriented spatial planning on NUTS-3 (Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics) and LAU-1 (Local Administrative Units) levels. The results are based on the collection of all relevant climate change-related strategic documents on these levels in Hungary and on the analysis of specific information. There is a lack of knowledge related to the comprehensive adaptation policy and planning on regional and local levels in Hungary. The results of the evaluation show the state-of-art knowledge related to possible adaptation pathways and the various engagement level for climate policy approach on different spatial levels in Hungary. In the case of the examined research area, the development of more mitigation oriented planning documents and low level of adaptation measures and monitoring process management tools is seen as critical.","[Csete, Maria Szalmane; Buzasi, Attila] Budapest Univ Technol & Econ, Dept Environm Econ, Magyar Tudosok Krt 2, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary",Budapest University of Technology & Economics,"Csete, MS (corresponding author), Budapest Univ Technol & Econ, Dept Environm Econ, Magyar Tudosok Krt 2, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary.",csete@eik.bme.hu,"Buzási, Attila/AAG-1339-2020; Csete, Maria/AAP-1198-2021","Buzási, Attila/0000-0002-4088-9276; Csete, Maria/0000-0001-7170-9402",Higher Education Excellence Program of the Ministry of Human Capacities in the frame of the Water sciences & Disaster Prevention research area of the Budapest University of Technology and Economics (BME FIKP-VIZ),Higher Education Excellence Program of the Ministry of Human Capacities in the frame of the Water sciences & Disaster Prevention research area of the Budapest University of Technology and Economics (BME FIKP-VIZ),The research reported in this paper was supported by the Higher Education Excellence Program of the Ministry of Human Capacities in the frame of the Water sciences & Disaster Prevention research area of the Budapest University of Technology and Economics (BME FIKP-VIZ).,,62,4,4,2,8,HUNGARIAN METEOROLOGICAL SERVICE,BUDAPEST,"PO BOX 38, BUDAPEST, H-1525, HUNGARY",0324-6329,,,IDOJARAS,Idojaras,APR-JUN,2020,2,,SI,,253,276,,10.28974/idojaras.2020.2.6,http://dx.doi.org/10.28974/idojaras.2020.2.6,,,24,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,MA3BR,,"gold, Green Accepted",,,12/21/22,WOS:000541793200007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Photovoltaic (PV) cells may be mounted above or onto the existing or traditional roofing or wall systems. However, BIPV systems replace the outer building envelope skin, i.e., the climate screen, hence serving simultanously as both a climate screen and a power source generating electricity. Thus, BIPV may provide savings in materials and labor, in addition to reducing the electricity costs. Hence, for the BIPV products, in addition to specific requirements put on the solar cell technology, it is of major importance to have satisfactory or strict requirements of rain tightness and durability, where building physical issues like e.g., heat and moisture transport in the building envelope also have to be considered and accounted for. This work, from both a technological and scientific point of view, summarizes briefly the current state-of-the-art of BIPV, including both BIPV foil, tiles, modules and solar cell glazing products, and addresses possible research pathways for BIPV in the years to come.","[Jelle, Bjorn Petter] SINTEF Bldg & Infrastruct, Dept Mat & Struct, NO-7465 Trondheim, Norway; [Jelle, Bjorn Petter] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Civil & Transport Engn, NO-7491 Trondheim, Norway",SINTEF; Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Jelle, BP (corresponding author), SINTEF Bldg & Infrastruct, Dept Mat & Struct, NO-7465 Trondheim, Norway.;Jelle, BP (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Civil & Transport Engn, NO-7491 Trondheim, Norway.",bjorn.petter.jelle@sintef.no,,"Jelle, Bjorn Petter/0000-0003-2026-6394",Research Council of Norway,Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway),This work has been supported by the Research Council of Norway and several partners through the research project Building Integrated Photovoltaics for Norway (BIPV Norway).,,190,70,74,6,100,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1996-1073,,ENERGIES,Energies,JAN,2016,1,,,,,,21,10.3390/en9010021,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en9010021,,,30,Energy & Fuels,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Energy & Fuels,DC8WV,,"Green Accepted, Green Submitted, Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000369501500003,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study has two objectives: (1) to examine how various types of teacher-student conflict affects students' innovative competence and (2) to identify the mediating role of a psychological safety climate in the association between conflict and students' innovative competence. To achieve the objectives, we used evidence from 1207 university students. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that conflicts were associated with students' innovative competence, and the mediation role of a psychological safety climate is significant. Specifically, the results revealed that Cognitive Conflict had significant positive effects on students' innovative competence, whereas Affective Conflict had a significant negative effect on students' innovative competence. In addition, we clarified a psychological safety climate as the boundary condition for the relationship between conflict and students' innovative competence.","[Xie, Ruoying; Yue, Linkai; Ye, Lin; Liu, Yin] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Media & Commun, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Jinzhang] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, USC SJTU Inst Cultural & Creat Ind, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China; [An, Dong] Southeast Univ, Sch Art, Nanjing 211189, Peoples R China",Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Southeast University - China,"Yue, LK (corresponding author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Media & Commun, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China.;Jiang, JZ (corresponding author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, USC SJTU Inst Cultural & Creat Ind, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China.",yuraxie@sjtu.edu.cn; jzjiang@sjtu.edu.cn; yuelinkai@sjtu.edu.cn; ye_lin@sjtu.edu.cn; donganphd@126.com; liuyin0531@sjtu.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [70872072],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, grant number 70872072.",,49,0,0,10,10,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

The field survey and excavations in the area found cupule panel fragments almost down to bedrock; Acheulian industry to Oldowan-like industry including several hammerstones. Early work demonstrated that at least some of the petroglyphs were of the earliest documented occupation of the region. Exfoliated pieces and boulders from the rock surface were found in the sediments, some bearing cupules and grooves. Here a detailed methodological procedure is enacted consisting of luminescence dating reinforced by mineralogical issues, where the latter secures credibility of the former. The optically stimulated luminescence (OSL), of the luminescence versus depth profiles, following blue LED and Single Aliquot Regeneration (SAR) technique of quartz, was applied following the surface luminescence dating versions to date this fallen rock. The two dose profiles from the sandstone studies provided an average date for the fallen boulder in the 13th millennium, providing a constrained terminus post quem. Surface patina and intrusion of (Fe, Mn) aluminosilicate weathering solution was examined in both luminescence profiles, properly dealt with issues of X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy-Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), X-Ray Florescence-Energy Dispersive mode (XRF/ED), Cathodoluminescence, stereomicroscope, thin sections optical microscopy (OM) and microdosimetry. Analytical petrographic results aided interpretation of luminescence data obtained. From the above rationale the two ages obtained from the two profiles can be considered close within errors, that coincide with the drastic change from last glaciation transition to the milder climate of the Holocene and the sudden end of colder Younger Dryas in similar to 13th Ka BP, having an impactonthe weathering, erosion and exfoliation of rock surfaces caused by the significant temperature change and the resulted thermal differential expansion of rocks (onset of the Holocene).

Tourism as a whole, especially transport related to arrivals and departures as well as tourism accommodation per se, significantly contributes to global warming through greenhouse gas emissions and a significant carbon footprint. The aim of the study was to investigate the beliefs and attitudes of Croatian tourism industry executives on climate change and the impact of tourist accommodation on climate change. The questionnaire was sent to the email addresses of all tourist accommodations in Croatia. In particular, all categorized hotels, hotel resorts, campsites and marinas were contacted.. Out of the total number of questionnaires submitted, 283 questionnaires were fully completed, representing 26.1% of respondents, including 4.60% of the members of the management or supervisory boards, 46.65% of directors or heads of facilities and management, 19% of quality control managers and 33.56% of middle management staff. After statistical analysis, it can be concluded that managers in tourist accommodation facilities have established beliefs and attitudes about climate change and the connection between climate change and tourist accommodation. When comparing the three components of the ABC Model of Attitudes, it has been shown that among managers the most powerful and positively oriented component was the behavioural component, followed by the cognitive component and the equally positive emotional component. Knowledge of managers' attitudes and beliefs is extremely important in order to anticipate, plan, and direct the use of mitigation measures for the negative impact of climate change so that all subjects directly or indirectly linked to tourism can adapt in a suitable way to the new situation and minimize the negative consequences of climate change as much as possible.","[Racz, Aleksandar] Univ Appl Hlth Sci, Mlinarska 38, Zagreb, Croatia; [Jurdana, Dora Smolcic; Grdic, Zvonimira Sverko] Univ Rijeka, Fac Tourism & Hospitality Management, Rijeka, Croatia",University of Rijeka,"Racz, A (corresponding author), Univ Appl Hlth Sci, Mlinarska 38, Zagreb, Croatia.",aleksandar.racz@zvu.hr; doras@fmtu.hr; zgrdic@fmtu.hr,,,,,,,23,0,0,2,3,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2020,,,,,1300,1314,,,,,,15,"Business; Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BS5EP,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000728402200095,View Full Record in Web of Science

The rate of increase of precipitation extremes in the extratropics is consistent across global climate models, but the rate of increase in the tropics varies widely, depending on the model used(3). The behaviour of tropical precipitation can, however, be constrained by observations of interannual variability in the current climate(4-6). Here I show that, across state-of-the-art climate models, the response of tropical precipitation extremes to interannual climate variability is strongly correlated with their response to longer-term climate change, although these responses are different. I then use satellite observations to estimate the response of tropical precipitation extremes to the interannual variability. Applying this observational constraint to the climate simulations and exploiting the relationship between the simulated responses to interannual variability and climate change, I estimate a sensitivity of the 99.9th percentile of daily tropical precipitation to climate change at 10% per K of surface warming, with a 90% confidence interval of 6-14% K-1. This tropical sensitivity is higher than expectations for the extratropics(3) of about 5% K-1. The inferred percentage increase in tropical precipitation extremes is similar when considering only land regions, where the impacts of extreme precipitation can be severe.","MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"O'Gorman, PA (corresponding author), MIT, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",.og@mit.edu,,"O'Gorman, Paul/0000-0003-1748-0816",NASA Earth Science MEaSUREs DISCOVER Project; NSF [AGS-1148594]; NASA [NNX-11AO92G],NASA Earth Science MEaSUREs DISCOVER Project; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)),"I am grateful to C.

Here, the direct effects of BC emissions from India (IDBC) and China (CNBC) are investigated in East Asia during summer using the state-of-the-art regional climate model RegCM4. In summer, IDBC and CNBC account for approximately 30% and 46% of the total BC emissions in Asia, respectively. The total BC column burden from the two countries and corresponding TOA effective radiative forcing are 1.58 mg m(-2) and +1.87 W m(-2) in East Asia, respectively. The regional air temperature increases over 0.3 K at maximum and precipitation decreases 0.028 mm day(-1) on average. Individually, IDBC and CNBC each can bring about rather different effects on regional climate. IDBC can result in a cooling perturbation accompanied by a substantially increased cloud amount and scattering aerosol loading, resulting in a complex response in the regional precipitation, while CNBC can lead to regional warming, and further induce a local flood in northern China or drought in southern China depending on the opposite but significant circulation anomalies. CNBC plays a dominant role in modulating the regional climate over East Asia due to its higher magnitude, wider coverage, and stronger climate feedback. The direct effect of the total BC from both countries is not a linear combination of that of IDBC and CNBC individually, suggesting that the regional climate responses are highly nonlinear to the emission intensity or aerosol loading, which may be greatly related to the influences of the perturbed atmospheric circulations and climate feedback.","[Chen, Huimin; Zhuang, Bingliang; Liu, Jane; Li, Shu; Wang, Tijian; Xie, Xiaodong; Xie, Min; Li, Mengmeng; Zhao, Ming] Nanjing Univ, Jiangsu Collaborat Innovat Ctr Climate Change, Sch Atmospher Sci, CMA NJU Joint Lab Climate Predict Studies, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Liu, Jane] Univ Toronto, Dept Geog & Planning, Toronto, ON, Canada",Nanjing University; University of Toronto,"Zhuang, BL (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ, Jiangsu Collaborat Innovat Ctr Climate Change, Sch Atmospher Sci, CMA NJU Joint Lab Climate Predict Studies, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",blzhuang@nju.edu.cn,"Zhuang, Bingliang/R-3898-2018","Zhuang, Bingliang/0000-0001-7092-7096; Xie, Min/0000-0002-0697-926X","National Key R&D Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China [2019YFA0606803, 41675143, 2017YFC0209803, 41621005, 2014CB441203, 2016YFC0203303, 91544230]",National Key R&D Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This work was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (2019YFA0606803, 41675143, 2017YFC0209803, 41621005, 2014CB441203, 2016YFC0203303, 91544230).",,98,2,2,1,26,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0894-8755,1520-0442,,J CLIMATE,J.

Processing has been central to lesbian identity since the 1970s, partly as an inside joke but seriously as well. In art and activism, a focus on process can be a way of centering ethical ways of relating: a good process considers feelings, power dynamics, and who gets paid. Process is as important as the final outcome. Queer environmental futurity draws on our histories of art, activism, and resilience, to confront the unthinkable futures of climate change. Drawing on Allyson Mitchell and Deirdre Logue's massive interactive installation, Killjoy's Kastle, this essay argues that the particularities of lesbian processing might inform how to deal with climate change.","[LeBel, Sabine] Univ New Brunswick, Dept Culture & Media Studies, 252 Marshall Davray Hall,10 Mackay Dr, Fredericton, NB E3B 5A3, Canada",University of New Brunswick,"LeBel, S (corresponding author), Univ New Brunswick, Dept Culture & Media Studies, 252 Marshall Davray Hall,10 Mackay Dr, Fredericton, NB E3B 5A3, Canada.",slebel@unb.ca,,,,,,,38,0,0,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1089-4160,1540-3548,,J LESBIAN STUD,J.

This work presents an optimization framework that develops a long-term planning tool tailored for use by academic institutions. Further, we highlight the potential for ecological solutions and land management as economically competitive actions for campuses. The presented tool, known as DCARB (Designing Climate Action and Regulations for sustainaBility), features an ability to quickly optimize multiple pathways towards carbon neutrality based on user-input and parameter variability. We showcase DCARB through an application for The Ohio State University to demonstrate the outputs of the tool based on current projects outlined in the institution's climate action plan. Additionally, parameter variability is analyzed to explore how solutions might change due to data uncertainty or application to other campuses. The results encourage urgent action as they can provide cheaper pathways towards neutrality, including immediate consideration of land-based actions. Additionally, applications of the tool highlight challenges for achieving neutrality such as a reliance on market-based offsets, future market volatility, proper carbon credit accounting, and planning for future social and behavioral actions.","[Charles, Michael; Vattyam, Vivek; Bakshi, Bhavik R.] Ohio State Univ, William G Lowrie Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Columbus, OH USA; [Bakshi, Bhavik R.] 151 W Woodruff Ave, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Bakshi, BR (corresponding author), 151 W Woodruff Ave, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",bakshi.2@osu.edu,,"Charles, Michael/0000-0002-9524-6737; Bakshi, Bhavik/0000-0002-6604-8408",National Sci-ence Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship [DGE-1343012]; Sustainability Institute at The Ohio State University,National Sci-ence Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Sustainability Institute at The Ohio State University,Acknowledgments This material is based upon work supported by the National Sci-ence Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship under Grant No. DGE-1343012 and partial funding from the Sustainability Institute at The Ohio State University.

However, measures like improved insulation and airtightness may increase their vulnerability to overheating and climate change may further worsen their performance in the future. This paper investigates indoor overheating risks brought by climate change in retrofitted historic buildings and proposes effective adaptation strategies. Firstly, local weather conditions are analysed to identify homogenous climatic zones. For each climatic zone, a business-as-usual emissions scenario is adopted, and most representative regional climate models are selected to obtain hourly output of future climate projection. A comparative study is adopted where typical alpine residential buildings, Portici house, are simulated with regard to future energy use and indoor thermal state using the dynamic model in EnergyPlus. Energy use and indoor thermal conditions are compared before and after energy retrofit, as well as under present and future climate conditions. The results demonstrate that retrofit interventions could significantly improve energy efficiency of historic buildings in both present and future scenarios. A change in climate together with retrofit interventions will, however, result in higher risk of indoor overheating in South Tyrol. Potential negative side effects of energy retrofit could be controlled by adopting adequate shading and ventilation approaches that minimise, or eliminate, the risk of overheating during high temperature periods while optimising historic buildings' energy performance.","[Hao, Lingjun] Hebei Univ Technol, Ctr Urban & Rural Renewal, Dept Architecture & Art Design, Built Heritage Conservat, Tianjin 300131, Peoples R China; [Herrera-Avellanosa, Daniel; Troi, Alexandra] Eurac Res, Inst Renewable Energy, I-39100 Bolzano, Italy; [Del Pero, Claudio] Politecn Milan, Dept Architecture Built Environm & Construct Engn, I-20133 Milan, Italy",Hebei University of Technology; European Academy of Bozen-Bolzano; Polytechnic University of Milan,"Hao, LJ (corresponding author), Hebei Univ Technol, Ctr Urban & Rural Renewal, Dept Architecture & Art Design, Built Heritage Conservat, Tianjin 300131, Peoples R China.",lingjun.hao@hebut.edu.cn; daniel.herrera@eurac.edu; claudio.delpero@polimi.it; alexandra.troi@eurac.edu,,"Herrera-Avellanosa, Daniel/0000-0002-9661-8387; Del Pero, Claudio/0000-0003-4205-2805; Troi, Alexandra/0000-0002-7450-4688",Hebei Key Research Institute of Humanities and Social Sciences at Universities,Hebei Key Research Institute of Humanities and Social Sciences at Universities,The APC was funded by Hebei Key Research Institute of Humanities and Social Sciences at Universities.,,51,1,1,7,7,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3417,,APPL SCI-BASEL,Appl.

A long-term (1870-2005) temperature and precipitation dataset was compiled for the northeastern United States to assess how the climate has changed. Adjustments were made to daily temperatures to account for changes in mean, variance, and skewness resulting from inhomogeneities, but precipitation data were not adjusted. Trends in 17 temperature and 10 precipitation indices at 40 stations were evaluated over three time periods-1893-2005, 1893-1950, and 1951-2005 and over 1870-2005 for a subset of longer-term stations. Temperature indices indicate strong warming with increases in the frequency of warm events (e.g., warm nights and warm summer days) and decreases in the frequency of cold events (e.g., ice days, frost days, and the cold spell duration indicator). The strongest warming is exhibited in the decrease in frost days and the increase in growing season length. Although maximum temperatures indices showed strong warming trends over the period 1893-1950, subsequent trends show little change and cooling. Few significant trends were present in the precipitation indices; however, they displayed a tendency toward wetter conditions. A stepwise multiple linear regression analysis indicated that some of the variability in the 27 indices from 1951 to 2002 was explained by the North Atlantic Oscillation, Pacific decadal oscillation, and Pacific North American pattern. However, teleconnection patterns showed little influence on the 27 indices over a 103-yr period.","[Brown, Paula J.; Bradley, Raymond S.; Keimig, Frank T.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Geosci, Climate Syst Res Ctr, Amherst, MA 01003 USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst,"Brown, PJ (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, 1121 Bradfield Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",pjb238@cornell.edu,"Bradley, Raymond S/P-9358-2015","Bradley, Raymond S/0000-0002-4032-9519",NOAA [NA050AR4311106],NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA),We wish to thank the National Climatic Data Center for providing microfiche of early climate observation forms and Paul Della-Marta for providing assistance with the temperature adjustment procedure.

The emphasis of our work is decadal variability of the shallow meridional overturning circulation, which links the tropical and subtropical Pacific Ocean. In observations, this circulation is characterized by equatorward geostrophic volume transport convergence in the interior ocean pycnocline across 9 degrees N and 9 degrees S. Historical hydrographic data indicate that there has been a decreasing trend in this convergence over the period 1953-2001 of about I I Sverdrup (I SV = 10(6) m(3) s(-1)), with maximum decade-to-decade variations of 7-11 Sv. The transport time series is highly anti-correlated with sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the central and eastern tropical Pacific, implying that variations in meridional overturning circulation are directly linked to decadal variability and trends in tropical SST. These relationships are explored in 18 model simulations of 20th century climate from 14 state-of-the-art coupled climate models. Significant correlation exists between meridional volume transport convergence and tropical SST in the majority of the models over the last half century. However, the magnitude of transport variability on decadal time scales in the models is underestimated while at the same time modeled SST variations are more sensitive to that transport variability than in the observations. The effects of the meridional overturning circulation on SST trends in most the models is less clear. Most models show no trend in meridional transport convergence and underestimate the trend in eastern tropical Pacific SST. The eddy permitting MIROCH model is the only model that reasonably reproduces the observed trends in transport convergence, tropical Pacific SST, and SST gradient along the equator over the last half century. If the observed trends and those simulated in the MIROCH model are ultimately related to greenhouse gas forcing, these results suggest that the Bjerknes feedback, by affecting pycnocline transport convergences, may enhance warming that arises from anthropogenic forcing in the eastern tropical Pacific.
