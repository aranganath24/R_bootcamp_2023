Here we present such a record from a high-elevation site on Mt. Smolikas in northern Greece, where some of Europe's oldest trees provide evidence of warm season temperature variability back to 730 CE. The reconstruction is derived from 192 annually resolved, latewood density series from ancient living and relict Pinus heldreichii trees calibrating at r(1911-2015) = 0.73 against regional July-September (JAS) temperatures. Although the recent 1985-2014 period was the warmest 30-year interval (JAS Twrt.1961-1990 = + 0.71 degrees C) since the eleventh century, temperatures during the ninth to tenth centuries were even warmer, including the warmest reconstructed 30-year period from 876-905 (+ 0.78 degrees C). These differences between warm periods are statistically insignificant though. Several distinct cold episodes punctuate the Little Ice Age, albeit the coldest 30-year period is centered during high medieval times from 997-1026 (- 1.63 degrees C). Comparison with reconstructions from the Alps and Scandinavia shows that a similar cold episode occurred in central Europe but was absent at northern latitudes. The reconstructions also reveal different millennial-scale temperature trends (NEur = - 0.73 degrees C/1000 years, CEur = - 0.13 degrees C, SEur = + 0.23 degrees C) potentially triggered by latitudinal changes in summer insolation due to orbital forcing. These features, the opposing millennial-scale temperature trends and the medieval multi-decadal cooling recorded in Central Europe and the Mediterranean, are not well captured in state-of-the-art climate model simulations.","[Esper, Jan; Klippel, Lara; Konter, Oliver] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Dept Geog, Mainz, Germany; [Krusic, Paul J.; Buentgen, Ulf] Univ Cambridge, Dept Geog, Cambridge, England; [Krusic, Paul J.] Stockholm Univ, Dept Phys Geog, Stockholm, Sweden; [Krusic, Paul J.] Navarino Environm Observ, Navarino Dunes, Messenia, Greece; [Raible, Christoph C.] Univ Bern, Phys Inst, Bern, Switzerland; [Raible, Christoph C.] Oeschger Ctr Climate Change Res, Bern, Switzerland; [Xoplaki, Elena; Luterbacher, Juerg] Justus Liebig Univ, Dept Geog, Giessen, Germany; [Luterbacher, Juerg] Justus Liebig Univ, Ctr Int Dev & Environm Res, Giessen, Germany; [Buentgen, Ulf] Swiss Fed Res Inst WSL, Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Buentgen, Ulf] Global Change Res Ctr AS CR Vvi, Brno, Czech Republic","Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz; University of Cambridge; Stockholm University; University of Bern; University of Bern; Justus Liebig University Giessen; Justus Liebig University Giessen; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape Research; Czech Academy of Sciences; Global Change Research Centre of the Czech Academy of Sciences","Esper, J (corresponding author), Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Dept Geog, Mainz, Germany.",esper@uni-mainz.de,"Xoplaki, Elena/AAF-1901-2020; Esper, Jan/O-3127-2018; Raible, Christoph/M-8309-2016","Xoplaki, Elena/0000-0002-2745-2467; Esper, Jan/0000-0003-3919-014X; Raible, Christoph/0000-0003-0176-0602","German Science Foundation [ES 161/9-1, Inst 247/665-1 FUGG]",German Science Foundation(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"We thank Robert Brandes for pointing towards old-growth forest sites in Greece, and Markus Kochbeck, Yannik Esser, Eileen Kuhl and Philipp Romer for MXD measurements.

Stones have, of course, played a quite significant role in the history of art, not least through skillfully crafted marble and grand earthworks. Within contemporary art today, however, everyday pebbles, cobbles and boulders have become a means to address the ecological crisis. By drawing upon the ongoing debate about the reorganization of knowledge, fostered by the awareness of climate change and discussed by Matthew Omelsky and Ian Baucom amongst others, this essay examines when and how stones became such a means. By reflecting upon artworks by Jimmie Durham, Adriane Wachholz, Silvia Noronha and Julian Charriere, it is suggested that stones are often used as a medium to transgress habitual and anthropocentric notions of time and temporality. Further, through their work, these artists have the potential to make us believe, in times of make-believe: Not only in the urgency of climate change, but also in a future to come.","[Hallgren, Anna-Maria] Stockholm Univ, Dept Culture & Aesthet, Stockholm, Sweden",Stockholm University,"Hallgren, AM (corresponding author), Stockholm Univ, Dept Culture & Aesthet, Stockholm, Sweden.",anna-maria.hallgren@arthistory.su.se,,"Hallgren, Anna-Maria/0000-0002-5832-3246",,,,,19,0,0,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0023-3609,1651-2294,,KONSTHIST TIDSKR,Konsthistorisk Tidsskr.,2-Jan,2019,1,,,,33,42,,10.1080/00233609.2018.1540444,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00233609.2018.1540444,,,10,Art,Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;HCI),Art,HQ4IQ,,hybrid,,,12/21/22,WOS:000462374200003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Descriptions of these three different approaches, as well as their respective skill, are available in the peer-reviewed literature, but because these various studies are sufficiently different in their details (e.g., period covered, metric used to compute the skill, measure of hurricane activity), it is nearly impossible to compare them. Using the latest decadal reforecasts currently available, we present a direct comparison of these three multiannual forecasting techniques with a combination of simple statistical models, with the hope of offering a perspective on the current state-of-the-art research in this field and the skill level currently reached by these forecasts. Using both deterministic and probabilistic approaches, we show that these forecast systems have a significant level of skill and can improve on simple alternatives, such as climatological and persistence forecasts.","[Caron, Louis-Philippe; Lledo, Llorenc] Barcelona Supercomp Ctr, Barcelona, Spain; [Hermanson, Leon] Met Off Hadley Ctr, Exeter, Devon, England; [Dobbin, Alison; Imbers, Jara] Risk Management Solut, London, England; [Vecchi, Gabriel A.] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya; Barcelona Supercomputer Center (BSC-CNS); Met Office - UK; Hadley Centre; Princeton University,"Caron, LP (corresponding author), Barcelona Supercomp Ctr, Barcelona, Spain.",louis-philippe.caron@bsc.es,"Vecchi, Gabriel/A-2413-2008; Lledó, Llorenç/AAC-2866-2020","Vecchi, Gabriel/0000-0002-5085-224X; Lledó, Llorenç/0000-0002-8628-6876; Caron, Louis-Philippe/0000-0001-5221-0147","Ministerio de Economia, Industria y Competitividad (MINECO) [CGL2014-55764-R]; Risk Prediction Initiative at BIOS [RPI2.0-2013-CARON]; EU [Seventh Framework Programme (FP7)] [GA603521]; MINECO under the Juan de la Cierva Incorporacion postdoctoral fellowship [IJCI-2015-23367]","Ministerio de Economia, Industria y Competitividad (MINECO); Risk Prediction Initiative at BIOS; EU [Seventh Framework Programme (FP7)]; MINECO under the Juan de la Cierva Incorporacion postdoctoral fellowship","The first author would like to thank Isadora Jimenez for providing the necessary material for Fig. 2.

At the same time, for underground systems, airflow within as well as in and out of sewers is often neglected during the design of sewers, which depend on these building installed systems for pressure relief and venting. There is clearly an interaction between the two systems, yet this is not reflected in the design guidance, particularly inside buildings where air pressure fluctuations can lead to the destruction of water trap seals and the ingress of foul air containing sewer gases and potentially harmful pathogens. In this systematic review of historical research and design practice for both above and belowground drainage systems, we present the current state of the art and make recommendations for advancements that recognise the interaction between systems and present a view on how design could be advanced in a more holistic way.","[Sharif, Khanda; Gormley, Michael] Heriot Watt Univ, Inst Sustainable Bldg Design, Riccarton Campus, Edinburgh EH14 4AS, Midlothian, Scotland",Heriot Watt University,"Gormley, M (corresponding author), Heriot Watt Univ, Inst Sustainable Bldg Design, Riccarton Campus, Edinburgh EH14 4AS, Midlothian, Scotland.",kss32@hw.ac.uk; m.gormley@hw.ac.uk,,"Gormley, Michael/0000-0003-3418-4621",Heriot-Watt University,Heriot-Watt University,Heriot-Watt University.,,90,0,0,2,14,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,NOV,2021,22,,,,,,3242,10.3390/w13223242,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w13223242,,,17,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,XJ3EN,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000726675900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This research focused on determining the date of appearance and compositional role of exotic trees in Hungarian landscape gardens. We can still find aged exotic woody taxa which determine the historical spatial structure in numerous landscape gardens nowadays. The nationwide distribution of these species, and their location within the gardens, can be an important addition to the questions of the revitalization of historical gardens, the more so because they may be indicative of the climate adaptability and, therefore, resilience of built heritage environments. An experimental approach to the introduction and use of new exotic tree species in historic gardens where this approach can be proven to have existed is also discussed as an opportunity to use these gardens in search of new foreign taxa to adapt to climate change.","[Sarospataki, Mate; Szabo, Patricia; Fekete, Albert] MATE Hungarian Univ Agr & Life Sci, Inst Landscape Architecture Urban Planning & Gard, Dept Garden Art & Landscape Design, Villanyi Ut 35-43, H-1118 Budapest, Hungary",,"Szabo, P (corresponding author), MATE Hungarian Univ Agr & Life Sci, Inst Landscape Architecture Urban Planning & Gard, Dept Garden Art & Landscape Design, Villanyi Ut 35-43, H-1118 Budapest, Hungary.",sarospataki.mate@uni-mate.hu; szabo.ptr.cia@gmail.com; fekete.albert@uni-mate.hu,,,Hungarian University of Agriculture and Life Sciences--MATE,Hungarian University of Agriculture and Life Sciences--MATE,This research received no external funding.

We surely want to do what we can to save it, but what for? Do we aim to avert the most extreme threats in order to continue abusing the world, and probably making most people miserable? Perhaps we can find ways to save the world and make people happier at the same time. Two initiatives a century apart - Tagore and Transition - make conviviality, creativity and celebration central to their approach to world change. The poet and polymath Rabindranath Tagore (1861-1941) aimed for cooperative self-reliance for Indian villages, seeking to overcome caste, class and religious divisions. He emphasised the importance of arts and crafts, including performing plays and music together. A similar ethos is evident in today's Transition Initiatives - now numbering thousands in over forty countries. A study has shown that participants value conviviality and enjoyment equally with making progress towards the goals of moving their local economy away from dependence on fossil fuels. There is a circumstantial connection between Tagore and Transition in that the first Transition Town was established in Totnes, near Dartington, where Tagore's colleague and friend Leonard Elmhirst carried out his own experiment in rural reconstruction, modelled on Tagore's. In this paper, I examine the aims and approaches of Tagore and Transition to test the idea that community self-help focussed on personal freedom and satisfaction is a viable and attractive solution to today's social and ecological crisis.",,,,,,,,,,,33,0,0,0,7,"INT ISLAMIC UNIV MALAYSIA, DEPT ENGLISH LANGUAGE & LITERATURE",SELANGOR,"JALAN GOMBAK, SELAYANG, SELANGOR, 50728, MALAYSIA",1985-3106,,,ASIATIC,Asiatic,DEC,2015,2,,,,26,40,,,,,,15,Literature,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Literature,DE6YS,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000370781400002,View Full Record in Web of Science

The previous research on ART used in tropospheric water vapor tomography focused on the convergence and relaxation parameters for various algebraic reconstruction techniques and rarely discussed the impact of Gaussian constraints and initial field on the iteration results. The existing accuracy evaluation parameters calculated from slant wet delay can only evaluate the resultant precision of the voxels penetrated by slant paths and cannot evaluate that of the voxels not penetrated by any slant path. The paper proposes two new statistical parameters Bias and RMS, calculated from wet refractivity of the total voxels, to improve the deficiencies of existing evaluation parameters and then discusses the effect of the Gaussian constraints and initial field on the convergence and tomography results in multiplicative algebraic reconstruction technique (MART) to reconstruct the 4D tropospheric wet refractivity field using simulation method.

Palynological studies carried out in the Balearic Islands highlight a deep vegetation change from the mid- to late-Holocene, but the climate-environmental-human interactions are not fully understood yet. In this study, we aim to disentangle the causalities of landscape changes during the last six millennia using a multi-proxy approach on an off-site core for the first time in Minorca island. We find that, during the mid-Holocene, the climate was wetter than today with less rainfall seasonality than in the current Mediterranean. This climate, favoured the expansion of box formations and the predominance of forested formations with minimal anthropized conditions. First agropastoral activities appeared in the sequence between ca. 3500-2650 cal BCE in north-eastern Minorca, coinciding with other sporadic archaeological evidence (Cova dels Morts rock-shelter) which support the possibility of a pre-Chalcolithic discovery and frequentation of the island. We record deep environmental change during the third millennium cal BCE, reflected in the substitution of the former mesophytic vegetation by Mediterranean maquis formations dominated by wild olive trees, heathers, mastic and Cistaceae. We propose that maquis, garrigues and open-land vegetation were favoured by human action in a context of increasing climatic dryness and seasonality, promoting vegetation flammability and substitution of former mesic communities to more adapted termophilous vegetation. The comparison of our new record from Addaia with other pollen studies from the Balearic Islands highlights the resilience of mesic vegetation to climate change. This is shown by the survival of box formations to the increased aridification initiated at ca. sixth fifth millennium cal BCE (ca. 7-6 cal kyr BP) in the Western Mediterranean which culminated at ca. fourth third millennium cal BCE (ca. 5-4 cal kyr BP). Additionally, whilst sporadic human presence versus stable occupation are difficult to detect in archaeological records, the coupling with paleoenvironmental studies may offer new scenarios and information for human arrival in the Balearic Islands.","[Servera-Vives, Gabriel; Picornell-Gelabert, Llorenc; Garcia, Arnau; Calvo Trias, Manuel] Univ Balearic Isl, Dept Hist Sci & Theory Art, ArqueoUIB Res Grp, Carretera Valldemossa Km 7,5, Palma De Mallorca 07122, Mallorca, Spain; [Riera, Santiago; Llergo, Yolanda] Univ Barcelona, Sect Prehist & Archaeol, Dept Hist & Archaeol, SERP,Seminary Prehist Studies & Res, C Montalegre 6, Barcelona 08001, Spain; [Picornell-Gelabert, Llorenc] Museum Natl Hist Nat, UMR 7209, CNRS, Archeozool Archeobot Soc Prat & Environm, 55 Rue Buffon, F-75005 Paris, France; [Picornell-Gelabert, Llorenc] Sorbonne Univ, 55 Rue Buffon, F-75005 Paris, France; [Moffa-Sanchez, Paola] Cardiff Univ, Sch Earth & Ocean Sci, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales; [Mus-Amezquita, Maurici] Univ Balearic Isl, Dept Biol, Carretera Valldemossa Km 7,5, Palma De Mallorca 07122, Mallorca, Spain; [Alvarez, Salvia Garcia] Univ Limoges, Geolab, 39E Rue Camille Guerin, F-87036 Limoges, France; [Alvarez, Salvia Garcia] CNRS, Geolab Lab Geog Phys & Environm, F-87036 Limoges, France",Universitat de les Illes Balears; University of Barcelona; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle (MNHN); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Cite; UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Cardiff University; Universitat de les Illes Balears; Universite de Limoges; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Servera-Vives, G (corresponding author), Univ Balearic Isl, Dept Hist Sci & Theory Art, ArqueoUIB Res Grp, Carretera Valldemossa Km 7,5, Palma De Mallorca 07122, Mallorca, Spain.",serveravives@gmail.com,"García Álvarez, Salvia/AAB-4353-2020; Moffa-Sanchez, Paola/AAA-7188-2022; Picornell-Gelabert, Llorenç/B-3760-2016; Servera-Vives, Gabriel/B-3026-2016; Garcia-Molsosa, Arnau/W-6448-2019","García Álvarez, Salvia/0000-0001-8367-0146; Moffa-Sanchez, Paola/0000-0003-1857-8954; Picornell-Gelabert, Llorenç/0000-0003-0662-110X; Servera-Vives, Gabriel/0000-0002-2352-9236; Garcia-Molsosa, Arnau/0000-0001-5416-2986","Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness of Spanish Government (Juan de La Cierva Program) [FJCI-2014-22498, IJCI-2015-24550]; Programa Vicenc Mut d'Incorporacio de Personal R + D + I (Pla de Ciencia, Tecnologia, Innovacio i Emprenedoria) de la Vicepresidencia i Conselleria d'Innovacio, Recerca i Turisme del Govern de les Illes Balears i el Fons Social Europeu [PD-018-2017]; Beatriu de Pinos postdoctoral fellowship of the Catalan Government [2014 BP-A 00216]; University of the Balearic Islands; Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports, Spain [CEI15-09]; la Caixa foundation; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [67211-P, 2500-123 BC]; Institut Menorqui d'Estudis; Minorca Council","Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness of Spanish Government (Juan de La Cierva Program); Programa Vicenc Mut d'Incorporacio de Personal R + D + I (Pla de Ciencia, Tecnologia, Innovacio i Emprenedoria) de la Vicepresidencia i Conselleria d'Innovacio, Recerca i Turisme del Govern de les Illes Balears i el Fons Social Europeu; Beatriu de Pinos postdoctoral fellowship of the Catalan Government; University of the Balearic Islands; Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports, Spain(Spanish Government); la Caixa foundation(La Caixa Foundation); Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); Institut Menorqui d'Estudis; Minorca Council","Gabriel Servera-Vives was supported by the Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness of Spanish Government (Juan de La Cierva Program: FJCI-2014-22498) and the Programa Vicenc Mut d'Incorporacio de Personal R + D + I (Pla de Ciencia, Tecnologia, Innovacio i Emprenedoria 2013-2017) de la Vicepresidencia i Conselleria d'Innovacio, Recerca i Turisme del Govern de les Illes Balears i el Fons Social Europeu (PD-018-2017).

For example, the geologian Thomas Berry wrote a poignant essay presenting his vision of the peace of the Earth, a Pax Gaia, which was published in his important book, Dream of the Earth (1988). In crafting a response to the ecological crisis, Berry repeatedly wrote with urgency about the need to rediscover and foster wonder amongst humans in relation to both the Earth and universe communities. Broadly taking these two features of Berry's work as its jumping off point, this article unfolds select ways to couple wonder, the moral imagination and socio-ecological flourishing at a time of climate change and social unrest, in the service of substantive peace. Specifically, the authors offer a discussion of wonder as it can be understood from reading Berry's work. Moving towards a contemporary contextual ethical application, this article then draws on the work of conflict transformation theorist and practitioner Jean Paul Lederach concerning the moral imagination, which he characterizes as the art and soul of building peace. The authors conclude by proposing a path towards an authentic Pax Gaia that broadens the scope of wonder to include more fully its human component, and broadens the scope of the moral imagination to include more fully its biological and geological components. It is in this way, this article suggests that we can foster an integral approach to peace, one characterized by socio-ecological flourishing.","[Appolloni, Simon] Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada; [Hrynkow, Christopher] Univ Saskatchewan, St Thomas More Coll, Saskatoon, SK S7N 0W0, Canada",University of Toronto; University of Saskatchewan,"Appolloni, S (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada.;Hrynkow, C (corresponding author), Univ Saskatchewan, St Thomas More Coll, Saskatoon, SK S7N 0W0, Canada.",simon.appolloni@utoronto.ca; chrynkow@stmcollege.ca,,,,,,,48,1,1,0,6,BRILL ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,LEIDEN,"PLANTIJNSTRAAT 2, P O BOX 9000, 2300 PA LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS",1363-5247,1568-5357,,WORLDVIEWS,Worldviews,,2016,2,,,,103,124,,10.1163/15685357-02002001,http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/15685357-02002001,,,22,Religion,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Religion,DL5RP,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000375694800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The calibration consistency across international satellites is further challenged in the implementation of GEOSS (Global Earth Observation System of Systems). As a result, establishing on-orbit calibration links among operational satellite radiometers has become critical. This paper provides an overview of the current status and challenges in the on-orbit calibration traceability among operational satellite radiometers. It then proposes to develop an on-orbit calibration reference network to establish the calibration links. The Simultaneous Nadir Overpass method for intersatellite calibration is a key methodology for the network. Other methodologies including vicarious calibration, moon calibration, and airborne campaigns will also be used to support the network. Example applications of the network for operational satellite radiometers are demonstrated. By establishing an on-orbit calibration network that makes the calibration of similar radiometers traceable to each other, a quasi on-orbit calibration standard can be established in the long-term. The system will help us diagnose radiance biases for data assimilation and time series analysis. It will also bring together a world of radiometers to facilitate the implementation of GEOSS.","NOAA, NESDIS, Ctr Satellite Applicat & Res, Camp Springs, MD 20746 USA",National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Cao, CY (corresponding author), NOAA, NESDIS, Ctr Satellite Applicat & Res, 5200 Auth Rd, Camp Springs, MD 20746 USA.",,"Cao, Changyong/F-5578-2010","Cao, Changyong/0000-0003-3572-6525",,,,,22,0,0,0,1,SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING,BELLINGHAM,"1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010 USA",0277-786X,,0-8194-6380-9,P SOC PHOTO-OPT INS,,,2006,,,,,30102,30102,630102,10.1117/12.683960,http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.683960,,,9,Remote Sensing,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Remote Sensing,BFG54,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000241728000002,View Full Record in Web of Science

The building sector is responsible for 38% of the total final energy consumption in Europe and is therefore in the epicentre of the effort to achieve improvements. This is being expressed by the targets of EU policies for 2030 and 2050, which set truly ambitious goals. Part of this effort is the improvement of the building's envelope thermal performance, along with the respective one of the HVAC systems, but also integrating those two in the best possible way. The facade is the crucial factor, as it is the interface between the building and its environment, but also between the environment and the HVAC system; it is truly the building's skin, which is therefore much more than a simple state boundary, if we want to have truly advanced buildings. Main scope of the paper is to present the results of an in depth investigation regarding the best available technologies and the upcoming trends of intelligent building facades, to be used in Zero and Positive Energy Buildings. This cannot be done without discussing the legislative and regulatory framework that applies for the building envelope, as solutions have to comply with regulations and standards, both national and international. In this line of approach an investigation of the practices and technical approaches best suited for Greece is being made, specifying their performance, possible drawbacks and approaches that are to be applied and the implementation of which is expected to contribute to the improvement of the buildings' performance. Furthermore, the constructional approaches and the effectiveness of both naturally and mechanically ventilated facades are discussed, along with their adaptation to the Greek building practices. The integration of ventilated facades with the building's HVAC systems may offer advantages, especially in spring and fall when preheating the air may lead to reduced energy requirements. In the opposite direction, heat rejection may be a problem in summer, where alternative cooling techniques can provide a solution. Finally, integration of innovative design elements such as the use of different final coating materials on the facades, the use of phase-changing materials (PCMs) and the integration of photovoltaic systems are evaluated.","[Antoniadou, Panagiota; Symeonidou, Maria; Kyriaki, Elli; Giama, Effrosyni; Boemi, Sofia-Natalia; Papadopoulos, Agis M.] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Mech Engn, Proc Equipment Design Lab, Thessaloniki, Greece; [Chadiarakou, Stella] FIBRAN SA, Thessaloniki, Greece",Aristotle University of Thessaloniki,"Antoniadou, P; Symeonidou, M (corresponding author), Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Mech Engn, Proc Equipment Design Lab, Thessaloniki, Greece.",pantoniadou@auth.gr; mmsymenonid@auth.gr,"Papadopoulos, Agis/AAO-3274-2021; GammaIotaAlphaMuAlpha, EpsilonUpsilonPhiRhoOmicronSigmaUpsilonNuEta/AAO-3254-2021; Boemi, Sofia - Natalia/M-6139-2013","Boemi, Sofia - Natalia/0000-0003-3163-3495",European Union [T1EDK-02045]; Greek national funds [T1EDK-02045],European Union(European Commission); Greek national funds(Greek Ministry of Development-GSRT),"The authors would like to express their gratitude to the European Union and Greek national funds through the Operational Program for the co-finance of the program Intelligent Facades for Nearly Zero Energy Buildings (IF - ZEB) through the action Competitiveness, Entrepreneurship and Innovation, under the call RESEARCH-CREATE-INNOVATE (project code: T1EDK-02045) and the excellent cooperation.",,47,2,2,4,16,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1755-1307,,,IOP C SER EARTH ENV,IOP Conf.

Specifically, changes in land cover affect biophysical feedbacks of water and energy, thereby contributing to climate change. In this study, we couple the well-established and comprehensively validated dynamic global vegetation model LPJmL5 (Lund-Potsdam-Jena managed Land) to the coupled climate model CM2Mc, the latter of which is based on the atmosphere model AM2 and the ocean model MOMS (Modular Ocean Model 5), and name it CM2Mc-LPJmL. In CM2Mc, we replace the simple land-surface model LaD (Land Dynamics; where vegetation is static and prescribed) with LPJmL5, and we fully couple the water and energy cycles using the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) Flexible Modeling System (FMS). Several improvements to LPJmL5 were implemented to allow a fully functional biophysical coupling. These include a sub-daily cycle for calculating energy and water fluxes, conductance of the soil evaporation and plant interception, canopy-layer humidity, and the surface energy balance in order to calculate the surface and canopy-layer temperature within LPJmL5. Exchanging LaD with LPJmL5 and, therefore, switching from a static and prescribed vegetation to a dynamic vegetation allows us to model important biospheric processes, including fire, mortality, permafrost, hydrological cycling and the impacts of managed land (crop growth and irrigation). Our results show that CM2Mc-LPJmL has similar temperature and precipitation biases to the original CM2Mc model with LaD. The performance of LPJmL5 in the coupled system compared to Earth observation data and to LPJmL offline simulation results is within acceptable error margins. The historical global mean temperature evolution of our model setup is within the range of CMIP5 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5) models. The comparison of model runs with and without land-use change shows a partially warmer and drier climate state across the global land surface. CM2Mc-LPJmL opens new opportunities to investigate important biophysical vegetation-climate feedbacks with a state-of-the-art and process-based dynamic vegetation model.","[Drueke, Markus; von Bloh, Werner; Petri, Stefan; Sakschewski, Boris; Schaphoff, Sibyll; Huiskamp, Willem; Feulner, Georg; Thonicke, Kirsten] Leibniz Assoc, Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany; [Drueke, Markus] Humboldt Univ, Dept Phys, D-12489 Berlin, Germany; [Forkel, Matthias] Tech Univ Dresden, Inst Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing, D-01069 Dresden, Germany",Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; Humboldt University of Berlin; Technische Universitat Dresden,"Druke, M (corresponding author), Leibniz Assoc, Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany.;Druke, M (corresponding author), Humboldt Univ, Dept Phys, D-12489 Berlin, Germany.",drueke@pik-potsdam.de,"Drüke, Markus/AHC-2690-2022; Forkel, Matthias/O-5592-2019; Feulner, Georg/A-1933-2011","Drüke, Markus/0000-0002-8004-7153; Forkel, Matthias/0000-0003-0363-9697; Feulner, Georg/0000-0001-9215-5517; Thonicke, Kirsten/0000-0001-5283-4937; Petri, Stefan/0000-0002-4379-4643; Huiskamp, Willem/0000-0001-6615-6348","DFG/FAPESP [IRTG 1740, TRP 2015/50122-0]; BMBF; Belmont Forum [01LP1610A]",DFG/FAPESP; BMBF(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); Belmont Forum,This research has been supported by the IRTG 1740 (DFG/FAPESP) (grant no.

In winter about 68% of the occupants felt slightly cool, cool or cold; only one-quarter of the people felt neutral. The summer situation was much better; 96% indicted comfortable. Results from the TSVs indicated that the neutral temperature for winter and summer was 18.9 degrees C and 23.3 degrees C, respectively. The winter neutral temperature was 7.6 degrees C higher than the mean indoor air temperature of 11.3 degrees C. Reasons for such large difference were suggested. An adaptive comfort model was developed using linear regression, and the indoor temperature limit was 16.4-29.7 degrees C based on 90% acceptability.

Here we explore the mechanisms that lead to future changes in subseasonal precipitation variability in North America during winter based on 20 state-of-the-art climate models. Modeling evidences indicate that in a warmer climate, the subseasonal precipitation variability consistently increases over most of North America, with intensified swing between the wet and dry extremes, but declines over Mexico. Using a moisture budget decomposition framework, two opposing mechanisms are established: the thermodynamic component from increasing moisture due to global warming intensifies the subseasonal precipitation variability, while the dynamic component from the projected reduction in subseasonal rainfall-related circulation variability has an opposite effect. Overall, the thermodynamic effect wins the tug of war at the mid-to-high latitudes over most of North America, while the dynamic effect overwhelms the thermodynamic effect in Mexico, creating distinct changes in subseasonal precipitation variability. Plain Language Summary There is an increasing demand for subseasonal forecast that bridges the gap between weather forecast and seasonal climate prediction. Although important progress has been made in subseasonal forecasting in the last decade, potential changes in subseasonal variability due to global warming may have important implications for subseasonal predictability. Here we found that subseasonal precipitation variability will increase over most of North America, with intensified wet and dry extremes under climate warming. However, subseasonal precipitation variability over Mexico will decline, with weakened extremes in the future. In response to warming, the effect of increasing background moisture is countered by the effect of weakening of subseasonal circulation variability, with the former dominating the enhanced subseasonal precipitation variability over the United States, while the latter dominates the weakened variability over Mexico. Changes in subseasonal precipitation variability and the swing between wet/dry extremes may have important societal and economic impacts.","[Dong, Lu; Leung, L.

However, with the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic in March 2020, the central role of researchers in participatory research processes had to be questioned and revisited. New modes of PAR developed dynamically under the new circumstances created by the pandemic. To better understand how Covid-19 changed the way PAR is applied, we analyzed PAR in agricultural research for development carried out in the Programme for Climate-Smart Livestock Systems (PCSL) implemented by the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) at five research sites in Kenya, Ethiopia, and Uganda. To understand how PAR changed in a component on adaptation research in the PCSL we facilitated a reflexive study with livestock keepers and researchers to document their experiences of PAR during the Covid-19 pandemic. The analytical framework focuses on highlighting the core characteristics and the underlying ethos of PAR in this case study. The lessons learnt in the process of adapting to the realities of doing participatory research in the middle of a pandemic provide important arguments for further amalgamating the PAR philosophy into similar research designs. The onset of the pandemic has led to a further decentering of the researcher and a shift of the focus to the citizen, in this case the local livestock keeper, that made it more participatory in the stricter interpretation of the term. Letting go of controlling both narrative and implementation of the research will be challenging for researchers in many research fields. However, this shift of power and this transformation of research methodologies is inevitable if the research should remain relevant and impactful. Ultimately, the transition into a Covid-19 future and the awareness that similar pandemics could dramatically interrupt our lives any time, will have an impact on how projects are designed and funded. More long-term funding and less pressure on providing immediate results can build community trust and ownership for research at a local level.","[Habermann, Birgit; Crane, Todd A.; Gichuki, Leah; Worku, Tigist; Mugumya, Roland] Int Livestock Res Inst ILRI, Sustainable Livestock Syst, Nairobi, Kenya; [Maiyo, Nathan; Kiptoo, Emmaculate; Goshme, Shenkute; Mohammednur, Fuad; Tugume, Geoffrey; Satia, Kamango Alphaeus; Siamito, Joel Reagan] Int Livestock Res Inst ILRI, Res Consultants, Nairobi, Kenya",CGIAR; International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI); CGIAR; International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI),"Habermann, B (corresponding author), Int Livestock Res Inst ILRI, Sustainable Livestock Syst, Nairobi, Kenya.",b.habermann@cgiar.org,,,,,,,55,0,0,1,1,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2571-581X,,FRONT SUSTAIN FOOD S,Front.

The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology has been actively seeking solutions to these two challenges. The first part (geo-energy) of this paper describes a series of novel cyclic heating and cooling centrifuge tests performed on replacement and displacement floating energy piles installed in both saturated sand and clay. The test results reveal that replacement floating energy piles exhibit ratcheting settlement under a constant working load but at a reducing rate when subjected to temperature cycles, irrespective of the type of soil in which they are embedded. On the contrary, displacement floating energy piles exhibit heave behaviour. No existing theoretical model can capture observed ratcheting pile settlement well. This suggests that care must be taken when designing replacement floating energy piles. In the second part (geo-environment) of the paper, a novel three-layer environmentally friendly earthen cover system for climate regions like Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia and Singapore is investigated through theoretical examination, physical modelling (e.g., one-dimensional soil column and two-dimensional large flume tests), and advanced numerical simulations. This novel cover system consists of a fine-grained soil underneath a conventional two-layer cover with capillary barrier effects. Two-dimensional water infiltration experiments and numerical simulations show that the newly introduced fine-grained soil layer can greatly minimize rainfall infiltration even after a 4-h rainfall event having a return period of 100 years in climate regions. One-dimensional gas emission tests and numerical simulations reveal that a minimum of 0.6 m thick fine grained soil layer compacted at 10% saturation (e.g. those in arid regions) can adequately satisfy the Australian guidelines. No geomembrane is needed. This new environmentally friendly and robust earthen landfill cover system is thus a promising alternative to other landfill covers for minimizing rainfall infiltration and landfill gas emission under all kinds of weather conditions.","[Ng, Charles W.

One pivotal element with the potential to take over fossil fuels as a global energy vector is renewable hydrogen; but, for this to happen, reliable solutions must be developed for its carbon-free production. The objective of this study was to perform a comprehensive review on several hydrogen production technologies, mainly focusing on water splitting by green-electrolysis, integrated on hydrogen's value chain. The review further deepened into three leading electrolysis methods, depending on the type of electrolyzer used-alkaline, proton-exchange membrane, and solid oxide-assessing their characteristics, advantages, and disadvantages. Based on the conclusions of this study, further developments in applications like the efficient production of renewable hydrogen will require the consideration of other types of electrolysis (like microbial cells), other sets of materials such as in anion-exchange membrane water electrolysis, and even the use of artificial intelligence and neural networks to help design, plan, and control the operation of these new types of systems.","[Vidas, Leonardo] Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Tecn, P-1049001 Lisbon, Portugal; [Castro, Rui] Univ Lisbon, INESC ID IST, P-1000029 Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade de Lisboa; Instituto Superior Tecnico; INESC-ID; Universidade de Lisboa,"Castro, R (corresponding author), Univ Lisbon, INESC ID IST, P-1000029 Lisbon, Portugal.",leonardo.vidas@tecnico.ulisboa.pt; rcastro@tecnico.ulisboa.pt,"Castro, Rui/AAG-5368-2019","Castro, Rui/0000-0002-3108-8880; Afonso Vidas, Leonardo/0000-0001-8168-5336",Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT) [UIDB/50021/2020],Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)(Portuguese Foundation for Science and TechnologyEuropean Commission),"FundingThis research was funded by Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT), grant number UIDB/50021/2020.",,130,8,8,92,163,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3417,,APPL SCI-BASEL,Appl.

Both projects use the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Integrated Forecast System (IFS) coupled to the Nucleus for European Modelling of the Ocean (NEMO). The Minerva runs consist of three sets of hindcasts where the spatial resolution of the model's atmospheric component is progressively increased while keeping the spatial resolution of its oceanic component constant. In the Metis runs, the spatial resolution of both the atmospheric and oceanic components are progressively increased. We find that raw model predictions show seasonal forecast skill for rainfall over northern and southeastern South America. However, predictability is difficult to detect on a local basis, but it can be detected on a large-scale pattern basis. In addition, increasing horizontal resolution does not lead to improvements in the forecast skill of rainfall over South America. A predictable component analysis shows that only the first predictable component of austral summer precipitation has forecast skill, and the source of forecast skill is El Nino-Southern Oscillation. Seasonal prediction of precipitation remains a challenge for state-of-the-art climate models. Positive benefits of increasing model resolution might be more evident in other atmospheric fields (i.e., temperature or geopotential height) and/or temporal scales (i.e., subseasonal temporal scales).","[Bombardi, Rodrigo J.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Geog, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Bombardi, Rodrigo J.; Trenary, Laurie; Pegion, Kathy; Cash, Benjamin; DelSole, Timothy; Kinter, James L., III] George Mason Univ, Dept Atmospher Ocean & Earth Sci, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; George Mason University,"Bombardi, RJ (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Dept Geog, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.;Bombardi, RJ (corresponding author), George Mason Univ, Dept Atmospher Ocean & Earth Sci, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.",rjbombardi@tamu.edu,"Bombardi, Rodrigo J./H-9117-2019; Pegion, Kathy/E-1525-2013; DelSole, Timothy/ABE-2478-2020","Bombardi, Rodrigo J./0000-0002-2796-9378; Pegion, Kathy/0000-0001-5820-7678; DelSole, Timothy/0000-0003-2041-3024; Trenary, Laurie/0000-0002-8874-3743; Cash, Benjamin/0000-0003-2295-3112","National Monsoon Mission, Ministry of Earth Sciences, government of India; NSF [AGS-1338427]; NOAA [NA14OAR4310160, NA15NWS4680018]; NASA [NNX14AM19G]; National Science Foundation","National Monsoon Mission, Ministry of Earth Sciences, government of India; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF))","This study was supported by the National Monsoon Mission, Ministry of Earth Sciences, government of India.

It is therefore important to have access to credible models of water consumption, so as to ensure that water utilities can adequately supply water to meet the growing demand. Within the literature, there are a variety of models, but often these models evaluate the water consumption at aggregate scales (e.g., city or regional), thus overlooking intra-city differences. Conversely, the models that evaluate intra-city differences tend to rely heavily on one or two sources of quantitative data (e.g., climate variables or demographics), potentially missing key cultural aspects that may act as confounding factors in quantitative models. Here, we present a novel mixed-methods approach to predict intra-city residential water consumption patterns by integrating climate and demographic data, and by incorporating social norm data to aid the interpretation of model results. Using Indianapolis, Indiana as a test case, we show the value in adopting a more integrative approach to modeling residential water consumption. In particular, we leverage qualitative interview data to interpret the results from a predictive model based on a state-of-the-art machine learning algorithm. This integrative approach provides community-specific interpretations of model results that would otherwise not be observed by considering demographics alone. Ultimately, the results demonstrate the value and importance of such approaches when working on complex problems.","[Obringer, Renee] Penn State Univ, Dept Energy & Mineral Engn, Hosier Bldg, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Obringer, Renee] Univ Maryland, Natl Socioenvironm Synth Ctr, 1 Pk Pl, Annapolis, MD 21401 USA; [Obringer, Renee] Purdue Univ, Environm & Ecol Engn, 500 Cent Dr, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Nateghi, Roshanak] Purdue Univ, Sch Ind Engn, Lab Adv Sustainable Crit Infrastruct, 315 N Grant St, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Ma, Zhao] Purdue Univ, Dept Forestry & Nat Resources, 195 Marsteller St, W Lafayette, IN 47909 USA; [Kumar, Rohini] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Computat Hydrosyst, Permoserstr 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ),"Obringer, R (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Dept Energy & Mineral Engn, Hosier Bldg, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",obringer@psu.edu,"Kumar, Rohini/B-2299-2013; Ma, Zhao/M-7657-2013","Kumar, Rohini/0000-0002-4396-2037; Ma, Zhao/0000-0002-9103-3996; Nateghi, Roshanak (Roshi)/0000-0003-4569-9233","NSF [DBI-1639145, 1826161, 1832688]; National Socio-Environmental Synthesis Center (SESYNC); Graduate School at Purdue University; Bilsland Dissertation Fellowship; Purdue University Center for the Environment; Purdue Climate Change Research Center",NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); National Socio-Environmental Synthesis Center (SESYNC)(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)); Graduate School at Purdue University; Bilsland Dissertation Fellowship; Purdue University Center for the Environment; Purdue Climate Change Research Center,"The authors would like to acknowledge support from NSF Grants #1826161 and #1832688, as well as the National Socio-Environmental Synthesis Center (SESYNC) under funding received from NSF Grant #DBI-1639145.

Although the FAO-56 Penman-Monteith (PM) equation is regarded as an ideal model for estimating ETo, its applicability is limited due to the absence of required climatic datasets in many regions of the world. Despite its significance, only a few studies use the EL algorithms for the ETo prediction perspective. In this study, we contribute to fill this gap from a two-fold way. First, we present the potential of new EL Random Tree (RT), Bagging and Random Subspace (RS) algorithms which were compared with two commonly used Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms for predicting daily ETo with the climatic data-limited humid region in Bangladesh during 1983-2017 using a five-fold cross-validation scheme. Second, we explore the role of contributing variables influencing ETo change at the regional scale. When a lack of climatic datasets, Tmax (maximum temperature), Tmin (minimum temperature) and Rs (solar radiation) as 3 input combinations obtained the reasonable precision for estimating ETo in all climatic regions except for south-central and south-western regions. Compared to other state-of-arts models, the RT model performed superior to predict ETo in all input combinations followed by the RF, Bagging, RS, and SVM. Considering less difficulty level, high prediction accuracy, more dependability and fewer computation costs of studied models, RT and RF models have been suggested as the promising potentials for daily ETo estimate in subtropical climate regions of Bangladesh and also may be applicable worldwide in the similar climates. The importance analysis from the RF model depicted that the wind speed (U2) and solar radiation (Rs) are the largest influential variables affecting the observed and predicted daily ETo changes in Bangladesh.","[Salam, Roquia; Islam, Abu Reza Md Towfiqul] Begum Rokeya Univ, Dept Disaster Management, Rangpur 5400, Bangladesh",,"Islam, AMT (corresponding author), Begum Rokeya Univ, Dept Disaster Management, Rangpur 5400, Bangladesh.",ruquiasalam@gmail.com; towfiq_dm@brur.ac.bd,", immamsheikh/ABB-6007-2020; Salam, Roquia/AAG-8050-2021; Islam, Abu Reza Md.

Within this work, measures are selected, designed and implemented, which consider all the relevant stakeholders and other environmental limitations, with the aim of mitigating pluvial floods caused by heavy rainfall in urban areas. Lohbrugge, an urban region situated in Hamburg, Germany, is used as the study area in which the flood investigation is carried out and adequate measures to curb pluvial flooding are implemented and assessed using the ArcGIS software. The measures selected and implemented include Green Roofs, Roof Catchment Rain Water Harvesting Systems, Sewer Grate Inlet, Retention Basins, Swales and the Dredging Measure, through the use of the delineation tools in the ArcGIS software. Results obtained show that the Dredging Measure had the most significant impact on the mitigation of the potential pluvial flooding, with a 100-year rainfall event data corresponding to a heavy rainfall used for analysis. Other measures implemented showed limited capacity to curb pluvial flooding under heavy rainfall conditions. It was concluded that urban areas should have adequate flood mitigation measures incorporated in their design and planning, to help curb flooding in anticipation of heavy rainfall, while more research need to be carried out to develop state-of-the-art technologies to further combat pluvial flooding in urban areas.","[Osuide, Eromosele Emmanuel] Hamburg Univ Technol, Sch Civil Engn, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Hamburg, Germany",Hamburg University of Technology,"Osuide, EE (corresponding author), Hamburg Univ Technol, Sch Civil Engn, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Hamburg, Germany.",seleosuide@gmail.com,,,"Institute of River and Coastal Engineering (Wasserbau) of the Hamburg University of Technology, Hamburg, Germany","Institute of River and Coastal Engineering (Wasserbau) of the Hamburg University of Technology, Hamburg, Germany","The research was supported by the Institute of River and Coastal Engineering (Wasserbau) of the Hamburg University of Technology, Hamburg, Germany, but no funding was received to complete this work.",,26,0,0,2,10,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",2363-6203,2363-6211,,MODEL EARTH SYST ENV,Model.

However, wastewater has to be treated in order to minimize the presence of pathogens, in particular, the ova of soil-transmitted helminthes (STHs). Limiting the transmission via removal of STH ova, accurate assessment of risks and minimizing the exposure to the public have been recommended by health regulators. The World Health Organization (WHO) guideline specifies a limit of <= 1 ova/L for safe wastewater reuse. Additionally, the Australian Guidelines for Water recycling (AGWR) recommend a hydraulic retention time of over 25 days in a lagoon or stabilization pond to ensure a 4 log reduction value of helminth ova and to mitigate soil-transmitted helminths associated risks to humans. However, the lack of fast and sensitive methods for assessing the concentration of STH ova in wastewater poses a considerable challenge for an accurate risk assessment. Consequently, it has been difficult to control soil-transmitted helminthiasis despite effective mass drug administration. This limitation can be overcome with the advent of novel techniques for the detection of helminth ova. Therefore, this review presents an assessment of the current methods to detect the viable ova of soil-transmitted helminths in wastewater. Furthermore, the review focuses on the perspectives for the emerging state-of-the-art research and developments that have the potential to replace currently available conventional and polymerase chain reaction based methods and achieve the guidelines of the WHO in order to allow the safe reuse of wastewater for non-potable applications, thereby minimizing public health risks.","[Ravindran, Vivek B.; Soni, Sarvesh K.; Ball, Andrew S.] RMIT Univ, Sch Sci, Ctr Environm Sustainabil & Remediat, Bundoora West, Vic 3083, Australia",Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT),"Ravindran, VB (corresponding author), RMIT Univ, Sch Sci, Ctr Environm Sustainabil & Remediat, Bundoora West, Vic 3083, Australia.",vivek.balakrishnanravindran@rmit.edu.au; sarvesh.soni@rmit.edu.au; andy.ball@rmit.edu.au,,,RMIT-ECP Opportunity Grant; RMIT Research Translation Seed Funding,RMIT-ECP Opportunity Grant; RMIT Research Translation Seed Funding,The authors acknowledge support from the RMIT-ECP Opportunity Grant and RMIT Research Translation Seed Funding.,,128,6,6,0,12,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2073-4441,,,WATER-SUI,Water,JUN,2019,6,,,,,,,10.3390/w11061212,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w11061212,,,21,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,II7BC,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000475346300100,View Full Record in Web of Science

The aim of this paper is to identify their potential use for the thermal renovation of opaque facades of buildings in order to reach climate adaptivity. Adaptive facade concept offers a huge potential for thermal renovation, by improving occupants' comfort, promoting sector decarbonization, and being an opportunity for adapting facades to climate change. A literature review permitted the systematization of thermal renovation adaptive strategies (TRAS) in which ARTs can be useful. The facade reversible changes (outputs) required for each strategy were identified, as well as the possible adaptation mechanisms to obtain them. The technologies responding within the recognized adaptation mechanisms were described and compared, their readiness level identified and their role within the TRAS was assigned. An approach to assess the suitability of each ART regarding TRAS for existing facades was conceived. It uses the criteria of aesthetic change, additional space and demolition needs, localization and area of intervention. The role of each ART within each TRAS, here systematized, will support the definition of the ART's operational range for each application and climate, and will promote the research and development of these technologies for thermal renovation of buildings' facades.

Using multiple observations (land-atmosphere fluxes, biomass, streamflow and remotely sensed vegetation cover) and two state-of-the-art biospheric models, we show that climate variability and extremes lead to positive or negative responses in the biosphere, depending on vegetation type. We find Australia to be a global hot spot for variability, with semi-arid ecosystems in that country exhibiting increased carbon uptake due to both asymmetry in the interannual distribution of rainfall (extrinsic forcing), and asymmetry in the response of gross primary production (GPP) to rainfall change (intrinsic response). The latter is attributable to the pulse-response behaviour of the drought-adapted biota of these systems, a response that is estimated to be as much as half of that from the CO2 fertilization effect during 1990-2013. Mesic ecosystems, lacking drought-adapted species, did not show an intrinsic asymmetric response. Our findings suggest that a future more variable climate will induce large but contrasting ecosystem responses, differing among biomes globally, independent of changes in mean precipitation alone. The most significant changes are occurring in the extensive arid and semi-arid regions, and we suggest that the reported increased carbon uptake in response to asymmetric responses might be contributing to the observed greening trends there.","[Haverd, Vanessa; Canadell, Josep G.] CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere, GPO Box 3023, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Ahlstrom, Anders] Stanford Univ, Sch Earth Energy & Environm Sci, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Ahlstrom, Anders; Smith, Benjamin] Lund Univ, Dept Phys Geog & Ecosyst Sci, S-22362 Lund, Sweden",Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Stanford University; Lund University,"Haverd, V (corresponding author), CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere, GPO Box 3023, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia.",Vanessa.haverd@csiro.au,"Ahlström, Anders/F-3215-2017; Smith, Benjamin/I-1212-2016; Canadell, Pep/E-9419-2010; Ahlström, Anders/AAC-6716-2019; haverd, vanessa/G-8683-2011","Ahlström, Anders/0000-0003-1642-0037; Smith, Benjamin/0000-0002-6987-5337; Canadell, Pep/0000-0002-8788-3218; Ahlström, Anders/0000-0003-1642-0037; Haverd, Vanessa/0000-0003-4359-5895","Australian Climate Change Science Program; Royal Physiographic Society in Lund (Birgit and Hellmuth Hertz Foundation); Swedish Research Council [637-2014-6895]; OCE Distinguished Visiting Scientist to CSIRO Oceans and Atmosphere, Canberra","Australian Climate Change Science Program; Royal Physiographic Society in Lund (Birgit and Hellmuth Hertz Foundation); Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research CouncilEuropean Commission); OCE Distinguished Visiting Scientist to CSIRO Oceans and Atmosphere, Canberra","VH and JGC thank the support of the Australian Climate Change Science Program.

They also provide other state-of-the-art capabilities such as improved conservation. However, the tracer transport of hundreds of tracers, e.g., in the chemistry version of the Community Atmosphere Model, is still a performance bottleneck. Therefore, we consider two conservative semi-Lagrangian schemes. Both are designed to be multi-tracer efficient, third order accurate, and allow significantly longer time steps than explicit Eulerian formulations. We address the difficulties arising on the cubed-sphere projection and on parallel computers and show the high scalability of our approach.

(2006), is adopted to assess the overall stability of El Nio and Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in state-of-the-art coupled models. The twentieth and twenty-first century simulations of 12 coupled models among the coupled model intercomparison project phase 3 models used in the intergovernmental panel on climate change forth assessment report demonstrate a significant positive correlation between ENSO amplitude and ENSO stability as measured by the BJ index. The simulations also show a diversity of behavior regarding the ENSO stability among the coupled models, which can be attributed to different mean state and sensitivity of an oceanic and atmospheric response to wind and SST forcing from model to model. When respective components of the BJ index obtained from the coupled models are compared with those from observations, it is revealed that most coupled models underestimate the thermodynamic damping effect and the positive effect of the zonal advective and thermocline feedback. Under increased CO2 induced warm climate, changes, relative to the twentieth century simulations, in the damping and feedback terms responsible for the ENSO stability measured by the BJ index can be linked to mean state changes and associated atmospheric and oceanic response sensitivity changes. There is a clear multi-model trend in the damping terms and positive zonal advective feedback, thermocline feedback, and Ekman feedback terms under enhanced greenhouse gas conditions. However, the various behavior among the coupled models in competition between the positive feedback and negative damping terms in the BJ index formula prevent the formation of a definitive conclusion regarding future projections of ENSO stability using the current coupled models.","[Kim, Seon Tae; Jin, Fei-Fei] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Meteorol, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA",University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa,"Kim, ST (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Irvine, CA 92687 USA.",seontk@uci.edu,"Kim, Seon Tae/G-6361-2011","Kim, Seon Tae/0000-0003-2628-0904","NSF [ATM 0652145, ATM 0650552]; NOAA [GC01-229]; Directorate For Geosciences [1034798] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); Directorate For Geosciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)),"This research is supported by NSF grants ATM 0652145 and ATM 0650552 and NOAA grants GC01-229.

Whilst there are many well developed CCUS technologies there is the potential for improvement that can encourage CCUS deployment. A time and cost-efficient way of advancing CCUS is through the application of machine learning (ML). ML is a collective term for high-level statistical tools and algorithms that can be used to classify, predict, optimise, and cluster data. Within this review we address the main steps of the CCUS value chain (CO2 capture, transport, utilisation, storage) and explore how ML is playing a leading role in expanding the knowledge across all fields of CCUS. We finish with a set of recommendations for further work and research that will develop the role that ML plays in CCUS and enable greater deployment of the technologies.","[Yan, Yongliang; Nkulikiyinka, Paula; Asibor, Jude Odianosen; Anthony, Edward J.; Manovic, Vasilije; Clough, Peter T.] Cranfield Univ, Energy & Power Theme, Cranfield MK43 0AL, Beds, England; [Yan, Yongliang] Newcastle Univ, Mat Concept & React Engn MatCoRE Grp, Sch Engn, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England; [Borhani, Tohid N.] Univ Wolverhampton, Sch Engn, Div Chem Engn, Wolverhampton WV1 1LY, England; [Subraveti, Sai Gokul; Pai, Kasturi Nagesh; Prasad, Vinay; Rajendran, Arvind] Univ Alberta, Donadeo Innovat Ctr Engn, Dept Chem & Mat Engn, 9211-116 St NW, Edmonton, AB T6G 1H9, Canada; [Zhang, Zhien] West Virginia Univ, Dept Chem & Biomed Engn, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA; [Shao, Ding; Zhang, Wenbiao] North China Elect Power Univ, Sch Control & Comp Engn, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China; [Wang, Lijuan; Yan, Yong] Univ Kent, Sch Engn, Canterbury CT2 7NT, Kent, England; [Ampomah, William; You, Junyu] New Mexico Inst Min & Technol, Petr Recovery Res Ctr, Socorro, NM 87801 USA; [You, Junyu] Chongqing Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Petr & Nat Gas Engn, Chongqing 401331, Peoples R China; [Wang, Meihong] Univ Sheffield, Dept Chem & Biol Engn, Sheffield S1 3JD, S Yorkshire, England",Cranfield University; Newcastle University - UK; University of Wolverhampton; University of Alberta; West Virginia University; North China Electric Power University; University of Kent; New Mexico Institute of Mining Technology; Chongqing University of Science & Technology; University of Sheffield,"Yan, YL; Clough, PT (corresponding author), Cranfield Univ, Energy & Power Theme, Cranfield MK43 0AL, Beds, England.",yongliang.yan@newcastle.ac.uk; p.t.clough@cranfield.ac.uk,"Wang, Meihong/A-6843-2011; N.Borhani, Tohid/V-8441-2018; Clough, Peter/N-3185-2018","Wang, Meihong/0000-0001-9752-270X; Manovic, Vasilije/0000-0002-8377-7717; Shao, Ding/0000-0002-8422-3572; Nkulikiyinka, Paula/0000-0003-0687-4895; N.Borhani, Tohid/0000-0002-0906-6749; Clough, Peter/0000-0003-1820-0484; Yan, Yongliang (Harry)/0000-0001-7501-7745","UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council Doctoral Training Partnership (EPSRC DTP) grant [EP/R513027/1]; Cranfield University Energy and Power research bursary; Petroleum Technology Development Fund (PTDF), Nigeria [PTDF/ED/OSS/PHD/JOA/077/19]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [61973113, 62073135]; U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) through the Southwest Regional Partnership on Carbon Sequestration (SWP) [DE-FC26-05NT42591]; Canada First Research Excellence Fund through University of Alberta Future Energy systems; UK EPSRC [EP/M001458/2, EP/N024540/1]","UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council Doctoral Training Partnership (EPSRC DTP) grant; Cranfield University Energy and Power research bursary; Petroleum Technology Development Fund (PTDF), Nigeria; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) through the Southwest Regional Partnership on Carbon Sequestration (SWP)(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Canada First Research Excellence Fund through University of Alberta Future Energy systems; UK EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC))","PN, PTC, and VM acknowledge the financial support from the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council Doctoral Training Partnership (EPSRC DTP) grant no.

For the regional drought projections, we employed a state-of-the-art complementary relationship (CR) method to estimate ET and atmospheric evaporative demand (E-p) that quantify the combined impact of water deficiency and vapor pressure deficit stress. The performance of the CR method was validated using the reanalysis climate data and independent water-balance ET estimates. The same CR method was again applied to hindcasts and projections of seven global climate models (GCM) in the CMIP6 archive. Results showed that the CR ET estimates and the GCM-driven ET products were both able to approximately close the basin-scale water balance and tightly correlated with each other. The application with the CMIP6 GCM hindcasts provided the same indication that the CR ET and the GCM-driven ET are consistent. The drought assessments using the ET deficit (ET - E-p) from the CMIP6 projections implicates that future drought risks over East Asia would be much higher than indicated by precipitation or soil moisture projections. Rising trends of E-p are expected to outpace those of ET even under the medium-level greenhouse gas emission scenario. Our new drought projections suggest that E-p amplified by soil water deficiency could raise agricultural and wildfire risks substantially by the end of the 21st century.","[Kim, Daeha] Jeonbuk Natl Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Jeonju Si, South Korea; [Ha, Kyung-Ja; Yeo, Ji-Hye] Inst Basic Sci, Ctr Climate Phys, Busan, South Korea; [Ha, Kyung-Ja; Yeo, Ji-Hye] Pusan Natl Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, Busan, South Korea",Jeonbuk National University; Institute for Basic Science - Korea (IBS); Pusan National University,"Kim, D (corresponding author), Jeonbuk Natl Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Jeonju Si, South Korea.;Ha, KJ (corresponding author), Inst Basic Sci, Ctr Climate Phys, Busan, South Korea.;Ha, KJ (corresponding author), Pusan Natl Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, Busan, South Korea.",daeha.kim@jbnu.ac.kr; kjha@pusan.ac.kr,"Ha, Kyung-Ja/D-7584-2018","Ha, Kyung-Ja/0000-0003-1753-9304",Institute for Basic Science [IBS-R028-D1]; National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korea government (MSIT) [2020R1A2C2006860],Institute for Basic Science; National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korea government (MSIT),The authors acknowledge the support of the Institute for Basic Science (project code IBS-R028-D1).

The high-resolution AGCM demonstrates good performance for reproducing precipitation extremes such as annual maximum 1-day precipitation total (Rx1d). Under the warmer climates, Rx1d are robustly projected to increase throughout East Asia. However, there is large range of their quantitative estimates, arising from internal variability and uncertainty in future SST patterns. Over land regions such as inland China, internal variability is the major source of the uncertainty in climatological-mean Rx1d change. However, over oceanic regions including Japan, Korea and coastal China, uncertainty in the SST patterns contributes greatly to the uncertainty in Rx1d through modulation of tropical cyclone activity, suggesting large regional variations in the relative importance of the two sources of uncertainty.","[Endo, Hirokazu; Mizuta, Ryo; Ishii, Masayoshi] Meteorol Res Inst, 1-1 Nagamine, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050052, Japan; [Kitoh, Akio] Univ Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan",Meteorological Research Institute - Japan; University of Tsukuba,"Endo, H (corresponding author), Meteorol Res Inst, 1-1 Nagamine, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050052, Japan.",hendo@mri-jma.go.jp,"Kitoh, Akio/F-1765-2010",,"SOUSEI program; Data Integration and Analysis System (DIAS); Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology","SOUSEI program; Data Integration and Analysis System (DIAS); Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT))","This study was supported by the SOUSEI program and the Data Integration and Analysis System (DIAS), sponsored by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology.

Although the timings, routes and frequencies of such dispersals have not yet been confirmed by genetic, fossil or archaeological evidence, expansion into Arabia would have been facilitated by humid periods driven by incursions of monsoon rainfall, potentially from both Indian Ocean and African monsoon systems. Here we synthesise terrestrial and marine core palaeoclimatic data in order to establish the spatial and temporal variability of humid periods in Arabia between late Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 7 and 3. Incursions of monsoon rainfall occurred during periods of insolation maxima at ca. 200-190, 170, 155, 130-120, 105-95, 85-75 and 60-55 ka, providing multiple 'windows' of favourable climatic conditions that could have facilitated demographic expansion through Arabia. Strong summer monsoons are generally associated with mid-high latitude interglacials, however, enhanced monsoon convection also brought rainfall into Arabia during global glacial phases, possibly due to a strengthened winter monsoon and a greater influence of southern hemispheric temperature changes. Key periods for dispersal into northern regions of Arabia correspond with the synchronous intensification of both eastern Mediterranean and monsoon rainfall systems at insolation maxima during MIS 7 and MIS 5, which may have facilitated demographic connectivity between the Levant and the Arabian interior. Environmental conditions throughout southern and southeast regions were also favourable to expansion during these times, although strong monsoons in these regions during MIS 6 and MIS 3 suggest further opportunities for demographic expansion and exchange. Terrestrial and marine evidence show that during early MIS 3 (ca. 60-50 ka), a strengthened monsoon led to the activation of interior drainage systems and increased productivity in coastal zones, indicating that favourable environmental conditions existed along both coastal and interior routes at that time.

The state of the art highlights that the most efficient passive solution for indoor temperature stabilization and control is the integration of thermal mass with an optimized ventilative cooling profile to enhance the thermal cycle of heat storage. Due to its cyclical behavior, thermal mass effects are difficult to predict and quantify with the traditional steady-state approach to building thermal performance. Dynamic thermal simulations help to assess a building's behavior under transient situations, including the thermal mass influence. However, building codes usually include thermal simulations based on standard assumptions: typical meteorological year (TMY), standard occupancy, standard daily-based lighting and appliances profiles, and standard weekly-based occupancy. Thus, when assumptions change, the actual behavior of the building may vary consistently from the predicted conditions. In this paper, we focused on the ability of thermal mass to contrast the influence of variations from the standard assumptions, especially in relation to climate and ventilation profiles.

In this regard, the aim of this work is to introduce a simple indicator to support curators in regulating the stipulation of contracts with external companies, a more effective management and maintenance of the Heating, Ventilating and Air-Conditioning systems will thus be achieved in order to preserve the works of art, by integrating into the contracts economic penalties related to the system's service break period.

Recent work demonstrated that current state-of-the-art climate models consistently underestimate the long rains in boreal spring over the Horn of Africa while overestimating the short rains in autumn. This inability to represent the seasonal cycle makes it problematic for climate models to project changes in East African precipitation. Here we consider whether this bias also has implications for understanding interannual and decadal variability in the East African long and short rains. Using a consistent framework with an unforced multi-century global coupled climate model simulation, the role of Indo-Pacific variability for East African rainfall is compared across timescales and related to observations. The dominant driver of East African rainfall anomalies critically depends on the timescale under consideration: Interannual variations in East African hydroclimate coincide with significant sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies across the Indo-Pacific, including those associated with the El Nio-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in the eastern Pacific, and are linked to changes in the Walker circulation, regional winds and vertical velocities over East Africa. Prolonged drought/pluvial periods in contrast exhibit anomalous SST predominantly in the Indian Ocean and Indo-Pacific warm pool (IPWP) region, while eastern Pacific anomalies are insignificant. We assessed dominant frequencies in Indo-Pacific SST and found the eastern equatorial Pacific dominated by higher-frequency variability in the ENSO band, while the tropical Indian Ocean and IPWP exhibit lower-frequency variability beyond 10 years. This is consistent with the different contribution to regional precipitation anomalies for the eastern Pacific versus Indian Ocean and IPWP on interannual and decadal timescales, respectively. In the model, the dominant low-frequency signal seen in the observations in the Indo-Pacific is not well-represented as it instead exhibits overly strong variability on subdecadal timescales. The overly strong ENSO-teleconnection likely contributes to the overestimated role of the short rains in the seasonal cycle in the model compared to observations.","[Ummenhofer, Caroline C.] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Phys Oceanog, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [Kulueke, Marco] Univ Hamburg, Dept Earth Sci, Hamburg, Germany; [Tierney, Jessica E.] Univ Arizona, Dept Geosci, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA",Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution; University of Hamburg; University of Arizona,"Ummenhofer, CC (corresponding author), Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Phys Oceanog, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.",cummenhofer@whoi.edu,,"Tierney, Jessica/0000-0002-9080-9289","U.S. DOE, Office of Science Innovative and Novel Computational Impact on Theory and Experiment program; U.S. National Science Foundation [OCE-1203892]; U.S. DOE, Office of Biological and Environmental Research; U.S. DOE, NOAA Climate Program Office; Directorate For Geosciences [1636445] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","U.S. DOE, Office of Science Innovative and Novel Computational Impact on Theory and Experiment program(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); U.S. National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); U.S. DOE, Office of Biological and Environmental Research(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); U.S. DOE, NOAA Climate Program Office; Directorate For Geosciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO))","Use of the following data sets is gratefully acknowledged: Global Precipitation Climatology Center data set by the German Weather Service (DWD) through http://gpcc.dwd.de, NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data provided by NOAA/OAR/ESRL PSD, Boulder, Colorado, USA, through http://www.cdc.noaa.gov; Hadley Centre HadISST by the UK Met Office, and the Twentieth Century Reanalysis Project supported by the U.S. DOE, Office of Science Innovative and Novel Computational Impact on Theory and Experiment program, Office of Biological and Environmental Research, and NOAA Climate Program Office.

A continental assessment of exposure of 284 African heritage sites shows that 20% of sites are currently at risk, which more than triples under moderate and high emission scenarios. The African coast contains heritage sites of 'Outstanding Universal Value' that face increasing risk from anthropogenic climate change. Here, we generated a database of 213 natural and 71 cultural African heritage sites to assess exposure to coastal flooding and erosion under moderate (RCP 4.5) and high (RCP 8.5) greenhouse gas emission scenarios. Currently, 56 sites (20%) are at risk from a 1-in-100-year coastal extreme event, including the iconic ruins of Tipasa (Algeria) and the North Sinai Archaeological Sites Zone (Egypt). By 2050, the number of exposed sites is projected to more than triple, reaching almost 200 sites under high emissions. Emissions mitigation from RCP 8.5 to RCP 4.5 reduces the number of very highly exposed sites by 25%. These findings highlight the urgent need for increased climate change adaptation for heritage sites in Africa, including governance and management approaches, site-specific vulnerability assessments, exposure monitoring, and protection strategies.","[Vousdoukas, Michalis, I] European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr JRC, Seville, Spain; [Clarke, Joanne] Univ East Anglia, Sch Art Media & Amer Studies, Norwich, Norfolk, England; [Ranasinghe, Roshanka; Duong, Trang Minh] IHE Delft Inst Water Educ, Dept Coastal & Urban Risk & Resilience, Delft, Netherlands; [Ranasinghe, Roshanka; Duong, Trang Minh] Univ Twente, Water Engn & Management, Enschede, Netherlands; [Ranasinghe, Roshanka; Duong, Trang Minh] Deltares, Harbour Coastal & Offshore Engn, Delft, Netherlands; [Reimann, Lena] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies IVM, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Khalaf, Nadia] Univ Exeter, Inst Arab & Islamic Studies, Exeter, Devon, England; [Ouweneel, Birgitt; Trisos, Christopher H.; Simpson, Nicholas P.] Univ Cape Town, African Climate & Dev Initiat, Cape Town, South Africa; [Sabour, Salma] Univ Southampton, Fac Engn & Phys Sci, Southampton, Hants, England; [Iles, Carley E.] Ctr Int Climate Res, Oslo, Norway; [Iles, Carley E.] Univ Paris Saclay, Lab Sci Climat & Environm, LSCE IPSL, CEA CNRS UVSQ, Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Trisos, Christopher H.] Univ Cape Town, Ctr Stat Ecol Environm & Conservat, Cape Town, South Africa; [Feyen, Luc] European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr JRC, Ispra, Italy; [Mentaschi, Lorenzo] Univ Bologna, Dept Phys & Astron Augusto Righi DIFA, Bologna, Italy",University of East Anglia; IHE Delft Institute for Water Education; University of Twente; Deltares; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; University of Exeter; University of Cape Town; University of Southampton; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; CEA; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); University of Cape Town; European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site; University of Bologna,"Vousdoukas, MI (corresponding author), European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr JRC, Seville, Spain.;Simpson, NP (corresponding author), Univ Cape Town, African Climate & Dev Initiat, Cape Town, South Africa.",Michail.VOUSDOUKAS@ec.europa.eu; nick.simpson@uct.ac.za,"Simpson, Nick/AAC-4578-2022; Vousdoukas, Michalis/C-6743-2012; Ranasinghe, Roshanka/C-6711-2009","Simpson, Nick/0000-0002-9041-982X; Clarke, Joanne/0000-0002-7954-6561; Trisos, Christopher/0000-0002-5854-1489; Vousdoukas, Michalis/0000-0003-2655-6181; Ranasinghe, Roshanka/0000-0001-6234-2063; Sabour, Salma/0000-0003-2697-2994; Reimann, Lena/0000-0002-9405-9147","AXA Research Fund; UK government's Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office; International Development Research Centre, Ottawa, Canada [109419 - 001]; African Academy of Sciences; Royal Society - UK government's Global Challenges Research Fund; Mapping Africa's Endangered Archaeological Sites and Monuments project - Arcadia Fund, UK; Leverhulme Trust Doctoral Training Scheme, UK","AXA Research Fund(AXA Research Fund); UK government's Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office; International Development Research Centre, Ottawa, Canada(CGIAR); African Academy of Sciences; Royal Society - UK government's Global Challenges Research Fund; Mapping Africa's Endangered Archaeological Sites and Monuments project - Arcadia Fund, UK; Leverhulme Trust Doctoral Training Scheme, UK","R.R. is partially supported by the AXA Research Fund.

In this study, we present a new rainfall data set (SM2RAIN-CCI) obtained from the inversion of the satellite soil moisture (SM) observations derived from the ESA Climate Change Initiative (CCI) via SM2RAIN (Brocca et al., 2014). Daily rainfall estimates are generated for an 18-year long period (1998-2015), with a spatial sampling of 0.25 degrees on a global scale, and are based on the integration of the ACTIVE and the PASSIVE ESA CCI SM data sets. The quality of the SM2RAIN-CCI rainfall data set is evaluated by comparing it with two state-of-the-art rainfall satellite products, i.e. the Tropical Measurement Mission Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis 3B42 real-time product (TMPA 3B42RT) and the Climate Prediction Center Morphing Technique (CMORPH), and one modeled data set (ERA-Interim). A quality check is carried out on a global scale at 1 degrees of spatial sampling and 5 days of temporal sampling by comparing these products with the gauge-based Global Precipitation Climatology Centre Full Data Daily (GPCC-FDD) product. SM2RAIN-CCI shows relatively good results in terms of correlation coefficient (median value > 0.56), root mean square difference (RMSD, median value < 10.34 mm over 5 days) and bias (median value <-14.44 %) during the evaluation period. The validation has been carried out at original resolution (0.25 degrees) over Europe, Australia and five other areas worldwide to test the capabilities of the data set to correctly identify rainfall events under different climate and precipitation regimes.

These observed regional trends are compared with those simulated by five state-of-the-art Earth system models over the historical period. Oceanic pCO(2) growth rates faster than the atmospheric growth rates indicate decreasing atmospheric CO2 uptake, while ocean pCO(2) growth rates slower than the atmospheric growth rates indicate increasing atmospheric CO2 uptake. Aside from the western subpolar North Pacific and the subtropical North Atlantic, our analysis indicates that the current observation-based basin-scale trends may be underestimated, indicating that more observations are needed to determine the trends in these regions. Encouragingly, good agreement between the simulated and observed pCO(2) trends is found when the simulated fields are subsampled with the observational coverage. In agreement with observations, we see that the simulated pCO(2) trends are primarily associated with the increase in surface dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) associated with atmospheric carbon uptake, and in part by warming of the sea surface. Under the RCP8.5 future scenario, DIC continues to be the dominant driver of pCO(2) trends, with little change in the relative contribution of SST. However, the changes in the hydrological cycle play an increasingly important role. For the contemporary (1970-2011) period, the simulated regional pCO(2) trends are lower than the atmospheric growth rate over 90% of the ocean. However, by year 2100 more than 40% of the surface ocean area has a higher oceanic pCO(2) trend than the atmosphere, implying a reduction in the atmospheric CO2 uptake rate. The fastest pCO(2) growth rates are projected for the subpolar North Atlantic, while the high-latitude Southern Ocean and eastern equatorial Pacific have the weakest growth rates, remaining below the atmospheric pCO(2) growth rate. Our work also highlights the importance and need for a sustained long-term observing strategy to continue monitoring the change in the ocean anthropogenic CO2 sink and to better understand the potential carbon cycle feedbacks to climate that could arise from it.","[Tjiputra, Jerry F.; Olsen, Are; Heinze, Christoph] Uni Res Climate, Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, Bergen, Norway; [Olsen, Are; Pfeil, Benjamin; Heinze, Christoph] Univ Bergen, Inst Geophys, Bergen, Norway; [Olsen, Are; Pfeil, Benjamin; Heinze, Christoph] Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, Bergen, Norway; [Bopp, Laurent; Roy, Tilla] CNRS CEA UVSQ, IPSL LSCE, UMR8212, Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Lenton, Andrew] Ctr Australian Weather & Climate Res, CSIRO, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Segschneider, Joachim] Max Planck Inst Meteorol, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany; [Totterdell, Ian] Hadley Ctr, Met Off, Exeter, Devon, England",Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research; University of Bergen; Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Earth Sciences & Astronomy (INSU); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Cite; Universite Paris Saclay; CEA; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Max Planck Society; Met Office - UK; Hadley Centre,"Tjiputra, JF (corresponding author), Uni Res Climate, Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, Bergen, Norway.",jerry.tjiputra@uni.no,"Tjiputra, Jerry/AAB-5896-2022; bopp, laurent/ABF-5302-2020; Olsen, Are/A-1511-2011; Lenton, Andrew/D-2077-2012","bopp, laurent/0000-0003-4732-4953; Olsen, Are/0000-0003-1696-9142; Lenton, Andrew/0000-0001-9437-8896; Tjiputra, Jerry/0000-0002-4600-2453","Centre for Climate Dynamics at the Bjerknes Centre; EU - European Commission [264879]; Research Council of Norway [207711/E10]; NOTUR projects [nn2980k, nn2345k]; NorStore projects [ns2980k, ns2345k]; Australian Climate Change Science Program",Centre for Climate Dynamics at the Bjerknes Centre; EU - European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre); Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway); NOTUR projects; NorStore projects; Australian Climate Change Science Program,"We thank three anonymous reviewers for their critical feedback, which helped to improve the manuscript significantly.

So far the design process in France is not well adapted to the design of zero energy buildings and does not allow the easy achievement of energy efficient buildings. A reorganization from the brief to the construction of the building itself is therefore necessary. Several reasons can explain this statement. First, no thermal standards are mandatory in Reunion Island as most of the French overseas territories. This leads to the construction of energy consuming buildings. However, a guideline named PERENE has been set-up but the prescriptions are not mandatory. They concern the thermal conception of buildings as well as the energy performance of buildings and are specific to each climatic zone that has been defined in PERENE. Despite that, the PERENE rules give only a minimum level of performance and can not be considered as the optimum design. Second, the lack of knowledge in the HVAC design practices about the last design tools and the lack of discussion between the people involved in the design process - i.e. the architect and the engineers is an obvious weakness for optimizing the passive design of the envelope and the systems. In some cases, the design teams selected by public owners - the Regional Council, the University and the City Councils have most of the time an overall good level of knowledge but unfortunately the brief of the building is not accurate enough in terms of objectives and energy performance requirements to meet. The paper will present the state of the art in France in terms of design process from the brief until the completion of the building. Then the adopted methodology will be introduced and applied to the case study of the ENERPOS building. The design stage has focused on the development of new methods for the design of zero net energy buildings in French tropical overseas territories. As the building has been completed in 2008, the lessons learned will be presented as well.","[Garde, Francois] Univ Reunion, ESIROI, Dept Sustainable Design & Environm, Le Tampon, Reunion, France; [Ottenwelter, Eric] Imageen, Green Bldg Design, St Denis, Reunion, France; [Bornarel, Alain] TRIBU, Green Bldg Design, Paris, France",University of La Reunion,"Garde, F (corresponding author), Univ Reunion, ESIROI, Dept Sustainable Design & Environm, Le Tampon, Reunion, France.",,,,,,,,11,9,9,0,6,"AMER SOC HEATING, REFRIGERATING AND AIR-CONDITIONING ENGS",ATLANTA,"1791 TULLIE CIRCLE NE, ATLANTA, GA 30329 USA",0001-2505,,,ASHRAE TRAN,,,2012,,1,,,81,89,,,,,,9,Thermodynamics; Construction & Building Technology,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Thermodynamics; Construction & Building Technology,BDC57,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000312640000011,View Full Record in Web of Science

Geoarchaeological analyses were carried out on a series of samples of compact and loose sediments provenient from the 1995 to 2005 excavation campaigns at the Atxoste shelter. This work focuses on climate reconstruction of the Upper Ebro Valley, comparing it with results of previous studies of the area and its surroundings, as well as the Cantabrian region. We also point out the problem of sediment conservation when analyzing sites containing Pleistocene/Holocene and/or Mesolithic/Neolithic transition stratigraphies. Thanks to the geoarchaeological study we have differentiated three climatic events: - The end of the Pleistocene as a period characterized by cold, humid conditions and with probable seasonal droughts. - The Pleistocene-Holocene transition that corresponds to a climatic moment in which the indicators of cold climate have practically disappeared. - The beginning of the Holocene, when a significant and rapid climatic improvement takes place, with an increase in temperatures, a decrease in rainfall but maintaining the humidity. The identification of the different post-depositional processes has been key to identifying the state of the recovered archaeological material. Therefore, this study is based on the geoarchaeological analysis, approaching the period central to this paper (Pleistocene-Holocene transition). This is crucial in order to obtain a better understanding of the paleoecology and archaeological aspects.","[Jindriska Perez-Fernandez, Arantzazu; Alday, Alfonso] Univ Basque Country, UPV EHU, Fac Art, Prehist Area,Dept Geog Prehist & Archaeol, Lab 1-18a C Tomas y Valiente S-N, Vitoria 01006, Spain; [Jindriska Perez-Fernandez, Arantzazu; Ligouis, Bertrand] Eberhard Karls Univ Tubingen, Inst Nat Wissensch Archaol, Geoarchaol, Rumelinstr 23, D-72070 Tubingen, Germany",University of Basque Country; Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen,"Ligouis, B (corresponding author), Eberhard Karls Univ Tubingen, Inst Nat Wissensch Archaol, Geoarchaol, Rumelinstr 23, D-72070 Tubingen, Germany.",bertrand.ligouis@uni-tuebingen.de,,,"Project Gaps and Sites.

Therefore, this study explores the techno-economic feasibility of proposed simple passive retrofitting solutions using nature-based and conventional thermal insulation materials to the existing dwellings in the traditional coastal settlements under the Mediterranean climate. Two case studies, one representing a typical coastal, traditional wooden house in the west center of Portugal and another, a conventional brick house in the Delta region in Egypt, were selected. Each case study house was simulated using energy performance assessment tools (Energy+) before and after retrofitting in both locations using similar insulation properties. The results showed that energy consumption decreased by (29% and 43%) for cooling and (23% and 45%) for heating under different circumstances. Furthermore, the shortest simple payback model was projected by 16 and 25 years, with profitability achieved in 17 and 27 years for a proposed retrofitting solution. Also, a new propinquity between Portuguese and Egyptian Architecture was brought out.

Accompanying this rapid warming are significant increases in summer mean daily maximum temperature, daily minimum temperature, annual hottest day temperature and warmest night temperature, and an increase in frequency of summer days and tropical nights, while the change in the diurnal temperature range (DTR) is small. This study focuses on understanding causes of the rapid summer warming and associated temperature extreme changes. A set of experiments using the atmospheric component of the state-of-the-art HadGEM3 global climate model have been carried out to quantify relative roles of changes in sea surface temperature (SST)/sea ice extent (SIE), anthropogenic greenhouse gases (GHGs), and anthropogenic aerosols (AAer). Results indicate that the model forced by changes in all forcings reproduces many of the observed changes since the mid-1990s over Western Europe. Changes in SST/SIE explain 62.2 +/- 13.0 % of the area averaged seasonal mean warming signal over Western Europe, with the remaining 37.8 +/- 13.6 % of the warming explained by the direct impact of changes in GHGs and AAer. Results further indicate that the direct impact of the reduction of AAer precursor emissions over Europe, mainly through aerosol-radiation interaction with additional contributions from aerosol-cloud interaction and coupled atmosphere-land surface feedbacks, is a key factor for increases in annual hottest day temperature and in frequency of summer days. It explains 45.5 +/- 17.6 % and 40.9 +/- 18.4 % of area averaged signals for these temperature extremes. The direct impact of the reduction of AAer precursor emissions over Europe acts to increase DTR locally, but the change in DTR is countered by the direct impact of GHGs forcing. In the next few decades, greenhouse gas concentrations will continue to rise and AAer precursor emissions over Europe and North America will continue to decline. Our results suggest that the changes in summer seasonal mean SAT and temperature extremes over Western Europe since the mid-1990s are most likely to be sustained or amplified in the near term, unless other factors intervene.","[Dong, Buwen; Sutton, Rowan T.; Shaffrey, Len] Univ Reading, Dept Meteorol, Natl Ctr Atmospher Sci, Reading, Berks, England",UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); NERC National Centre for Atmospheric Science; University of Reading,"Dong, BW (corresponding author), Univ Reading, Dept Meteorol, Natl Ctr Atmospher Sci, Reading, Berks, England.",B.Dong@reading.ac.uk,,,"EUCLEIA project - European Union's Seventh Framework Programme [607085]; U.K. National Centre for Atmospheric Science-Climate (NCAS-Climate) at the University of Reading; NERC [NE/M005909/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Natural Environment Research Council [ncas10009, NE/M005909/1] Funding Source: researchfish",EUCLEIA project - European Union's Seventh Framework Programme; U.K. National Centre for Atmospheric Science-Climate (NCAS-Climate) at the University of Reading; NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"This work was supported by EUCLEIA project funded by the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme [FP7/2007-2013] under Grant Agreement No. 607085.

Convection is sustained in the late afternoon just inland of the coasts because of sea breeze convergence. Previous work has shown that the variability in MC rainfall associated with the MJO is manifested in changes to this diurnal cycle; land-based rainfall peaks before the active convective envelope of the MJO reaches the MC, whereas oceanic rainfall rates peak while the active envelope resides over the region. The model simulations show that the main controls on oceanic MC rainfall in the early active MJO phases are the large-scale environment and atmospheric stability, followed by high oceanic latent heat flux forced by high near-surface winds in the later active MJO phases. Over land, rainfall peaks before the main convective envelope arrives (in agreement with observations), even though the large-scale convective environment is only moderately favorable for convection. The causes of this early rainfall peak are strong convective triggers from land-sea breeze circulations that result from high surface insolation and surface heating. During the peak MJO phases cloud cover increases and surface insolation decreases, which weakens the strength of the mesoscale circulations and reduces land-based rainfall, even though the large-scale environment remains favorable for convection at this time. Hence, scale interactions are an essential part of the MJO transition across the MC.","[Birch, C. E.] Univ Leeds, Met Off Leeds, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Birch, C. E.; Parker, D.

This paper investigates recent changes in temperature extremes in China using 25 state-of-the-art global climate models participating in CMIP5. Thirteen indices that represent extreme temperature events were chosen and derived by daily maximum and minimum temperatures, including those representing the intensity (absolute indices and threshold indices), duration (duration indices), and frequency (percentile indices) of extreme temperature. The overall performance of each model is summarized by a portrait diagram based on relative root-mean-square error, which is the RMSE relative to the median RMSE of all models, revealing the multi-model ensemble simulation to be better than individual model for most indices. Compared with observations, the models are able to capture the main features of the spatial distribution of extreme temperature during 1986-2005. Overall, the CMIP5 models are able to depict the observed indices well, and the spatial structure of the ensemble result is better for threshold indices than frequency indices. The spread amongst the CMIP5 models in different subregions for intensity indices is small and the median CMIP5 is close to observations; however, for the duration and frequency indices there can be wide disagreement regarding the change between models and observations in some regions. The model ensemble also performs well in reproducing the observational trend of temperature extremes. All absolute indices increase over China during 1961-2005.","[Dong Siyan; Xu Ying; Zhou Botao; Shi Ying] China Meteorol Adm, Natl Climate Ctr, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China",China Meteorological Administration,"Xu, Y (corresponding author), China Meteorol Adm, Natl Climate Ctr, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",xuying@cma.gov.cn,,"Dong, Siyan/0000-0001-5625-6097","National Basic Key Project (973 Project) [2010CB950501, 2010CB950102]; R&D Special Fund for Public Welfare Industry (meteorology) [GYHY 201306019]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41275078]",National Basic Key Project (973 Project)(National Basic Research Program of China); R&D Special Fund for Public Welfare Industry (meteorology); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This study was supported by the National Basic Key Project (also called 973 Project, Grant Nos. 2010CB950501 and 2010CB950102), the R&D Special Fund for Public Welfare Industry (meteorology) (Grant No. GYHY 201306019), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41275078).",,28,43,49,2,43,SCIENCE PRESS,BEIJING,"16 DONGHUANGCHENGGEN NORTH ST, BEIJING 100717, PEOPLES R CHINA",0256-1530,1861-9533,,ADV ATMOS SCI,Adv.

This idea will pave the way for a fusion of the available information as well as a multi-source mapping procedure which will be able to exploit successfully the huge quantity of data available for the past and the even larger amount that may be accessed in the future. To this aim, a comparison on selected dates for the whole 2000/2006 period was performed.","[Gamba, P.; Lisini, G.; Merlin, E.; Riva, F.] Univ Pavia, Dept Elect, I-27100 Pavia, Italy",University of Pavia,"Gamba, P (corresponding author), Univ Pavia, Dept Elect, I-27100 Pavia, Italy.",,"Gamba, Paolo E/G-1959-2010","Gamba, Paolo E/0000-0002-9576-6337; Merlin, Emiliano/0000-0001-6870-8900",,,,,9,0,0,0,0,SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING,BELLINGHAM,"1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010 USA",0277-786X,,978-0-8194-6906-9,P SOC PHOTO-OPT INS,,,2007,,,,,U7480,U7480,,10.1117/12.737266,http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.737266,,,11,"Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Remote Sensing",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Engineering; Remote Sensing,BHJ09,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000253478400027,View Full Record in Web of Science

The Fridays for Future movement characterises a political group that has a majority of young people, frequently using social media to organise actions. By conducting a social network analysis on hashtags, this study contributes to the understanding of the global Fridays for Future movement. Particularly, we focus on the use and connection of hashtags on Instagram. We collected 59,112 posts tagged with #fridaysforfuture and analysed 91,172 hashtags used therein. Subsequently, the 140 most used hashtags were divided into 11 clusters, which provide not only information about the organisation of the social movement via social media, but also insights into lifestyle-related aspects. The clusters include the topics: climate; nutrition, lifestyle and health; memes; cycling; art; sustainable consumption and the Earth Day. The article shows that the motives of the Fridays for Future movement are broad. We can demonstrate that Fridays for Future is connected to other social movements and gain insights into the everyday life of the Fridays for Future stakeholders.","[Herrmann, Christoph; Rhein, Sebastian] Martin Luther Univ Halle Wittenberg, Grosse Steinstr 73, D-06108 Halle, Saale, Germany; [Dorsch, Isabelle] Heinrich Heine Univ Dusseldorf, Dusseldorf, Germany",Martin Luther University Halle Wittenberg; Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf,"Herrmann, C (corresponding author), Martin Luther Univ Halle Wittenberg, Grosse Steinstr 73, D-06108 Halle, Saale, Germany.",christoph.herrmann@wiwi.uni-halle.de,,"Dorsch, Isabelle/0000-0001-7391-5189; Herrmann, Christoph/0000-0002-1974-6457; Rhein, Sebastian/0000-0001-6923-7215",,,,,107,0,0,12,20,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0165-5515,1741-6485,,J INF SCI,J.

National Academy Press, Washington, DC; Bricker et al. (1999) National Estuarine Eutrophication Assessment. Effects of nutrient enrichment in the nation's estuaries. NOAA-NOS Special Projects Office, Silver Spring, MD). However, not all of the nitrogen input to a watershed is exported to the coast (Howarth et al. (1996) Biogeochemistry 35:75-139; Jordan and Weller (1996) Bioscience 46:655-664). Global estimates of nitrogen export to coasts have been taken to be 25% of watershed input, based largely on northeastern U.S. observations (Galloway et al. (2004) Biogeochemistry 70:153-226; Boyer et al. (2006) Global Biogeochem Cycle 20:Art. No. GB1S91). We applied the N budgeting methodology developed for the International SCOPE Nitrogen project (Howarth et al. (1996) Biogeochemistry 35:75-139; Boyer et al. (2002) Biogeochemistry 57:137-169) to 12 watersheds in the southeastern U.S., and compared them with estimates of N export for 16 watersheds in the northeastern U.S. (Boyer et al. (2002) Biogeochemistry 57:137-169). In southeastern watersheds, average N export was only 9% of input, suggesting the need for downward revision of global estimates. The difference between northern and southern watersheds is not a function of the absolute value of N inputs, which spanned a comparable range and were positively related to export in both cases. Rather, the proportion of N exported was significantly related to average watershed temperature (% N export = 58.41 e(-0.11) (*) (temperature) stop; R-2 = 0.76), with lower proportionate nitrogen export in warmer watersheds. In addition, we identified a threshold in proportionate N export at 38 degrees N latitude that corresponds to a reported breakpoint in the rate of denitrification at 10-12 degrees C. We hypothesize that temperature, by regulating denitrification, results in increased proportionate N export at higher latitudes. Regardless of the mechanism, these observations suggest that temperature increases associated with future climate change may well reduce the amount of nitrogen that reaches estuaries, which will have implications for coastal eutrophication.","Univ Georgia, Dept Marine Sci, Athens, GA 30602 USA; Univ Georgia, Inst Ecol, Athens, GA 30602 USA",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; University System of Georgia; University of Georgia,"Alber, M (corresponding author), Univ Georgia, Dept Marine Sci, Marine Sci Bldg, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",malber@uga.edu,,,,,,,59,107,112,1,60,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0168-2563,1573-515X,,BIOGEOCHEMISTRY,Biogeochemistry,SEP,2007,3,,,,333,346,,10.1007/s10533-007-9144-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-007-9144-9,,,14,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology,201AY,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000248805100007,View Full Record in Web of Science

A comparison of perceived change with science-based assessment of change is proposed to better understand community risk assessment and decision-making. Based on this analysis, we identify shared attitudes and perceptions of change that can be used to develop communication about environmental change in a manner that is appropriate within the context of the community. A community-level survey was conducted to sample differences in individual perception of likely environmental change as well as attitudes regarding climate change and natural resource management among residents of Alaska's Kenai Peninsula. We compare perceptions of likely environmental change to science-based assessments of change using a conceptual framework that recognizes socio-cognitive processes associated with decision-making. We evaluate the relationship of those perceptions to attitudes using quantitative methods. A binary logistic model is used to investigate the predictive relationship between perception and attitudes regarding climate change and natural resource management. A cultural consensus model is then used to determine areas of shared community perception of change and attitudes. Results of this analysis suggest that despite diverse individual perceptions of environmental change, shared community perceptions and attitudes can be identified.","[Grunblatt, Jess] Univ Alaska Anchorage, Alaska Ctr Conservat Sci, 3211 Providence Dr, Anchorage, AK 99508 USA; [Alessa, Lilian] Univ Idaho, Coll Art & Architecture, 875 Perimeter Dr MS 2481, Moscow, ID 83844 USA",University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Anchorage; Idaho; University of Idaho,"Grunblatt, J (corresponding author), Univ Alaska Anchorage, Alaska Ctr Conservat Sci, 3211 Providence Dr, Anchorage, AK 99508 USA.",jgrunbla@alaska.edu; alessa@uidaho.edu,"Alessa, Lilian/AAA-6518-2020",,Alaska Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (Alaska EPSCoR) NSF award [OIA-1208927]; State of Alaska,Alaska Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (Alaska EPSCoR) NSF award; State of Alaska,This study was supported by the Alaska Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (Alaska EPSCoR) NSF award #OIA-1208927 and the State of Alaska.

In recent decades, the probability of these events occurring has increased, activating the interest of researchers in the study of new methods of risk analysis to prevent and mitigate possible damage to people, the environment, and processing facilities. On the other hand, the concept of multi-hazard is summarized in the combination of two or more threat factors manifested in isolated, simultaneous manner, or by chain reaction, to produce a trigger event of a disaster, where hazardous events can be one or more natural events. Considering that, it is essential to know the progress in risk analysis for Natech events, to identify the gaps for future research. Therefore, in this paper, a systematic review of the Natech events literature with single and multi-hazard approaches was developed. The review was conducted by searching the Science Direct, Web of Science, and Scopus databases for scientific documents. Subsequently, the words Natech and Multi-hazard were taken as keywords, and 208 results were obtained. Then, some management documents were consulted in international organizations to compare academic literature and industrial risk management. In conclusion, the risk analysis methods revised are specific to a particular hazard and apply mainly to earthquakes, floods, and lightning. Regarding a multi-hazard approach, the methods focus on risk mitigation in urban areas without taking into account Natech risk. In the case of industrial risk assessment, some methodologies were found that briefly consider Natech risk in risk assessment processes in industry.","[Mesa-Gomez, Adriana] Univ Andes, Chem Engn Dept, Bogota, Colombia; [Mesa-Gomez, Adriana; Casal, Joaquim] Univ Politecn Cataluna, Ctr Technol Risk Studies, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain; [Munoz, Felipe] Empresa Colombia Petroleos ECOPETROL SA, Bogota, Colombia",Universidad de los Andes (Colombia); Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya,"Mesa-Gomez, A (corresponding author), Cra 1 19A-40,Edificio Mario Laserna,Piso 7, Bogota, Colombia.",am.mesa@uniandes.edu.co,,"Mesa Gomez, Adriana/0000-0001-8216-425X; Munoz Giraldo, Felipe/0000-0001-5045-1713","National Department of Science, Technology, and Innovation of Colombia [785]; Fundaci.on Carolina","National Department of Science, Technology, and Innovation of Colombia; Fundaci.on Carolina","A.

This is most evident for simple (mostly two-parameter) indices, when comparing them to complete heat budget models developed since the 1960s. ISB Commission 6 took up the idea of developing a Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) based on the most advanced multi-node model of thermoregulation representing progress in science within the last three to four decades, both in thermo-physiological and heat exchange theory. Creating the essential research synergies for the development of UTCI required pooling the resources of multidisciplinary experts in the fields of thermal physiology, mathematical modelling, occupational medicine, meteorological data handling (in particular radiation modelling) and application development in a network. It was possible to extend the expertise of ISB Commission 6 substantially by COST (a European programme promoting Cooperation in Science and Technology) Action 730 so that finally over 45 scientists from 23 countries (Australia, Canada, Israel, several Europe countries, New Zealand, and the United States) worked together. The work was performed under the umbrella of the WMO Commission on Climatology (CCl). After extensive evaluations, Fiala's multi-node human physiology and thermal comfort model (FPC) was adopted for this study. The model was validated extensively, applying as yet unused data from other research groups, and extended for the purposes of the project. This model was coupled with a state-of-the-art clothing model taking into consideration behavioural adaptation of clothing insulation by the general urban population in response to actual environmental temperature. UTCI was then derived conceptually as an equivalent temperature (ET). Thus, for any combination of air temperature, wind, radiation, and humidity (stress), UTCI is defined as the isothermal air temperature of the reference condition that would elicit the same dynamic response (strain) of the physiological model. As UTCI is based on contemporary science its use will standardise applications in the major fields of human biometeorology, thus making research results comparable and physiologically relevant.","[Jendritzky, Gerd] Univ Freiburg, Inst Meteorol, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany; [de Dear, Richard] Univ Sydney, Fac Architecture Design & Planning, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Havenith, George] Univ Loughborough, Loughborough Design Sch, Environm Ergon Res Ctr, Loughborough, Leics, England",University of Freiburg; University of Sydney; Loughborough University,"Jendritzky, G (corresponding author), Univ Freiburg, Inst Meteorol, Hugstetter Str 55, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany.",gerd.jendritzky@meteo.uni-freiburg.de,"de Dear, Richard/AAP-8963-2020; Havenith, George/B-8579-2008; Nahas, Alberth/C-8379-2013","de Dear, Richard/0000-0002-3414-290X; Havenith, George/0000-0001-6223-4265; ","European Union TRD; International Society of Biometeorology Commission 6, under the umbrella of the World Meteorological Organization's Commission on Climatology CCl","European Union TRD; International Society of Biometeorology Commission 6, under the umbrella of the World Meteorological Organization's Commission on Climatology CCl","The UTCI project was performed within COST Action 730, funded by the European Union TRD Framework Programme and the International Society of Biometeorology Commission 6, under the umbrella of the World Meteorological Organization's Commission on Climatology CCl.",,52,489,519,18,238,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0020-7128,,,INT J BIOMETEOROL,Int.

While there is a myriad of challenges that have emerged because of such human-driven planetary changes, one area of investigation that requires ongoing scholarly attention and scientific debate is the emotions of the Anthropocene. The emotional, mental, and psychological burdens induced by rapid and unprecedented change must be understood to better reflect the experiences of people around the globe and to initiate conversations about how emotions may be used for transformative change and effective politics. This paper aims to provide insights into the types of emotions that are emerging in Oceania as the Anthropocene unfolds. To do this, we draw on several data sets: questionnaire results with visitors of Mt Barney Lodge in the World Heritage Gondwana area in Queensland, Australia; another questionnaire with Pacific Island experts engaged in climate change, development, and disaster risk management work; interviews with locals living in the Cook Islands; and various spoken, written, and visual art from the Pacific. Bringing these data sets together allows us to explore a diversity of experiences, perspectives, and emotional responses to the Anthropocene from participants across Oceania. We found that acute and slow-onset weather events, experiences of direct loss and change, a perceived lack of agency or control over futures, and a sense of injustice triggered emotions including fear, stress, anxiety, exhaustion, sadness, grief, anger, frustration, helplessness, worry, but also empowerment. These results are critical for the first step of acknowledging and naming the emotions that are emerging in Oceania, such that they can then be worked through, and may be used for transformative change, effective politics, and agency over futures.","[Clissold, Rachel; McNamara, Karen E.] Univ Queensland, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Westoby, Ross] Griffith Univ, Griffith Inst Tourism, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia",University of Queensland; Griffith University,"McNamara, KE (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.",r.clissold@uq.edu.au; karen.mcnamara@uq.edu.au; r.westoby@griffith.edu.au,"; McNamara, Karen/D-7322-2013","Westoby, Ross/0000-0001-9868-2246; McNamara, Karen/0000-0002-4511-8403",Australian Research Council Future Fellowship [FT190100114],Australian Research Council Future Fellowship(Australian Research Council),This research was funded through an Australian Research Council Future Fellowship (grant number FT190100114).,,69,1,1,5,6,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

This study aims at characterizing in a systematic way sea level variations along the coasts of France. Wave climates are first characterized using state-of-the-art high resolution hindcasts validated against available observations from the national network CANDHIS. This analysis reveals a contrasting situation between coastal zones located along the Bay of Biscay, exposed to energetic and moderate-to-long period swells, and coastal zones located in the English Channel and the Mediterranean Sea, exposed mostly to wind seas and shorter period swells. Tides are characterized using available tide gauge measurements retrieved from the national REFMAR database and display large contrasts, between microtidal regimes along the Mediterranean Sea and macrotidal regimes along the English Channel. The analysis of storm surges computed from the same data reveals that they are controlled not only by storm tracks but also by the width of the continental shelf. Thus, during the studied period 1998-2018, storm surges derived from tide gauges measurements hardly reach 1.0 m along the coastlines of the southern Bay of Biscay and the eastern Mediterranean Sea but can exceed 2.0 m in the English Channel. The analysis of long-term sea level trends reveals significant variabilities, with an accelerated sea level rise on average from 1.2 mm/yr over the 20th century to 2.4 mm/yr over the two last decades, and ranging locally from 1.23 mm/yr (Roscoff) to 4.25 mm/yr (Nice). Finally, these values are compared against vertical land motions, computed from a state-of-the-art GPS reanalysis. A moderate land subsidence (<1 mm/year) is found for the majority of the stations.","[Dodet, Guillaume] Inst Univ Europeen Mer, UMR GEOMER CNRS LETG 6554, Plouzane, France; [Bertin, Xavier; Gravelle, Mederic; Testut, Laurent; Woppelmann, Guy] Univ La Rochelle, CNRS, UMR 7266 LIENSs, La Rochelle, France; [Bouchette, Frederic] Univ Montpellier II, UMR 5243 Geosci Montpellier, Montpellier, France; [Testut, Laurent] CNRS CNES IRD UPS, UMR5566 LEGOS, Toulouse, France",Universite de Bretagne Occidentale; Institut Universitaire Europeen de la Mer (IUEM); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); La Rochelle Universite; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Earth Sciences & Astronomy (INSU); Universite de Montpellier; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier,"Dodet, G (corresponding author), Inst Univ Europeen Mer, UMR GEOMER CNRS LETG 6554, Plouzane, France.",guillaume.dodet@univ-brest.fr,"Bouchette, Frédéric/E-9825-2010; Dodet, Guillaume/F-8704-2017","Bouchette, Frédéric/0000-0001-9537-3624; Gravelle, Mederic/0000-0002-5223-1340; Testut, Laurent/0000-0002-3969-2919; Dodet, Guillaume/0000-0002-0200-6858",INSU/CNRS; University of La Rochelle; GLADYS; University of Montpellier; MUSE; ESA Sea State Climate Change Initiative; Laboratoire d'Excellence LabexMER [ANR-10-LABX-19]; French government under the program Investissements d'Avenir; region of Brittany; University of Toulouse,INSU/CNRS(Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)); University of La Rochelle; GLADYS; University of Montpellier; MUSE; ESA Sea State Climate Change Initiative; Laboratoire d'Excellence LabexMER; French government under the program Investissements d'Avenir(French National Research Agency (ANR)); region of Brittany(Region Bretagne); University of Toulouse,"This work was possible thanks to all institutions that contribute to make wave buoys, tide gauge and GNSS data freely available via well-structured international and national programs and networks (GLOSS, IGS, RONIM, RENAG, CANDHIS).

Developing pathways toward transformation is especially difficult in regions with multiple contested resource uses and rights, with diverse decision makers and rules, and where high uncertainty is generated by differences in stakeholders' values, understanding of climate change, and ways of adapting. Such a region is the Murray-Darling Basin, Australia, from which we provide insights for developing a process to address these constraints. We present criteria for sequencing actions along adaptation pathways: feasibility of the action within the current decision context, its facilitation of other actions, its role in averting exceedance of a critical threshold, its robustness and resilience under diverse and unexpected shocks, its effect on future options, its lead time, and its effects on equity and social cohesion. These criteria could potentially enable development of multiple stakeholder-specific adaptation pathways through a regional collective action process. The actual implementation of these multiple adaptation pathways will be highly uncertain and politically difficult because of fixity of resource-use rights, unequal distribution of power, value conflicts, and the likely redistribution of benefits and costs. We propose that the approach we outline for building resilient pathways to transformation is a flexible and credible way of negotiating these challenges.","[Abel, Nick; Wise, Russell M.; Colloff, Matthew J.; Walker, Brian H.; Butler, James R.

They are inferred to be the product of the explosive interaction between rising magma (mostly basaltic) and various groundwater sources or surface water bodies. Maar and tuff ring volcanoes are commonly associated with extensive scoria cone fields that are fed by dispersed volcanic vents, providing access to the surface for magma over a long period of time (thousands to millions of years' timescale). The presence of maar and tuff ring volcanoes, therefore, is an important signifier of the availability of water from sub-surface and/or surface water sources. As environmental conditions change over time, the groundwater table, as well as surface water availability, can change dramatically and this is likely be reflected in the type of volcanoes formed on the surface. Such changes are the most graphic and visible in volcanic fields that are today located in arid environments, where the presence of young volcanoes formed through interactions with water demonstrates how the environment can change over geological timescales. Therefore, these areas have high geoeducational values and can contribute to our understanding of how external (water sources controlled by climatic factors) and internal (magmatic) forces can shape the style of volcanism of a volcanic field. Harrat Hutaymah is one of the excellent locations where there is great abundance of maars and tuff rings. They are located in an area dominated today by various types of deserts. Harrat Hutaymah, therefore, demonstrates the global geological changes that can affect the style of volcanism and hence the resulting volcanic landscape. The richness of the region in archaeological sites and early settlements indicates the importance of this region for the early evolution of civilizations in the Middle East, which is likely to have been enhanced and/or modified by similar environmental changes over a much smaller timescale. Harrat Hutaymah provides a firm basis to demonstrate global changes through its volcanic heritage that are easily accessible and well exposed.","[Moufti, Mohammed R.; El-Masry, Nabil; Qaddah, Atef] King Abdulaziz Univ, Geol Hazards Res Unit, Jeddah 21413, Saudi Arabia; [Nemeth, Karoly] Massey Univ, Volcanic Risk Solut, Palmerston North, New Zealand",King Abdulaziz University; Massey University,"Nemeth, K (corresponding author), King Abdulaziz Univ, Geol Hazards Res Unit, Jeddah 21413, Saudi Arabia.",k.nemeth@massey.ac.nz,"Nemeth, Karoly/V-7614-2017; El-Masry, Nabil/D-6106-2013; Qaddah, Atef/D-6118-2013","Nemeth, Karoly/0000-0003-1026-0407; El-Masry, Nabil/0000-0002-9272-9776; Qaddah, Atef/0000-0002-5924-382X",,,,,78,22,22,0,27,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1867-2477,1867-2485,,GEOHERITAGE,Geoheritage,JUN,2015,2,,,,103,118,,10.1007/s12371-014-0110-3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12371-014-0110-3,,,16,"Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Geology,CI0QX,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000354443800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

According to Bergmann's and Allen's rules, populations in regions with a cold climate are expected to display an overall larger body and smaller/shorter extremities than those in warm/hot environments. In the present study, the skeletal limb size and proportions of prehistoric Jomon hunter-gatherers, who extensively inhabited subarctic to subtropical areas in the ancient Japanese archipelago, were examined to evaluate whether or not the inter-regional differences follow such ecogeographic patterns. Results showed that the Jomon intralimb proportions including relative distal limb lengths did not differ significantly among five regions from northern Hokkaido to the southern Okinawa Islands. This suggests a limited co-variability of the intralimb proportions with climate, particularly within genealogically close populations. In contrast, femoral head breadth (associated with body mass) and skeletal limb lengths were found to be significantly and positively correlated with latitude, suggesting a north-south geographical cline in the body size. This gradient therefore comprehensively conforms to Bergmann's rule, and may stem from multiple potential factors such as phylogenetic constraints, microevolutionary adaptation to climatic/geographic conditions during the Jomon period, and nutritional and physiological response during ontogeny. Specifically, the remarkably small-bodied Jomon in the Okinawa Islands can also be explained as an adjustment to subtropical and insular environments. Thus, the findings obtained in this study indicate that Jomon people, while maintaining fundamental intralimb proportions, displayed body size variation in concert with ambient surroundings.

Since the Arctic is still quite cold, especially in winter, it is often (implicitly) assumed that the additional precipitation will fall mostly as snow(3). However, little is known about future changes in the distributions of rainfall and snowfall in the Arctic. Here we use 37 state-of-the-art climate models in standardized twenty-first-century (2006-2100) simulations4 to show a decrease in average annual Arctic snowfall (70 degrees-90 degrees N), despite the strong precipitation increase. Rain is projected to become the dominant form of precipitation in theArctic region (2091-2100), as atmosphericwarming causes a greater fraction of snowfall to melt before it reaches the surface, in particular over the North Atlantic and the Barents Sea. The reduction in Arctic snowfall is most pronounced during summer and autumn when temperatures are close to the melting point, but also winter rainfall is found to intensify considerably. Projected (seasonal) trends in rainfall and snowfall will heavily impact Arctic hydrology (for example, river discharge, permafrost melt)(5-7), climatology (for example, snow, sea-ice albedo and melt)(8,9) and ecology (for example, water and food availability)(5,10).","[Bintanja, R.; Andry, O.] Royal Netherlands Meteorol Inst KNMI, Utrechtseweg 297, NL-3731GA De Bilt, Netherlands; [Bintanja, R.] Univ Groningen, ESRIG, Nijenborgh 6-7, NL-9747 AG Groningen, Netherlands",Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute; University of Groningen,"Bintanja, R (corresponding author), Royal Netherlands Meteorol Inst KNMI, Utrechtseweg 297, NL-3731GA De Bilt, Netherlands.;Bintanja, R (corresponding author), Univ Groningen, ESRIG, Nijenborgh 6-7, NL-9747 AG Groningen, Netherlands.",bintanja@knmi.nl,,,,,,,30,250,255,12,140,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1758-678X,1758-6798,,NAT CLIM CHANGE,Nat.

Time series of 6-h meridional winds at about 780 mb over West Africa were spectrally analyzed to detect African wave disturbances, whose properties for the two ensembles are compared and contrasted. The realistically simulated, stronger 1988 tropical easterly jet and the associated stronger upper-tropospheric divergence are components of interannual differences in the SST-forced planetary circulation, which correspond to higher amplitudes of African wave activity and concomitant excesses in 1988 Sahel rainfall rates. Results do not show. however, that most of the heavier precipitation was spatially organized by African wave structures. The excess rainfall is associated with stronger mean southerly circulation in the lower troposphere, which carried more moisture into the Sahel. Nevertheless, because waves modulate winds, convergence, humidity, and precipitation, the study suggests that they serve as a teleconnection mechanism, whereby extreme Pacific Ocean SST anomalies art: able to influence climate variability in Africa's Sahel.","NASA,GODDARD INST SPACE STUDIES,NEW YORK,NY 10025; LAB MODELISAT CLIMAT & ENVIRONNMENT,GIF SUR YVETTE,FRANCE",National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center,"Druyan, LM (corresponding author), COLUMBIA UNIV,CTR CLIMATE SYST RES,2880 BROADWAY,NEW YORK,NY 10025, USA.",,,"Hall, Timothy/0000-0003-1755-4889",,,,,31,19,19,0,0,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693",0894-8763,,,J APPL METEOROL,J.

Observations indicate the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation-a fundamental component of the ocean's global conveyor belt-is weakening. Although causes remain uncertain, such weakening is consistent with increasing greenhouse gases. Recent studies also suggest that anthropogenic emissions associated with air pollution can impact the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. Here, we use four state-of-the-art chemistry-climate models to quantify how efforts to improve future air quality, via near-term climate forcer mitigation, will impact the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. Future reductions in aerosols, ozone and precursor gases alone induces end-of-century weakening of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation by up to 10%. However, when methane reductions are also included, this weakening is offset. The responses are best explained by changes in the North Atlantic radiative forcing. Thus, efforts to improve air quality must also target methane and other greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide to avoid weakening of the world's major ocean circulation system.","[Hassan, Taufiq; Allen, Robert J.; Liu, Wei] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Shim, Sungbo] Natl Inst Meteorol Sci, Seogwipo Si, Jeju Do, South Korea; [van Noije, Twan; Le Sager, Philippe] Royal Netherlands Meteorol Inst, De Bilt, Netherlands; [Oshima, Naga; Deushi, Makoto] Japan Meteorol Agcy, Meteorol Res Inst, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Randles, Cynthia A.] ExxonMobil Technol & Engn Co, Annandale, NJ USA; [O'Connor, Fiona M.] Met Off Hadley Ctr, Exeter, Devon, England",University of California System; University of California Riverside; National Institute of Meteorological Sciences; Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute; Japan Meteorological Agency; Meteorological Research Institute - Japan; Met Office - UK; Hadley Centre,"Allen, RJ (corresponding author), Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.",rjallen@ucr.edu,,"O'Connor, Fiona/0000-0003-2893-4828; Hassan Mozumder, Mohammad Taufiq/0000-0003-2361-6361; Deushi, Makoto/0000-0002-0373-3918; Oshima, Naga/0000-0002-8451-2411; Le Sager, Philippe/0000-0002-2855-668X","Korea Meteorological Administration Research and Development Program Development and Assessment of Climate Change Scenario [KMA2018-00321]; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science KAKENHI [JP18H03363, JP18H05292, JP19K12312, JP20K04070, JP21H03582]; Environment Research and Technology Development Fund of the Environmental Restoration and Conservation Agency of Japan [JPMEERF20202003, JPMEERF20205001]; Arctic Challenge for Sustainability II (ArCS II) [JPMXD1420318865]; Ministry of the Environment, Japan [MLIT1753]","Korea Meteorological Administration Research and Development Program Development and Assessment of Climate Change Scenario(Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA)); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Environment Research and Technology Development Fund of the Environmental Restoration and Conservation Agency of Japan; Arctic Challenge for Sustainability II (ArCS II); Ministry of the Environment, Japan(Ministry of the Environment, Japan)","S.S. was supported by the Korea Meteorological Administration Research and Development Program Development and Assessment of Climate Change Scenario under Grant (KMA2018-00321).

The Global Energy and Water cycle Exchanges (GEWEX) water vapor assessment has been tasked with characterizing the current state of the art in water vapor products currently available for climate analysis. Within the scope of this exercise, water vapor profiles from AIRS have been assessed using collocated characterized in situ measurements of tropospheric water vapor between 2007 and 2012. We first show how previously published methods for correcting radiosondes can be applied to global records, which show high correlations to Global Climate Observing System Reference Upper-Air Network (GRUAN) performance at pressures between the surface and 250hPa. We go further and show the first comparison of uncertainties from both the newly created Characterized Radiosonde Measurement (CRM) and GRUAN data sets. Global estimates of AIRS water vapor profile (wet/dry) biases relative to GRUAN and CRM are within 60.3%ppmv and 150.1%ppmv below 300hPa, respectively. The CRM record allows latitudinal analysis for the first time, which when examined shows sensitivity to changes in absolute concentration due to large-scale circulation in the International Tropical Convergence Zone. This paper advances the use of state-of-the-art in situ records for characterizing absolute performance, recognizing that long-term stability needs further research.","[Trent, Tim; Remedios, John] Univ Leicester, Dept Phys & Astron, Earth Observat Sci, Leicester, Leics, England; [Trent, Tim; Remedios, John] Univ Leicester, Dept Phys & Astron, Natl Ctr Earth Observat, Leicester, Leics, England; [Schroeder, Marc] Deutsch Wetterdienst, Satellite Based Climate Monitoring, Offenbach, Germany",University of Leicester; University of Leicester; Deutscher Wetterdienst,"Trent, T (corresponding author), Univ Leicester, Dept Phys & Astron, Earth Observat Sci, Leicester, Leics, England.;Trent, T (corresponding author), Univ Leicester, Dept Phys & Astron, Natl Ctr Earth Observat, Leicester, Leics, England.",tjt11@le.ac.uk,,"Trent, Tim/0000-0001-9215-5808","Natural Environment Research Council through Natural Centre for Earth Observation [PR140015]; EUMETSAT member states through CM SAF; NERC [nceo020001, nceo020006] Funding Source: UKRI",Natural Environment Research Council through Natural Centre for Earth Observation; EUMETSAT member states through CM SAF; NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"Tim Trent and John Remedios would like to acknowledge the funding from Natural Environment Research Council through Natural Centre for Earth Observation, contract PR140015.

This contributes major uncertainties to the prediction of global and regional climate change. Therefore, models need good parameterizations for heterogeneous ice nucleation by atmospheric aerosols. Here the authors present a new parameterization of immersion freezing on desert dust particles derived from a large number of experiments carried out at the Aerosol Interaction and Dynamics in the Atmosphere (AIDA) cloud chamber facility. The parameterization is valid in the temperature range between -12 degrees and -36 degrees C at or above water saturation and can be used in atmospheric models that include information about the dust surface area. The new parameterization was applied to calculate distribution maps of ice nuclei during a Saharan dust event based on model results from the regional-scale model Consortium for Small-Scale Modelling-Aerosols and Reactive Trace Gases (COSMO-ART). The results were then compared to measurements at the Taunus Observatory on Mount Kleiner Feldberg, Germany, and to three other parameterizations applied to the dust outbreak. The aerosol number concentration and surface area from the COSMO-ART model simulation were taken as input to different parameterizations. Although the surface area from the model agreed well with aerosol measurements during the dust event at Kleiner Feldberg, the ice nuclei (IN) number concentration calculated from the new surface-area-based parameterization was about a factor of 13 less than IN measurements during the same event. Systematic differences of more than a factor of 10 in the IN number concentration were also found among the different parameterizations. Uncertainties in the modeled and measured parameters probably both contribute to this discrepancy and should be addressed in future studies.","[Niemand, Monika] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Atmospher Aerosol Res Div, D-76021 Karlsruhe, Germany; [Connolly, Paul] Univ Manchester, Sch Earth Atmospher & Environm Sci, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Klein, Holger; Bingemer, Heinz] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Inst Atmospher & Environm Sci, Frankfurt, Germany; [DeMott, Paul] Colorado State Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA",Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; University of Manchester; Goethe University Frankfurt; Colorado State University,"Niemand, M (corresponding author), Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Atmospher Aerosol Res Div, POB 3640, D-76021 Karlsruhe, Germany.",monika.niemand@kit.edu,"Hoose, Corinna/A-4295-2009; Vogel, Heike/A-3196-2013; Leisner, Thomas K/A-2391-2013; Connolly, Paul/ABD-1752-2020; Möhler, Ottmar/J-9426-2012; Vogel, Bernhard/A-9558-2013; Connolly, Paul J/A-2024-2012; DeMott, Paul J/C-4389-2011","Hoose, Corinna/0000-0003-2827-5789; Leisner, Thomas K/0000-0001-9693-7671; Connolly, Paul/0000-0002-3294-7405; Möhler, Ottmar/0000-0002-7551-9814; Vogel, Bernhard/0000-0002-8894-0165; Connolly, Paul J/0000-0002-3294-7405; DeMott, Paul J/0000-0002-3719-1889",Helmholtz Association through the Virtual Institute on Aerosol-Cloud Interactions (VI-ACI) [VH-VI-233]; President's Initiative and Networking fund [VH-NG-620]; NERC [NE/G000875/1]; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/G000875/1] Funding Source: researchfish,Helmholtz Association through the Virtual Institute on Aerosol-Cloud Interactions (VI-ACI); President's Initiative and Networking fund; NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"Skillful support by the AIDA technician team is gratefully acknowledged.

The decarbonization of baseload electricity is met by significant expansions of nuclear power and renewable energy generation technologies as well as the application of carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) technologies applied to both coal and natural gas fired power plants. Relatively little attention has been paid thus far to whether intermediate and peaking units would respond the same way to a climate policy given the very different operational and economic context that these kinds of electricity generation units operate under. In this paper, the authors discuss key aspects of the load segmentation methodology used to imbed a varying electricity demand within the GCAM (a state-of-the-art Integrated Assessment Model) energy and economic modelling framework and present key results on the role CCS technologies could play in decarbonizng subpeak and peak generation (encompassing only the top 10% of the load) and under what conditions. To do this, the authors have modelled two hypothetical climate policies that require 50% and 80% reductions in US emissions from business as usual by the middle of this century. Intermediate electricity generation is virtually decarbonized once carbon prices exceed approximately $150/tonCO(2). When CO2 permit prices exceed $160/tonCO(2), natural gas power plants with CCS have roughly the same marketshare as conventional gas plants in serving subpeak loads. The penetration of CCS into peak load (upper 6% here) is minimal under the scenarios modeled here suggesting that CO2 emissions from this aspect of the U.S. electricity sector would persist well into the future even with stringent CO2 emission control policies in place.

Proxies of past conditions recovered from Stalagmite ANJ94-2 include ratios of carbon and oxygen stable isotopes (delta C-13 and delta O-18), mineralogy (calcite and aragonite), layer-bounding surfaces, layer-specific width, and detrital material. Those proxies suggest that the natural environment changed in response to changes in rainfall at time scales of a few decades to multiple centuries; comparison with distant proxies suggests that wetter conditions in northwestern Madagascar may have been linked to cooling in the Northern Hemisphere. Carbon isotope data nonetheless suggest that the greatest environmental change in the area coincided with human introduction of swidden (tavy) agriculture about 1200 years ago, during a time not of drought but perhaps of slightly increasing wetness. The timing and extent of environmental change 1200 to 600 years ago seen in stalagmite and wetland data suggest that human modification of the landscape had a causal role in the extinction of Madagascar's megafauna. On the other hand, the results combine with other recent research to indicate that drought was not the cause of the megafaunal extinction. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Railsback, L.

Arsenic concentrations up to 10,000 mu g/L have been reported in surface water systems, caused by human activities such as mining, industrial effluents, and municipal solid waste disposals. Similarly, concentrations up to 1760 mu g/L have been reported in many groundwater systems which account for approximately 60% of drinking water demand in rural Africa. Naturally, As is mobilized in groundwater systems through weathering processes and dissolution of As bearing minerals such as sulfides (pyrite, arsenopyrite, and chalcopyrite), iron oxides, other mineralized granitic and gneissic rocks, and climate change factors triggering As release in groundwater. Recently, public health studies in some African countries such as Tanzania and Ethiopia have reported high levels of As in human tissues such as toenails as well as in urine among pregnant women exposed to As contaminated groundwater, respectively. In urine, concentrations up to 150 mu g/L were reported among pregnant women depending on As contaminated drinking water within Geita gold mining areas in the north-western part of Tanzania. However, the studies on As occurrence, and mobilization in African water systems, as well as related health effects are limited, due to the lack of awareness. The current study aims to gather information on the occurrence of As in different environmental compartments, its spatial variability, public health problems and the potential remediation options of As in water sources. The study also aims at creating awareness of As contamination in Africa and its removal using locally available materials.","[Irunde, Regina; Ijumulana, Julian; Ligate, Fanuel; Ahmad, Arslan; Bhattacharya, Prosun] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Dept Sustainable Dev Environm Sci & Engn, KTH Int Groundwater Arsen Res Grp, Teknikringen 10B, SE-10044 Stockholm, Sweden; [Irunde, Regina; Ijumulana, Julian; Ligate, Fanuel; Mtamba, Joseph; Mtalo, Felix] Univ Dar Salaam, Dept Water Resources Engn, Coll Engn & Technol, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania; [Irunde, Regina] Univ Dar Salaam, Coll Nat & Appl Sci, Dept Chem, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania; [Ijumulana, Julian] Univ Dar Salaam, Coll Engn & Technol, Dept Transportat & Geotech Engn, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania; [Ligate, Fanuel] Univ Dar Salaam, Mkwawa Coll Educ, Dept Chem, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania; [Maity, Jyoti Prakash] KIIT Deemed Be Univ, Sch Appl Sci, Dept Chem, Bhubaneswar 751024, Odisha, India; [Ahmad, Arslan] SIBELCO Ankerpoort NV, Op Bos 300, NL-6223 EP Maastricht, Netherlands",Royal Institute of Technology; University of Dar es Salaam; University of Dar es Salaam; University of Dar es Salaam; University of Dar es Salaam; Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology (KIIT),"Irunde, R; Ijumulana, J (corresponding author), KTH Royal Inst Technol, Dept Sustainable Dev Environm Sci & Engn, KTH Int Groundwater Arsen Res Grp, Teknikringen 10B, SE-10044 Stockholm, Sweden.",irunde@kth.se; julianij@kth.se,"Ligate, Fanuel/ACS-2234-2022; Ligate, Fanuel Josephat/AAZ-4434-2020","Ligate, Fanuel/0000-0002-2883-2445; Ligate, Fanuel Josephat/0000-0002-2883-2445",Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) [51170071],Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida),"The authors extend sincere thanks to the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) for funding the project DAFWAT through Sida Contribution 51170071, between University of Dar es Salaam (UDSM) and the KTH Royal Institute of Technology for the current study.",,202,3,3,5,5,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2352-801X,,,GROUNDWATER SUST DEV,Groundwater Sustain.

The rock art has been created by removing the black varnish coating and thereby exposing the light sandstone underneath. With time, the varnish, a natural manganese (Mn)-rich coating, grows back. To study the rate of regrowth, we made 234 measurements by portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF) on intact varnish and engraved petroglyphs. Since many petroglyphs can be assigned to a specific time period, a relationship between their ages and the Mn surface densities (D-Mn) of the regrown material could be derived. This relationship was improved by normalizing the D-Mn in the petroglyphs with the D-Mn of adjacent intact varnish. In turn, we used this relationship to assign a chronologic context to petroglyphs of unknown ages. Following the removal of the varnish by the artist and prior to the beginning of Mn oxyhydroxide regrowth, a thin Fe-rich film forms on the underlying rock. This initial Fe oxyhydroxide deposit may act as catalyst for subsequent fast Mn oxidation. After a few decades of relatively rapid growth, the regrowth of the Mn-rich varnish slows down to about 0.017 mu g cm(-2) a(-1) Mn, corresponding to about 0.012% a(-1) Mn of the intact varnish density, or about 1.2 nm a(-1), presumably due to a change of the catalytic process. Our results suggest that petroglyphs were engraved almost continuously since the pre-Neolithic period, and that rock varnish growth seems to proceed roughly linear, without detectable influences of the regional Holocene climatic changes.","[Macholdt, Dorothea S.; Jochum, Klaus Peter; Andreae, Meinrat O.] Max Planck Inst Chem, POB 3060, D-55020 Mainz, Germany; [Al-Amri, Abdullah M.; Tuffaha, Husam T.; Andreae, Meinrat O.] King Saud Univ, Geol & Geophys Dept, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; [Andreae, Meinrat O.] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",Max Planck Society; King Saud University; University of California System; University of California San Diego; Scripps Institution of Oceanography,"Macholdt, DS (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Chem, POB 3060, D-55020 Mainz, Germany.",d.macholdt@mpic.de,"Andreae, Meinrat O./B-1068-2008","Andreae, Meinrat O./0000-0003-1968-7925","Max Planck Society of Germany; King Saud University, Saudi Arabia","Max Planck Society of Germany(Max Planck Society); King Saud University, Saudi Arabia(King Saud University)","This work was funded by the Max Planck Society of Germany and King Saud University, Saudi Arabia.",,54,12,12,0,10,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0959-6836,1477-0911,,HOLOCENE,Holocene,SEP,2018,9,,,,1495,1511,,10.1177/0959683618777075,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683618777075,,,17,"Geography, Physical; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Physical Geography; Geology,GS1TN,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000443315700010,View Full Record in Web of Science

Quantifying the processes that control UTLS composition (e.g., stratosphere-troposphere exchange) therefore represents a crucial task. We assess the influence of uncertainties in the atmospheric mixing strength on global UTLS distributions of greenhouse gases (water vapor, ozone, methane, and nitrous oxide) and associated radiative effects. The study is based on multiannual simulations with the Chemical Lagrangian Model of the Stratosphere (CLaMS) driven by ERA-Interim meteorological data and on a state-of-the-art radiance code. Mixing, the irreversible part of transport, is controlled by the local horizontal strain and vertical shear of the atmospheric flow. We find that simulated radiative effects of water vapor and ozone, both characterized by steep gradients in the UTLS, are particularly sensitive to uncertainties of the atmospheric mixing strength. Globally averaged radiative effects are about 0.72 and 0.17 W/m(2) for water vapor and ozone, respectively. For ozone, the largest impact of mixing uncertainties is observed in the extra-tropical lower stratosphere.","[Riese, M.; Ploeger, F.; Vogel, B.; Konopka, P.] Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Energy & Climate Res, D-52425 Julich, Germany; [Rap, A.; Forster, P.] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Dameris, M.] Deutsch Zentrum Luft & Raumfahrt, Inst Phys Atmosphare, Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Research Center Julich; University of Leeds; Helmholtz Association; German Aerospace Centre (DLR),"Riese, M (corresponding author), Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Energy & Climate Res, IEK 7, D-52425 Julich, Germany.",M.Riese@fz-juelich.de,"Konopka, Paul/A-7329-2013; Rap, Alexandru/G-7532-2016; Ploeger, Felix/A-1393-2013; Vogel, Bärbel/A-9988-2013; Riese, Martin/A-3927-2013; Forster, Piers M/F-9829-2010","Rap, Alexandru/0000-0002-2319-6769; Riese, Martin/0000-0001-6398-6493; Forster, Piers M/0000-0002-6078-0171; Vogel, Barbel/0000-0001-9763-3055; Ploeger, Felix/0000-0002-3427-6991; Dameris, Martin/0000-0001-6700-0628",European Space Agency (ESA) [AO/1-6340/09/NL/CBi]; UK NERC [NE/G005109/1]; NERC [NE/G005109/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/G005109/1] Funding Source: researchfish,European Space Agency (ESA)(European Space AgencyEuropean Commission); UK NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"The work presented here was partly funded by the European Space Agency (ESA) as part of the project PREMIER - Quantification of Atmospheric Pollution and Climate Aspects under Request for Quotation AO/1-6340/09/NL/CBi.

The small signal gain on the overtone transitions was estimated to be 0.1 m(-1). Fundamental band (V+1 -> V) lasing was observed within 4.9-5.7 mu m spectral range. In fundamental band output power 2.1 kW with efficiency 21% was obtained, with typical small signal gain being about I m-1. Modeling experiments on electron-beam sustained discharge facility were carried out at experimental conditions (gas pressure, temperature) corresponding to those of supersonic gas flow.

Reservoirs act as critical buffers to ensure agricultural and municipal water deliveries, mitigate flooding, and generate hydroelectric power, yet they often lose significant amounts of water through evaporation, especially in arid and semiarid regions. Despite this fact, reservoir evaporation has been an inconsistently and inaccurately estimated component of the water cycle within the water resource infrastructure of the arid and semiarid western United States. This paper highlights the increasing importance and challenges of correctly estimating and forecasting reservoir evaporation in the current and future climate, as well as the need to bring new ideas and state-of-the-art practices for the estimation of reservoir evaporation into operational use for modern water resource managers. New ideas and practices include i) improving the estimation of reservoir evaporation using up-to-date knowledge, state-of-the-art instrumentation and numerical models, and innovative experimental designs to diagnose processes and accurately forecast evaporation; ii) improving our understanding of spatial and temporal variations in evaporative water loss from existing reservoirs and transferring this knowledge when expanding reservoirs or siting new ones; and iii) implementing an adaptive management plan that incorporates new knowledge, observations, and forecasts of reservoir evaporation to improve water resource management.","[Friedrich, Katja; Grossman, Robert L.] Univ Colorado, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Huntington, Justin; Pearson, Christopher] Desert Res Inst, Div Hydrol Sci, Reno, NV USA; [Blanken, Peter D.; Lenters, John] Univ Colorado, Dept Geog, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Lenters, John] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Ctr Limnol, Boulder Jct, WI USA; [Holman, Kathleen D.; Prairie, James; Dahm, Katharine] US Bur Reclamat, Denver, CO USA; [Gochis, David] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [Livneh, Ben] Univ Colorado, Dept Civil Environm & Architectural Engn, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Livneh, Ben] Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Boulder, CO USA; [Skeie, Erik; Finnessey, Taryn] Colorado Water Conservat Board, Denver, CO USA; [Healey, Nathan C.; Hook, Simon J.] NASA, CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA USA; [Kowalski, Ted] Walton Family Fdn, Environm Colorado River Initiat, Denver, CO USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); Desert Research Institute NSHE; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; California Institute of Technology; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL),"Friedrich, K (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",katja.friedrich@colorado.edu,"Livneh, Ben/I-2939-2015; Hook, Simon J/D-5920-2016","Livneh, Ben/0000-0001-5445-2473; Hook, Simon J/0000-0002-0953-6165; Lenters, John/0000-0002-6895-7592",National Aeronautics and Space Administration [NRA NNH13ZDA001N]; Landsat Science Team funding; Basin Study Program through West-Wide Climate Risk Assessments,National Aeronautics and Space Administration(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); Landsat Science Team funding; Basin Study Program through West-Wide Climate Risk Assessments,"We wish to extend our thanks to the University of Colorado for hosting and sponsoring the workshop and DRI for its assistance with providing travel funds.

Although several authors have discussed the advantages of using monetary valuation in the weighting phase of LCA, its practical implementation is still challenging. The aim of this study is to critically assess the available monetary valuation approaches applicable in LCA and highlight challenges and research needs towards the development of a set of monetary valuation factors to be applied to life cycle impact assessment methods, e.g., the European Environmental Footprint one. To this end, a literature review was performed to collect and compare monetary valuation coefficients. The review highlighted significant variability in the availability of monetary valuation coefficients across impact categories, with some (e.g., climate change) commonly analyzed, compared to others (e.g., terrestrial euthrophication) with very little information available to date. The collected monetary valuation coefficients were tested in a case study on the environmental impacts of the consumption of an average European citizen. Results were compared with the per capita household expenditure as a point of reference, yielding a contribution of the external damage ranging from 15% to 41% of the per capita expenditure. The novelty of this work lies in performing an updated and systematic assessment of the available monetary valuation approaches for LCA and investigating the variability of the results that stem from the adoption of different approaches, paving the way towards an increased use of LCA and environmental considerations in decision making processes.","[Amadei, Andrea Martino; De Laurentiis, Valeria; Sala, Serenella] European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Via Enrico Fermi 2749, I-21027 Ispra, VA, Italy",European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site,"Sala, S (corresponding author), European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Via Enrico Fermi 2749, I-21027 Ispra, VA, Italy.",serenella.sala@ec.europa.eu,"Sala, Serenella/AAA-9133-2022","Sala, Serenella/0000-0003-1919-9948; Amadei, Andrea/0000-0003-3279-9665",European Commission Directorate General of Environment [070201/2019/811467/AA/ENV.B.1]; Joint Research Centre 'Technical support for the Environmental Footprint and the Life Cycle Data Network (EF4) DG ENV' [070201/2019/811467/AA/ENV.B.1],European Commission Directorate General of Environment; Joint Research Centre 'Technical support for the Environmental Footprint and the Life Cycle Data Network (EF4) DG ENV',The present study has been funded via an Administrative Arrangement between the European Commission Directorate General of Environment and the Joint Research Centre 'Technical support for the Environmental Footprint and the Life Cycle Data Network (EF4) DG ENV' 070201/2019/811467/AA/ENV.B.1.,,53,5,5,5,10,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0959-6526,1879-1786,,J CLEAN PROD,J.

It has been proposed that observed changes in salinity can be used to infer changes in the water cycle. Here salinity is characterized by the distribution of water masses in salinity coordinates. Only mixing and sources and sinks of freshwater and salt can modify this distribution. Mixing acts to collapse the distribution, making saline waters fresher and fresh waters more saline. Hence, in steady state, there must be net precipitation over fresh waters and net evaporation over saline waters. A simple model is developed to describe the relationship between the breadth of the distribution, the water cycle, and mixingthe latter being characterized by an e-folding time scale. In both observations and a state-of-the-art ocean model, the water cycle maintains a salinity distribution in steady state with a mixing time scale of the order of 50 yr. The same simple model predicts the response of the salinity distribution to a change in the water cycle. This study suggests that observations of changes in ocean salinity could be used to infer changes in the hydrological cycle.","[Zika, Jan D.; Skliris, Nikolaos; Marsh, Robert] Univ Southampton, Natl Oceanog Ctr, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, England; [Nurser, A.

In particular, there is no consensus on whether the EASM rain belt reached its modern northern limit by the early Holocene. Here, we present inferred moisture variations from a multi-parameter, absolute-dated lacustrine-eolian sequence from northern China that date back to the late Pleistocene (similar to 14 ka BP or thousand years ago). We observed a sharp transition towards wet conditions at the onset of the Holocene Epoch. Maximum wet climate occurred here during similar to 11.3-8.5 ka. The climate remained predominantly wet until similar to 4.2 ka, then it became progressively drier. We observed alternating organic-rich, fine-grained lake deposits and organic-depleted, coarse-grained eolian sand layers during similar to 14-7 ka. These layers correspond to sedimentation associated with the Allerod, Younger Dryas (YD), post YD warming, pre-Boreal oscillation (PBO), early Holocene and 8.2 ka event.

Sanctuary Lab, a transdisciplinary initiative at UVA, investigates how religious processes interact with planetary stresses. Provisionally adopting a keyword in religious studies, the sacred, opens a post-disciplinary angle of inquiry into Anthropocene processes of cultural and environmental change. Focusing on dynamics of change in places regarded as sanctuaries affords unique perspective on how rapid planetary changes interact with particular inherited streams of normativity and imagination. This essay integrates field note illustrations from Yellowstone and Bhutan with critical reflection on the lab's approach in order to share initial hypotheses, collaborative research practices, and potential significance. It suggests that sacralization is part of the process through which cultures make sense of rapid changes; that nonhumans participate in sacralization; that sanctuaries offer unique laboratories of coupled change; and that arts-based exercises can help drive critical reflection on experience and method.","[Jenkins, Willis] Univ Virginia, Religious Studies, Charlottesville, VA 22902 USA",University of Virginia,"Jenkins, W (corresponding author), Univ Virginia, Religious Studies, Charlottesville, VA 22902 USA.",willis.jenkins@virginia.edu,,,,,,,38,1,1,0,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2077-1444,,RELIGIONS,Religions,MAY,2020,5,,,,,,215,10.3390/rel11050215,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rel11050215,,,15,Religion,Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;HCI),Religion,LZ2AE,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000541029900005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Turbulence decreases the effectiveness of electro-optical systems. It causes a reduction of the spatial resolution of thermal imagers, which is characterized by the turbulence modulation transfer function MTF. Turbulence MTF depends on atmospheric parameters, e.g. the strength of atmospheric turbulence as described by the structure parameter of the refractive index fluctuations, C-n(2), the atmospheric path length, the cross-wind velocity, and on the sensor parameters, i.e. the wavelength and the aperture diameter of the front optics. The total MTF is the product of turbulence MTF and sensor MTF, which in turn is the product of detector MTF and optics MTF. As a figure of merit for the spatial resolution, we used the area under the total MTF (MTFA). Based on our turbulence measurement that was taken in and climate in Negev desert, Middle East, we calculated the total MTFA for a dual-band thermal imager (MWIR and LWIR) with two available optics under diverse turbulence conditions and for different path lengths up to 5 km. The selected C-n(2) values are representative for the diurnal run of C-n(2) in and summer or different times of day, respectively. We defined a turbulence degradation factor X to estimate the impact of turbulence on the image quality as a function of V time of day and path length.

The determinants of the energy policies of Poland and Germany are presented along with the priorities until 2050. The possibilities of reducing the impact of energy on the environment were interpreted, emphasizing its common goal. Activities supporting the EU and maintaining the level of energy security are indicated. Possible negative effects in the social and health sphere are presented as a response to the failure to implement these demands. The literature was analyzed and proprietary questionnaires were carried out, and the results realized in the EU by the independent FBI Economic Department were implemented. On the basis of earlier pilot studies, variants of a successful transformation were implemented, assuming different roles performed by a citizen (entrepreneur). Opportunities to tackle climate change and global challenges have been identified based on innovation and motivation. The opinion on the way of thinking in Poland and Germany was compared, and a descriptive model was prepared to increase the achievement of the assumed goals, together with a model based on innovation. Citizens should be active in efforts to promote renewable energy. The EU has a strong base to work to avoid climate change. What is needed is innovative thinking and a motivation to introduce changes with the involvement of every citizen through solidarity, efficiency, and justice. The existing foundations of legal solutions create adaptation possibilities and the ability to achieve goals through self-discipline, comparing with the assumption of EU civic awareness, significantly affecting the successful implementation of RES. Analyzing the attitudes of Poland and Germany, it seems that the distant social consequences are not sufficient. It is necessary not only to perform selected management functions (planning, organizing), but also partly to motivate. There is a strong need to increase motivation and implement the control process required under the threat of negative consequences in the current period as a key strategic preventive action. The analysis of the opinions of Poland and Germany against the background of the European Union allowed for no significant differences, subject to Germany's readiness to take greater risk. Most of Poland is less inclined to take risks. The lack of an unambiguous opinion may indicate incomplete awareness of both the negative effects of climate change. Both countries are concerned about the unplanned costs of transformation. Germany, unlike Poland, has dedicated employees to handle the climate, and conducts an energy audit and is of interest to investors, thanks to investment plans.","[Jalowiec, Tomasz; Wojtaszek, Henryk] War Studies Univ, Fac Management & Command, PL-00910 Warsaw, Poland; [Miciula, Ireneusz] Univ Szczecin, Fac Econ Finance & Management, PL-70453 Szczecin, Poland",University of Szczecin,"Wojtaszek, H (corresponding author), War Studies Univ, Fac Management & Command, PL-00910 Warsaw, Poland.",t.jalowiec@akademia.mil.pl; h.wojtaszek@akademia.mil.pl; ireneusz.miciula@usz.edu.pl,"Miciuła, Ireneusz/Q-3479-2016; Wojtaszek, Henryk Zygmunt/AAD-3824-2019; Jalowiec, Tomasz/B-7965-2019","Miciuła, Ireneusz/0000-0003-3150-4490; Wojtaszek, Henryk Zygmunt/0000-0002-3082-1219; Jalowiec, Tomasz/0000-0002-6974-090X",Academy of War Art inWarsaw; University of Szczecin in Szczecin;  [001/RID/2018/19],Academy of War Art inWarsaw; University of Szczecin in Szczecin; ,"The article was funded fromresearch funds fromthe Academy ofWar Art inWarsaw and the University of Szczecin in Szczecin.

J,"Li, DZ",,,,"Li, Dongze",,,"RESEARCH ON SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT PLANNING OF LOW-CARBON CITY IN XI'AN, CHINA",FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN,,,English,Article,,,,,,Low-carbon city; urban planning; sustainable development; climate change,CLIMATE-CHANGE,"Climate change has brought challenges to the construction of human settlements. Cities are not only the gathering place for development, but also the key to mitigating carbon emissions. The current urban planning thinking mode has begun to shift to low-carbon ecologicalization. Low-carbon urban planning theory and construction practice have become the focus of attention of the international community in many urban issues. Its core idea is to transform the traditional way of urban development, develop a low-carbon economy and build a low-carbon life through the low-carbon transformation planning layout of urban space and the low-carbon industrial system. As the largest carbon source and the region with the greatest emission reduction potential, cities urgently need to transform their production and lifestyles into renewable energy and circular economy in an all-round way. As a city planning that has a strong guiding and controlling role in urban development, it also plays an important role in the transformation process. Based on the analysis of the low-carbon city planning and construction of Xi'an, Shaanxi Province, Xi'an has the following characteristics: As a northwestern industrial base, the main industrial pillar of Xi'an is the secondary industry, and the industry will continue to be occupied in the development of Xi'an. Since Xi'an's main pillar industries are petrochemicals, automobile manufacturing, metallurgy (mainly steel), and electricity, carbon dioxide emissions have seriously exceeded the standard. As a city along the river, Xi'an has abundant water resources and long and cold winters. This paper analyzes the data of Xi'an for ten years, analyzes and predicts the carbon dioxide emissions of Xi'an, and puts forward feasible low-carbon city planning and construction policies and recommendations. We summarize and analyze the existing theories, examples and research status of low-carbon city planning, and extract analysis methods and planning research theories from them. We establish urban low-carbon models and evaluation indicators to analyze and forecast Xi'an's carbon dioxide emissions from the aspects of low-carbon energy and economy, low-carbon space and layout, low-carbon transportation and transportation, low-carbon communities and buildings, low-carbon emissions and treatment, and low-carbon policies and management.","[Li, Dongze] Lanzhou City Univ, Coll Art & Designing, Lanzhou 730070, Peoples R China; [Li, Dongze] Northwest Normal Univ, Coll Geog & Environm Sci, Lanzhou 730070, Peoples R China",Lanzhou City University; Northwest Normal University - China,"Li, DZ (corresponding author), Northwest Normal Univ, Coll Geog & Environm Sci, Lanzhou 730070, Peoples R China.",mma0405@sina.com,,,,,,,24,3,3,13,36,PARLAR SCIENTIFIC PUBLICATIONS (P S P),FREISING,"ANGERSTR. 12, 85354 FREISING, GERMANY",1018-4619,1610-2304,,FRESEN ENVIRON BULL,Fresenius Environ.

Drivers of the variability of onset, which are well simulated by Coupled Forecast System version 2, viz., tropical Pacific sea surface temperature, reversal of tropospheric temperature gradient and strengthening of westerlies over AS during the early summer are identified as potential predictors. Data-driven method, Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator, makes the final selection of predictors for the linear regression model of onset.

The project was part of the cooperation program developed to establish the Egyptian Gilf Kebir National Park (GKNP) protected area. Given their bad state of preservation, the Italian conservation project focused on the Caves of Swimmers and Archers, located along the Wadi Sura. Although only very few studies of this kind have been carried out in the Saharan region, our work in the Gilf Kebir can be considered a pilot study, the results of which should be evaluated in the long term. Results obtained to date and reported in this paper provide analytical petrographic studies of the bedrock, a complete photographic and geodetic survey of the two sites, data from climate monitoring, along with a preliminary consolidation of some of the most at-risk areas of the two caves. Finally, laboratory experimentation led us to select the most suitable materials for the consolidation of the rock, shifting in the direction of nano-technology instead of ethyl silicate use because of the longer cross-linking process of the latter in hyper-arid environments; the use of the latter can in fact result in extremely long and expensive field seasons. These results will be valuable for the continuation and extension of the project, which is currently suspended due to safety concerns in the region.","[Tomassetti, Maria Cristina] Via Flavia 16, I-00062 Rome, Italy; [Lucarini, Giulio; Mutri, Giuseppina] Univ Cambridge, McDonald Inst Archaeol Res, Downing St, Cambridge CB2 3ER, England; [Hamdan, Mohamed A.] Cairo Univ, Dept Geol, Giza, Egypt; [Macchia, Andrea] YOCOCU YOuth COnservat CUltural Heritage, Rome, Italy; [Barich, Barbara E.] Sapienza Univ Rome, Ple Aldo Moro 5, I-00185 Rome, Italy; [Lucarini, Giulio; Mutri, Giuseppina; Barich, Barbara E.] ISMEO, Corso Vittorio Emanuele 2 244, I-00186 Rome, Italy",University of Cambridge; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Cairo University; Sapienza University Rome,"Tomassetti, MC (corresponding author), Via Flavia 16, I-00062 Rome, Italy.",cristinatommi@hotmail.it,"Lucarini, Giulio/AAW-7086-2020; Macchi, Andrea/B-1900-2009; Lucarini, Giulio/AAW-7122-2020; MUTRI, GIUSEPPINA/ABA-6261-2021","Macchi, Andrea/0000-0002-1835-2544; Lucarini, Giulio/0000-0003-4722-1065; ",,,,,28,2,2,0,6,"UNIV ALEXANDRU IOAN CUZA IASI, ARHEOINVEST INTERDISCIPLINARY PLATFORM",IASI,"LAB SCI INVES & CONSERVATION,  BLVD CAROL I, NO 22, CORP G, DEMISOL, IASI, 700506, ROMANIA",2067-533X,2067-8223,,INT J CONSERV SCI,Int.

But this article argues that the set of similarities is both larger than reported and more concentrated, with several strands of evidence converging on a zone encompassing the Kern-Kern Hamada and Wadi Draa on the Algerian-Moroccan border. While some of these similarities probably derive from the common roots of Nilotic and Saharan cultures during the spread of pastoralism from Nubia to the Maghreb from 6000 to 5400 cal. BCE, others - such as grinding platforms with low relief, inwardly spiralled snakes on their backs, which occur in the western Sahara as part of a tradition of decorated querns, and northern Nubia, where there was apparently no such tradition - may signal a later connection. The article weighs the probability of a westward contact versus an eastward one around 4000 BCE and speculates that some of the resemblances may represent the arrival in the Nile Valley of refugees who fled the increasing aridity of the 4th millennium BCE by retracing the steps of pastoral ancestors. If this scenario is correct, some of the elements of Egyptian theology that became the prerogatives of royalty and the rationale for kingship, including the Horus-Osiris cycle, arrived from the west as the result of an exodus caused by climate change.",,,"Caldwell, D (corresponding author), 18,Rue Rambuteau B35, F-75003 Paris, France.",caldwellnd@aol.com,,,,,,,74,1,1,0,1,ARCHAEOLOGICAL PUBL,CAULFIELD SOUTH,"PO BOX 216, CAULFIELD SOUTH, VIC 3162, AUSTRALIA",0813-0426,,,ROCK ART RES,Rock Art Res.,NOV,2013,2,,,,174,196,,,,,,23,Archaeology; Art,Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;HCI),Archaeology; Art,VI6DK,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000500409100013,View Full Record in Web of Science

A number of factors influence this, ranging from physical conditions through to human management capacities. Across the Orange River Basin in southern Africa, these threats arise from overpopulation and farming pressure, with agrochemical and industrial runoff as well as harsh weather conditions giving rise to severe problems of erosion and land degradation. Under conditions of climate change, these threats are exacerbated, as temperature rises and water resources become more erratic. Since water is both an essential instrument of livelihood support and a crucial factor of production, there is a need to develop more effective mechanisms to identify those areas where its scarcity or poor management can bring about a slowdown in the development process. This urgency is heightened by the international commitment to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), supposedly to be reached by 2015. In addition to the MDGs, governments are also committed to the development of basin management plans for Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM). This means that, in order to try to allocate water in an equitable and efficient way, better understanding is needed of all of the complexities of managing water across heterogeneous basins. It is now recognized that effective water management is much more dependent on effective governance than on hydrologic regimes. Ranging from traditional local customary norms and practices dating back through generations to the latest state-of-the-art science-based international agreements, water governance is a key to supporting the lives and livelihoods of local populations. Access to information is an essential feature of any of these approaches, and harmonization of data on water issues is long overdue. This paper provides an outline of an index-based methodology on which an assessment of water vulnerability can be made. In this approach, supply-driven vulnerability (from water systems) and the demand-driven vulnerability (from water users), are evaluated at the municipal scale. By combining these various dimensions together mathematically, a Water Vulnerability Index (WVI) can be generated.","[Sullivan, Caroline A.] So Cross Univ, Sch Environm Sci & Management, Lismore, NSW 2480, Australia; [Sullivan, Caroline A.] Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, Oxford, England",Southern Cross University; University of Oxford,"Sullivan, CA (corresponding author), So Cross Univ, Sch Environm Sci & Management, Lismore, NSW 2480, Australia.",caroline.sullivan@scu.edu.au,"Sullivan, Caroline/T-8668-2017","Sullivan, Caroline/0000-0001-8486-0523",European Union [511179GOCE],European Union(European Commission),"This work has been funded by the European Union NeWater Project 'New Approaches to Adaptive Water Management under Uncertainty' (contract no. 511179GOCE).

In the current era of continuous climate changes, the understanding of the molecular aspects involved in abiotic stress response in plants is a priority. The rise of -omics approaches provides key strategies to promote effective research in the field, facilitating the investigations from reference models to an increasing number of species, tolerant and sensitive genotypes. Integrated multilevel approaches, based on molecular investigations at genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics levels, are now feasible, expanding the opportunities to clarify key molecular aspects involved in responses to abiotic stresses. To this aim, bioinformatics has become fundamental for data production, mining and integration, and necessary for extracting valuable information and for comparative efforts, paving the way to the modeling of the involved processes. We provide here an overview of bioinformatics resources for research on plant abiotic stresses, describing collections from -omics efforts in the field, ranging from raw data to complete databases or platforms, highlighting opportunities and still open challenges in abiotic stress research based on -omics technologies.","[Ambrosino, Luca; Colantuono, Chiara; Chiusano, Maria Luisa] Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Agr Sci, I-80055 Portici, Na, Italy; [Ambrosino, Luca; Colantuono, Chiara; Chiusano, Maria Luisa] Dept Res Infrastruct Marine Biol Resources RIMAR, I-80121 Naples, Italy; [Diretto, Gianfranco; Fiore, Alessia] Italian Natl Agcy New Technol, Energy & Sustainable Econ Dev ENEA, I-00123 Rome, Italy",University of Naples Federico II; Italian National Agency New Technical Energy & Sustainable Economics Development,"Chiusano, ML (corresponding author), Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Agr Sci, I-80055 Portici, Na, Italy.;Chiusano, ML (corresponding author), Dept Res Infrastruct Marine Biol Resources RIMAR, I-80121 Naples, Italy.",luca.ambrosino@szn.it; chiara.colantuono@szn.it; gianfranco.diretto@enea.it; alessia.fiore@enea.it; chiusano@unina.it,"luisa, chiusano maria/AAQ-3064-2021; Colantuono, Chiara/K-3309-2019; Diretto, Gianfranco/L-9279-2017; Colantuono, Chiara/GYA-0390-2022","luisa, chiusano maria/0000-0002-6296-7132; Colantuono, Chiara/0000-0003-3014-6978; Diretto, Gianfranco/0000-0002-1441-0233; Colantuono, Chiara/0000-0003-3014-6978; Ambrosino, Luca/0000-0003-1756-9538","Cost Action [FA1106, CA15136, CA18210]; Ministero dell'Istruzione, dell'Universita e della Ricerca (MIUR), Italy [PON02_00395_3082360, PON02_00395_3215002]","Cost Action(European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST)); Ministero dell'Istruzione, dell'Universita e della Ricerca (MIUR), Italy(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR))","This work is in the frame of the Cost Action FA1106, CA15136 and CA18210, and of the Genopom Pro (PON02_00395_3082360) and HORT (PON02_00395_3215002) Projects (Ministero dell'Istruzione, dell'Universita e della Ricerca (MIUR), Italy).",,343,8,8,1,16,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2223-7747,,PLANTS-BASEL,Plants-Basel,MAY,2020,5,,,,,,591,10.3390/plants9050591,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants9050591,,,36,Plant Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Plant Sciences,MB0GE,32384671,"gold, Green Published",,,12/21/22,WOS:000542286900068,View Full Record in Web of Science

Among the suite of published isotope-enabled climate models, those with intermediate complexity offer the benefits of efficiency, allowing for long ensemble runs. However, the ability of these models to simulate the response to global warming with the same fidelity as state-of-the-art models is questionable. Here we evaluate an intermediate complexity model, SPEEDY-IER, in a high-CO(2)scenario and compare its performance to an Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)-class model, iCAM5. SPEEDY-IER can generally simulate changes in tropical circulation, the weakening of the Walker circulation, and the narrowing of the deep tropics. A deeper investigation of water isotope fields indicates SPEEDY-IER simulates qualitative trends in precipitation and vapor isotopes with fidelity, but it does not simulate amplitudes or spatial patterns of water isotope changes shown in iCAM5. This bias in SPEEDY-IER is mainly due to its coarse resolution and simplified convection scheme. We then modify the model by introducing condensation and detrainment in intermediate convection levels; this modification successfully improves SPEEDY-IER's simulation of water isotope fields, though the response of the Walker circulation to climate change is weakened. We demonstrate that evaluating water isotope fields reveals hidden biases in a climate model and guides improvements to the model's performance. Thus, the examination of water isotope fields and validation against available observations likely provides more stringent constraints for model physics. Plain Language Summary Climate models are utilized to project climate change as we enter a world with ever-higher CO2 concentrations, but running these models usually takes a huge amount of time and computational resources. Intermediate-complexity models circumvent this issue by simplifying model physics and thus save time for long simulations. Moreover, the addition of stable water isotopes in these climate models provides unique constrains in the global water cycle. However, to use intermediate-complexity models with water isotopes to study the climate of a high-CO2 world, we need to verify their simulations, and evaluations of these models are sorely lacking. This study evaluates one of these models, SPEEDY-IER, in a high-CO2 world. We find that SPEEDY-IER can simulate fundamental tropical circulation changes, and it is suitable for studies of future climate change. In addition, the evaluation of water isotopes in SPEEDY-IER reveals hidden biases of the model, and the subsequent modifications based on this evaluation improve SPEEDY-IER. This provides an example of how diagnosing water isotope fields can improve the performance of climate models.","[Hu, Jun; Dee, Sylvia] Rice Univ, Dept Earth Atmospher & Planetary Sci, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Nusbaumer, Jesse] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Climate & Global Dynam Lab, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA",Rice University; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA,"Hu, J (corresponding author), Rice Univ, Dept Earth Atmospher & Planetary Sci, Houston, TX 77005 USA.",jun.hu@rice.edu,"Hu, Jun/K-8453-2019","Nusbaumer, Jesse/0000-0002-4370-3537; Hu, Jun/0000-0002-0458-5996","Department of Earth, Environmental, and Planetary Sciences at Rice University","Department of Earth, Environmental, and Planetary Sciences at Rice University","This project was supported by the Department of Earth, Environmental, and Planetary Sciences at Rice University.

In fact, bioenergy use in general is promoted, and is expected by many to play a major role in climate change mitigation. But bioenergy use in general faces competition for resources such as land, water and fertiliser from the two other general biomass uses, food production and biomaterials. Ethically, food production should take precedence over the other two uses (and at present all bioliquids are made from foodstuffs), and using biomass for biomaterials will in many situations reduce greenhouse gas emissions more than using the same amount of biomass for energy. Where a given amount of biomass is available for transport energy use, it will usually produce more greenhouse gas reductions per vehicle-km if used to produce electricity rather than liquid biofuels. Finally, there are signs that internal combustion engine vehicles could be phased out in the coming decades. If so, liquid biofuels will be phased out along with existing oil-based transport fuels. In conclusion, except for specialist uses, liquid biofuels do not appear to have a long-term future. (C) 2019 The Authors.

To better estimate the radiative forcing of aircraft-induced cloudiness, there is a pressing need to improve the present understanding of the optical properties of nonspherical ice crystals within contrails and contrail cirrus, and to enhance the global satellite detection and retrieval of these clouds. It is also critical to develop appropriate parameterizations of ice crystal bulk optical properties for climate models on the basis of state-of-the-art scattering simulations and available in situ measurements of ice crystal size and habit distributions within contrails and contrail cirrus. More accurate methods are needed to retrieve the bulk radiative properties of contrails and contrail cirrus to separate natural from anthropogenic ice cloud effects. Such refined techniques should be applied to past and future satellite imagery to develop a contrail climatology that would serve to evaluate contrail radiative forcing more accurately, to determine trends in contrail cirrus, and to guide and validate parameterizations of contrails in numerical weather and climate models.

As a result, the STCs play an important role in connecting the tropical and subtropical Atlantic Ocean, in terms of heat, freshwater, oxygen, and nutrients exchange. However, their representation in state-of-the-art coupled models has not been systematically evaluated. In this study, we investigate the performance of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 climate models in simulating the Atlantic STCs. Comparing model results with observations, we first present the simulated mean state with respect to ensembles of the key components participating in the STC loop, that is, the meridional Ekman and geostrophic flow across 10 degrees N and 10 degrees S, and the Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC) at 23 degrees W. We find that the model ensemble reveals biases toward weak Southern Hemisphere Ekman transport and interior geostrophic transports, as well as a weak EUC. We then investigate the large inter-model spread of these key components and find that models with strong Ekman divergence between 10 degrees N and 10 degrees S tend to have strong mixed layer and thermocline interior convergence and strong EUC. The inter-model spread of the EUC strength is primarily associated with the intensity of the southeasterly trade winds in the models. Since the trade-wind-induced poleward Ekman transports are regarded as the drivers of the STCs, our results highlight the necessity to improve skills of coupled models to simulate the Southern Hemisphere atmospheric forcing.","[Fu, Yao] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Earth & Atmospher Sci, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Brandt, Peter; Tuchen, Franz Philip; Lubbecke, Joke F.] GEOMAR Helmholtz Ctr Ocean Res Kiel, Kiel, Germany; [Brandt, Peter; Lubbecke, Joke F.] Univ Kiel, Fac Math & Nat Sci, Kiel, Germany; [Tuchen, Franz Philip] NOAA, Atlantic Oceanog & Meteorol Lab, Miami, FL USA; [Wang, Chunzai] Chinese Acad Sci, South China Sea Inst Oceanol, State Key Lab Trop Oceanog, Guangzhou, Peoples R China","University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology; Helmholtz Association; GEOMAR Helmholtz Center for Ocean Research Kiel; University of Kiel; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Atlantic Oceanographic & Meteorological Laboratory (AOML); Chinese Academy of Sciences; South China Sea Institute of Oceanology, CAS","Fu, Y (corresponding author), Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Earth & Atmospher Sci, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.;Wang, CZ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, South China Sea Inst Oceanol, State Key Lab Trop Oceanog, Guangzhou, Peoples R China.",yaofu@gatech.edu; cwang@scsio.ac.cn,"Wang, Chunzai/C-9712-2009; Brandt, Peter/C-8254-2013; Tuchen, Franz Philip/GQA-9418-2022; Luebbecke, Joke/AFR-7882-2022; Lübbecke, Joke F/G-6315-2016","Wang, Chunzai/0000-0002-7611-0308; Brandt, Peter/0000-0002-9235-955X; Tuchen, Franz Philip/0000-0002-2189-9217; Luebbecke, Joke/0000-0002-7839-3284; Lübbecke, Joke F/0000-0002-7839-3284; Fu, Yao/0000-0003-2227-3694","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41731173, 42192564]; National Key R&D Program of China [2019YFA0606701]; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDB42000000, XDA2006502]; Leading Talents of Guangdong Province Program, Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation [2020A1515110673]; Independent Research Project of State Key Laboratory of Tropical Oceanography [LTOZZ2005]; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research [03F0795A]; EU [817578]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key R&D Program of China; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); Leading Talents of Guangdong Province Program, Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation; Independent Research Project of State Key Laboratory of Tropical Oceanography; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); EU(European Commission)","This study is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41731173 & 42192564), the National Key R&D Program of China (2019YFA0606701), the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDB42000000 & XDA2006502), the Leading Talents of Guangdong Province Program, Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation (2020A1515110673), Independent Research Project of State Key Laboratory of Tropical Oceanography (LTOZZ2005), the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research in the frame of the BANINO project (03F0795A) and by the EU H2020 under grant agreement 817578 TRIATLAS project.

We consider the conceptual model introduced by Tziperman et al. for the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) system. It describes the interactions of both a positive and a negative delayed feedback, created by an ocean-atmosphere coupling, as well as seasonal forcing. The delayed effects of the feedback mechanisms are due to the finite velocities of oceanic waves; they are incorporated explicitly into the model, which takes the form of a delay differential equation (DDE). Tziperman et al. demonstrated that, for a certain set of parameter values, this model can generate a chaotic solution that reproduces irregular behavior with certain characteristic features of the ENSO system. However, it was not clear how robust the observed chaotic behavior is against changes in model parameters and which dynamical processes are involved in its creation. Associated are the more general issues of how prominent the chaotic behavior is in the model and what ingredients are required for the observed behavior. In this paper, we conduct a bifurcation analysis with dedicated continuation software, giving an overview of the possible dynamical behavior of the ENSO model, including transitions to chaos, across large ranges of relevant parameters. Our starting point is a simpler ENSO model, a special case without positive delayed feedback and without asymmetry in the ocean-atmosphere coupling, first studied by Ghil et al. We transition to the full version of the ENSO model of Tziperman et al. by gradually introducing these two additional model features. We study their individual and combined influence on the dynamics by means of bifurcation analysis with state-of-the-art numerical tools for DDEs. Our findings show that asymmetry in the coupling function is particularly important for reproducing characteristic features more realistically. We can confirm that the chaotic behavior seen in previous studies is a result of simultaneous resonances and that, more specifically, chaotic solutions appear through the emergence of period-doubling cascades within overlapping resonance tongues. We also establish the coexistence of different routes to chaos depending on the path taken through parameter space. Such transitions to chaos are demonstrated to be robust against the seasonal forcing strength. Finally, we investigate the sensitivity of the model to changes of the delay times across a range of realistic values. We find that the observed behavior is sensitive to changes of the delay associated with the negative feedback but not the positive feedback.","[Keane, Andrew; Krauskopf, Bernd; Postlethwaite, Claire] Univ Auckland, Dept Math, Auckland 1, New Zealand",University of Auckland,"Keane, A (corresponding author), Univ Auckland, Dept Math, Auckland 1, New Zealand.",a.keane@auckland.ac.nz; b.krauskopf@auckland.ac.nz; c.postlethwaite@auckland.ac.nz,"Postlethwaite, Claire M/D-4696-2009","Postlethwaite, Claire M/0000-0003-0654-6736; Krauskopf, Bernd/0000-0002-8940-230X; Keane, Andrew/0000-0001-7094-841X",University of Auckland Doctoral Scholarship,University of Auckland Doctoral Scholarship,The research of the first author was funded by a University of Auckland Doctoral Scholarship.,,61,8,9,0,7,SIAM PUBLICATIONS,PHILADELPHIA,"3600 UNIV CITY SCIENCE CENTER, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19104-2688 USA",1536-0040,,,SIAM J APPL DYN SYST,SIAM J.

This is also the case for Indonesia. Despite having fertile volcanic soil and a strong agriculture tradition, these assets are under pressure, and strategies to preserve them from industrialization are urgently needed. Recently, the number and the interest to take on the profession of farmer have sharply declined, mainly due to urbanization. It should also be noted that the agricultural lands, both their area and fertility, have decreased. Farming has also become more challenging due to climate change. An alternative solution to revitalize the agricultural sector, increase the number of farmers, and increase their livelihood is urgently needed to ensure food security. For this reason, strengthening research activities in the field of crop biotechnology to improve agriculture production, human health, and social security is required. There should be multi-stakeholder collaborative efforts to develop reliable and environmentally sustainable approaches for agriculture. In this paper, our focus is on the application of biotechnology for cassava processing. Cassava was chosen due to it being the fourth largest staple food in the tropics and is well studied in Indonesia. In connection with improving the livelihood of cassava farmers, an introduction of bioprocess for the improvement of economic value of cassava tuber is highlighted, including an example of work for converting of cassava tuber to mycoprotein. In comparison with a commercial product, our results have shown comparable, if not better characteristics.","[Sukara, Endang] Indonesian Acad Sci AIPI, Komplek Perpustakaan Nas, Jakarta 10110, Indonesia; [Sukara, Endang] Univ Nas, Jl Sawo Manila 61, Jakarta 12520, Indonesia; [Hartati, Sri] Indonesian Inst Sci, Cibinong Sci Ctr, Res Ctr Biotechnol, Bot Garden, Jl Raya Jakarta Bogor Km 46, Bogor 16911, West Java, Indonesia; [Ragamustari, Safendrri Komara] Sch Govt & Publ Policy, Bogor 16810, West Java, Indonesia",Universitas Nasional Pionir Perubahan; Indonesian Institute of Sciences,"Sukara, E (corresponding author), Indonesian Acad Sci AIPI, Komplek Perpustakaan Nas, Jakarta 10110, Indonesia.;Sukara, E (corresponding author), Univ Nas, Jl Sawo Manila 61, Jakarta 12520, Indonesia.",endang.sukara@civitas.unas.ac.id,,"Sukara, Endang/0000-0002-6387-0500",,,,,27,7,7,2,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1863-5466,1863-5474,,PLANT BIOTECHNOL REP,Plant Biotechnol.

A recent hydroclimate proxy suggests that South China became wet in cold stadials during the last deglaciation, with the intensification proposed to be contributed mostly by the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM). Here, based on a deglacial simulation in a state-of-the-art climate model that well reproduces the evolution of EASM, winter monsoon (EAWM) and the associated water isotopes in East Asia, we propose that the intensified hydroclimate in South China is also contributed heavily by the rainfall in autumn, during the transition between EASM and EAWM. The excessive rainfall in autumn results from the convergence between anomalous northerly wind due to amplified land-sea thermal contrast and anomalous southerly wind associated with the anticyclone over Western North Pacific, both of which are, in turn, forced by the slowdown of the Atlantic thermohaline circulation. Regardless the rainfall change, however, the modeled delta O-18(p) remains largely unchanged in autumn. Our results provide new insights to East Asia monsoon associated with climate change in the North Atlantic. Deglacial hydroclimate in South China is perennially debated. New modeling experiments reveal that regional hydroclimate was strongly influenced by rainfall during the transition between the East Asian summer monsoon and winter monsoon, forced by climate variability in the North Atlantic.","[He, Chengfei] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Coll Atmospher Sci, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [He, Chengfei; Liu, Zhengyu] Ohio State Univ, Dept Geog, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [He, Chengfei; Zhu, Chenyu; Gu, Sifan] Pilot Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol, 0Pen Studio Ocean Climate Isotope Modeling, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Otto-Bliesner, Bette L.; Brady, Esther C.; Tomas, Robert] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Climate & Global Dynam Lab, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [Zhu, Chenyu; Jin, Yishuai] Ocean Univ China, Key Lab Phys Oceanog, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Gu, Sifan] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Oceanog, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Han, Jing] Peking Univ, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China",Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; Qingdao National Laboratory for Marine Science & Technology; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; Ocean University of China; Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Peking University,"He, CF (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Coll Atmospher Sci, Nanjing, Peoples R China.;He, CF (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, Dept Geog, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.;He, CF (corresponding author), Pilot Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol, 0Pen Studio Ocean Climate Isotope Modeling, Qingdao, Peoples R China.",he.1519@osu.edu,"Zhu, Chenyu/GNM-9706-2022","He, Chengfei/0000-0003-1453-9691; Zhu, Chenyu/0000-0002-9330-4294; Otto-Bliesner, Bette/0000-0003-1911-1598","Chinese NSFC [41630527]; U.S. NSF [1810682, 1810681]; Qingdao Pilot National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology; National Science Foundation (NSF); National Center for Atmospheric Research; NSF [1852977]",Chinese NSFC(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); U.S. NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Qingdao Pilot National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology; National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)); National Center for Atmospheric Research; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"We thank Dr. Jesse Nusbaumer for helpful discussion on the latent heat flux in CESM.

The operational algorithms now produce Level 2 aerosol data at varying spatial resolutions (1, 3, and 10 km) and Level 3 data at 1 degree. The local and global applications have benefited from the coarse resolution gridded data sets (i.e., Level 3, 1 degree), as it is easier to use since data volume is low, and several online and offline tools are readily available to access and analyze the data with minimal computing resources. At the same time, researchers who require data at much finer spatial scales have to go through a challenging process of obtaining, processing, and analyzing larger volumes of data sets that require high-end computing resources and coding skills. Therefore, we created a high spatial resolution (high-resolution gridded (HRG), 0.1 x 0.1 degree) daily and monthly aerosol optical depth (AOD) product by combining two MODIS operational algorithms, namely Deep Blue (DB) and Dark Target (DT).

Based on the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data (from 1981 to 2004), this paper has revealed the dynamics of grassland vegetation coverage of Northern Tibet by the method which the remote sensing technique integrated with ground measurement. The preliminary results are as follows: The grassland vegetation coverage of Northern Tibet is very low that the average value is only 29.7% for many years. In terms of spatial distribution of grassland vegetation coverage, the eastern region of Northern Tibet has a relatively higher coverage of grassland vegetation; the western has the lowest vegetation coverage. During the period of 1981-2004, the average grassland vegetation coverage had a slight decreasing trend, but fluctuation is relative greatly; the grassland vegetation coverage in the western region had a marked rising trend while the coverage in the middle, eastern and northern regions had a decreasing tendency.","Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Environm & Sustainable Dev Agr, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Institute of Environment & Sustainable Development in Agriculture, CAAS","Gao, QZ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Environm & Sustainable Dev Agr, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",,"Gao, Qingzhu/B-6068-2013; Gao, Qingzhu/B-7021-2012",,,,,,14,1,1,1,8,SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING,BELLINGHAM,"1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010 USA",0277-786X,,0-8194-6377-9,P SOC PHOTO-OPT INS,,,2006,,,,,J2982,J2982,62982J,10.1117/12.678398,http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.678398,,,9,Ecology; Remote Sensing,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Remote Sensing,BFM14,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000243026400071,View Full Record in Web of Science

A state-of-the-art snow-evolution modeling system(SnowModel) was used to simulate variations in the GrIS melt extent, surface water balance components, changes in SMB, and freshwater influx to the ocean. The simulations are based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change scenario A1B modeled by the HIRHAM4 regional climate model (RCM) using boundary conditions from the ECHAM5 atmosphere-ocean general circulation model (AOGCM) from 1950 through 2080. In situ meteorological station [Greenland Climate Network (GC-Net) and World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI)] observations from inside and outside the GrIS were used to validate and correct RCM output data before they were used as input for SnowModel. Satellite observations and independent SMB studies were used to validate the SnowModel output and confirm the model's robustness. The authors simulated an; 90% increase in end-of-summer surface melt extent (0.483 x 10(6) km(2)) from 1950 to 2080 and a melt index (above 2000-m elevation) increase of 138% (1.96 x 10(6) km(2) x days). The greatest difference in melt extent occurred in the southern part of the GrIS, and the greatest changes in the number of melt days were seen in the eastern part of the GrIS (similar to 50%-70%) and were lowest in the west (similar to 20%-30%). The rate of SMB loss, largely tied to changes in ablation processes, leads to an enhanced average loss of 331 km(3) from 1950 to 2080 and an average SMB level of 299 km(3) for the period 2070-80. GrIS surface freshwater runoff yielded a eustatic rise in sea level from 0.8 +/- 0.1 (1950-59) to 1.9 +/- 0.1 mm (2070-80) sea level equivalent (SLE) yr(-1). The accumulated GrIS freshwater runoff contribution from surface melting equaled 160-mm SLE from 1950 through 2080.","[Mernild, Sebastian H.] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Int Arctic Res Ctr, Fairbanks, AK USA; [Mernild, Sebastian H.] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Water & Environm Res Ctr, Fairbanks, AK USA; [Liston, Glen E.; Hiemstra, Christopher A.] Colorado State Univ, Cooperat Inst Res Atmosphere, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Christensen, Jens H.] Danish Meteorol Inst, Danish Climate Ctr, Copenhagen, Denmark",University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Fairbanks; University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Fairbanks; Colorado State University; Danish Meteorological Institute DMI,"Mernild, SH (corresponding author), Los Alamos Natl Lab, Climate Ocean & Sea Ice Modeling Grp, Computat Phys Methods CCS 2, Mail Stop B296, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA.",mernild@lanl.gov,"Christensen, Jens Hesselbjerg/C-4162-2013; Mernild, Sebastian H./M-5516-2013","Christensen, Jens Hesselbjerg/0000-0002-9908-8203; Mernild, Sebastian H./0000-0003-0797-3975",University of Alaska Presidential IPY Postdoctoral Foundation; University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research,University of Alaska Presidential IPY Postdoctoral Foundation; University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research,"Very special thanks to the three anonymous reviewers for their insightful critique of this article.

We argue that despite a continued need for further addressing remaining limitations of their key components, numerical prediction systems have reached a sufficient level of maturity to examine and critically assess the suitability of Earth's current observing systems - remote and in situ, for prediction purposes; and that they can provide evidence-based support for the deployment of future observational networks. We illustrate this point by presenting recent, co-ordinated international efforts focused on Arctic observing systems, led in the framework of the Year of Polar Prediction and the H2020 project APPLICATE. The Arctic, one of the world's most rapidly changing regions, is relatively poorly covered in terms of in situ data but richly covered in terms of satellite data. In this study, we demonstrate that existing state-of-the-art datasets and targeted sensitivity experiments produced with numerical prediction systems can inform us of the added value of existing or even hypothetical Arctic observations, in the context of predictions from hourly to interannual time-scales. Furthermore, we argue that these datasets and experiments can also inform us how the uptake of Arctic observations in numerical prediction systems can be enhanced to maximise predictive skill. Based on these efforts we suggest that (a) conventional in situ observations in the Arctic play a particularly important role in initializing numerical weather forecasts during the winter season, (b) observations from satellite microwave sounders play a particularly important role during the summer season, and their enhanced usage over snow and sea ice is expected to further improve their impact on predictive skill in the Arctic region and beyond, (c) the deployment of a small number of in situ sea-ice thickness monitoring devices at strategic sampling sites in the Arctic could be sufficient to monitor most of the large-scale sea-ice volume variability, and (d) sea-ice thickness observations can improve the simulation of both the sea ice and near-surface air temperatures on seasonal time-scales in the Arctic and beyond.","[Sandu, Irina; Arduini, Gabriele; Bauer, Peter; Bormann, Niels; Day, Jonathan; Dahoui, Mohamed; Lawrence, Heather] European Ctr Medium Range Weather Forecasts ECMWF, Shinfield Pk, Reading RG2 9AX, Berks, England; [Massonnet, Francois; van Achter, Guillian; Fichefet, Thierry; Ponsoni, Leandro] Catholic Univ Louvain, Brussels, Belgium; [Acosta Navarro, Juan C.; Moreno-Chamarro, Eduardo; Ortega, Pablo] Barcelona Supercomp Ctr, Barcelona, Spain; [Blockley, Ed; Lawrence, Heather] Met Off, Exeter, Devon, England; [Chevallier, Matthieu] Meteo France, Toulouse, France; [Flocco, Daniela; Hawkins, Ed] Univ Reading, Reading, Berks, England; [Jung, Thomas] Alfred Wegener Inst, Bremerhaven, Germany; [Laroche, Stephane; Poan, Emmanuel] Environm & Climate Change, Gatineau, PQ, Canada; [Kristianssen, Jorn; Randriamampianina, Roger] Met Norway, Oslo, Norway","European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF); Universite Catholique Louvain; Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya; Barcelona Supercomputer Center (BSC-CNS); Met Office - UK; University of Reading; Helmholtz Association; Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar & Marine Research; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Norwegian Meteorological Institute","Sandu, I (corresponding author), European Ctr Medium Range Weather Forecasts ECMWF, Shinfield Pk, Reading RG2 9AX, Berks, England.",irina.sandu@ecmwf.int,"Moreno-Chamarro, Eduardo/ABF-9676-2021; Jung, Thomas/J-5239-2012; Massonnet, Francois/J-5315-2014; Hawkins, Ed/B-7921-2011; Ponsoni, Leandro/B-5425-2018","Moreno-Chamarro, Eduardo/0000-0002-7931-5149; Jung, Thomas/0000-0002-2651-1293; sandu, irina/0000-0002-1215-3288; Ortega, Pablo/0000-0002-4135-9621; Acosta Navarro, Juan C./0000-0001-5375-0639; Blockley, Ed/0000-0002-0489-4238; Massonnet, Francois/0000-0002-4697-5781; Hawkins, Ed/0000-0001-9477-3677; Ponsoni, Leandro/0000-0002-2218-271X",European Commission [727862]; Norges Forskningsrad [280573],European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre); Norges Forskningsrad,"European Commission, Grant/Award Number: 727862; Norges Forskningsrad, Grant/Award Number: 280573",,71,3,3,1,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0035-9009,1477-870X,,Q J ROY METEOR SOC,Q.

The twentieth-century climate simulations of 22 IPCC AR4 CGCMs are analyzed, together with the available Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP) runs from 12 of them. To understand the physical mechanisms for the double-ITCZ problem, the main ocean-atmosphere feedbacks, including the zonal sea surface temperature (SST) gradient-trade wind feedback (or Bjerknes feedback), the SST-surface latent heat flux (LHF) feedback, and the SST-surface shortwave flux (SWF) feedback, are studied in detail. The results show that most of the current state-of-the-art CGCMs have some degree of the double-ITCZ problem, which is characterized by excessive precipitation over much of the Tropics ( e. g., Northern Hemisphere ITCZ, South Pacific convergence zone, Maritime Continent, and equatorial Indian Ocean), and are often associated with insufficient precipitation over the equatorial Pacific. The excessive precipitation over much of the Tropics usually causes overly strong trade winds, excessive LHF, and insufficient SWF, leading to significant cold SST bias in much of the tropical oceans. Most of the models also simulate insufficient latitudinal asymmetry in precipitation and SST over the eastern Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. The AMIP runs also produce excessive precipitation over much of the Tropics, including the equatorial Pacific, which also leads to overly strong trade winds, excessive LHF, and insufficient SWF. This suggests that the excessive tropical precipitation is an intrinsic error of the atmospheric models, and that the insufficient equatorial Pacific precipitation in the coupled runs of many models comes from ocean atmosphere feedback. Feedback analysis demonstrates that the insufficient equatorial Pacific precipitation in different models is associated with one or more of the following three biases in ocean-atmosphere feedback over the equatorial Pacific: 1) excessive Bjerknes feedback, which is caused by excessive sensitivity of precipitation to SST and overly strong time-mean surface wind speed; 2) overly positive SST-LHF feedback, which is caused by excessive sensitivity of surface air humidity to SST; and 3) insufficient SST-SWF feedback, which is caused by insufficient sensitivity of cloud amount to precipitation. Off the equator over the eastern Pacific stratus region, most of the models produce insufficient stratus-SST feedback associated with insufficient sensitivity of stratus cloud amount to SST, which may contribute to the insufficient latitudinal asymmetry of SST in their coupled runs. These results suggest that the double-ITCZ problem in CGCMs may be alleviated by reducing the excessive tropical precipitation and the above feedback-relevant errors in the atmospheric models.","NOAA, ESRL, CIRES Climate Diagnost Ctr, Boulder, CO 80305 USA",National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Lin, JL (corresponding author), NOAA, ESRL, CIRES Climate Diagnost Ctr, 325 Broadway, Boulder, CO 80305 USA.",jialin.lin@noaa.gov,,,,,,,90,464,480,5,63,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693, UNITED STATES",0894-8755,1520-0442,,J CLIMATE,J.

By performing experiments with a coupled land-atmosphere model, here we show that summer greening effectively dampens NH warming by -0.15 +/- 0.03 degrees C for 1982-2014 due to enhanced evapotranspiration. However, greening generates weak temperature changes in spring (+0.02 +/- 0.06 degrees C) and autumn (-0.05 +/- 0.05 degrees C), because the evaporative cooling is counterbalanced by radiative warming from albedo and water vapor feedbacks. The dwindling evaporative cooling towards cool seasons is also supported by state-of-the-art Earth system models. Moreover, greening-triggered energy imbalance is propagated forward by atmospheric circulation to subsequent seasons and causes sizable time-lagged climate effects. Overall, greening makes winter warmer and summer cooler, attenuating the seasonal amplitude of NH temperature. These findings demonstrate complex tradeoffs and linkages of vegetation-climate feedbacks among seasons. The seasonal greening of Northern Hemisphere ecosystems due to extended growing periods and enhanced photosynthetic activity is, via experiments, shown to modify near-surface warming by perturbing land-atmosphere energy exchanges.","[Lian, Xu; Xu, Hao; Piao, Shilong] Peking Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Sino French Inst Earth Syst Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Lian, Xu; Gentine, Pierre] Columbia Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Engn, New York, NY USA; [Jeong, Sujong] Seoul Natl Univ, Grad Sch Environm Studies, Dept Environm Planning, Seoul, South Korea; [Jeong, Sujong] Seoul Natl Univ, Environm Planning Inst, Seoul, South Korea; [Park, Chang-Eui] Korea Inst Sci & Technol, Ctr Sustainable Environm Res, Seoul, South Korea; [Li, Laurent Z.

Later, a second hydrogen wave due to another crisis occurred. Currently, the world is discussing the third hydrogen wave, for which, unlike the other two waves, its driving force is not the lack of fossil fuels but the imminent climate change. The hydrogen economy is expected to answer the energy storage challenges created by fluctuating electricity generation from renewable energy sources and provide a solution for the decarbonization of high energy demand sectors and the synthesis of many chemicals. Today, governments around the globe are committed to scale-up the hydrogen economy; more than 30 nations have launched a National Hydrogen Plan or Strategy. The hydrogen economy functions with a Power-to-X (PtX) versatile system. Power-to-X (X as an energy carrier) refers to hydrogen produced via a carbon-free process and the further storage of this element either as pure hydrogen or converted to an energy carrier that can easily be stored, transported, and used, such as ammonia, methanol and other liquid organic hydrogen carriers. This paper conducts a literature review of the political commitment regarding the hydrogen economy, the status of PtX technologies, and development worldwide. It also compares four different scenarios for green hydrogen storage using various criteria. Power-to-Ammonia, Power-to-Methanol, Power-to-Hydrogen blended with natural gas, and Power-to-Liquid hydrogen are evaluated. Conclusively, the four concepts have their advantages and disadvantages, depending on the specific application and related scenario. Germany sponsors most of the research associated with PtX and is the country with the most advanced PtX projects. Therefore, Germany was chosen as a study case for multicriteria evaluation of PtX technologies. Power-to-Ammonia appears to be the best solution.","[Incer-Valverde, Jimena; Patino-Arevalo, Laura J.; Tsatsaronis, George; Morosuk, Tatiana] Tech Univ Berlin, Inst Energy Engn, Marchstr 18, D-10587 Berlin, Germany",Technical University of Berlin,"Morosuk, T (corresponding author), Tech Univ Berlin, Inst Energy Engn, Marchstr 18, D-10587 Berlin, Germany.",jimena.incervalverde@tu-berlin.de; l.patinoarevalo@campus.tu-berlin.de; georgios.tsatsaronis@tu-berlin.de; tetyana.morozyuk@tu-berlin.de,,"Incer Valverde, Jimena/0000-0003-3611-3325",,,,,169,4,4,32,32,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0196-8904,1879-2227,,ENERG CONVERS MANAGE,Energy Conv.

In particular, it reviews the research leading to the view that averaged over the decadal or longer time scales, ENSO acts as a basin-scale heat mixer in the tropical Pacific. This heat mixer regulates the long-term temperature difference between the surface water in the warm pool and the subsurface water constituting the equatorial undercurrent. When this temperature difference is externally forced to increase, the level of ENSO activity increases. Conversely, when this temperature difference is externally forced to decrease, the level of ENSO activity decreases. The time-mean effect of ENSO is to counteract the effect of external forcing on this temperature difference. This view of ENSO explains the recent trend in the level of ENSO activity in the instrumental record and sheds light on the behavior of ENSO in the past climates. The implied response in the level of ENSO activity to global warming, however, is at odds with the popular prediction by the state-of-the-art coupled climate models. Reasons for this discrepancy are explored. An inadequate sensitivity of the tropical hydrological cycle to sea surface temperature changes in the present coupled models is hypothesized as a possible factor responsible for the discrepancy.","[Sun, De-Zheng] NOAA, Div Phys Sci, Earth Syst Res Lab, Boulder, CO 80303 USA; [Sun, De-Zheng] Univ Colorado, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Sun, DZ (corresponding author), NOAA, Div Phys Sci, Earth Syst Res Lab, Boulder, CO 80303 USA.",dezheng.sun@noaa.gov,,,,,,,71,9,9,0,0,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",0065-8448,,978-0-87590-480-1,GEOPHYS MONOGR SER,,,2010,,,,,79,103,,10.1029/2009GM000865,http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2009GM000865,10.1029/GM189,,25,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Book Citation Index – Science (BKCI-S),Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,BUS84,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000290244800007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Based on Kramer's projects, historical photo-documentation and analysis of the current condition, the hotel complex was examined in the context of hotel construction in the Kramer area, which was transformed with the development of tourism at the beginning of the twentieth century. The dosed historicist concept was abandoned in favour of the more complex ground floor and open facades with loggias, as well as more social and recreational activities, which implied the introduction of public spaces such as a cinema, dance hall, music room, games room, indoor swimming pools, etc. At the same time, the Art Nouveau vocabulary, along with modern elements, gained primacy over the earlier dominant neoclassical expression. However, the complex was significantly altered with a series of interventions after World War II. The intervention to Neptun III, the biggest building of the complex, based on a project by the Slovenian architect Vinko Glanz, is particularly interesting. For the planned meeting of representatives of non-aligned countries in 1956 on Veliki Brijun, Glanz was tasked by the SFRY government to transform the Neptun hotel complex, which represents the gateway to the island, in line with the political aspirations of Yugoslavia. The paper presents Vinko Glanz's unpublished designs for the reconstruction of Neptun III, as well as a conceptual design for the transformation of the entire complex. In addition to Glanz's interventions, other significant changes, like the reconstruction of the swimming-pool building and the Neptun II building, were identified. These interventions contributed to the complete differentiation of parts of the originally homogeneous unit, which opens up numerous questions regarding the future restoration and presentation of the complex. Although the Neptun complex was built as a functionally connected unit with a consistent form, later interventions negated this fact. Each period transformed some buildings in accordance with the spirit of the time, or the historical and political context, not respecting their cohesion and relationship. This approach led to diversity and disparity, and also to complexity of the entire complex - which, in spite of everything, inherited cultural, historical and urbanistic-architectural values. The complex, with Art Nouveau characteristics, from the time of investor Paul Kupelwiesor and designer Eduard Kramer, presents the period when the hotel complex on Veliki Brijun was created, and from which one of the most sought-after holiday resorts of the Monarchy developed. As such, it occupies a significant place in the review of the first hotel buildings built for the conditions and climate of the region, and also in the wider context of tourism development in the northern Adriatic under the auspices of Austrian entrepreneurs and Viennese influence. This layer, except in the basic four-part concept of interconnected volumes, is preserved in the loggia system that appears as the dominant part on the main and back facades of Neptun III. The transformation that Vinko Glanz carried out in the 1950s was an intervention in which the ideological component played a crucial role, giving the designer a problem with the presentation. The reduction of certain parts of Neptun III in favour of achieving straight lines and abstract forms deprived the entire complex of significant features. Even though he was aware of removing essential properties - decorative and imaginative aspects as an association with the aristocratic past of the island - Glanz retained the structure of the horizontal and vertical lines which formed deep loggias that are part of each room. This grid, purified and accentuated by the project, has remained the dominant manifestation and identity of Neptun III and can be assessed as the most valuable contribution to the reconstruction. The third phase or layer is of interventions on Neptun II in the sixties, and the swimming-pool building in the late seventies, even though they were not the work of the same designer, nor did they derive from the same period. Regardless, they are the expression of the same artistic intention in the sense of reducing decorative elements in favour of an abstract composition of geometric character and purity. Each one carries certain qualities, although, in the context of the entire complex, they are in fact not uniform. The complex is in need of a thorough reconstruction that will affirm its significant properties. In the abstract language of the 21st century, in conjunction with the sequence of transformations carried out in the 20th century, it is necessary to reshape certain parts of the complex in a way that will restore its uniformity and vividness of outline. In this sense, only Neptun III should be dominant and of accentuated verticals, while Neptun II should retain the character of a subordinate building with its shape adapted to the entire complex. The future project proposes to maintain and present the concept of the facade with loggias that was innovative when it was made, and is today a testimony to the strategic thinking and development of hotel architecture in this area.","[Boric, Viki Jakasa] Minist Kulture RH, Konzervatorski Odjel Zagrebu, Zagreb, Croatia; [Bilus, Biserka Dumbovic] Minist Kulture RH, Konzervatorski Odjel Rijeci, Zagreb, Croatia",,"Boric, VJ (corresponding author), Minist Kulture RH, Konzervatorski Odjel Zagrebu, Zagreb, Croatia.",vjakasa@gmail.com; bbilusic@gmail.com,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,4,HRVATSKI RESTAURATORSKI ZAVOD,ZAGREB,"UL NIKE GRSKOVICA 23, ZAGREB, 10000, CROATIA",1847-9464,1848-6681,,PORTAL-CROATIA,Portal,,2019,10,,,,131,143,,10.17018/portal.2019.7,http://dx.doi.org/10.17018/portal.2019.7,,,13,Art,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Art,KF0AX,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000508912800007,View Full Record in Web of Science

The author improved a photosynthesis-and-sterility-based crop production CPI index to crop yield index CYI, which estimates rice yields, in place of the crop situation index CSI. The CSI gives a percentage of rice yields compared to normal annual production. The model calculates photosynthesis rates including biomass effects, low-temperature sterility, and high-temperature injury by incorporating: solar radiation, effective air temperature, normalized difference vegetation index NDVI, and the effect of temperature on photosynthesis by grain plant leaves. The method is based on routine observation data, enabling automated monitoring of crop production at arbitrary regions without special observations. The method aims to quantity grain production at an early stage to raise the alarm in Asian countries, which are facing climate fluctuation through this century of global warming.","Matsue Natl Coll Technol, Dept Environm & Civil Engn, Matsue, Shimane 6908518, Japan",,"Kaneko, D (corresponding author), Matsue Natl Coll Technol, Dept Environm & Civil Engn, 14-4 Nishiikuma Chou, Matsue, Shimane 6908518, Japan.",,,,,,,,10,1,1,0,3,SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING,BELLINGHAM,"1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010 USA",0277-786X,,978-0-8194-6900-7,P SOC PHOTO-OPT INS,,,2007,,,,,F7420,F7420,,10.1117/12.731312,http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.731312,,,12,Geochemistry & Geophysics; Remote Sensing; Optics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Geochemistry & Geophysics; Remote Sensing; Optics,BHI20,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000253406200014,View Full Record in Web of Science

When the separation is small, there is a positive correlation, and as the separation between them increases, the correlation reduces. In the simplified model, a weak negative correlation emerges at large separations.The location of the anomalous meridional mass flux associated with variations in the latitude of (EDJ), relative to the climatological Hadley cell position, determines the extent to which (HC) is influenced by changes in (EDJ). Changes in the latitude of phi(EDJ) are driven by anomalous eddy momentum flux convergence, and these are approximately balanced by the Coriolis torque on the meridional flow, as expected under quasi-geostrophic scaling. Under changing time-mean climates, the anomalous flow associated with phi(EDJ) variability translates location so that it is approximately fixed relative to the time-mean phi(EDJ). This means that the influence of phi(EDJ) variability on phi(HC) varies as a function of the time-mean separation of the features.Initial indications are that the same causal relationship holds in a suite of state of the art GCMs and that this explains the seasonal variation in the correlation between phi(HC) and phi(EDJ).","[Kidston, J.; Cairns, C.

The design strategies, derived from high performance building design, work in harmony with pre air-conditioning construction solutions including openable windows and the use of hybrid natural, mechanical ventilation integrated with a heat pump energy recovery, transfer distribution system. This project required careful integration of interdependent and synergistic building components: systems to significantly reduce the operating energy, at the same time, provide a high level of indoor environmental quality required for a hospital. The design stage energy modeling analyzed numerous energy conserving options. The designed hospital is estimated to consume 359 kWhr/m(2)/yr. as compared to a conventional code compliant design which would consume 530 kWhr/m(2)/yr. The results show 32% energy and 23% energy cost savings (including non-regulated energy) and 24% which is equal to 2 LEED points under EAc1 and a CO2 saving of over 100 tonnes CO(2)e/yr. These results are based on the final stage energy optimization analysis as part of the LEED compliance energy model process. The relatively low energy cost savings is due to the high cost of electricity in Dawson City. Dawson City has a limited number of service technicians and replacement parts along with the limited accessibility, and requires a design with resilient, robust, redundant system components. Taking this fact into consideration the mechanical and electrical systems have been designed so that they can be remotely monitored and controlled from Whitehorse (450 km south of Dawson City) using web based BACnet communications protocols.",,,,paul.marmion@stantec.com; ian.carter@stantec.com,,,,,,,3,0,0,2,9,"AMER SOC HEATING, REFRIGERATING AND AIR-CONDITIONING ENGS",ATLANTA,"1791 TULLIE CIRCLE NE, ATLANTA, GA 30329 USA",,,,,,,2012,,,,,317,324,,,,,,8,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Civil",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Construction & Building Technology; Engineering,BJO65,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000329390200040,View Full Record in Web of Science

Players are invited to help rebuild the lost world of Mer and its devastated ecosystem in VR by re-establishing its unique flora and fauna, and fighting ongoing dangers and threats, with the aim of bringing back to life its mysterious Mer-people inhabitants. Guided by a solitary seal spirit named Athina - the last of its kind in a dying ocean - players try to save the Mer population from extinction. They tend to secret gardens of coral threatened by pollution, create habitats for Mer-people, and explore the destroyed civilization, in the process learning how their real-world actions impact the world around them. The project was developed with the input of environmental scientists from Harvard University and Dartmouth College. The experience is based on real science, but told through fantasy, as it draws on the cross-cultural myth of the mermaid to appeal to people across the globe.","[Bennett, Gregory] Auckland Univ Technol, Sch Art & Design, Auckland, New Zealand; [Canner, Liz] Astrea Media, New York, NY USA",Auckland University of Technology,"Bennett, G (corresponding author), Auckland Univ Technol, Sch Art & Design, Auckland, New Zealand.",gregory.bennett@aut.ac.nz; lizcanner@astreamedia.org,,,,,,,0,2,3,3,4,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA",,,978-1-4503-6947-3,,,,2019,,,,,25,26,,10.1145/3355355.3361897,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3355355.3361897,,,2,"Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BP0JX,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000535124600012,View Full Record in Web of Science

Results suggest a robust statistical relationship between the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and autumn rainfall in parts of southwest Europe, northern Africa and southwest Asia. The correlation between area-mean anomalies over this region (P-ea) and the NINO3.4 index is 0.68, stationary over the last 50 years. Global ENSO-like tropical climate anomalies are observed in conjunction with Pea anomalies confirming the relationship found with the NINO3.4 index. Overall, the connection with Indo-Pacific variability is stronger than that with the eastern Pacific. While rainfall anomalies in southwest Europe and southwest Asia appear to largely co-vary as one pattern under the influence of ENSO, our results suggest that different mechanisms may be contributing to the observed anomalies. In the North Atlantic/European region, it is speculated that while a PNA-like mode maybe the prevailing teleconnection mechanism for high P-ea, for low P-ea tropical Atlantic ENSO related SST anomalies may be playing a more relevant role forcing northeastward propagating Rossby waves. Over southwest Asia, a more direct connection to the Indo-Pacific region is suggested by the upper air anomaly observed over southern Asia, possibly the Rossby wave response to enhanced heating in the Indian Ocean.","ENEA, Rome, Italy; Univ Maryland, ESSIC, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; Univ Maryland, Dept Meteorol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",Italian National Agency New Technical Energy & Sustainable Economics Development; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Mariotti, A (corresponding author), ENEA, Rome, Italy.",annarita.mariotti@casaccia.enea.it,"Poy, Joaquim Ballabrera/I-1955-2015; Zeng, Ning/A-3130-2008","Poy, Joaquim Ballabrera/0000-0002-1753-221X; Zeng, Ning/0000-0002-7489-7629",,,,,43,54,55,2,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0930-7575,1432-0894,,CLIM DYNAM,Clim.

The regional chemistry-climate model COSMO-ART has been lacking a description of wet scavenging of gases and aqueous-phase chemistry. In this work we present a coupling of COSMO-ART with a wet scavenging and aqueous-phase chemistry scheme. The coupling is made consistent with the cloud microphysics scheme of the underlying meteorological model COSMO. While the choice of the aqueous-chemistry mechanism is flexible, the effects of a simple sulfur oxidation scheme are shown in the application of the coupled system in this work. We give details explaining the coupling and extensions made, then present results from idealized flow-over-hill experiments in a 2-D model setup and finally results from a full 3-D simulation. Comparison against measurement data shows that the scheme efficiently reduces SO2 trace gas concentrations by 0.3 ppbv (-30 %) on average, while leaving O-3 and NOx unchanged. PM10 aerosol mass was increased by 10% on average. While total PM2.5 changes only little, chemical composition is improved notably. Overestimations of nitrate aerosols are reduced by typically 0.5-1 mu g m(-3) (up to -2 mu g m(-3) in the Po Valley) while sulfate mass is increased by 1-1.5 mu g m(-3) on average (up to 2.5 mu g m(-3) in Eastern Europe). The effect of cloud processing of aerosols on its size distribution, i.e. a shift towards larger diameters, is observed. Compared against wet deposition measurements the system tends to underestimate the total wet deposited mass for the simulated case study.","[Knote, C.; Brunner, D.] Empa Mat & Sci, Lab Air Pollut Env Technol, Dubendorf, Switzerland; [Knote, C.; Brunner, D.] ETH, Ctr Climate Syst Modeling C2SM, Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science & Technology (EMPA); Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Knote, C (corresponding author), Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Div Atmospher Chem, Boulder, CO 80307 USA.",knote@ucar.edu,"Knote, Christoph/A-9809-2010; Brunner, Dominik/P-9520-2019; Brunner, Dominik/A-1255-2009; Brunner, Dominik/GSI-5449-2022","Knote, Christoph/0000-0001-9105-9179; Brunner, Dominik/0000-0002-4007-6902; Brunner, Dominik/0000-0002-4007-6902",Swiss National Science Foundation [206021_128754],Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission),"We thank Holger Tost, Johannes Gutenberg-Universitaet Mainz, Germany, for his willingness to provide source code and updates for the SCAV module and his kindness in responding to our questions.

With a time series at two sites in excess of 40yr, we investigated turnover of both species and functional traits in a system stressed by eutrophication and overfishing and undergoing climate change and invasion. The two sites, although located near to each other, differ in water depth (20 cf. 35m), but both sites have displayed increased abundances of an invasive polychaete since 1990. We tested two hypotheses related to the effect of an invasive species; that taxa richness and turnover would decrease, and trait richness would increase post invasion and that trait turnover would increase between arrival and establishment of the invasive. Generally, we observed different dynamics at the two sites and responses not consistent with our hypotheses. We detected an increase in taxa richness at both sites and an increase in taxa turnover and number of traits at one site only. Trait turnover was higher prior to the invasion, although again only at one site. Disjunctive responses between species and trait turnover occurred, with the invader contributing in a nonrandom fashion to trait turnover. The lack of strong, consistent responses to the arrival and establishment of the invasive, and the decrease in trait turnover, suggests that effects of invasives are not only system- and species-dependent, but also depend on community dynamics of the invaded site, in particular the assembly processes, and historical context.","[Hewitt, Judi E.] Natl Inst Water & Atmospher Res, Marine Ecol Dept Hamilton, Hamilton 3251, New Zealand; [Hewitt, Judi E.; Norkko, Joanna; Kauppi, Laura; Villnas, Anna; Norkko, Alf] Univ Helsinki, Tvarminne Zool Stn, JA Palmenin Tie 260, FI-10900 Hango, Finland; [Norkko, Alf] Finnish Environm Inst, Ctr Marine Res, FI-00251 Helsinki, Finland",National Institute of Water & Atmospheric Research (NIWA) - New Zealand; University of Helsinki; Finnish Environment Institute,"Hewitt, JE (corresponding author), Natl Inst Water & Atmospher Res, Marine Ecol Dept Hamilton, Hamilton 3251, New Zealand.;Hewitt, JE (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Tvarminne Zool Stn, JA Palmenin Tie 260, FI-10900 Hango, Finland.",j.hewitt@niwa.co.nz,"Norkko, Alf/A-1856-2012; Norkko, Alf/K-2341-2019; Norkko, Alf/L-8736-2019","Norkko, Alf/0000-0002-9741-4458; Norkko, Alf/0000-0002-9741-4458; Peters, Debra/0000-0002-5842-8099; Villnas, Anna/0000-0003-3077-929X; Norkko, Joanna/0000-0001-9885-8408",Walter and Andree De Nottbeck Foundation; NIWA's Coasts and Oceans Centre; University of Helsinki; BONUS COCOA-project - BONUS (Art 185); EU; Academy of Finland; Maj and Tor Nessling Foundation [2014322],Walter and Andree De Nottbeck Foundation; NIWA's Coasts and Oceans Centre; University of Helsinki; BONUS COCOA-project - BONUS (Art 185); EU(European Commission); Academy of Finland(Academy of Finland); Maj and Tor Nessling Foundation,"Funding for this manuscript was obtained from: the Walter and Andree De Nottbeck Foundation senior fellowship to JEH in 2013; from NIWA's Coasts and Oceans Centre (JEH); the University of Helsinki (3-yr grant to JN); the BONUS COCOA-project supported by BONUS (Art 185), funded jointly by the EU and the Academy of Finland; and the Maj and Tor Nessling Foundation (Grant no. 2014322).

In our study we investigated the effects of EM on crop yields and soil microbial parameters in a 4-year field experiment under organic management (2003-2006) in Zurich, Switzerland. Treatments of the EM preparations (i) the spraying agent EMA, (ii) EMA with the EM enriched organic substrate Bokashi and (iii) EMA with Bokashi and farmyard manure were applied in each year. As controls to treatments (i)-(iii) the same treatments were included with sterilised EM preparations and a control without EM application. Crop yields in each year and the soil microbiological parameters soil respiration, microbial biomass (SIR, CFE), dehydrogenase activity and microbial community structure (RISA, CLSU) were determined in spring and autumn 2005 and spring 2006. In laboratory incubation experiments cellulose degradation. N mineralisation potential and N mineralisation from added substrate were determined. The EMA application as spraying agent alone (treatment (i)) showed no significant differences to the untreated control (treatment without EM application) for any of the investigated parameters. Significant differences to the untreated control for crop yields and soil microbial parameters were found if Bokashi was applied in addition to EMA ((ii) and (iii)). However, these differences were not consistent throughout the parameters and sampling times. Treatments with living EM compared with its sterilised control treatments showed no differences on any of the parameters. This indicates that the small effects observed were not caused by the EM microorganisms but rather by the nutrient inputs derived from Bokashi. The sampling time showed stronger effects on soil microbial biomass, soil respiration and microbial community structure when compared to the effects of the treatments. We conclude from our results that 'Effective microorganisms' did not improve yields and soil quality during 4 years of application in this field experiment under the temperate climatic conditions of Central Europe.

The applicability of dynamic building simulation in estimating cooling loads of a city's housing stock can be limited due to lack of fine-grained on-site current and future weather inputs. For predicative modelling of residential cooling energy demand to aid a city's energy supply planning resilient to excessive heat conditions, it requires cooling energy demand projection based on a relational account of (1) the thermal-environmental interaction between housing stocks and urban microclimate conditions, (2) the city dwellers' cooling energy use behaviour, and (3) the city's climate projections. In this paper, we introduce an 'archetype-in-neighbourhood' framework to meet these requirements. Combining empirical urban data modelling and EngeryPlus model calibration, this frame-work was developed to obtain statistically a maximal cooling energy demand model of a city's housing stock during yearly hottest periods. We applied the framework to multiple datasets selected from Seoul's open urban data sources for the period of 2014-2017 (2014 being the earliest year of data availability, 2017 being the end of the study period), including metered electricity use data of 659 apartment buildings (51,351 households) sampled from 18 city districts. The results show that maximal month cooling energy demand (MMCD, kWh/m(2)) of Seoul's housing stock can be expressed as a regression function of two determinants: (1) the city's average outdoor temperature during the hottest month period (T-ex, degrees C), and (2) estimated indoor cooling temperature set-point (T-in, degrees C) of the city' housing stock during the same period. Through a k-fold (k = 4) validation, the current regression model (2014-17) was evaluated to have an overall coefficient of determination R-2=0.969. Assuming no housing stock renovation, we applied the model to generate scenarios of maximal month cooling demand in future years according to some of the highest summer temperatures projected for Seoul (RCP8.5 2045, RCP4.5 2047, MM5 2071-2100). We conclude this paper with a brief discussion of the implication for cooling energy supply planning and further work to extend the applicability of this new framework to housing stock adaptation planning and design.

The models are different in that ERGOM and RCO-SCOBI are three-dimensional (3D) circulation models while BALTSEM resolves the Baltic Sea into 13 dynamically interconnected and horizontally integrated sub-basins. The aim is to assess the simulated long-term dynamics and to discuss the response of the coupled physical-biogeochemical models to changing physical conditions and nutrient loadings during the period 1970-2005. We compared the long-term seasonal and annual statistics of inorganic nitrogen, phosphorus, and oxygen from hindcast simulations with those estimated from observations. We also studied the extension of hypoxic bottom areas covered by waters with O-2<2 ml O-2 l(-1) and cod reproductive volumes comprising waters with salinity >11 and O-2>2 ml O-2 l(-1). The models reproduce much of the nutrient biogeochemical cycling in the Baltic proper. However, biases are larger in the Bothnian Sea and Bothnian Bay. No model shows outstanding performance in all aspects but instead the ensemble mean results are better than or as good as the results of any of the individual models. Uncertainties are primarily related to differences in the bioavailable fractions of nutrient loadings from land and parameterizations of key processes like sediment fluxes that are presently not well known. Also the uncertainty related to the initialization of the models in the early 1960s influence the modeled biogeochemical cycles during the investigated period. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

CRAICC gathered more than 100 scientists from all Nordic countries in a virtual centre with the objectives of identifying and quantifying the major processes controlling Arctic warming and related feedback mechanisms, outlining strategies to mitigate Arctic warming, and developing Nordic Earth system modelling with a focus on short-lived climate forcers (SLCFs), including natural and anthropogenic aerosols. The outcome of CRAICC is reflected in more than 150 peer-reviewed scientific publications, most of which are in the CRAICC special issue of the journal Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics. This paper presents an overview of the main scientific topics investigated in the centre and provides the reader with a state-of-the-art comprehensive summary of what has been achieved in CRAICC with links to the particular publications for further detail. Faced with a vast amount of scientific discovery, we do not claim to completely summarize the results from CRAICC within this paper, but rather concentrate here on the main results which are related to feedback loops in climate change-cryosphere interactions that affect Arctic amplification.","[Boy, Michael; Brasseur, Zoe; Duplissy, Ella-Maria; Duplissy, Jonathan; Kasurinen, Ville; Lappalainen, Hanna K.; Lauri, Antti; Lepparanta, Matti; Makkonen, Risto; Tabakova, Ksenia; Virkkula, Aki; Wu, Yusheng; Kulmala, Markku] Univ Helsinki, Inst Atmospher & Earth Syst Res Phys, POB 64, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Thomson, Erik S.; Castarede, Dimitri; Pettersson, Jan B.

The cause of dependence, the relationship between dependence and likelihoods of compound events, and changes in risks associated with dependence changes are reviewed, with the illustration of two typical examples of compound dry-hot events and compound flooding events. Also discussed are related topics, including impacts of sample sizes, multivariate bias correction of dependence, and separating driving factors of compound event changes.

So it was essential to measure crop transpiration rate. Owing to the difficulty of obtaining accurate real time data of crop transpiration, it was commonly estimated from weather parameters. So the fuzzy logic model for estimation of greenhouse crop transpiration rate was developed. The model was made up of five sub-systems and three layers. There were nine input variables and one output variable. The results of comparison between measured and fuzzy model is inspirer. The squared correlation coefficient (r(2)) by fuzzy model method (r(2) = 0.9302) is slightly higher than by FAO Penman-Monteith formula (r(2) = 0.9213). The fuzzy logic crop transpiration rate model could be easily extended for irrigation decision-making.","Zhengzhou Inst Light Ind, Dept Comp & Commun Engn, Zhengzhou 450002, Peoples R China",Zhengzhou University of Light Industry,"Deng, LJ (corresponding author), Zhengzhou Inst Light Ind, Dept Comp & Commun Engn, 5 Dongfeng Rd, Zhengzhou 450002, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,4,SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING,BELLINGHAM,"1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010 USA",0277-786X,,0-8194-6453-8,P SOC PHOTO-OPT INS,,,2006,,2-Jan,,,E3585,E3585,63585E,10.1117/12.718289,http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.718289,,,6,"Automation & Control Systems; Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Instruments & Instrumentation",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Automation & Control Systems; Computer Science; Instruments & Instrumentation,BFM86,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000243125000194,View Full Record in Web of Science

Establishing living walls as a viable constructive system will require filling gaps in our knowledge by taking advantage of the lessons learned from recently built projects. Growing plants on a vertical surface gives the appearance of natural simplicity. However, achieving a successful living wall is a complex problem with many factors. These include: ensuring an appropriate support structure, maintaining the proper amount of water, oxygen, nutrients and pH levels, choosing plants which can survive seasonal climatic changes, and establishing the appropriate lighting conditions; not to mention affordability, sustainability and longevity. Satisfying these complex needs - mastering all of these factors - will be essential for living wall systems to mature beyond their use as vanity projects and gain acceptance by the construction industry. This article aims to aid those considering living walls and dispel some of the mystery surrounding them by studying precedents and addressing their commonly cited criticisms: living walls are too expensive and unsustainable, too complicated and prone to failure, and too decorative and superficial to the buildings they serve.

For megacities, these features become mesoscale phenomena (scale 10 km) that are amplified by the tropospheric feedbacks, and have substantial implications on human well-being. For the first time, a three-dimensional statistical description of the megacity-induced meteorological effects extending towards the lower troposphere for summer is acquired on a quasi-climatological timescale (a decade) based on high-resolution (1 km) simulations for Moscow with the COSMO-CLM model with and without its urban canopy model TERRA_URB. Our results confirm the features from previous observational and modeling studies, including the UHI itself, the cooling effect above established by the cross-over effect, the urban dry/moist islands and the urban breeze circulation. Particularly, the UHI shows a strong diurnal variation in terms of intensity and vertical extent between daytime (approximate to 0.5 K/approximate to 1.5 km) and nighttime (>3 K/approximate to 150 m). We have discovered a systematic veering in the downwind shift of the UHI spatial pattern established by the Coriolis effect, and an enhanced stable stratification of the rural surroundings established by the urban plumes further downwind. Finally, extending the analysis to multiple summers demonstrates a substantial increase in summer precipitation (up to +25%) over the city center and its leeward side. These urban-caused mesoclimatic effects need to be taken into account in weather and climate services, including the design of future megacities.","[Varentsov, Mikhail; Platonov, Vladimir; Konstantinov, Pavel] Lomonosov Moscow State Univ, Fac Geog, Ctr Res Comp, 1 Leninskiye Gory, Moscow 119991, Russia; [Varentsov, Mikhail] AM Obukhov Inst Atmospher Phys, 3 Pyzhyovskiy Pereulok, Moscow 119017, Russia; [Wouters, Hendrik] Univ Ghent, Dept Forest & Water Management, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Wouters, Hendrik] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Div Geog & Tourism, B-3001 Leuven, Belgium",Lomonosov Moscow State University; Russian Academy of Sciences; Obukhov Institute of Atmospheric Physics of Russian Academy of Sciences; Ghent University; KU Leuven,"Varentsov, M (corresponding author), Lomonosov Moscow State Univ, Fac Geog, Ctr Res Comp, 1 Leninskiye Gory, Moscow 119991, Russia.;Varentsov, M (corresponding author), AM Obukhov Inst Atmospher Phys, 3 Pyzhyovskiy Pereulok, Moscow 119017, Russia.",mvar91@gmail.com; Hendrik.Wouters@ugent.be; vplatonov86@gmail.com; kostadini@mail.ru,"Konstantinov, Pavel/C-3141-2015; Platonov, Vladimir/D-5213-2012; Varentsov, Mikhail/F-7851-2017","Konstantinov, Pavel/0000-0001-5064-155X; Platonov, Vladimir/0000-0002-7256-1451; Varentsov, Mikhail/0000-0001-9095-5334",Russian Science Foundation [17-77-20070]; European Research Council (ERC) [715254],Russian Science Foundation(Russian Science Foundation (RSF)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)),"The bulk of the research (supercomputer modeling, data management and analysis) performed by M.

Tropical montane cloud forests (TMCF) have unique climatic conditions, which allow the coexistence of plant lineages with different phytogeographical origins from tropical versus temperate climates. Future climate projections suggest TMCFs will be subjected to increasing drought stress due to fog uplift and higher temperatures, possibly leading to tree mortality and local extinctions, and consequently changes in forest composition and functioning. Characterizing community functional composition, trade-offs among traits and the drivers of community assembly is of utmost importance to improve our capacity to predict the response of montane plant communities to forecast climate change. 2. Here, we aimed to test whether species from different phytogeographical origins (i.e. tropical - evergreen x deciduous - and temperate) differ in drought vulnerability and how the coexistence of these groups change the hydraulic composition of TMCFs. We used a framework based on measurements of key hydraulic traits (i.e. xylem embolism resistance, hydraulic safety margin, stomata control, turgor loss point, minimum water potential) of 16 dominant species (>70% of the forest basal area) within a TMCF in the Atlantic Rain Forest Domain in southeast Brazil. We used community-weighted means to model whether removing each species group would change the community hydraulic functional composition. 3. Temperate, tropical deciduous and tropical evergreen groups differ in their hydraulic functioning and these differences explain forest functional composition and taxa dominance. Temperate and tropical deciduous taxa were consistently more vulnerable hydraulically (i.e. lower safety margins and embolism resistance). The coexistence of different phytogeographical lineages is a key determinant of TMCF hydraulic composition. We also used models including phylogeny to evaluate the variation of hydraulic traits across phytogeographical groups, and the results suggest some niche conservatism associated with plant hydraulic functioning. 4. Our results provide evidence of the importance of species phytogeographical origin on TMCF functioning, and niche conservatism in the evolution of hydraulic traits. The higher drought vulnerability observed in temperate group might be a mechanistic explanation for the restriction of temperate taxa distribution to wetter places during past colder and drier climate. Thus, we suggest hydraulic functional traits may be useful to predict future dynamics of TMCFs under changing climatic conditions.","[Barros, Fernanda de, V; Bittencourt, Paulo L.; Eller, Cleiton B.] Univ Estadual Campinas, Inst Biol, Programa Posgrad Ecol, Campinas, Brazil; [Barros, Fernanda de, V; Bittencourt, Paulo L.; Signori-Muller, Caroline] Univ Exeter, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Dept Geog, Exeter, Devon, England; [Signori-Muller, Caroline] Univ Estadual Campinas, Inst Biol, Programa Posgrad Biol Vegetal, Campinas, Brazil; [Meireles, Leonardo D.] Univ Sao Paulo, Sch Art Sci & Humanities, Environm Management Course, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Oliveira, Rafael S.] Univ Campinas UNICAMP, Inst Biol, Dept Biol Vegetal, CP 6109, Campinas, Brazil",Universidade de Sao Paulo; Universidade Estadual de Campinas; University of Exeter; Universidade de Sao Paulo; Universidade Estadual de Campinas; Universidade de Sao Paulo; Universidade de Sao Paulo; Universidade Estadual de Campinas,"Barros, FD (corresponding author), Univ Estadual Campinas, Inst Biol, Programa Posgrad Ecol, Campinas, Brazil.;Barros, FD (corresponding author), Univ Exeter, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Dept Geog, Exeter, Devon, England.",nandavascon@gmail.com,"Signori-Müller, Caroline/AAI-2859-2021; Oliveira, Rafael/B-3422-2013","Signori-Müller, Caroline/0000-0003-1047-1896; Oliveira, Rafael/0000-0002-6392-2526; de Vasconcellos Barros, Fernanda/0000-0003-3835-2020",Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo [2011/52072-0]; Microsoft Research [2011/52072-0],Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)); Microsoft Research(Microsoft),"Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo, Grant/Award Number: 2011/52072-0; Microsoft Research, Grant/Award Number: 2011/52072-0",,89,0,0,8,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0269-8463,1365-2435,,FUNCT ECOL,Funct.

Excess loading of the macronutrients nitrogen and phosphorus from a myriad of human activities in catchment areas has forced many lake ecosystems into turbid, eutrophic states from which natural recovery is slow. A wide array of tools is available to lake managers to accelerate the process of lake restoration. These range from external measures to reduce nutrient loading, to internal measures designed to either retain nutrients in sediments or remove them from the lake ecosystem. In this preface to the Special Issue Restoration of eutrophic lakes: current practices and future challenges, we briefly review the currently available approaches to lake restoration and assess their global prevalence through a literature survey. The results show that traditional restoration methods such as aeration and chemical inactivation of phosphorus by aluminum continue to be widely used and reported in the scientific literature. The popularity of biomanipulation appears to be in decline, while studies into newly developed, in-lake nutrient inactivation methods are expanding. Hypolimnetic withdrawal, on the other hand, remains a comparatively rare technique. The 16 original research articles in the Special Issue showcase the current state-of-the-art in knowledge of these approaches and their efficacy. We conclude by discussing the key relevant future challenges in the field of lake restoration science. Of these, the need to unite diverse fields of knowledge to develop quantitative models of lake ecosystem responses to restoration measures under a changing climate is paramount. We also emphasize the ongoing need for interaction between scientists, managers, and stakeholders in lake restoration.","[Jilbert, Tom] Univ Helsinki, Fac Biol & Environm Sci, Aquat Biogeochem Res Unit, Ecosyst & Environm Res Program, Helsinki, Finland; [Couture, Raoul-Marie] Univ Laval, Dept Chem, Aquat Geochem Grp, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Huser, Brian J.] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Aquat Sci & Assessment, Uppsala, Sweden; [Salonen, Kalevi] Univ Helsinki, Lammi Biol Stn, Helsinki, Finland",University of Helsinki; Laval University; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; University of Helsinki,"Jilbert, T (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Fac Biol & Environm Sci, Aquat Biogeochem Res Unit, Ecosyst & Environm Res Program, Helsinki, Finland.",tom.jilbert@helsinki.fi,"Huser, Brian J/C-8660-2012; Jilbert, Tom/AAL-2273-2021; Couture, Raoul/AGR-6683-2022","Huser, Brian J/0000-0002-2804-326X; Couture, Raoul/0000-0003-4940-3372",,,,,91,17,17,11,47,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0018-8158,1573-5117,,HYDROBIOLOGIA,Hydrobiologia,DEC,2020,21,,SI,,4343,4357,,10.1007/s10750-020-04457-x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-020-04457-x,,20-Nov,15,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Marine & Freshwater Biology,PE1HT,,Bronze,,,12/21/22,WOS:000590034800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the underlying cause of this increased surface melting and how it relates to cryospheric changes across the Arctic remain unclear. Here it is shown that an important contributing factor is the decreasing Arctic sea ice. Reduced summer sea ice favors stronger and more frequent occurrences of blocking-high pressure events over Greenland. Blocking highs enhance the transport of warm, moist air over Greenland, which increases downwelling infrared radiation, contributes to increased extreme heat events, and accounts for the majority of the observed warming trends. These findings are supported by analyses of observations and reanalysis data, as well as by independent atmospheric model simulations using a state-of-the-art atmospheric model that is forced by varying only the sea ice conditions. Reduced sea ice conditions in the model favor more extensive Greenland surface melting. The authors find a positive feedback between the variability in the extent of summer Arctic sea ice and melt area of the summer Greenland ice sheet, which affects the Greenland ice sheet mass balance. This linkage may improve the projections of changes in the global sea level and thermohaline circulation.","[Liu, Jiping] SUNY Albany, Dept Atmospher & Environm Sci, 1400 Washington Ave, Albany, NY 12222 USA; [Chen, Zhiqiang; Song, Mirong] Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Numer Modeling Atmospher Sci & Geop, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Chen, Zhiqiang; Song, Mirong] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Francis, Jennifer] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Marine & Coastal Sci, New Brunswick, NJ 08903 USA; [Mote, Thomas] Univ Georgia, Dept Geog, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Hu, Yongyun] Peking Univ, Sch Phys, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China","State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Albany; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; Rutgers State University New Brunswick; University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; Peking University","Liu, JP (corresponding author), SUNY Albany, Dept Atmospher & Environm Sci, 1400 Washington Ave, Albany, NY 12222 USA.",jliu26@albany.edu,"Hu, Yongyun/B-6786-2016; LIU, JIPING/N-6696-2016","Hu, Yongyun/0000-0002-4003-4630; ","Climate Observation and Earth System Science Divisions, Climate Program Office, NOAA, U.S. Department of Commerce [NA15OAR4310163, NA14OAR4310216]; NSF ARCSS [1304097]; NSFC [41305097]; NASA IDS [NNX14AD98G]; Office of Polar Programs (OPP) [1304097] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Climate Observation and Earth System Science Divisions, Climate Program Office, NOAA, U.S. Department of Commerce; NSF ARCSS(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)); NSFC(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); NASA IDS; Office of Polar Programs (OPP)(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO))","J.

Therefore, the impact of climate change on crop production is a significant problem to be solved. Though a handful of research works are present to predict the crop yield, the prediction accuracy of crop productivity is not sufficient. Besides, the time duration needed to identify the crop production using big agriculture dataset was higher. To avoid such limitations, the Bootstrap Aggregative MapReduce Rocchio Classification (BAMRC) technique is proposed. The BAMRC technique contains two key processes i.e., feature selection and classification. The experimental evaluation of BAMRC technique is conducted on metrics such as prediction accuracy, prediction time and false positive rate relating to numerous test instances collected at varied time period. The experimental results depict that the BAMRC technique is able to improve the prediction accuracy and also minimise the prediction time of crop yields from soybean large dataset when compared to state-of-the-art works.","[Saranya, C.

It is currently experiencing high rates of relative sea-level rise of about 5 mm/year, reflecting anthropogenic climate change and land subsidence. This is expected to accelerate further through the 21st Century, so there are concerns that the GBM delta will be progressively submerged. In this context, a core question is: can sedimentation on the delta surface maintain its elevation relative to sea level? This research seeks to answer this question by applying a two-dimensional flow and morphological model which is capable of handling dynamic interactions between the river and floodplain systems and simulating floodplain sedimentation under different flow-sediment regimes and anthropogenic interventions. We find that across a range of flood frequencies and adaptation scenarios (including the natural polder-free state), the retained volume of sediment varies between 22% and 50% of the corresponding sediment input. This translates to average rates of sedimentation on the delta surface of 5.5 mm/yr to 7.5 mm/yr. Hence, under present conditions, sedimentation associated with quasi-natural conditions can exceed current rates of relative sea-level rise and potentially create new land mass. These findings highlight that encouraging quasi-natural conditions through the widespread application of active sediment management measures has the potential to promote more sustainable outcomes for the GBM delta. Practical measures to promote include tidal river management, and appropriate combinations of cross-dams, bandal-like structures, and dredging.","[Rahman, Md.

State of the art,WATER RESEARCH,,,English,Review,,,,,,Management; Resilience; Sewer systems; Wastewater; WRRF,CLIMATE-CHANGE; INFRASTRUCTURE; FRAMEWORK,"Government bodies, utilities, practitioners, and researchers have growing interest in the incorporation of resilience into wastewater management. Since resilience is a multidisciplinary term, it is important to review what has been achieved in the wastewater sector, and describe the future research directions for the forthcoming years. This work presents a critical review of studies that deal with resilience in the wastewater treatment sector, with a special focus on understanding how they addressed the key elements for assessing resilience, such as stressors, system properties, metrics and interventions to increase resilience. The results showed that only 17 peer-reviewed papers and 6 relevant reports, a small subset of the work in wastewater research, directly addressed resilience. The lack of consensus in the definition of resilience, and the elements of a resilience assessment, is hindering the implementation of resilience in wastewater management. To date, no framework for resilience assessment is complete, comprehensive or directly applicable to practitioners; current examples are lacking key elements (e.g. a comprehensive study of stressors, properties and metrics, examples of cases study, ability to benchmark interventions or connectivity with broader frameworks). Furthermore, resilience is seen as an additional cost or extra effort, instead of a means to overcome project uncertainty that could unlock new opportunities for investment. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Here, a modular Earth System Model emulator is used to evaluate the realism of the warming signal in CMIP6 models on both global and regional scales, by comparing their global trends and regional response parameters to observations. Subsequently, the emulator is employed to derive large crossbred multimodel initial-condition ensembles of regionally optimized land temperature projections by combining observationally constrained global mean temperature trend trajectories with observationally constrained local parameters. In the optimized ensembles, the warmest temperature projections are generally reduced and for the coolest projections both higher and lower values are found, depending on the region. The median shows less changes in large parts of the globe. These regional differences highlight the importance of a geographically explicit evaluation of Earth System Model projections. Plain Language Summary The newest generation of state-of-the-art Earth System Models (ESMs) exhibits more uncertainty in temperature projections at the end of the 21st century than the previous generation. Here we use an ESM emulator, that is, a statistical tool which mimics the behavior of ESMs, to evaluate this newest generation of ESMs with respect to observations and to generate new ensembles combining the best performing features of these ESMs at both global and regional scales. The new ensembles consist of a large number of regionally optimized land temperature projections. At the end of the 21st century, the warmest regional temperature projections are generally lower in the optimized ensembles and the coolest projections are either reduced or enhanced, depending on the region. The temperature projections in the middle of the distribution are less affected in large parts of the globe. These regional differences emphasize the importance of also considering ESM performance in individual regions, not just the global mean, when evaluating climate change projections with current ESMs.","[Beusch, Lea; Gudmundsson, Lukas; Seneviratne, Sonia I.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Beusch, L (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, Zurich, Switzerland.",lea.beusch@env.ethz.ch,"Seneviratne, Sonia I./G-8761-2011; Gudmundsson, Lukas/I-9535-2014","Seneviratne, Sonia I./0000-0001-9528-2917; Gudmundsson, Lukas/0000-0003-3539-8621; Beusch, Lea/0000-0002-3692-7962",H2020 CRESCENDO project [641816]; FP7 Ideas ERC DROUGHT-HEAT project [617518],H2020 CRESCENDO project; FP7 Ideas ERC DROUGHT-HEAT project,"We acknowledge partial support from the H2020 CRESCENDO project (Grant Agreement 641816) and the FP7 Ideas ERC DROUGHT-HEAT project (Grant Agreement 617518).

Ningaloo Nino is the major cause of marine heatwaves in the region. Although oceanic variability in this region has long been considered mainly as a response to the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), some recent studies have suggested the possible existence of local air-sea feedback processes. Using a state-of-the-art ocean-atmosphere coupled model that realistically simulates Ningaloo Nino/Nina, whether Ningaloo Nino/Nina can occur independently of ENSO is examined. Even in an experiment in which ENSO is suppressed by strongly nudging tropical Pacific sea surface temperatures toward the model climatology, Ningaloo Nino/Nina with a similar magnitude and seasonality still develops, likely through an air-sea interaction off Western Australia amplifying atmospheric stochastic forcing. This study is the first to show that Ningaloo Nino/Nina can develop even without ENSO. Plain Language Summary Ningaloo Nino/Nina is the major cause of extreme warming/cooling in the southeastern Indian Ocean in austral summer and affects the marine environment and precipitation over the Western Australia. Although it has long been considered that El Nino and La Nina in the Pacific drive ocean extreme events in this region, some recent studies have suggested a possibility that warming/cooling off Western Australia would add to itself by changing the atmospheric condition and creating further heating/cooling (i.e., positive air-sea feedback). Using climate model simulations, we show that, even without El Nino and La Nina, Ningaloo Nino/Nina with a similar magnitude occurs in summer, likely through the positive air-sea feedback off Western Australia amplifying atmospheric random forcing. This study is the first to show that Ningaloo Nino/Nina can develop even without El Nino and La Nina.","[Kataoka, Takahito] JAMSTEC, Project Team Adv Climate Modeling, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan; [Masson, Sebastien; Izumo, Takeshi] Univ Paris 06, LOCEAN IPSL, Paris, France; [Tozuka, Tomoki] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Tokyo, Japan; [Tozuka, Tomoki; Yamagata, Toshio] JAMSTEC, Applicat Lab, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan",Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science & Technology (JAMSTEC); Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle (MNHN); UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; University of Tokyo; Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science & Technology (JAMSTEC),"Kataoka, T (corresponding author), JAMSTEC, Project Team Adv Climate Modeling, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan.",tkataoka@15.alumni.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Yamagata, Toshio/A-1807-2009; Tozuka, Tomoki/A-1805-2009; Izumo, Takeshi/AAW-5940-2020; Kataoka, Takahito/GRY-2961-2022; Izumo, Takeshi/C-1838-2013","Tozuka, Tomoki/0000-0001-6738-1299; Izumo, Takeshi/0000-0001-9617-2234; Izumo, Takeshi/0000-0001-9617-2234","MEXT, Japan; MEXT; Japan Society for Promotion of Science [JP16H04047]; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS); GENCI-IDRIS [2013-016895, 2014-016895]","MEXT, Japan(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); MEXT(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); Japan Society for Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); GENCI-IDRIS","We would like to thank Hiroaki Miura and Tamaki Suematsu for helpful discussions, Takeshi Doi for technical advice, and two anonymous reviewers for helpful comments.

It was our objective, therefore, to provide an additional source for paleovegetation comparison by presenting simulations from a state-of-the-art fully coupled earth system model (HadCM3LC). We simulated potential paleovegetation distributions following pre-Industrial and last glacial maximum (LGM) climate forcing for the continent of Africa. Our LGM simulations indicate that tropical broadleaf forest was not severely displaced by expanding grasslands within central Africa, although the outer extent of closed forest decreases, particularly in the north. Our simulations indicate that the structure of glacial forests may have been much different from today, in that LGM simulations indicate that forests were likely characterized by lower leaf area indexes, lower tree heights and lower vegetation carbon content. On the other hand, warmer interglacial climate (like our pre-Industrial climate scenario) results in simulated expansion of tropical forest from coast to coast across central Africa that we postulate could have acted as a barrier to plant and animal species migrations. We suggest that our modeling experiments have implications for the interpretation of phylogenetic data, including that of our own species, Homo sapiens sapiens.","[Cowling, Sharon A.; Peros, Mathew] Univ Toronto, Dept Geog, Toronto, ON M5S 3G3, Canada; [Cowling, Sharon A.; Maslin, Mark A.] UCL, Dept Geog, London WC1H 0AP, England; [Cox, Peter M.; Jones, Chris D.; Spall, Steven A.] Hadley Ctr Climate Predict & Res, Met Off, Exeter EX1 3PB, Devon, England",University of Toronto; University of London; University College London; Met Office - UK; Hadley Centre,"Cowling, SA (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Geog, 100 St George St,5th Floor, Toronto, ON M5S 3G3, Canada.",cowling@geog.utoronto.ca,"Cox, Peter Michae;/B-3299-2012; Jones, Chris/I-2983-2014","Cox, Peter Michae;/0000-0002-0679-2219; Jones, Chris/0000-0002-7141-9285; Maslin, Mark/0000-0001-9957-3463",Natural Environment Research Council [NER/A/S/2001/01160] Funding Source: researchfish,Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),,,97,75,76,0,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

In this article we document both historic and recent observations of sea hares (family Aplysiidae) from Port Stephens with the intention of recording species diversity. The western South Pacific region has the richest aplysiid fauna in the world, with 16 species now recorded in Port Stephens. This location is the most taxonomically diverse for this family in Australia. Despite this hotspot of aplysiid diversity, the taxonomy and nomenclature of 12 species is uncertain, a fact highlighted by a series of nomenclatural notes included in this article. We herein report the first observation of Petalifera sp. in Australian waters. Dolabrifera jacksoniensis Pilsbry, 1896 is newly synonymised with D. brazieri G.B. Sowerby II, 1870. Recent reports of southern range extensions for other heterobranch sea slugs, both in Port Stephens and elsewhere in NSW, highlight the importance of recording the existing aplysiid diversity in the port. Thus, any future alteration to species composition and range shifts driven by climate change may be detected.","[Nimbs, Matt J.; Smith, Stephen D.

For a quantitative assessment of its impact on the global climate, state-of-the-art atmospheric and aerosol models can be utilized. In this study, we use the ECHAM6.3-HAM2.3 model to perform global simulations of the mineral dust cycle for present-day (PD), pre-industrial (PI), and last glacial maximum (LGM) climate conditions. The intercomparison with marine sediment and ice core data, as well as other modeling studies, shows that the obtained annual dust emissions of 1221, 923, and 5159 Tg for PD, PI, and LGM, respectively, generally agree well with previous findings. Our analyses focusing on the Southern Hemisphere suggest that over 90 % of the mineral dust deposited over Antarctica are of Australian or South American origin during both PI and LGM. However, contrary to previous studies, we find that Australia contributes a higher proportion during the LGM, which is mainly caused by changes in the precipitation patterns. Obtained increased particle radii during the LGM can be traced back to increased sulfate condensation on the particle surfaces as a consequence of longer particle lifetimes. The meridional transport of mineral dust from its source regions to the South Pole takes place at different altitudes depending on the grain size of the dust particles. We find a trend of generally lower transport heights during the LGM compared to PI as a consequence of reduced convection due to colder surfaces, indicating a vertically less extensive Polar cell.","[Kraetschmer, Stephan; van der Does, Michelle; Lamy, Frank; Lohmann, Gerrit; Voelker, Christoph; Werner, Martin] Helmholtz Ctr Polar & Marine Res, Alfred Wegener Inst, Bremerhaven, Germany; [Lohmann, Gerrit] Univ Bremen, Phys Dept, Bremen, Germany","Helmholtz Association; Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar & Marine Research; University of Bremen","Kratschmer, S (corresponding author), Helmholtz Ctr Polar & Marine Res, Alfred Wegener Inst, Bremerhaven, Germany.",stephan.kraetschmer@awi.de,"Voelker, Christoph/I-7891-2012; Werner, Martin/C-8067-2014; Lohmann, Gerrit/M-7453-2016","Voelker, Christoph/0000-0003-3032-114X; Werner, Martin/0000-0002-6473-0243; Kratschmer, Stephan/0000-0003-2649-8559; Lohmann, Gerrit/0000-0003-2089-733X",Alfred Wegener Institute Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research (Strategy Fund Project DustIron grant),Alfred Wegener Institute Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research (Strategy Fund Project DustIron grant),This research has been supported by the Alfred Wegener Institute Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research (Strategy Fund Project DustIron grant).,,82,2,2,0,3,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1814-9324,1814-9332,,CLIM PAST,Clim.

An old conceptual model for the greenhouse effect is revisited and presented as a useful resource in climate change communication. It is validated against state-of-the-art data, and nontraditional diagnostics show a physically consistent picture. The earth's climate is constrained by well-known and elementary physical principles, such as energy balance, flow, and conservation. Greenhouse gases affect the atmospheric optical depth for infrared radiation, and increased opacity implies higher altitude from which earth's equivalent bulk heat loss takes place. Such an increase is seen in the reanalyses, and the outgoing long-wave radiation has become more diffuse over time, consistent with an increased influence of greenhouse gases on the vertical energy flow from the surface to the top of the atmosphere. The reanalyses further imply increases in the overturning in the troposphere, consistent with a constant and continuous vertical energy flow. The increased overturning can explain a slowdown in the global warming, and the association between these aspects can be interpreted as an entanglement between the greenhouse effect and the hydrological cycle, where reduced energy transfer associated with increased opacity is compensated by tropospheric overturning activity.","[Benestad, Rasmus E.] Norwegian Meteorol Inst, POB 43 Blindern, N-0313 Oslo, Norway",Norwegian Meteorological Institute,"Benestad, RE (corresponding author), Norwegian Meteorol Inst, POB 43 Blindern, N-0313 Oslo, Norway.",rasmus.benestad@met.no,"Benestad, Rasmus E./I-3156-2019","Benestad, Rasmus E./0000-0002-5969-4508",Norwegian Meteorological Institute,Norwegian Meteorological Institute,"This work has been partly supported by the Norwegian Meteorological Institute as a means of enlightening the general public on climate change.

According to the state-of-the-art regional fire risk projections, in forthcoming decades climate effects are expected to become stronger and possibly overcome fire prevention efforts. However, significant uncertainties exist and the direct effect of climate change in regulating fuel moisture (e.g. warmer conditions increasing fuel dryness) could be counterbalanced by the indirect effects on fuel structure (e.g. warmer conditions limiting fuel amount), affecting the transition between climate-driven and fuel-limited fire regimes as temperatures increase. Here we analyse and model the impact of coincident drought and antecedent wet conditions (proxy for the climatic factor influencing total fuel and fine fuel structure) on the summer Burned Area (BA) across all eco-regions in Mediterranean Europe. This approach allows BA to be linked to the key drivers of fire in the region. We show a statistically significant relationship between fire and same-summer droughts in most regions, while antecedent climate conditions play a relatively minor role, except in few specific eco-regions. The presented models for individual eco-regions provide insights on the impacts of climate variability on BA, and appear to be promising for developing a seasonal forecast system supporting fire management strategies.","[Turco, Marco; Llasat, Maria Carmen] Univ Barcelona, Dept Appl Phys, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain; [Turco, Marco] Barcelona Supercomp Ctr, Earth Sci Dept, Barcelona 08028, Spain; [von Hardenberg, Jost] CNR, ISAC, I-10133 Turin, Italy; [AghaKouchak, Amir] Univ Calif Irvine, Ctr Hydrometeorol & Remote Sensing, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Provenzale, Antonello] CNR, Inst Geosci & Earth Resources IGG, I-56124 Pisa, Italy; [Trigo, Ricardo M.] Univ Lisbon, IDL, Fac Ciencias, P-1749016 Lisbon, Portugal",University of Barcelona; Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya; Barcelona Supercomputer Center (BSC-CNS); Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Scienze dell'Atmosfera e del Clima (ISAC-CNR); University of California System; University of California Irvine; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Geoscienze e Georisorse (IGG-CNR); Universidade de Lisboa,"Turco, M (corresponding author), Univ Barcelona, Dept Appl Phys, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain.;Turco, M (corresponding author), Barcelona Supercomp Ctr, Earth Sci Dept, Barcelona 08028, Spain.",turco.mrc@gmail.com,"Llasat, Maria Carmen/AAB-7873-2020; Turco, Marco/B-5814-2011; Trigo, Ricardo/Q-8391-2019; Trigo, Ricardo M/B-7044-2008","Llasat, Maria Carmen/0000-0001-8720-4193; Turco, Marco/0000-0001-8589-7459; Trigo, Ricardo/0000-0002-4183-9852; Trigo, Ricardo M/0000-0002-4183-9852; AghaKouchak, Amir/0000-0003-4689-8357","Project of Interest NextData of the Italian Ministry for Education, University and Research; EU H Project ECOPOTENTIAL: Improving Future Ecosystem Benefits through Earth Observations [641762]; IMDROFLOOD - Portuguese FCT [WaterJPI/0004/2014]","Project of Interest NextData of the Italian Ministry for Education, University and Research; EU H Project ECOPOTENTIAL: Improving Future Ecosystem Benefits through Earth Observations; IMDROFLOOD - Portuguese FCT","We thank the European Forest Fire Information System-EFFIS (http://effis.jrc.ec.europa.eu) of the European Commission Joint Research Centre for the fire data.

Sediment transport in a river basin is therefore a multifaceted field yet being a dynamic task in nature. It is characterized by high stochasticity, non-linearity, non-stationarity, and feature redundancy. Various artificial intelligence (AI) modeling frameworks have been introduced to solve river sediment problems. The present survey is designed to provide an updated account of the latest and most relevant AI-based applications for modeling the sediment transport in river basin systems. The review is established to capture the subsequent developments in the advanced AI models applied for river sediment transport prediction. Also, several hydrological and environmental aspects are identified and analyzed according to the results produced in those studies. The merits and constraints of the well-established AI models are further discussed in much detail, particularly considering state-of-the art, modeling frameworks and their application-specific appraisal, and some of the key proposed future research directions. Together with the synthesis of such information to drive a new understanding of models and methodologies related to suspended river sediment prediction, this review provides a future research vision for hydrologists, water scientists, water resource engineers, oceanography and environmental planners.","[Tao, Hai] Ankang Univ, Sch Elect & Informat Engn, Ankang, Peoples R China; [Tao, Hai] Baoji Univ Arts & Sci, Sch Comp Sci, Baoji, Peoples R China; [Tao, Hai] Univ Teknol MARA, Inst Big Data Analyt & Artificial Intelligent IBD, Shah Alam, Selangor, Malaysia; [Al-Khafaji, Zainab S.] Minist Oil, Al Furrat Al Awsat Distribut Fdn, Babylon, Iraq; [Al-Khafaji, Zainab S.] Islamic Univ, Coll Tech Engn, Dept Bldg & Construct Tech Engn, Najaf, Iraq; [Qi, Chongchong] Cent South Univ, Sch Resources & Safety Engn, Changsha, Peoples R China; [Zounemat-Kermani, Mohammad] Shahid Bahonar Univ Kerman, Dept Water Engn, Kerman, Iran; [Kisi, Ozgur] Ilia State Univ, Fac Nat Sci & Engn, Tbilisi, Georgia; [Tiyasha, Tiyasha] Ton Duc Thang Univ, Fac Civil Engn, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Chau, Kwok-Wing] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Hung Hom, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Nourani, Vahid] Univ Tabriz, Ctr Excellence Hydroinformat, Fac Civil Engn, Tabriz, Iran; [Nourani, Vahid] Near East Univ, Fac Civil & Environm Engn, Nicosia, North Cyprus, Turkey; [Melesse, Assefa M.] Florida Int Univ, Dept Earth & Environm, Miami, FL USA; [Elhakeem, Mohamed] Abu Dhabi Univ, Coll Engn, Dept Civil Engn, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates; [Elhakeem, Mohamed] Univ Tennessee, Coll Engn, Dept Civil Engn, Knoxville, TN USA; [Farooque, Aitazaz Ahsan] Univ Prince Edward Isl, Fac Sustainable Design Engn, Charlottetown, PE, Canada; [Farooque, Aitazaz Ahsan] Univ Prince Edward Isl, Sch Climate Change & Adaptat, Charlottetown, PE, Canada; [Pouyan Nejadhashemi, A.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Biosyst & Agr Engn, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Khedher, Khaled Mohamed] King Khalid Univ, Coll Engn, Dept Civil Engn, Abha, Saudi Arabia; [Khedher, Khaled Mohamed] Mrezgua Univ Campus, High Inst Technol Studies, Dept Civil Engn, Nabeul, Tunisia; [Alawi, Omer A.] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Sch Mech Engn, Dept Thermofluids, Skudai, Kagawa, Malaysia; [Deo, Ravinesh C.] Univ Southern Queensland, Sch Sci, Springfield, Qld, Australia; [Shahid, Shamsuddin] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Sch Civil Engn, Fac Engn, Skudai, Johor Bahru, Malaysia; [Singh, Vijay P.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Dept Biol & Agr Engn & Zachry, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Yaseen, Zaher Mundher] Al Ayen Univ, New Era & Dev Civil Engn Res Grp, Sci Res Ctr, Thi Qar, Iraq; [Yaseen, Zaher Mundher] Asia Univ, Coll Creat Design, Taichung, Taiwan",Ankang University; Baoji University of Arts & Sciences; Universiti Teknologi MARA; Islamic University College; Central South University; Shahid Bahonar University of Kerman (SBUK); Ilia State University; Ton Duc Thang University; Hong Kong Polytechnic University; University of Tabriz; Near East University; State University System of Florida; Florida International University; Abu Dhabi University; University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville; University of Prince Edward Island; University of Prince Edward Island; Michigan State University; King Khalid University; Universiti Teknologi Malaysia; University of Southern Queensland; Universiti Teknologi Malaysia; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Asia University Taiwan,"Yaseen, ZM (corresponding author), Al Ayen Univ, New Era & Dev Civil Engn Res Grp, Sci Res Ctr, Thi Qar, Iraq.;Yaseen, ZM (corresponding author), Asia Univ, Coll Creat Design, Taichung, Taiwan.",zaheryaseen88@gmail.com,"Chau, Kwok-wing/E-5235-2011; Al-khafaji, Zainab/AAJ-9429-2020; Tiyasha, Tiyasha/AAF-4836-2021; Hai, Tao/AFU-5851-2022; Yaseen, Zaher Mundher/G-7029-2018; Melesse, Assefa/F-9931-2013; Qi, Chongchong/K-1167-2019; SHAHID, SHAMSUDDIN/B-5185-2010; Alawi, Omer A./R-9720-2018","Chau, Kwok-wing/0000-0001-6457-161X; Al-khafaji, Zainab/0000-0002-5450-7312; Tiyasha, Tiyasha/0000-0003-2138-2100; Yaseen, Zaher Mundher/0000-0003-3647-7137; Melesse, Assefa/0000-0003-4724-9367; Qi, Chongchong/0000-0001-5189-1614; SHAHID, SHAMSUDDIN/0000-0001-9621-6452; Alawi, Omer A./0000-0002-8598-4461; Elhakeem, Mohamed/0000-0002-5753-7306; HAI, TAO/0000-0002-6156-1974; Kisi, Ozgur/0000-0001-7847-5872; Zounemat-Kermani, Mohammad/0000-0002-1421-8671",,,,,212,10,10,12,30,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1994-2060,1997-003X,,ENG APPL COMP FLUID,Eng.

The study finds this shift (including everything from ceramics to demographics to the appearance of petroglyphs and workstones) occurred during both heightened climatic instability and a population influx - likely of Arauquinoid groups from coastal South America.

The net-zero pledges announced to date across many countries and private industries are insufficient to achieve carbon neutrality, which requires implementation of far-reaching and significantly scaled-up climate-positive actions. All technology options that pertain to deep decarbonization and carbon removal must be part of the mitigation portfolio. Transformative action plans must be established in which every individual/organization around the globe is an actor of changes in relation to net-zero goals. Such plans must involve governmental policy support but also encourage voluntary efforts to boost innovations, investments, initiatives, and behavioral changes. Recognition of these efforts is made quantifiable with the concepts of carbon handprint and net positivity.This paper presents a carbon handprint perspective on characterizing the environmental benefits of hybrid energy systems (HESs)-a widely applicable solution to cleaner production leveraging the capabilities of a portfolio of low-carbon energy sources-that provide heat and electricity to industrial processes. First, the carbon handprint and net positivity concepts and their calculation approach are introduced. The state of the art of HES-enabled industrial cogeneration is then surveyed, and the greenhouse gas emission intensities of different energy sources that power HESs are compared. Next, drawing on a case study about a US chemical facility's voluntary initiative to explore replacing its fossil fuel-based cogeneration infrastructure with a clean energy-generated HES, several technically viable scenarios are evaluated-especially those with small modular nuclear reac-tors-to illustrate how the positive-thinking handprint approach helps encourage and inform the search for widespread influence pathways in pursuit of net-positive sustainability. Finally, current knowledge gaps in the case study are identified, and opportunities to scale up the proposed handprint-based analysis are outlined with consideration of an expanded role of HESs in fulfilling climate objectives.It is envisioned that like-minded decision makers in the industry sector and beyond will adopt this perspective and act synergistically to enhance their environmental stewardship through voluntary actions and make greater contributions to the planet's climate future.","[Zhao, Xingang; Huning, Alexander J.; Kropaczek, David J.; Pointer, W.

However, the LSMs embedded in state-of-the-art climate models differ in how they represent fundamental aspects of the hydrological and carbon cycles, resulting in large inter-model differences and sometimes faulty predictions. These third-generation LSMs respect the close coupling of the carbon and water cycles through plants, but otherwise tend to be under-constrained, and have not taken full advantage of robust hydrological parameterizations that were independently developed in offline models. Benchmarking, combining multiple sources of atmospheric, biospheric and hydrological data, should be a required component of LSM development, but this field has been relatively poorly supported and intermittently pursued. Moreover, benchmarking alone is not sufficient to ensure that models improve. Increasing complexity may increase realism but decrease reliability and robustness, by increasing the number of poorly known model parameters. In contrast, simplifying the representation of complex processes by stochastic parameterization (the representation of unresolved processes by statistical distributions of values) has been shown to improve model reliability and realism in both atmospheric and land-surface modelling contexts. We provide examples for important processes in hydrology (the generation of runoff and flow routing in heterogeneous catchments) and biology (carbon uptake by species-diverse ecosystems). We propose that the way forward for next-generation complex LSMs will include: (a) representations of biological and hydrological processes based on the implementation of multiple internal constraints; (b) systematic application of benchmarking and data assimilation techniques to optimize parameter values and thereby test the structural adequacy of models; and (c) stochastic parameterization of unresolved variability, applied in both the hydrological and the biological domains.","[Prentice, I.

The results show that the state-of-the-art CGCMs display a wide range of skill in simulating the interdecadal variability of ENSO. The 21 models can be categorized into three groups. The first group ( 8 models) shows an oscillation with a constant period shorter than the observed ENSO period, and sometimes with a constant amplitude. The second group ( 5 models) does not produce many statistically significant peaks in the ENSO frequency band, but usually produces one or two prominent peaks ( episodes) at period longer than 6 years. The third group ( 8 models) displays significant interdecadal variability of ENSO in both amplitude and period. Among them, only the MPI model reproduces the observed eastward shift of the westerly anomalies in the low-frequency regime.","NOAA, Climate Diagnost Ctr, ESRL, CIRES, Boulder, CO 80305 USA",National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Lin, JL (corresponding author), NOAA, Climate Diagnost Ctr, ESRL, CIRES, 325 Broadway,R PSD1, Boulder, CO 80305 USA.",jialin.lin@noaa.gov,,,,,,,19,56,58,0,6,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",0094-8276,1944-8007,,GEOPHYS RES LETT,Geophys.

Most study sites investigated the influence of one or several management practices on N2O exchange, such as nitrogen fertilization and grazing intensity. Fluxes were measured using non-steady state chambers at most sites, and alternative measurement techniques such as eddy covariance and fast-box using tunable diode laser spectroscopy were implemented at some sites. The overall uncertainty in annual flux estimates derived from chamber measurements may be as high as 50% due to the temporal and spatial variability in fluxes, which warrants the future use of continuous measurements, if possible at the field scale. Annual emission rates were higher from intensive than from extensive grasslands, by a factor 4 if grazed (1.77 versus 0.48 kg N2O-N ha(-1) year(-1)) and by a factor 3 if ungrazed (0.95 versus 0.32 kg N2O-N ha(-1) year(-1)). Annual emission factors for fertilized systems were highly variable, ranging from 0.01% to 3.56%. but the mean emission factor across all sites (0.75%) was substantially lower than the IPCC default value of 1.25%. Emission factors for individual fertilization events increased with soil temperature and were generally higher for water-filled pore space values in the range 60-90%, though precipitation onto dry soils was also shown to lead to high losses of N2O-N from applied fertilizer. An empirical, multiple regression model to predict N2O emission factors on the basis of soil temperature, moisture and rainfall is developed, explaining half of the variability in observed emission factors.

The objective of this review is to synthetize the current situation and the perspective of the restoration ecology in Mexico and the challenge of this area of research given the environmental conditions in our country. A review of different indicators as scientific publications, meetings, institutions, researchers and the offer of academic programs was carried out. This review resulted in a total of 206 articles from which 78% were research articles (1995-2016), 18% opinions or methodological proposals and 4% were meta-analyses. In 82% of the publications, the first authors were working at a Mexican institution and from them, 57% were men and 43% women. The studies on forest ecosystems represented 71% and the principal topic was the recovery of woody species. The evaluation showed that some indicators increased whereas other stayed constant. The results showed that the academic offer was not enough; the need of a national scientific policy of restoration and long-term sources of funding is discussed.

On decadal to multidecadal timescales, variability in these records is consistent with the null hypothesis that it arises from multivariate red noise (a multivariate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process) generated from a linear inverse model of tropical ocean-atmosphere dynamics. On centennial and longer timescales, both a last millennium simulation performed using the Community Climate System Model 4 (CCSM4) and the paleoclimate reconstructions have variability that is significantly stronger than the null hypothesis. However, the time series of the model and the reconstruction do not agree with each other. In the model, variability primarily reflects a thermodynamic response to reconstructed solar and volcanic activity, whereas in the reconstruction, variability arises from either internal climate processes, forced responses that differ from those in CCSM4, or nonclimatic proxy processes that are not yet understood. These findings imply that the response of the tropical Pacific to future forcings may be even more uncertain than portrayed by state-of-the-art models because there are potentially important sources of century-scale variability that these models do not simulate.","[Ault, T.

The method is the spectral nudging technique, which was applied to a state-of-the-art general circulation model (ECHAM6, T255L95). Large spatial scales of the global climate model prognostic variables were spectrally nudged toward a reanalysis dataset (NCEP-1, T62L28) for the past few decades. The main idea is the addition of dynamically consistent regional weather details to the coarse-grid NCEP-1 reanalysis. A large number of sensitivity experiments was performed, using different nudging e-folding times, vertical profiles, wavenumbers, and variables. Comparisons with observations and several reanalyses showed a high dependency on the variations of the nudging configuration. At the global scale, the accordance is very high for extratropical regions and lower in the tropics. A wavenumber truncation of 30, a relatively short e-folding time of 50min, and a plateau-shaped nudging profile applied only to divergence and vorticity generally yielded the best results. This is one of the first global spectral nudging hindcast studies and the first applying an altitude-dependent profile to selected prognostic variables. The method can be applied to reconstructing the history of extreme events such as intense storms within the context of ongoing climate change.","[Schubert-Frisius, Martina; Feser, Frauke; von Storch, Hans] Helmholtz Ctr Geesthacht, Inst Coastal Res, Geesthacht, Germany; [Rast, Sebastian] Max Planck Inst Meteorol, Hamburg, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Zentrum Geesthacht - Zentrum fur Material- und Kustenforschung; Max Planck Society,"Schubert-Frisius, M (corresponding author), Helmholtz Ctr Geesthacht, Inst Coastal Res, Geesthacht, Germany.",martina.schubert-frisius@hzg.de,"Feser, Frauke/C-1605-2014; von Storch, Hans/J-4165-2012","Feser, Frauke/0000-0002-0252-468X; von Storch, Hans/0000-0002-5825-8069","Cluster of Excellence CliSAP'', Universitat Hamburg through the German Research Foundation (DFG) [EXC177]; Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)","Cluster of Excellence CliSAP'', Universitat Hamburg through the German Research Foundation (DFG); Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF))","Work was supported through the Cluster of Excellence CliSAP'' (EXC177), Universitat Hamburg, funded through the German Research Foundation (DFG).

However, the sensitivity of the lapse rate to climate change is uncertain because of poor constraints on high-elevation temperature during past climate states. We present a 25,000-year temperature reconstruction from Mount Kenya, East Africa, which demonstrates that cooling during the Last Glacial Maximum was amplified with elevation and hence that the lapse rate was significantly steeper than today. Comparison of our data with paleoclimate simulations indicates that state-of-the-art models underestimate this lapse-rate change. Consequently, future high-elevation tropical warming may be even greater than predicted.","[Loomis, Shannon E.; Russell, James M.] Brown Univ, Dept Earth Environm & Planetary Sci, 324 Brook St,Box 1846, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Russell, James M.] Brown Univ, Inst Brown Environm & Soc, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Verschuren, Dirk; De Cort, Gijs; Eggermont, Hilde] Univ Ghent, Dept Biol, Limnol Unit, KL Ledeganckstr 35, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Morrill, Carrie] Univ Colorado Boulder, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Boulder, CO 80305 USA; [Morrill, Carrie] NOAA, Natl Ctr Environm Informat, Boulder, CO 80305 USA; [De Cort, Gijs] Royal Museum Cent Africa, Dept Earth Sci, Leuvensesteenweg 13, B-3080 Tervuren, Belgium; [Damste, Jaap S.

However, affordability and intermittency of renewable generation are still the main obstacles for firms to power their operations using wind and solar energy. Aggregate production planning models that incorporate onsite renewable energy (APPMs-RE) are the state-of-the-art to facilitate renewable adoption. A large number of APPMs are available in the literature, but renewables-based APPMs are still inadequately investigated. This paper proposes a novel APPM-RE because it optimizes wide-ranging RE decisions such as microgrid capacity, energy storage, prosumer energy transactions, and demand response along with production, machine usage, and workforce levels to minimize cost. The model is a two-stage stochastic program considering uncertainties in product demand, labor and machine capacity, and power gen-eration. The research goals are to (1) investigate the feasibility of decarbonizing the production, transportation, and warehousing operations, (2) examine the system affordability under practical hourly load requirements, (3) assess the cost-benefit of a prosumer energy transaction mechanism (PETM), (4) identify the effect in cost and microgrid capacity of time-of-use tariff, and (5) demonstrate the suitability of a two-stage stochastic program-ming model. The numerical experiments relying on climate analytics of six U.S. cities represent a broad scope of climate conditions. The managerial insights derived from this study are: (1) renewable microgrids with PETM may attain net-zero carbon operations with an affordable levelized cost of energy, and (2) time-of-use stimulates more adoption of solar generation than the flat rate.","[Islam, Sayed Rezwanul; Novoa, Clara; Jin, Tongdan] Texas State Univ, Ingram Sch Engn, San Marcos, TX 78666 USA",Texas State University System; Texas State University San Marcos,"Novoa, C (corresponding author), Texas State Univ, Ingram Sch Engn, San Marcos, TX 78666 USA.",cn17@txstate.edu,,"Novoa, Clara/0000-0001-8502-5335",National Science Foundation under CBET [1704933],National Science Foundation under CBET,This work is supported by the National Science Foundation under CBET grant No. 1704933.,,35,2,2,3,3,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0959-6526,1879-1786,,J CLEAN PROD,J.

The safety validation and vehicle type approval process of ADS are seen as the biggest challenges for the automotive stakeholders today. Considering a variety of existingwhite papers, standardization activities and regulatory approaches, manufacturers still struggle with selecting best practices that stay aligned with their Safety Management System and Safety Culture. A step forward would be to implement a harmonized and global safety assurance scheme that is compliant with relevant regulations, standards, and reflects locally accepted behavioural laws. This will ensure a common understanding of the safety and build needed trust around ADS. Today many communities (regulatory bodies, local authorities, industrial stakeholders, and academia) work on proof-of-concept framework for the Safety Argumentation as an answer to this problem. Unfortunately, there is still no consensus on one definitive methodology and a set of safety metrics to measure ADS safety.

We show that state-of-art model forecast skill 3 + 4 weeks ahead is systematically lower over land than ocean, which is matched by a similar land-ocean contrast in the spatial scales of observed biweekly rainfall anomalies. Regional differences in predictability are then interpreted using observed characteristics of daily rainfall (wet-patch size, mean intensity as well as the strength of local S2S modes of rainfall variation), and classified into six S2S predictability types. Both forecast skill and spatial scales are reduced over the continents, either because daily rainfall patches are small and poorly organized by S2S modes of variation (as over equatorial and northern tropical Africa), or where the daily mean intensity is very high (as over South and SE Asia). Forecast skill and spatial scales are largest where daily rainfall is synchronized by intraseasonal (such as the Madden-Julian Oscillation) as well as interannual ocean-atmosphere modes of variation (such as El Nino-Southern Oscillation), especially over northern Australia and parts of the Maritime Continent, and over parts of eastern, southern Africa and northeast South America. The oceans exhibit the highest skill and largest spatial scales, especially where interannual (central equatorial Pacific) or intraseasonal (central and eastern Tropical Indian Ocean and Western Pacific) variability is largest. These results provide a relevant regional typology of the potential drivers and controls on S2S predictability of tropical rainfall, informing intrinsic limits and possible improvements toward useful S2S climate prediction at regional scale.","[Moron, Vincent] Aix Marseille Univ, Coll France, CEREGE, INRAE,IRD,CNRS, Aix En Provence, France; [Moron, Vincent; Robertson, Andrew W.] Columbia Univ, IRI, Palisades, NY 10964 USA",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); INRAE; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); UDICE-French Research Universities; Aix-Marseille Universite; PSL Research University Paris; College de France; Columbia University,"Moron, V (corresponding author), Aix Marseille Univ, Coll France, CEREGE, INRAE,IRD,CNRS, Aix En Provence, France.;Moron, V (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, IRI, Palisades, NY 10964 USA.",moron@cerege.fr,"Moron, Vincent/ABI-5722-2020","Moron, Vincent/0000-0002-4981-9530",Columbia University's Center for Climate and Life; Aix-Marseille University under the FIR (Fonds Incitatif pour la Recherche)-2018 contract,Columbia University's Center for Climate and Life; Aix-Marseille University under the FIR (Fonds Incitatif pour la Recherche)-2018 contract,"A.W.R. acknowledges the support of a fellowship from Columbia University's Center for Climate and Life.

This model embeds a terrestrial biogeochemical component with explicit carbon-nitrogen interaction to account for soil nutrient control on plant growth and the land carbon sink. The model's ocean biogeochemical component is largely updated to simulate the biogeochemical cycles of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, iron, and oxygen such that oceanic primary productivity can be controlled by multiple nutrient limitations. The ocean nitrogen cycle is coupled with the land component via river discharge processes, and external inputs of iron from pyrogenic and lithogenic sources are considered. Comparison of a historical simulation with observation studies showed that the model could reproduce the transient global climate change and carbon cycle as well as the observed large-scale spatial patterns of the land carbon cycle and upper-ocean biogeochemistry. The model demonstrated historical human perturbation of the nitrogen cycle through land use and agriculture and simulated the resultant impact on the terrestrial carbon cycle. Sensitivity analyses under preindustrial conditions revealed that the simulated ocean biogeochemistry could be altered regionally (and substantially) by nutrient input from the atmosphere and rivers. Based on an idealized experiment in which CO2 was prescribed to increase at a rate of 1% yr(-1), the transient climate response (TCR) is estimated to be 1.5 K, i.e., approximately 70% of that from our previous ESM used in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). The cumulative airborne fraction (AF) is also reduced by 15% because of the intensified land carbon sink, which results in an airborne fraction close to the multimodel mean of the CMIP5 ESMs. The transient climate response to cumulative carbon emissions (TCRE) is 1.3KEgC(-1), i.e., slightly smaller than the average of the CMIP5 ESMs, which suggests that optimistic future climate projections will be made by the model. This model and the simulation results contribute to CMIP6. The MIROC-ES2L could further improve our understanding of climate-biogeochemical interaction mechanisms, projections of future environmental changes, and exploration of our future options regarding sustainable development by evolving the processes of climate, biogeochemistry, and human activities in a holistic and interactive manner.","[Hajima, Tomohiro; Watanabe, Michio; Yamamoto, Akitomo; Tatebe, Hiroaki; Noguchi, Maki A.; Abe, Manabu; Ohgaito, Rumi; Ito, Akinori; Okajima, Hideki; Ito, Akihiko; Ogochi, Koji; Watanabe, Shingo; Kawamiya, Michio] Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, Res Inst Global Change, Kanazawa Ku, 3173-25 Showamachi, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2360001, Japan; [Yamazaki, Dai] Univ Tokyo, Inst Ind Sci, Tokyo 1538505, Japan; [Ito, Akihiko; Takata, Kumiko] Natl Inst Environm Studies, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058506, Japan; [Takata, Kumiko] Azabu Univ, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Sagamihara, Kanagawa 2525201, Japan",Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science & Technology (JAMSTEC); University of Tokyo; National Institute for Environmental Studies - Japan; Azabu University,"Hajima, T (corresponding author), Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, Res Inst Global Change, Kanazawa Ku, 3173-25 Showamachi, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2360001, Japan.",hajima@jamstec.go.jp,"Abe, Manabu/A-9221-2008; Watanabe, Michio/R-1149-2019; Ito, Akihiko/P-2624-2017; Ito, Akinori/M-9599-2014; Yamazaki, Dai/J-3029-2012; Watanabe, Shingo/L-9689-2014; Kawamiya, Michio/GPS-7720-2022; Yamamoto, Akitomo/F-2488-2013; Yamamoto, Akitomo/S-2759-2019","Watanabe, Michio/0000-0003-2563-7297; Ito, Akihiko/0000-0001-5265-0791; Ito, Akinori/0000-0002-4937-2927; Yamazaki, Dai/0000-0002-6478-1841; Watanabe, Shingo/0000-0002-2228-0088; Yamamoto, Akitomo/0000-0003-0314-4854; Yamamoto, Akitomo/0000-0003-0314-4854; Ohgaito, Rumi/0000-0002-5717-1594; tatebe, hiroaki/0000-0002-2265-5847; Abe, Manabu/0000-0002-4822-3321","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) of Japan [JPMXD0717935715]; JSPS KAKENHI [17K12820]","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) of Japan(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This research has been supported by the The Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) of Japan (Integrated Research Program for Advancing Climate Models (grant no.

Here we use tree ring-based temperature reconstructions and state-of-the-art climate model simulations to assess temporal changes in Northern Hemisphere intercontinental temperature covariance during the last 1000 years. Tree ring-only approaches reveal stronger agreement with model simulations compared to multiproxy networks. Although simulated temperatures exhibit a substantial spread among individual models, intercontinental temperature coherency is mainly driven by the cooling of large volcanic eruptions in 1257, 1452, 1600, and 1815 Common Era. The coherence of these synchronizing events appears to be elevated in several climate simulations relative to their own unforced covariance baselines and in comparison to the proxy reconstructions. This suggests that some models likely overestimate the amplitude of abrupt summer cooling in response to volcanic eruptions, particularly at larger spatial scales.","[Hartl-Meier, C. T.

This article has been done to evaluate the thermal behavior of the pond roof in optimizing the energy consumption of residential buildings in Yazd with hot and dry climate and also compared the results of other studies on the proper height of the water layer on the pond roof and its comparison with green roof. The research method is quantitative, and library and documentary studies have been used to complete the literature. This study was aimed at investigating the effect of factors affecting the thermal performance of roof pond systems, such as water height on the annual energy consumption, and evaluating the sustainability and efficiency of using roof pond systems in the hot and dry climate of Yazd City. Design Builder software is the energy simulator program used in this study. First, using energy simulator software (Design Builder), the effect of green roof with different bed layers and pond roof with different water heights on the annual energy consumption of a residential building in Yazd w investigated. It also calculates the cooling and heating load based on the ASHRAE standard using the heat balance used in Energy Plus. The results show that with increasing water layer height, the building better performance in energy efficiency. Evaluating the height of the water layer 5-15-25-35-45-55-65 cm respectively 7.77%, 8.11%, 8.54%, 8.91%, 9.15%, 9.53%, 9.86% in annual energy consumption in the simulated residential sample has been saved and also compared to conventional roof has about 86% less heat transfer and compared to green roof about 11 times in optimizing annual heating energy and about 1.4 times in optimizing annual cooling energy and about. It has 1.8 times better thermal performance in annual energy consumption, and by examining the amount of water consumption for storage with gray water regeneration and also the optimal thermal performance of the closed roof pond with fixed insulation cover, the appropriate height of the pond was determined to be about 30 cm.","[Kheili, Mehdi Goleh; Nikghadam, Niloufar] Islamic Azad Univ, Fac Art & Architecture, South Tehran Branch, Architecture, Tehran, Iran; [Shemirani, Seyed Majid Mofidi] Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Architecture & Urban Design, Architecture, Tehran, Iran",Islamic Azad University,"Nikghadam, N (corresponding author), Islamic Azad Univ, Fac Art & Architecture, South Tehran Branch, Architecture, Tehran, Iran.",m.goleh@yahoo.com; n_nikghadam@azad.ac.ir,,,,,,,47,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",2363-6203,2363-6211,,MODEL EARTH SYST ENV,Model.

However, here it is shown that when forced by SST alone, most state-of-the-art climate models do not reproduce a statistically significant upward trend in Sahelian precipitation over the last 30 years and that those models with a significant upward trend in rainfall seem to achieve this result for disparate reasons. Here the role of the Saharan heat low (SHL) in the recovery from the Sahelian drought of the 1980s is examined. Using observations and reanalyses, it is demonstrated that there has been an upward trend in SHL temperature that is coincident with the drought recovery. A heat and moisture budget analysis of the SHL suggests that the rise in temperature is due to greenhouse warming by water vapor, but that changes in water vapor are strongly dependent upon the temperature of the SHL: a process termed the Saharan water vapor-temperature (SWAT) feedback. It is shown that the structure of the drought recovery is consistent with a warming SHL and is evidence of a fundamental, but not exclusive, role for the SHL in the recent increase in Sahelian monsoon rainfall.","[Evan, Amato T.; Flamant, Cyrille; Kocha, Cecile] CNRS, Lab Atmosphere, Paris, France; [Evan, Amato T.; Flamant, Cyrille; Kocha, Cecile] Univ Paris 06, Paris, France; [Evan, Amato T.] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Lavaysse, Christophe] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [Saci, Azzedine] Off Natl Meteorol, Algiers, Dar El Beida, Algeria",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Cite; UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; University of California System; University of California San Diego; Scripps Institution of Oceanography; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA,"Evan, AT (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, 8622 Kennel Way, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",aevan@ucsd.edu,"Lavaysse, Christophe/X-1650-2019; Evan, Amato/GZL-2684-2022","Evan, Amato/0000-0003-2812-3750",French Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) [ANR-10-LABX-18-01]; Laboratoire d'excellence Institute Pierre Simon Laplace (L-IPSL); Research in Paris programme; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Climate Program Office Grant [NA11OAR4310157],French Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)(French National Research Agency (ANR)); Laboratoire d'excellence Institute Pierre Simon Laplace (L-IPSL); Research in Paris programme; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Climate Program Office Grant,"We thank four anonymous reviewers and the editor for their constructive and helpful comments on previous versions of this manuscript.

In this study, we found that the influence from climate variability in the Atlantic is of equal importance. Application of a state-of-the-art causality analysis reveals that the Atlantic meridional mode (AMM), Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO) and north tropical Atlantic (NTA) sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies are all causal to the Australian region TCG frequency. The associated physical mechanisms are investigated as well. Based on this causal analysis and inference, a statistical model is constructed to forecast TCG, using the Poisson regression and the step-by-step predictor selection method. The Atlantic causal factors, after being taken in as new predictors, help increase the forecast skill for the seasonal Australian region TCG by as much as 10% in terms of correlation increase and 40% in terms of root-mean-square error reduction.","[Zhang, Shuo; Ma, Ming; Chen, Jian; Bai, Chengzu] Beijing Inst Appl Meteorol, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Shuo; Ma, Ming; Chen, Jian; Bai, Chengzu] State Key Lab Geoinformat Engn, Xian 710054, Peoples R China; [Li, Ming] Natl Univ Def Technol, Coll Meteorol & Oceanog, Changsha 410073, Peoples R China",National University of Defense Technology - China,"Bai, CZ (corresponding author), Beijing Inst Appl Meteorol, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.;Bai, CZ (corresponding author), State Key Lab Geoinformat Engn, Xian 710054, Peoples R China.",baiczu@163.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [42106200],National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC, 42106200).",,46,0,0,4,4,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0930-7575,1432-0894,,CLIM DYNAM,Clim.

It is thus important to quantify changes in the Amazonian rainfall and clarify its mechanism. Previous studies indicate that the interannual variability of Amazonian precipitation could be largely attributed to variabilities in the South American monsoon system and the El Nino Southern Oscillation. However, the trend of the wet season tropical Amazonian precipitation during recent decades is not very well investigated. In this study, by combining both satellite and in situ observations, it is revealed that tropical Amazonian precipitation has significantly increased by similar to 180 to 600 mm (in different datasets) in the wet season during the satellite era from 1979 to 2015. We then use a state-of-the-art atmospheric model to simulate the impact of the tropical sea surface temperatures (SSTs) on the precipitation changes. Results show that the multidecadal warming of the tropical Atlantic has contributed more than half of this precipitation change over the past three decades, while the east Pacific cooling plays a secondary role. We finally combine the simulation results and the reanalysis data to investigate the mechanisms of this process, i.e. the SST variability dramatically increases the convergence of the moisture transport over the Amazon region. The precipitation changes over the Amazon region largely impact on the local hydrological cycle and the ecosystem, and have important impacts on the global climate system by mediating the teleconnection between the Pacific and the Atlantic oceans. Our results show that the long-term change in the wet season Amazonian precipitation is important and deserves further investigation and discussion.","[Wang, Xin-Yue; Li, Xichen; Zhu, Jiang] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, ICCES, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Jiang] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Tanajura, Clemente A.

In order to parameterize the production of water vapor (H2O) from CH4 oxidation, it is often assumed that the oxidation of one CH4 molecule yields exactly two molecules of H2O. However, this assumption is based on an early study, which also gives evidence that this is not true at all altitudes. In the current study, we re-evaluate this assumption with a comprehensive systematic analysis using a stateof- the-art chemistry-climate model (CCM), namely the ECHAM/MESSy Atmospheric Chemistry (EMAC) model, and present three approaches to investigate the yield of H2O and hydrogen gas (H-2) from CH4 oxidation. We thereby make use of the Module Efficiently Calculating the Chemistry of the Atmosphere (MECCA) in a box model and global model configuration. Furthermore, we use the kinetic chemistry tagging technique (MECCA-TAG) to investigate the chemical pathways between CH4, H2O and H-2, by being able to distinguish hydrogen atoms produced by CH4 from H-2 from other sources. We apply three approaches, which all agree that assuming a yield of 2 overestimates the production of H2O in the lower stratosphere (calculated as 1.5-1.7). Additionally, transport and subsequent photochemical processing of longer-lived intermediates (mostly H-2) raise the local yield values in the upper stratosphere and lower mesosphere above 2 (maximum > 2.2). In the middle and upper mesosphere, the influence of loss and recycling of H2O increases, making it a crucial factor in the parameterization of the yield of H2O from CH4 oxidation. An additional sensitivity study with the Chemistry As A Boxmodel Application (CAABA) shows a dependence of the yield on the hydroxyl radical (OH) abundance. No significant temperature dependence is found. We focus representatively on the tropical zone between 23 degrees S and 23 degrees N. It is found in the global approach that presented results are mostly valid for midlatitudes as well. During the polar night, the method is not applicable. Our conclusions question the use of a constant yield of H2O from CH4 oxidation in climate modeling and encourage to apply comprehensive parameterizations that follow the vertical profiles of the H2O yield derived here and take the chemical H2O loss into account.","[Frank, Franziska; Joeckel, Patrick; Dameris, Martin] Deutsch Zentrum Luft & Raumfahrt DLR, Inst Phys Atmosphare, Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany; [Gromov, Sergey] Max Planck Inst Chem, Air Chem Dept, Mainz, Germany; [Gromov, Sergey] Inst Global Climate & Ecol Roshydromet, Moscow, Russia; [Gromov, Sergey] RAS, IGCE, Moscow, Russia",Helmholtz Association; German Aerospace Centre (DLR); Max Planck Society; Russian Academy of Sciences,"Frank, F (corresponding author), Deutsch Zentrum Luft & Raumfahrt DLR, Inst Phys Atmosphare, Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany.",franziska.frank@dlr.de,"Gromov, Sergey/G-1224-2013; Jöckel, Patrick/C-3687-2009; Winterstein, Franziska/ABG-4964-2020","Gromov, Sergey/0000-0002-2542-3005; Jöckel, Patrick/0000-0002-8964-1394; Winterstein, Franziska/0000-0002-2406-4936; Dameris, Martin/0000-0001-6700-0628","DLR internal project KliSAW (Klimarelevanz von atmospharischen Spurengasen, Aerosolen und Wolken); Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung (BMBF)","DLR internal project KliSAW (Klimarelevanz von atmospharischen Spurengasen, Aerosolen und Wolken); Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF))","We acknowledge the DLR internal project KliSAW (Klimarelevanz von atmospharischen Spurengasen, Aerosolen und Wolken), which provided the financial basis for the presented study.; The model simulations have been performed at the German Climate Computing Centre (DKRZ) through support from the Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung (BMBF).",,40,12,12,0,10,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1680-7316,1680-7324,,ATMOS CHEM PHYS,Atmos.

Consequently, a process-based model of individual tree growth driven by meteorology was developed. The model, Forest v5.1 predicts the growth of deciduous and coniferous species for the Great Lakes Region of North America. The model uses a daily time step and was written with two overriding design tenets in mind: (i) model drivers must mimic controls on plant growth as they exist in nature and (ii) model initialization must be achievable through the use of typical forest inventory field plot data. Forest v5.1 predicts the carbon, nutrient and water cycle as these influence tree growth and with particular emphasis on light interception and assimilation. Model outputs are both in dimension as well as biomass. Sensitivity analysis shows the importance of parameters that characterize maximum photosynthetic potential and scaling factors. A comparison of observed and predicted growth trajectories for 25 years indicates tree diameter development exhibits useful levels of precision (-0.12 to 0.11 cm year(-1)) relative to an empirical model. The model, using HadCM2-generated weather, projects that water use efficiency will increase as a result of climate change. Net basal area increment increases on average by 0.17 m(2) ha(-1) year(-1) relative to a projection of current climate. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

J,"Gumo, S",,,,"Gumo, Sussy",,,Praying for Rain: Indigenous Systems of Rainmaking in Kenya,ECUMENICAL REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,CLIMATE-CHANGE,"Africa in general and Kenya in particular are facing climate change challenges. Since most Kenyan communities depend on agriculture as the backbone of the economy for sustenance, some of these, including the Abanyore, Akamba, Ameru, Turkana, and Maasai, have been involved in the practice of rainmaking rituals. They use African traditional indigenous knowledge embedded in African religion to pray for rain by predicting, causing, redirecting, and controlling rain within their locality. The role of rainmaking and its effects is therefore crucial. The purpose of this contribution is to examine the indigenous systems of rainmaking in Kenya. It situationally analyzes the art of rainmaking in Africa in general and further contextually examines rainmaking rituals among three Kenyan communities. It suggests that rainmaking is performed as an expression of African religion through communal ceremonies, and further notes that indigenous knowledge in rainmaking rituals is significant in helping local communities respond to climate changes, allowing them to execute this knowledge in mitigation or adaptation of climate challenges. The article concludes that local communities need to integrate both indigenous knowledge and scientific knowledge to forecast and dispel rainfall patterns to effectively predict weather patterns.","[Gumo, Sussy] Maseno Univ, Sch Arts & Social Sci, Dept Relig Theol & Philosophy, Relig, Kisumu, Kenya",Maseno University,"Gumo, S (corresponding author), Maseno Univ, Sch Arts & Social Sci, Dept Relig Theol & Philosophy, Relig, Kisumu, Kenya.",,,,,,,,27,6,6,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0796,1758-6623,,ECUMENICAL REV,Ecumen.

Based on the historical simulations in the phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5), we identify that state-of-the-art CGCMs commonly simulate insufficient Indian summer monsoon (ISM) rainfall along with too weak monsoon circulations. Such ISM rainfall/circulation biases, however, are absent in the Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project simulations forced by observed sea surface temperature (SST), suggesting that the common ISM biases are not intrinsic errors of the atmospheric models but arise from the interaction between the monsoon and the oceans. A multimodel statistical analysis further shows that the ISM rainfall/circulation biases in CMIP5 models can be traced back to the excessively cold SST over the northern Indian Ocean (NIO). The systemic cold SST biases in the NIO suppress local convective activity and reduce air temperature, resulting in a weak north-south thermal contrast in the mid-upper troposphere. This would induce an excessively weak ISM circulation and resultant insufficient monsoon rainfall. Furthermore, the dynamic effect of cold NIO SST biases on the ISM rainfall/circulation simulations is also confirmed through several sensitivity experiments by using the widely-applied Weather Research and Forecasting model. To the extent that the cold SST biases over the NIO may originate from an excessively strong Indian winter monsoon, improving the winter monsoon simulation is an important prerequisite for better summer climate simulations and predictions/projections over the broad ISM region.","[Wang, Ziqian; Yang, Song] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Atmospher Sci, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Wang, Ziqian; Yang, Song] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Climate Change & Nat Disas, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Li, Gen] Hohai Univ, Coll Oceanog, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Sun Yat Sen University; Sun Yat Sen University; Hohai University,"Li, G (corresponding author), Hohai Univ, Coll Oceanog, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",ligen@hhu.edu.cn,,,"National Key Scientific Research Plan of China [2014CB953900]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41605038, 41661144019, 41690123, 41406026]; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province [2015A030310224]; Guangzhou Joint Research Center for Atmospheric Sciences of CMA; Guangdong Natural Science Funds for Distinguished Young Scholar [2015A030306008]; Youth Innovation Promotion Association CAS; Pearl River S&T Nova Program of Guangzhou [201506010094]; Open Project Program of State Key Laboratory of Tropical Oceanography [LTOZZ1603]",National Key Scientific Research Plan of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province(National Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province); Guangzhou Joint Research Center for Atmospheric Sciences of CMA; Guangdong Natural Science Funds for Distinguished Young Scholar; Youth Innovation Promotion Association CAS; Pearl River S&T Nova Program of Guangzhou; Open Project Program of State Key Laboratory of Tropical Oceanography,"This work was supported jointly by the National Key Scientific Research Plan of China (Grant 2014CB953900), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grants 41605038, 41661144019, 41690123, and 41406026), the Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province (Grant 2015A030310224), the Guangzhou Joint Research Center for Atmospheric Sciences of CMA, the Guangdong Natural Science Funds for Distinguished Young Scholar (2015A030306008), the Youth Innovation Promotion Association CAS, the Pearl River S&T Nova Program of Guangzhou (201506010094), and the Open Project Program of State Key Laboratory of Tropical Oceanography (LTOZZ1603).",,46,20,20,3,17,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0930-7575,1432-0894,,CLIM DYNAM,Clim.

In this context, the southwestern Italian Peninsula is a key area to study mammal adaptation to past environmental changes. One of the key localities in this region is the Grotta del Romito, an archaeological site that bears one of the most important Late Palaeolithic and Mesolithic sequences in Europe. To understand the faunal dynamics in the region during this period, we studied the large and small mammal sequences coming from the deposit investigated in the Rock shelter area using environment and climate reconstruction methods such as Habitat Weighting, Bioclimatic model, and Quantified Ecology. In the lower part of the sequence, the large mammals are dominated by Capra ibex, Cervus elaphus, and Capreolus capreolus, while the upper portion is dominated by C. elaphus, Sus scrofa, and C. capreolus. This change is also visible among small mammals, where a high biodiversity is registered in the lower units, while Glis glis is dominant in the upper sequence. The environmental reconstructions show a trend from a starting condition where grasslands and rocky landscapes were widespread to another where forests were the dominant biome in the area. The climate results show an increase in temperatures, even though there are some incongruities among the models used. We correlated the Grotta del Romito - Rock shelter sequence to the major oscillations in climatic and environmental conditions detected in other proxies during the passage between the Late Pleistocene and the Holocene; the results allowed us to detect a first warming oscillation (STR 7-7D to STR 6A-6B), which can be related to the Bolling-Allerod Interstadial. A relatively mild and quick change in favour of open environments, together with a drop in diversity species and index, was tentatively correlated with the passage between the Younger Dryas and the Preboreal (STR 4B-4C and 4-4A). The sequence ends with STR 3, related to the Early Holocene, where forested habitats were dominant. The disappearance of environments suitable for Capra ibex may have led to the progressive extirpation of this species from the southwestern Italian Peninsula.

Floods can bring pathogens into homes and cause lingering damp and microbial growth in buildings, with the level of growth and persistence dependent on the volume and chemical and biological content of the flood water, the properties of the contaminating microbes, and the surrounding environmental conditions, including the restoration time and methods, the heat and moisture transport properties of the envelope design, and the ability of the construction material to sustain the microbial growth. The public health risk will depend on the interaction of these complex processes and the vulnerability and susceptibility of occupants in the affected areas. After the 2007 floods in the UK, the Pitt review noted that there is lack of relevant scientific evidence and consistency with regard to the management and treatment of flooded homes, which not only put the local population at risk but also caused unnecessary delays in the restoration effort. Understanding the drying behaviour of flooded buildings in the UK building stock under different scenarios, and the ability of microbial contaminants to grow, persist, and produce toxins within these buildings can help inform recovery efforts. To contribute to future flood management, this paper proposes the use of building simulations and biological models to predict the risk of microbial contamination in typical UK buildings. We review the state of the art with regard to biological contamination following flooding, relevant building simulation, simulation-linked microbial modelling, and current practical considerations in flood remediation. Using the city of London as an example, a methodology is proposed that uses GIS as a platform to integrate drying models and microbial risk models with the local building stock and flood models. The integrated tool will help local governments, health authorities, insurance companies and residents to better understand, prepare for and manage a large-scale flood in urban environments.

Towards achieving this, the use of computational intelligence and behaviour based systems in particular multi-agent systems (MAS) have been proposed for use in building comfort and energy management systems (BECMS) to achieve energy savings as well as improved user satisfaction. However its application in BECMs of large commercial buildings is still very limited. This paper provides a survey of MAS frameworks existing in literature.

Demand-side management, considered as an essential part of the energy management system, can enable utility market operators to make better management decisions for energy trading between consumers and the operator. In this system, a priori knowledge about the energy load pattern can help reshape the load and cut the energy demand curve, thus allowing a better management and distribution of the energy in smart grid energy systems. Designing a computationally intelligent load forecasting (ILF) system is often a primary goal of energy demand management. This study explores the state of the art of computationally intelligent (i.e., machine learning) methods that are applied in load forecasting in terms of their classification and evaluation for sustainable operation of the overall energy management system. More than 50 research papers related to the subject identified in existing literature are classified into two categories: namely the single and the hybrid computational intelligence (CI)-based load forecasting technique. The advantages and disadvantages of each individual techniques also discussed to encapsulate them into the perspective into the energy management research. The identified methods have been further investigated by a qualitative analysis based on the accuracy of the prediction, which confirms the dominance of hybrid forecasting methods, which are often applied as metaheurstic algorithms considering the different optimization techniques over single model approaches. Based on extensive surveys, the review paper predicts a continuous future expansion of such literature on different CI approaches and their optimizations with both heuristic and metaheuristic methods used for energy load forecasting and their potential utilization in real-time smart energy management grids to address future challenges in energy demand management.","[Fallah, Seyedeh Narjes] Payame Noor Univ, Dept Comp, Tehran 19305, Iran; [Deo, Ravinesh Chand] Univ Southern Queensland, Inst Agr & Environm, Sch Agr Computat & Environm Sci, Int Ctr Appl Climate Sci, Springfield 4300, Australia; [Shojafar, Mohammad; Conti, Mauro] Univ Padua, Dept Math, Padua, Italy; [Shamshirband, Shahaboddin] Ton Duc Thang Univ, Dept Management Sci & Technol Dev, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Shamshirband, Shahaboddin] Ton Duc Thang Univ, Fac Informat Technol, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam",Payame Noor University; University of Southern Queensland; University of Padua; Ton Duc Thang University; Ton Duc Thang University,"Shamshirband, S (corresponding author), Ton Duc Thang Univ, Dept Management Sci & Technol Dev, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.;Shamshirband, S (corresponding author), Ton Duc Thang Univ, Fac Informat Technol, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.",S.narjes.f@gmail.com; Ravinesh.Deo@usq.edu.au; Shojafar@math.unipd.it; conti@math.unipd.it; shahaboddin.shamshirband@tdt.edu.vn,"Deo, Ravinesh/F-6157-2012; S.Band, Shahab/ABI-7388-2020; Conti, Mauro/F-9145-2012; Fallah, Seyedeh Narjes/M-9692-2019; S.Band, Shahab/AAD-3311-2021; Shojafar, Mohammad/C-9151-2013","Deo, Ravinesh/0000-0002-2290-6749; S.Band, Shahab/0000-0002-8963-731X; Conti, Mauro/0000-0002-3612-1934; Fallah, Seyedeh Narjes/0000-0003-2638-0585; Shojafar, Mohammad/0000-0003-3284-5086; Shamshirband, Shahaboddin/0000-0002-6605-498X",,,,,105,114,115,9,87,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1996-1073,,ENERGIES,Energies,MAR,2018,3,,,,,,596,10.3390/en11030596,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en11030596,,,31,Energy & Fuels,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Energy & Fuels,GA4MQ,,"gold, Green Submitted, Green Accepted",,,12/21/22,WOS:000428304300124,View Full Record in Web of Science

To identify the contributions of various feedback processes to the ENSO amplitude, we used the Bjerknes stability (BJ) index, which aims to quantify the main ENSO feedbacks from a linear perspective. To start, we demonstrated that the time-varying BJ index is highly correlated with the decadal changes in the standard deviation of the ENSO index, suggesting that it provides a good representation of the decadal modulation of the ENSO amplitude. We further revealed that this phenomenon can be attributed mainly to thermocline feedback changes, particularly changes in the oceanic response to zonal wind stress. In addition, two critical features of the background state were found to contribute significantly to changes in the equatorial thermocline feedback: 1) the subtropical-tropical cells and 2) ocean stratification. It was suggested that weak (strong) background subtropical meridional overturning circulation partly contributes to regulating the narrower (wider) meridional scales of the sea surface temperature and the associated zonal wind stress anomalies. The more stratified the ocean, the stronger ocean responses to a given wind stress forcing, which affects the ENSO amplitude.","[Kim, Geon-Il; Kug, Jong-Seong] Pohang Univ Sci & Technol, Div Environm Sci & Engn, Pohang, South Korea",Pohang University of Science & Technology (POSTECH),"Kug, JS (corresponding author), Pohang Univ Sci & Technol, Div Environm Sci & Engn, Pohang, South Korea.",jskug1@gmail.com,,"KUG, JONG-SEONG/0000-0003-2251-2579",National Research Foundation of South Korea [NRF-2018R1A5A1024958],National Research Foundation of South Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea),"Acknowledgments.

These pluvial conditions have been commonly explained for decades by a southward deflection of the jet stream by the Laurentide Ice Sheet. Here analysis of state-of-the-art coupled climate models shows that effects of the Laurentide Ice Sheet on the mean circulation were more important than storm track changes in generating wet conditions. Namely, strong cooling by the ice sheet significantly reduced humidity over land, increasing moisture advection in the westerlies due to steepened humidity gradients. Additionally, the removal of moisture from the atmosphere by mass divergence associated with the subtropical high was diminished at the Last Glacial Maximum compared to present. These same dynamic and thermodynamic factors, working in the opposite direction, are projected to cause regional drying in western North America under increased greenhouse gas concentrations, indicating continuity from past to future in the mechanisms altering hydroclimate.","[Morrill, Carrie] Univ Colorado, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Morrill, Carrie; Lowry, Daniel P.] NOAA, Natl Ctr Environm Informat, Boulder, CO 80305 USA; [Lowry, Daniel P.] Victoria Univ Wellington, Wellington, New Zealand; [Hoell, Andrew] NOAA, Phys Sci Div, Earth Syst Res Lab, Boulder, CO USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Victoria University Wellington; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Morrill, C (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.;Morrill, C (corresponding author), NOAA, Natl Ctr Environm Informat, Boulder, CO 80305 USA.",carrie.morrill@colorado.edu,,"Morrill, Carrie/0000-0002-1635-5469; Lowry, Daniel/0000-0002-9668-0850",NOAA Hollings Scholarship Program; NOAA Climate Program Office,NOAA Hollings Scholarship Program; NOAA Climate Program Office(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA),"We acknowledge the World Climate Research Programme's Working Group on Coupled Modeling and the Paleoclimate Modeling Intercomparison Project for CMIP/PMIP model output and NOAA/OAR/ESRL PSD for Livneh precipitation observations.

Microwave satellite data provide valuable humidity observations in the upper troposphere with global coverage. In this study, we compare upper tropospheric humidity (UTH) retrieved from the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit and the Microwave Humidity Sounder against radiosonde data measured at four of the central facilities of the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement program. The Atmospheric Radiative Transfer Simulator (ARTS) was used to simulate satellite brightness temperatures from the radiosonde profiles. Strong ice clouds were filtered out, as their influence on microwave measurements leads to incorrect UTH values. Day and night radiosonde profiles were analyzed separately to take into account the radiosonde radiation bias. The comparison between radiosonde and satellite is most meaningful for data in cloud-free, nighttime conditions and with a time difference of less than 2 hr. We found good agreement between the two data sets. The satellite data were slightly moister than the radiosonde data, with a mean difference of 1%-2.3% relative humidity (RH), depending on the radiosonde site. Monthly gridded data were also compared and showed a slightly larger mean difference of up to 3.3% RH, which can be explained by sampling issues.","[Moradi, Isaac; Buehler, Stefan A.; Eliasson, Salomon] Lulea Univ Technol, Satellite Atmospher Sci Grp, Dept Space Sci, IRV, S-98128 Kiruna, Sweden; [John, Viju O.] Met Off Hadley Ctr, Exeter EX1 3PB, Devon, England",Lulea University of Technology; Met Office - UK; Hadley Centre,"Moradi, I (corresponding author), Lulea Univ Technol, Satellite Atmospher Sci Grp, Dept Space Sci, IRV, Box 812, S-98128 Kiruna, Sweden.",isaac.moradi@ltu.se,"Eliasson, Salomon/ABH-5521-2020; John, Viju/S-6989-2019; Moradi, Isaac/A-7539-2008; John, Viju/A-4558-2008; Buehler, Stefan Alexander/A-4056-2009","Moradi, Isaac/0000-0003-2194-1427; Buehler, Stefan Alexander/0000-0001-6389-1160; Eliasson, Salomon/0000-0002-1391-961X; John, Viju/0000-0002-8640-8810","U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research, Climate and Environmental Sciences Division; U.K. Joint DECC and DEFRA Integrated Climate Programme-DECC/Defra [GA01101]; Swedish Space Board [48/09]; NERC [jwcrp01002] Funding Source: UKRI; Natural Environment Research Council [jwcrp01002] Funding Source: researchfish","U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research, Climate and Environmental Sciences Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); U.K. Joint DECC and DEFRA Integrated Climate Programme-DECC/Defra(Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA)); Swedish Space Board; NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC))","Radiosonde data were obtained from the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research, Climate and Environmental Sciences Division.

Trends in cloud properties and sea ice coverage during RILEs are compared with their secular trends between 2000 and 2049 during summer, autumn, and winter. The results suggest that clouds promote abrupt Arctic climate change during RILEs through increased (decreased) cloudiness in autumn (summer) relative to the changes over the first half of the 21st century. The trends in cloud characteristics (cloud amount, water content, and radiative forcing) during RILEs are most strongly and consistently an amplifying effect during autumn, the season in which RILEs account for the majority of the secular trends. The total cloud trends in every season are primarily due to low clouds, which show a more robust response than middle and high clouds across RILEs. Lead-lag correlations of monthly sea ice concentration and cloud cover during autumn reveal that the relationship between less ice and more clouds is enhanced during RILEs, but there is no evidence that either variable is leading the other. Given that Arctic cloud projections in CCSM3 are similar to those from other state-of-the-art GCMs and that observations show increased autumn cloudiness associated with the extreme 2007 and 2008 sea ice minima, this study suggests that the rapidly declining Arctic sea ice will be accentuated by changes in polar clouds.","[Vavrus, Steve] Univ Wisconsin, Ctr Climat Res, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Holland, Marika M.; Bailey, David A.] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Boulder, CO 80307 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA,"Vavrus, S (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Ctr Climat Res, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",sjvavrus@wisc.edu,,"Bailey, David/0000-0002-6584-0663; Holland, Marika/0000-0001-5621-8939","National Science Foundation [OPP-0327664, OPP-0612388, ARC-0628910, ARC-0652838]; NASA [NNG06GB26G]; UCAR",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); UCAR,"This study was supported by grants from the National Science Foundation (OPP-0327664, OPP-0612388, ARC-0628910, and ARC-0652838).

These processes will also affect the German energy system. Understanding and predicting the implications of these changes is one of the core elements of energy system analysis. To address this issue, herein, we present a structured and systematic review of literature within the intersection of industrial digitalization in the sense of Industry 4.0 and scientific energy system analysis. The goals of this study are (1) to reveal the locations and institutions of relevant experts and (2) to carve out the current state of the art with regard to technologies that enable (digitized) industries to interact with the energy system in order to contribute to a smart energy system. Our approach is based on a systematic and reproducible keyword search using the scientific literature database Scopus. Both a quantitative evaluation and a qualitative evaluation of the relevant literature are conducted. The quantitative results are presented using GIS-based visualizations. This facilitates us to identify the European Union as main contributor on a global level and the United Kingdom as the most prolifically publishing country within the European Union. Focusing on Germany, we find North Rhine-Westphalia to be the most scientifically active area and Aachen/Dortmund to be the cities where most publications originate. In the qualitative, content-based part of this review, we show that in particular sector coupling and the integration of distributed energy prosumers can lead to a working smart energy system. We demonstrate that industrial digitalization processes in the sense of Industry 4.0 can serve as enabling factor in this respect. Further, we provide extensive summaries regarding both the technological and economic potentials and challenges of different technologies in future smart energy systems. Taking all of the results into account, we outline a framework to connect the highly discussed topics of digitalized industries and smart energy systems to corresponding experts.","[Nolting, Lars; Kies, Alexander; Schoenegge, Marius; Praktiknjo, Aaron] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, E ON Energy Res Ctr, Inst Future Energy Consumer Needs & Behav FCN, Mathieustr 10, D-52074 Aachen, Germany; [Praktiknjo, Aaron] JARA ENERGY, D-52074 Aachen, Germany; [Robinius, Martin] Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Energy & Climate Res, Electrochem Proc Engn IEK 3, D-52425 Julich, Germany; [Robinius, Martin] JARA ENERGY, D-52425 Julich, Germany",E-ON; RWTH Aachen University; Helmholtz Association; Research Center Julich,"Nolting, L; Praktiknjo, A (corresponding author), Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, E ON Energy Res Ctr, Inst Future Energy Consumer Needs & Behav FCN, Mathieustr 10, D-52074 Aachen, Germany.",lnolting@eonerc.rwth-aachen.de; apraktiknjo@eonerc.rwth-aachen.de,"Praktiknjo, Aaron/AAX-4381-2020; Praktiknjo, Aaron/O-6105-2017","Praktiknjo, Aaron/0000-0002-2151-4241; Praktiknjo, Aaron/0000-0002-2151-4241; Nolting, Lars/0000-0001-8800-5807; Robinius, Martin/0000-0002-5307-3022",,,,,127,3,3,1,37,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0363-907X,1099-114X,,INT J ENERG RES,Int.

Here we show that these thresholds represent the sufficiency of local and renewable water resources, which are estimated daily by a state-of-the-art global hydrological model. We found that water abstraction from local and renewable sources is insufficient (i.e., more than 1% of the annual total water requirement becomes unmet) in a majority of grid cells where annual total water withdrawal exceeds 20% of the availability and/or per capita water availability falls below 1,700 person(-1).year(-1) (moderate stress). In grid cells where the corresponding values are 40% and/or below 500 m(3).person(-l).year(-1) (high water stress), more than 20% and 60% of the annual total water requirement must be supplied by nonlocal and nonrenewable sources, respectively. These results indicate that conventional indicators and thresholds can be used as a surrogate for measuring daily variations in the sufficiency of local and renewable water sources at the global scale. At the same time, the substitutability of the water withdrawal to availability (WTA) and the water availability per capita (APC) varies by region, which can be primarily attributed to the intensity of the seasonal variation in river flow and irrigated area per capita, respectively. Based on the analyses, new sets of thresholds for WTA and APC are proposed.","[Hanasaki, Naota] Natl Inst Environm Studies, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Yoshikawa, Sayaka; Kanae, Shinjiro] Tokyo Inst Technol, Tokyo, Japan; [Pokhrel, Yadu] Michigan State Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",National Institute for Environmental Studies - Japan; Tokyo Institute of Technology; Michigan State University,"Hanasaki, N (corresponding author), Natl Inst Environm Studies, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.",hanasaki@nies.go.jp,"Hanasaki, Naota/C-2932-2009; Yoshikawa, Sayaka/Q-4257-2019; Pokhrel, Yadu/AAC-1776-2021; Kanae, Shinjiro/E-5606-2010; Pokhrel, Yadu/J-6440-2013","Hanasaki, Naota/0000-0002-5092-7563; Yoshikawa, Sayaka/0000-0002-0384-9937; Kanae, Shinjiro/0000-0002-3176-4957; Pokhrel, Yadu/0000-0002-1367-216X","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology/Japan Society for the Promotion of Science KAKENHI [16H06291]; Environment Research and Technology Development Fund of the Environmental Restoration and Conservation Agency, Japan [2RF-1802]","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology/Japan Society for the Promotion of Science KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Environment Research and Technology Development Fund of the Environmental Restoration and Conservation Agency, Japan","This work was funded by a Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology/Japan Society for the Promotion of Science KAKENHI grant (grant number 16H06291) and the Environment Research and Technology Development Fund (2RF-1802) of the Environmental Restoration and Conservation Agency, Japan.

Nevertheless, in spite of these similarities, the development path to reach a modern and industrialized use of timber in construction which allows a diversity of architectural expression and design possibilities has differed considerably between these two countries, after the function-based building regulations that were introduced in Europe nearly three decades ago. This paper gives an overview of some characteristic modern timber buildings in Slovenia and Sweden, and the different construction techniques that are used in these two countries. Successful initiatives supporting the use of timber in construction are also presented. The opportunities for the further development of sustainable timber constructions in Slovenia and Sweden lie in new production methods, high prefabrication, and energy-efficient and climate-effective architecture, besides partnership and increased responsibilities for planning, improved and systematic feedback of experience and team cooperation, as well as knowing users identity, values and life style.","[Kuzman, Manja Kitek] Univ Ljubljana, Biotech Fac, Dept Wood Sci & Technol, Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Sandberg, Dick] Lulea Univ Technol, Wood Sci & Engn, Lulea, Sweden",University of Ljubljana; Lulea University of Technology,"Kuzman, MK (corresponding author), Univ Ljubljana, Biotech Fac, Dept Wood Sci & Technol, Ljubljana, Slovenia.",manja.kuzman@bf.uni-lj.si,,"Kitek Kuzman, Manja/0000-0002-3764-4681","STSM COST [FP1407, P4-0015]; Slovenian Research Agency [P4-0015]; Swedish Research Council Formas [2014-172, 942-2016-64]",STSM COST; Slovenian Research Agency(Slovenian Research Agency - Slovenia); Swedish Research Council Formas(Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council Formas),The authors would like to thank the STSM COST FP1407 and Slovenian Research Agency for financial support within the P4-0015 program.

However, the performance of this class of algorithms greatly depends on the choice of the kernel function. Kernel function implicitly represents the inner product between a pair of points of a dataset in a higher dimensional space. This inner product amounts to the similarity between points and provides a solid foundation for nonlinear analysis in kernel-based learning algorithms. The most important challenge in kernel-based learning is the selection of an appropriate kernel for a given dataset. To remedy this problem, algorithms to learn the kernel have recently been proposed. These methods formulate a learning algorithm that finds an optimal kernel for a given dataset. In this paper, we present an overview of these algorithms and provide a comparison of various approaches to find an optimal kernel. Furthermore, a list of pivotal issues that lead to efficient design of such algorithms will be presented.","[Abbasnejad, M.

A better understanding of flood regime changes and their drivers is therefore needed. The paper reviews the current knowledge on flood regime changes in European rivers that has traditionally been obtained through two alternative research approaches. The first approach is the data-based detection of changes in observed flood events. Current methods are reviewed together with their challenges and opportunities. For example, observation biases, the merging of different data sources and accounting for nonlinear drivers and responses. The second approach consists of modelled scenarios of future floods. Challenges and opportunities associated with flood change scenarios are discussed such as fully accounting for uncertainties in the modelling cascade and feedbacks. To make progress in flood change research, we suggest that a synthesis of these two approaches is needed. This can be achieved by focusing on long duration records and flood-rich and flood-poor periods rather than on short duration flood trends only, by formally attributing causes of observed flood changes, by validating scenarios against observed flood regime dynamics, and by developing low-dimensional models of flood changes and feedbacks. The paper finishes with a call for a joint European flood change research network.","[Hall, J.; Kiss, A.; Parajka, J.; Perdigao, R. A. P.; Plavcova, L.; Rogger, M.; Salinas, J.

This paper mainly introduces the principle theory and process to establish a snow-depth retrieval model within 30cm using EOS/MODIS visible to short-infrared window channels' data and station-measured data, considering snow characteristics in different physical states and various complex underneath conditions including DEM, land cover such as grassland, forest, cropland and so on. Based on snow characteristics and underneath conditions, snow is devided into many types: old dry snow in flat grassland, new dry snow in flat grassland, old dry snow in mountainous grassland, old dry snow in flat cropland and so on. Fourteen kinds of snow have been modeled respectively in this retrieval model. Through 4 years validation in XinJiang Province of China since 2002, the precision of snow-depth retrieval model using MODIS visible to short-infrared channels' data can reach more than 80%. In flat area with single underneath condition, where wind power can be ignored, the model can always get a better precision.

Urgent action is needed to shift from a reactive approach to a proactive one, for which drought risk assessment is fundamental. Nevertheless, the current methodology to calculate composite risk indicators is still debated, undermining the overall robustness and validity of drought risk assessments. Furthermore, the diversity of socioecological contexts, spatiotemporal scales, and data availability hamper the homogenization of assessment methods. We present a complete drought risk assessment methodology, applied to the agricultural systems of five Italian coastal watersheds, introducing a simple robustness evaluation method to validate the assessment tool and archetype analysis to link the outputs with adaptation strategies. Forty-two (42) indicators were included to represent hazard, exposure, and vulnerability. Past and future drought hazards were estimated considering multiple types of droughts with data from public observatories.The results show highest hazard for the southern part of the study region, highest exposure in the coastal and high-value wine producers' municipalities, while vulnerability patterns are less clear. Major adaptation efforts should target specific watersheds of the Grosseto province, which has the highest projected drought risk. Archetype analysis was then used to suggest possible context-specific adaptation strategies. The proposed methodology, with the integration of a robustness evaluation and the archetype analysis, represents an advancement toward shared and homogeneous guidelines in stateof-the-art drought risk assessments.","[Villani, Lorenzo; Castelli, Giulio; Piemontese, Luigi; Penna, Daniele; Bresci, Elena] Univ Firenze, Dept Agr Food Environm & Forestry DAGRI, Florence, Italy; [Villani, Lorenzo] Vrije Univ Brussels VUB, Hydrol & Hydraul Engn Dept, Brussels, Belgium",University of Florence; Vrije Universiteit Brussel,"Villani, L (corresponding author), Univ Firenze, Dept Agr Food Environm & Forestry DAGRI, Florence, Italy.",lorenzo.villani@unifi.it; giulio.castelli@unifi.it; luigi.piemontese@unifi.it; daniele.penna@unifi.it; elena.bresci@unifi.it,"Castelli, Giulio/O-2592-2018","Castelli, Giulio/0000-0002-0209-0869; Villani, Lorenzo/0000-0002-4241-7619; Penna, Daniele/0000-0001-6915-0697",,,,,83,2,2,17,17,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0378-3774,1873-2283,,AGR WATER MANAGE,Agric.

The Belt and Road Initiative involves over four billion people from more than 60 countries; therefore, it is imperative to make accurate projections of future climate changes for improved mitigation planning at the national level. Extreme heat waves may have significant impacts on several aspects of natural ecosystems and society, prompting considerable concern; thus, research is necessary with respect to potential changes in the frequency and intensity of heat waves in the context of global warming. Increasing heat wave related disasters in a potentially warmer future may pose threats to the sustainable development of the Belt and Road Region (BRR)-A region with various complex climates and a weak economic foundation. Heat wave disasters that are accompanied by high temperatures and humidity can threaten human health. Traditional research on heat waves focuses on the effects of temperature; however, taking the comprehensive effect of temperature-humidity into consideration can better explain heat stress on the human body in a high-temperature environment and better measure the intensity of heat waves. Therefore, we adopted a heat wave index (a widely used indicator for the synergistic effect of temperature and humidity) developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to characterize the health risks associated with heat waves, as well as to further project the changes in areal and population exposure to heat waves in the 21st century at different risk levels throughout the BRR under two typical climatic-socioeconomical scenarios (SSP2-4.5 and SSP3-8.5). Our analysis was based on state-of-the-art global climate models that are a part of the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project and a population projection dataset developed by the National Center for Atmospheric Research and the City University of New York's Institute for Demographic Research. Our results indicated that the intensity and frequency of heat waves in most areas throughout the BRR showed various increasing trends. Under the SSP2-4.5 and SSP3-8.5 scenarios, the sum of the population exposure to all levels of extreme heat waves in the BRR will increase to 2.0 and 3.3 times, respectively, by the end of the 21st century compared with that of the reference period (1986-2005). Furthermore, the relative increase in population exposure will be more remarkable for heat waves associated with higher risk levels; namely, the population exposure to heat waves at low, medium, and high risk levels will increase to 1.3, 2.1, and 8.9, respectively, under SSP2-4.5 and 1.5, 2.9, and 28.2 times, respectively, under SSP3-8.5 compared with that of the reference period. Developing countries in South Asia and Southeast Asia with large populations will suffer the most prominent increase in population exposure to heat waves. Typically, climatic factors play a major role in the increase of overall population exposure and dominate the increase in population exposure to heat waves at higher risk levels. However, the relative magnitude of the contribution of climatic and demographic factors varied across the regions. Our results indicated that unlike the air temperature, changes in the heat-humidity indices were significantly greater at lower latitudes, where only slight increases in the mean may be required to substantially enhance the frequency of dangerous conditions. Future construction of the Belt and Road must establish an early warning system for high-risk areas based on risk evaluations for extreme heat wave events. Additionally, it will be necessary to strengthen the vulnerability assessments for different areas and industries in the BRR and to establish an effective technical system to cope with extreme events.","[Wang, Fang; Zhang, Jintao; Ge, Quansheng; Hao, Zhixin] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Land Surface Pattern & Simulat, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Jintao] Fudan Univ, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Shanghai 200438, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Fudan University","Wang, F (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Land Surface Pattern & Simulat, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",wangf@igsnrr.ac.cn,,,,,,,67,2,4,26,34,SCIENCE PRESS,EPHRATA,"300 WEST CHESNUT ST, EPHRATA, PA 17522 USA",0023-074X,2095-9419,,CHIN SCI B-CHIN,Chin.

This causes penetrations and voltage surges, system instability, inefficient utilities planning and financial loss. Forecast models can help; however, time stamp, forecast horizon, input correlation analysis, data pre and post-processing, weather classification, network optimization, uncertainty quantification and performance evaluations need consideration. Thus, contemporary forecasting techniques are reviewed and evaluated. Input correlational analyses reveal that solar irradiance is most correlated with Photovoltaic output, and so, weather classification and cloud motion study are crucial. Moreover, the best data cleansing processes: normalization and wavelet transforms, and augmentation using generative adversarial network are recommended for network training and forecasting. Furthermore, optimization of inputs and network parameters, using genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization, is emphasized. Next, established performance evaluation metrics MAE, RMSE and MAPE are discussed, with suggestions for including economic utility metrics. Subsequently, modelling approaches are critiqued, objectively compared and categorized into physical, statistical, artificial intelligence, ensemble and hybrid approaches. It is determined that ensembles of artificial neural networks are best for forecasting short term photovoltaic power forecast and online sequential extreme learning machine superb for adaptive networks; while Bootstrap technique optimum for estimating uncertainty. Additionally, convolutional neural network is found to excel in eliciting a model's deep underlying non-linear input-output relationships. The conclusions drawn impart fresh insights in photovoltaic power forecast initiatives, especially in the use of hybrid artificial neural networks and evolutionary algorithms.","[Ahmed, R.; Sreeram, V; Mishra, Y.] Univ Western Australia, Sch Elect Elect & Comp Engn, Perth, WA, Australia; [Mishra, Y.] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Ahmed, R.; Arif, M.

What is the use of the defamiliarizing and the sublime amidst cataclysmic conflicts over identity and belonging, resources and institutions, climate and extinction? Understandably, many defenders of art have lately come to frame their defenses in terms of messaging: artists make art to convey messages otherwise excluded from official discourse (ideology, policy, history, social science), to testify and self-express, to achieve recognition and elicit identification.

P. euphratica is a salt-tolerant tree species growing in saline semi-arid areas. It is one of the stress-tolerance and desert-grown species. Therefore, the P. euphratica has been treated as main protecting object and the Tarim Nature Reserve is one of two P. euphratica Reserves in China. The nature reserve is located in the middle reach of the Tarim River, Xinjiang. It is not only the world's largest intact and unfrequented area of Populus euphratica forests, but also plays great significant role in maintaining the ecological balance of the Tarim Basin. However, the Populus euphratica Nature Reserve's eco-environment is getting more and more degenerated due to the human activities in recent years. This paper analyzed the ecological frangible factors and their influence mechanisms on the nature reserve eco-system stability using 3S technologies. The results showed the eco-environmental condition of P. euphratica is fragile and the ability of insisting on the artificial influence is weak because of the harsh climate, topographical conditions, and human irrational water use and land resources. The shortage and exhaustion of surface water, as well as descending of groundwater depth, make Populus euphratica forests deteriorating. The protecting strategies are suggested in this paper according to the research analyses.",,,,,,,,,,,15,2,2,2,7,SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING,BELLINGHAM,"1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010 USA",0277-786X,,0-8194-6377-9,P SOC PHOTO-OPT INS,,,2006,,,,,N2981,N2981,62981N,10.1117/12.684944,http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.684944,,,12,Ecology; Remote Sensing,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Remote Sensing,BFM14,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000243026400046,View Full Record in Web of Science

The climate change signal was inferred from the output of two simulations with a state-of-the-art global climate model (GCM), a reference run valid for 1961-1990 and a time-slice simulation valid for 2071-2100 under forcing from the A2 IPCC emission scenario. In this particular GCM experiment and with respect to the Alpine region summer temperature was found to increase by 3 to 4 degrees C, whereas precipitation was found to decrease by 10 to 20%. Global radiation and water vapor pressure deficit were found to increase by about 5% and 2 hPa, respectively. On this background, an overall increase of potential evapotranspiration of about 20% relative to the baseline was predicted by the hydrological model, with important variations between but also within individual basins. The results of the hydrological simulations also revealed a reduction in the evapotranspiration efficiency that depends on altitude. Accordingly, actual evapotranspiration was found to increase at high altitudes and to the south of the Alps, but to decrease in low elevation areas of the northern forelands and in the inner-Alpine domain. Such a differentiation does not appear in the GCM scenario, which predicts an overall increase in evapotranspiration over the Alps. This underlines the importance of detailed simulations for the quantitative assessment of the regional impact of climate change on the hydrological cycle.","Agroscope FAL Reckenholz, Swiss Fed Res Stn Agroecol & Agr, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland; Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Research Station Agroscope; Swiss Federal Research Station for Agroecology & Agriculture; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Calanca, P (corresponding author), Agroscope FAL Reckenholz, Swiss Fed Res Stn Agroecol & Agr, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland.",pierluigi.calanca@fal.admin.ch,"Wild, Martin/J-8977-2012",,,,,,48,59,59,0,20,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

Despite the extensive bovid fossil record in Eurasia, the evolutionary history of the European bison (or wisent, Bison bonasus) before the Holocene (<11.7 thousand years ago (kya)) remains a mystery. We use complete ancient mitochondrial genomes and genome-wide nuclear DNA surveys to reveal that the wisent is the product of hybridization between the extinct steppe bison (Bison priscus) and ancestors of modern cattle (aurochs, Bos primigenius) before 120 kya, and contains up to 10% aurochs genomic ancestry. Although undetected within the fossil record, ancestors of the wisent have alternated ecological dominance with steppe bison in association with major environmental shifts since at least 55 kya. Early cave artists recorded distinct morphological forms consistent with these replacement events, around the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, B21-18 kya).","[Soubrier, Julien; Gower, Graham; Chen, Kefei; Richards, Stephen M.; Llamas, Bastien; Mitchell, Kieren J.; Bover, Pere; Haak, Wolfgang; van Loenen, Ayla; Wooley, Oliver; Cooper, Alan] Univ Adelaide, Sch Biol Sci, Australian Ctr Ancient DNA, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Ho, Simon Y.

The local drying trend in this region has been associated with the expansion of the subtropical drylands over the last decades. It has been shown that SWSA precipitation is linked to large-scale dynamics modulated by internal climate variability and external forcing. This work aims at unravelling the causes of this long-term trend toward dryness in the context of the emerging climate change relying on a large set simulations of the state-of-the-art IPSL-CM6A-LR climate model from the 6th phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project. Our results identify the leading role of dynamical changes induced by external forcings, over the local thermodynamical effects and teleconnections with internal global modes of sea surface temperature. Our findings show that the simulated long-term changes of SWSA precipitation are dominated by externally forced anomalous expansion of the Southern Hemisphere Hadley Cell (HC) and a persistent positive Southern Annular Mode (SAM) trend since the late 1970s. Long-term changes in the HC extent and the SAM show strong co-linearity. They are attributable to stratospheric ozone depletion in austral spring-summer and increased atmospheric greenhouse gases all year round. Future ssp585 and ssp126 scenarios project a dominant role of anthropogenic forcings on the HC expansion and the subsequent SWSA drying, exceeding the threshold of extreme drought due to internal variability as soon as the 2040s, and suggest that these effects will persist until the end of the twenty-first century.","[Villamayor, Julian; Khodri, Myriam] Sorbonne Univ, LOCEAN IPSL, CNRS, IRD,MNHN, 4 Pl Jussieu, F-75005 Paris, France; [Villalba, Ricardo] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Inst Argentino Nivol Glaciol & Ciencias Ambiental, Mendoza, Argentina; [Daux, Valerie] UVSQ, CEA, Lab Sci Climat & Environm LSCE, CNRS, Gif Sur Yvette, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle (MNHN); UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Universite Paris Cite; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; CEA; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Villamayor, J (corresponding author), Sorbonne Univ, LOCEAN IPSL, CNRS, IRD,MNHN, 4 Pl Jussieu, F-75005 Paris, France.",julian.villamayor@locean.ipsl.fr,"Khodri, Myriam/K-1399-2016","Khodri, Myriam/0000-0003-1941-1646; VILLAMAYOR MORENO, JULIAN/0000-0002-8844-7389","BNP-Paribas Foundation; CNRS, Sorbonne Universite; Ecole Polytechnique; CNES","BNP-Paribas Foundation; CNRS, Sorbonne Universite; Ecole Polytechnique; CNES(Centre National D'etudes Spatiales)","The authors thank editor Dr. Corti and the two anonymous reviewers for their fundamental duty in the publishing process of this paper and their helpful comments.

One of the alternative methods to correct model errors is to use the canonical correlation analysis (CCA) correction method. CCA forecasts at the present time show better skill than dynamical model forecasts especially over the midlatitudes. Model outputs are adjusted based on the CCA modes between the model forecasts and the observations. This study builds a canonical correlation prediction model for subseasonal (June) precipitation. The predictors are circulation fields over western North Pacific from the Global Seasonal Forecasting System version 5 (GloSea5) and observed snow cover extent over Eurasia continent from Climate Data Record (CDR). The former is based on simultaneous teleconnection between the western North Pacific and the East Asia, and the latter on lagged teleconnection between the Eurasia continent and the East Asia. In addition, we suggest a technique for improving forecast skill by applying the ensemble canonical correlation (ECC) to individual canonical correlation predictions.","[Lee, Kang-Jin; Kwon, MinHo] Korea Inst Ocean Sci & Technol, Ocean Circulat & Climate Res Ctr, Ansan 15627, South Korea",Korea Institute of Ocean Science & Technology (KIOST),"Lee, KJ (corresponding author), Korea Inst Ocean Sci & Technol, Ocean Circulat & Climate Res Ctr, Ansan 15627, South Korea.",kjlee@kiost.ac.kr,,,,,,,22,2,2,0,5,KOREAN METEOROLOGICAL SOC,SEOUL,"SHINKIL-DONG 508, SIWON BLDG 704, YONGDUNGPO-GU, SEOUL, 150-050, SOUTH KOREA",1598-3560,2288-3266,,ATMOS-KOREA,Atmos.-Korea,DEC,2016,4,,,,711,716,,10.14191/Atmos.2016.26.4.711,http://dx.doi.org/10.14191/Atmos.2016.26.4.711,,,6,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,FD2OF,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000407373700016,View Full Record in Web of Science

North and southwest China are the regions with the highest drought frequency and maximum duration. At the interannual time scale, drought in the eastern part of East Asia is mainly dominated by two teleconnection patterns (i.e., the Pacific-Japan and Silk Road teleconnections). The former is forced by SST anomalies in the western North Pacific and the tropical Indian Ocean during El Nino decaying year summers. The precipitation anomaly features a meridional tripolar or sandwich pattern. The latter is forced by Indian monsoon heating and is a propagation of stationary Rossby waves along the Asian jet in the upper troposphere. It can significantly influence the precipitation over north China. Regarding the long-term trend, there exists an increasing drought trend over central parts of northern China and a decreasing tendency over northwestern China from the 1950s to the present. The increased drought in north China results from a weakened tendency of summer monsoons, which is mainly driven by the phase transition of the Pacific decadal oscillation. East Asian summer precipitation is poorly simulated and predicted by current state-of-the-art climate models. Encouragingly, the predictability of atmospheric circulation is high because of the forcing of ENSO and the associated teleconnection patterns. Under the SRES A1B scenario and doubled CO2 simulations, most climate models project an increasing drought frequency and intensity over southeastern Asia. Nevertheless, uncertainties exist in the projections as a result of the selection of climate models and the choice of drought index.","[Zhang, Lixia; Zhou, Tianjun] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, LASG, POB 9804, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Lixia] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteoro, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Tianjun] Joint Ctr Global Change Studies, Beijing, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology","Zhou, TJ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, LASG, POB 9804, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.",zhoutj@lasg.iap.ac.cn,"ZHOU, Tianjun/C-3195-2012; Zhang, Lixia/J-7752-2017","ZHOU, Tianjun/0000-0002-5829-7279; Zhang, Lixia/0000-0002-8424-3741","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41305072, 41330423, 41023002]; NUIST [KLME1306]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); NUIST,"This work was jointly supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grants 41305072, 41330423, and 41023002, and the open Program of NUIST under Grant KLME1306.

This paper compares different urban canopy models to characterize the UHI in Toronto. In particular, the effects of urban parameterization modeling are investigated using the state-of-the-art Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF). The WRF is coupled separately with three Urban Canopy Models (UCMs) to predict the heat and moisture fluxes from the canopies to the atmosphere. The three UCMs are a slab (SB), single-layer (SL), and multi-layer (ML) representation of the canopy. The SB, SL, and ML respectively consider buildings as increased roughness elements, a single orientation of the two-dimensional approximation, and the three-dimensional urban surfaces that also accounts for the vertical exchange of heat, moisture, and momentum. The WRF-UCMs are used to investigate a specific heat wave period. The simulations are evaluated comparing the results of the air temperature, wind speed, relative humidity, and dew point temperature with the measurements from several weather stations. The correlation (r-squared) of the air temperature and dew point temperature was close to 0.9 and 0.85, whereas the correlation of the wind speed and relative humidity was 0.6 and 0.7 respectively. The UHI magnitude is also estimated by the air temperature changes between urban and rural areas. The results illustrate that the daily heat island magnitude is around 1.2-1.5 degrees C, while the daytime is near 0.7 degrees C. The UHI is magnified during the nighttime and is up to 2 degrees C. The analysis indicated that the SL is reliable for climate simulations, but for the evaluation of the UHI magnitude and to analyze more sophisticated structures, the ML urban canopy model has to be applied as it is critical to account for the air turbulences and multi-reflections in the urban canopy.","[Jandaghian, Zahra; Berardi, Umberto] Ryerson Univ, 3520 Victiria St, Toronto, ON M5B 2K3, Canada",Toronto Metropolitan University,"Berardi, U (corresponding author), Ryerson Univ, 3520 Victiria St, Toronto, ON M5B 2K3, Canada.",uberardi@ryerson.ca,"Berardi, Umberto/G-1972-2017","Berardi, Umberto/0000-0002-0508-6195",NSERC DG [2016-04904]; Ontario Ministry of Research Innovation and Science (MRIS) through the ERA award,NSERC DG(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); Ontario Ministry of Research Innovation and Science (MRIS) through the ERA award,Funding for this research was provided by the NSERC DG #2016-04904 and the Ontario Ministry of Research Innovation and Science (MRIS) through the ERA award.,,40,29,29,8,43,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2210-6707,2210-6715,,SUSTAIN CITIES SOC,Sust.

We move this global budget to the forefront of our considerations regarding a new global climate treaty in the post-Copenhagen process. [The authors are members of the German Advisory Council on Global Change (WBGU). The WBGU recently published a study on Solving the climate dilemma: The budget approach. This paper builds on the fundamental ideas and findings of the WBGU study and demonstrates that the budget approach could serve as a cornerstone for an institutional design for a global low-carbon economy.] Combining findings from climate science and economics with fundamental concepts of equity, the budget approach provides concrete figures for the emission allowances that are still available to countries, assuming they want to prevent the destabilization of the planet's climate system. Our calculations demonstrate that the time pressure for acting is almost overwhelming-in industrialized countries and also in emerging economies and many developing nations. We suggest several institutional innovations and rules to manage the global and the national CO(2) budgets in a transparent, fair, and flexible way. A sober analysis of the state of the art of climate change science and of the state of multilateral attempts to create an effective climate protection accord so far reveals that the budget approach can provide crucial orientation for the negotiations toward a comprehensive post-Copenhagen climate regime. The approach facilitates at the same time an institutional design for a low-carbon global economy, setting the necessary incentives for decoupling economic growth from the burning of fossil fuels.

Most Indian rice production depends on monsoon timing and dynamics. In 2002, the lowest monsoon precipitation of the last 130+ years was observed. It coincided with the worst rice production anomaly recorded by FAOSTAT from 1961 to 2014. In that year, freshwater limitation was blamed as responsible for the yield losses in the southeastern coastal regions. Given the important implication for local food security and international market stability, we here investigate the specific mechanisms behind the effects of this extreme meteorological drought on rice yield at the national and regional levels. To this purpose, we integrate output from the hydrological model, surface, and satellite observations for the different rice cropping cycles into state-of-the-art and novel climate indicators. In particular, we adopt the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) as an indicator of drought due to the local surface water balance anomalies (i.e., precipitation and evapotranspiration). We propose a new indicator of the renewable surface freshwater availability due to non-local sources, i.e., the standardized river discharge index (SDI) based on the anomalies of modelled river discharge data. We compare these indicators to the soil moisture observations retrieved from satellites. We link all diagnostics to the recorded yields at the national and regional level, quantifying the long-term correlations and the best match of the 2002 anomaly. Our findings highlight the need for integrating non-local surface freshwater dynamics with local rainfall variability to determine the soil moisture conditions in rice fields for yields assessment, modeling, and forecasting.","[Zampieri, Matteo; Garcia, Gema Carmona; Dentener, Frank; Salamon, Peter; Seguini, Lorenzo; Toreti, Andrea] EC, JRC, Via E Fermi 2749, I-21027 Ispra, Italy; [Gumma, Murali Krishna] Int Crops Res Inst Semi Arid Trop, Remote Sensing GIS Lab, Innovat Syst Drylands Program ISD, Patancheru 502324, Andhra Pradesh, India",European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site; CGIAR; International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid-Tropics (ICRISAT),"Zampieri, M (corresponding author), EC, JRC, Via E Fermi 2749, I-21027 Ispra, Italy.",matteo.zampieri@ec.europa.eu; Gema.CARMONA-GARCIA@ec.europa.eu; frank.dentener@ec.europa.eu; M.Gumma@cgiar.org; peter.salamon@ec.europa.eu; lorenzo.seguini@ec.europa.eu; andrea.toreti@ec.europa.eu,"Seguini, Lorenzo/AAR-8734-2020; Seguini, Lorenzo/ABB-4312-2020","ZAMPIERI, Matteo/0000-0002-7558-1108; Salamon, Peter/0000-0002-5419-5398; Gumma, Murali Krishna/0000-0002-3760-3935; Seguini, Lorenzo/0000-0003-0118-1328",,,,,50,22,22,2,15,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2072-4292,,,REMOTE SENS-BASEL,Remote Sens.,FEB,2018,2,,,,,,244,10.3390/rs10020244,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs10020244,,,19,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,FZ4DT,,"gold, Green Submitted, Green Accepted",,,12/21/22,WOS:000427542100089,View Full Record in Web of Science

Buildings and their cooling systems should be designed and operated to be resilient under such events to protect occupants from potentially dangerous indoor thermal conditions. This study performed a critical review on the state-of-the-art of cooling strategies, with special attention to their performance under heatwaves and power outages. We proposed a definition of resilient cooling and described four criteria for resilience-absorptive capacity, adaptive capacity, restorative capacity, and recovery speed -and used them to qualitatively evaluate the resilience of each strategy. The literature review and qualitative analyses show that to attain resilient cooling, the four resilience criteria should be considered in the design phase of a building or during the planning of retrofits. The building and relevant cooling system characteristics should be considered simultaneously to withstand extreme events. A combination of strategies with different resilience capacities, such as a passive envelope strategy coupled with a low-energy space-cooling solution, may be needed to obtain resilient cooling. Finally, a further direction for a quantitative assessment approach has been pointed out. (c) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

Specifically, drought was characterized using the observed rainfall data from 36 rain gauges spanning the period between 1990 and 2010 and covering the main climatic regions in Syria (i.e., Mediterranean, arid, semiarid and mountainous). Meteorological drought was assessed using the standardized precipitation index (SPI) at 12-month timescale, allowing for detecting the impacts of climate variability on agricultural droughts. The dominant modes of drought were defined using an S-mode of the principal component analysis. To assess the links between meteorological drought evolution and vegetation greening in Syria, the time series of SPI were correlated with the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Time series of NDVI were retrieved from the remotely sensed National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Advanced Very High-Resolution Radiometer (NOAA/AVHRR) sensor at a spatial resolution of 25 km for the common period 1990-2010. Trend analysis suggests a statistically significant increase in the frequency and intensity of drought at 12-month timescale. The observed intensification of meteorological drought is mostly associated with the increase in mild and moderate droughts, relative to extremes and very extreme droughts. Results also suggest a statistically significant decrease (p < 0.05) in vegetation greening over Syria during the study period, especially in the eastern parts of the country. Our results demonstrate that the decrease in vegetation cover can directly be linked to the anomalous drought events, with Pearson' r coefficients generally above 0.6. This dependency was more highlighted during wintertime for the Mediterranean vegetation and in northeastern portions of the country. Overall, the increase in the frequency and intensity of meteorological drought, combined with a series of unrest and political instability, have drastic impacts on the agricultural sector in Syria, with serious implications for crop yield.","[Mohammed, Safwan; Harsanyie, Endre] Univ Debrecen, Inst Land Utilizat Technol & Reg Planning, H-4032 Debrecen, Hungary; [Alsafadi, Karam] Alexandria Univ, Fac Arts, Dept Geog & GIS, Alexandria 25435, Egypt; [Al-Awadhi, Talal; Sherief, Youssef; El Kenawy, Ahmed M.] Sultan Qaboos Univ, Dept Geog, Muscat, Oman; [Sherief, Youssef] Zagazig Univ, Fac Arts, Dept Geog, Zagazig, Egypt; [Harsanyie, Endre] Inst Agr Engn, Natl Agr Res & Innovat Ctr, Tessedik Samuel 4, H-2100 Godollo, Hungary; [El Kenawy, Ahmed M.] Mansoura Univ, Dept Geog, Mansoura 35516, Egypt",University of Debrecen; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Alexandria University; Sultan Qaboos University; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Zagazig University; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Mansoura University,"El Kenawy, AM (corresponding author), Sultan Qaboos Univ, Dept Geog, Muscat, Oman.;El Kenawy, AM (corresponding author), Mansoura Univ, Dept Geog, Mansoura 35516, Egypt.",kenawy@mans.edu.eg,"Mohammed (PhD), Safwan/AAA-7126-2019; Kenawy, Ahmed/Y-9137-2018; Alsafadi, Karam/AAI-5270-2020","Mohammed (PhD), Safwan/0000-0003-2311-6789; Kenawy, Ahmed/0000-0001-6639-6253; Alsafadi, Karam/0000-0001-8925-7918","Higher Education Institutional Excellence Programme of the Ministry of Human Capacities in Hungary; Sultan Qaboos University (SQU), the Sultanate of Oman, as a part of the HM Trust Fund [SR/ART/GEOG/17/01];  [GINOP-2.2.1-15-2016-00001];  [EFOP-3.6.3-VEKOP-16-2017-00008]","Higher Education Institutional Excellence Programme of the Ministry of Human Capacities in Hungary; Sultan Qaboos University (SQU), the Sultanate of Oman, as a part of the HM Trust Fund; ; ","The authors are grateful to the Syrian Ministry of Agriculture (MoA) for providing rainfall data used in this study.

The period and magnitude of the QBO and the magnitude of the polar Holton-Tan (HT) relationship is simulated in a free-running configuration of MiMA, comparable to that in state-of-the-art climate models. To isolate mechanisms whereby the QBO influences variability outside the tropical atmosphere, a series of branch experiments are performed with nudged QBO winds. When easterly QBO winds maximized around 30 hPa are relaxed, an Eliassen-Palm (E-P) flux divergence dipole quickly forms in the extratropical middle stratosphere as a direct response to the tropical meridional circulation, in contrast to the HT mechanism, which is associated with wave propagation near the zero wind line. This meridional circulation response to the relaxed QBO winds develops within the first 10 days in seasonally varying and fixed-seasonal experiments. No detectable changes in upward propagation of waves in the midlatitude lowermost stratosphere are evident for at least 20 days after branching, with the first changes only evident after 20 days in perpetual midwinter and season-varying runs, but after 40 days in perpetual November runs. The polar vortex begins to respond around the 20th day, and subsequently a near-surface response in the Atlantic Ocean sector forms in mid-to-late winter runs. These results suggest that the maximum near-surface response observed in mid-to-late winter is not simply due to a random seasonal synchronization of the QBO phase, but is also due to the long lag of the surface response to a QBO relaxation in early winter and the short lag of the surface response to a QBO relaxation in mid-to-late winter.","[Rao, Jian] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteoro, Joint Int Res Lab Climate & Environm Change, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster,Minist Educ, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Rao, Jian; Garfinkel, Chaim, I; White, Ian P.] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Fredy & Nadine Herrmann Inst Earth Sci, Edmond J Safra Campus, Givat Ram Jerusalem, Israel",Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Hebrew University of Jerusalem,"Rao, J (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteoro, Joint Int Res Lab Climate & Environm Change, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster,Minist Educ, Nanjing, Peoples R China.",raojian@nuist.edu.cn,"garfinkel, chaim I/AAA-1134-2020; Rao, Jian/O-3392-2019","garfinkel, chaim I/0000-0001-7258-666X; Rao, Jian/0000-0001-5030-0288","National Natural Science Foundation of China [42030605, 41705024]; ISF-NSFC joint research program [3259/19]; European Research Council starting grant under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program [677756]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); ISF-NSFC joint research program; European Research Council starting grant under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program,"Author Rao was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grants 42030605 and 41705024).

Methods: Using a pretest-posttest design, this study examines changes in advocacy intentions around LGBTQQ issues among middle school and high school students who participated in the intervention (n = 515). Results: Students reported a significant increase in intentions to advocate. Existing intervention behaviors and increased recognition of homophobia/transphobia as problems were associated with greater increases in intention to advocate. Respondents with higher existing intervention behaviors, as well as White students and cisgender women, reported higher advocacy intentions compared to students of color and cisgender men. Further, we found indication of greater awareness of homophobia/transphobia as a problem in school. Conclusions: Youth-led theater and dialogue-based interventions may be a promising strategy for addressing heterosexism and genderism in schools.","[Wernick, Laura J.] Fordham Univ, Grad Sch Social Serv, 113 West 60th St, Bronx, NY 10023 USA; [Kulick, Alex] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Dessel, Adrienne B.] Univ Michigan, Program Intergrp Relat, Ann Arbor, MI USA; [Graham, Louis F.] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Publ Hlth & Hlth Sci, Amherst, MA 01003 USA",Fordham University; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst,"Wernick, LJ (corresponding author), Fordham Univ, Grad Sch Social Serv, 113 West 60th St, Bronx, NY 10023 USA.",lwernick@fordham.edu,,,Arcus Foundation; Liberty Hill Foundation; Mukti Fund; University of Michigan Arts of Citizenship; Community Foundation of SE Michigan,Arcus Foundation; Liberty Hill Foundation; Mukti Fund; University of Michigan Arts of Citizenship; Community Foundation of SE Michigan,"The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was supported in part by the Arcus Foundation, Liberty Hill Foundation, Mukti Fund, University of Michigan Arts of Citizenship, and the Community Foundation of SE Michigan.",,95,9,9,0,15,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1049-7315,1552-7581,,RES SOCIAL WORK PRAC,Res.

Yet, alteration of the flow regime of temporary rivers may lessen the resilience of fish communities to tolerate hydrologic change imposed by droughts. This long-term study (2001-2013) predicted spatial structuring (across catchments and amongst reaches) in fish community composition and abundance across a hydrologically-altered Mediterranean-type region dominated by temporary streams. Shifts from freshwater specialist and diadromous species to more generalist and tolerant species (i.e. freshwater generalist, aliens and estuarine species) were anticipated as the region experienced low flows (2001-2006) and critical water shortage (2007-2010) associated with a most severe drought. It was anticipated that changes in composition and abundance would be revealed during flood (2011) and post-flood (2012-2013) periods after the drought. Contrary to these predictions, fish community structure was broadly consistent across catchments, despite varying climatic and hydrologic (mainly, flow intermittence) regimes. As expected, significant spatial variability was revealed at the reach scale, with significant differences between upper reaches and terminal wetlands, and with a clear transition in fish community structure between these reach types. Significant temporal variability was also revealed with the reduced abundance of diadromous species (although Pseudaphritis urvillii did increase) and increases in the abundance of aliens and surprisingly freshwater specialists over the period of critical water shortage relative to antecedent low flows. This was followed by mixed reach-dependent responses of fish during the flood and post-flood periods. The differential responses of fish communities across reaches and temporal periods must be considered as part of the management of threatened species in hydrologically-altered regions dominated by temporary streams.","[Whiterod, Nick S.; Hammer, Michael P.] Aquasave Nat Glenelg Trust, Goolwa Beach, SA 5214, Australia; [Hammer, Michael P.] Museum & Art Gallery Northern Terr, Darwin, NT, Australia; [Vilizzi, Lorenzo] Mugla Sitki Kocman Univ, Fac Fisheries, Kotekli, Mugla, Turkey",Mugla Sitki Kocman University,"Whiterod, NS (corresponding author), Aquasave Nat Glenelg Trust, 7 Kemp St, Goolwa Beach, SA 5214, Australia.",nick.whiterod@aquasave.com.au,"; Vilizzi, Lorenzo/C-6263-2012","Hammer, Michael/0000-0002-0981-4647; Vilizzi, Lorenzo/0000-0001-8103-885X",Scientific & Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK); Department of Science Fellowships & Grant Programs (BIDEB),Scientific & Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK)(Turkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Arastirma Kurumu (TUBITAK)); Department of Science Fellowships & Grant Programs (BIDEB),"The present study draws on data from numerous research projects, which were predominantly funded (as was this study) by the South Australian (SA) Department of Environment, Water and Natural Resources (DEWNR) (formerly, SA Department of Environment and Heritage: DEH) and other departments now subsumed into SA DEWNR (including the SA MBD Natural Resources Management (NRM) Board).

Conventional static species distribution models (SDMs) do not incorporate these processes explicitly. This limits their applicability, particularly for non-equilibrium situations such as invasions or climate change. In this paper we show how dynamic SDMs can be formulated and fitted to data within a Bayesian framework. Our focus is on discrete state-space Markov process models which provide a flexible framework to account for stochasticity in key demographic processes, including dispersal, growth and competition. We show how to construct likelihood functions for such models (both discrete and continuous time versions) and how these can be combined with suitable observation models to conduct Bayesian parameter inference using computational techniques such as Markov chain Monte Carlo. We illustrate the current state-of-the-art with three contrasting examples using both simulated and empirical data. The use of simulated data allows the robustness of the methods to be tested with respect to deficiencies in both data and model. These examples show how mechanistic understanding of the processes that determine distribution and abundance can be combined with different sources of information at a range of spatial and temporal scales. Application of such techniques will enable more reliable inference and projections, e.g. under future climate change scenarios than is possible with purely correlative approaches. Conversely, confronting such process-oriented niche models with abundance and distribution data will test current understanding and may ultimately feedback to improve underlying ecological theory.","[Marion, Glenn; Catterall, Stephen] Biomath & Stat Scotland, Edinburgh EH9 3JZ, Midlothian, Scotland; [McInerny, Greg J.] Microsoft Res, Sci Computat Lab, Computat Ecol & Environm Sci Grp, Cambridge CB3 0FB, England; [Pagel, Joern] Univ Potsdam, D-14469 Potsdam, Germany; [Pagel, Joern; O'Hara, Robert B.] Biodivers & Climate Res Ctr, D-60325 Frankfurt, Germany; [Cook, Alex R.] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Stat & Appl Probabil, Singapore 117546, Singapore; [Hartig, Florian] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Ecol Modelling, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany",James Hutton Institute; Microsoft; University of Potsdam; National University of Singapore; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ),"Marion, G (corresponding author), Biomath & Stat Scotland, James Clerk Maxwell Bldg,Kings Bldg, Edinburgh EH9 3JZ, Midlothian, Scotland.",glenn@bioss.ac.uk,"Hartig, Florian/G-4510-2010; Cook, Alex/S-3576-2019; Marion, Glenn/J-4738-2013; O'Hara, Bob/A-7499-2008; Cook, Alex/B-5941-2011; Catterall, Stephen/I-7217-2013; Pagel, Joern/A-9897-2012","Hartig, Florian/0000-0002-6255-9059; O'Hara, Bob/0000-0001-9737-3724; Cook, Alex/0000-0002-6271-5832; Pagel, Joern/0000-0002-4817-1920; Marion, Glenn/0000-0002-0454-9338","LOEWE initiative for scientific and economic excellence of the German federal state of Hesse; Scottish Government's RESAS; ERC [233066]; Biodiversity and Climate Research Centre (BiK-F), part of the LOEWE programme 'Landes-Offensive zur Entwicklung Wissenschaftlich-okonomischer Exzellenz' of Hesse's Ministry of Higher Education, Research and the Arts; EPSRC [EP/I017909/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/I017909/1] Funding Source: researchfish","LOEWE initiative for scientific and economic excellence of the German federal state of Hesse; Scottish Government's RESAS; ERC(European Research Council (ERC)European Commission); Biodiversity and Climate Research Centre (BiK-F), part of the LOEWE programme 'Landes-Offensive zur Entwicklung Wissenschaftlich-okonomischer Exzellenz' of Hesse's Ministry of Higher Education, Research and the Arts; EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC))","We would like to thank the organizers of the workshop on 'The ecological niche as a window to biodiversity' in Frankfurt (Christine Romermann, Steve Higgins and Bob O'Hara) for inviting us to attend, and to write this review.

Its commercialization, however, poses a multi-scale challenge, which starts with the characterization of feedstock, products and reaction intermediates at molecular scales, and continues with understanding the complex reaction network taking place in different reactor configurations, and in the case of catalytic pyrolysis and upgrading on different catalysts. In addition, crude pyrolysis oil is not immediately usable in the current energy infrastructure, due to undesirable properties such as low energy content and corrosiveness as a result of its high oxygenate content. It, therefore, needs to be upgraded and fractionated to desired specifications. While various types of pyrolysis reactors and upgrading technologies are under development, knowledge transfer and closing the gap between theory and application requires model development. Indepth understanding of the reaction mechanisms and kinetics should be combined with the knowledge of multi-scale transport phenomena to enable design, optimization, and control of complex pyrolysis reactors. Finally, underpinning economic and environmental impacts of biofuel production requires expanding the system boundaries to include the overall process and supply chain. The present contribution aims at providing a comprehensive multi-scale review that discusses the state of the art of each of these aspects, as well as their multi-scale interactions. The study is mainly focused on fast pyrolysis, although reference to other types of pyrolysis technologies is made for the sake of comparison and knowledge transfer. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Some interesting findings in this study include (i) multiple-model ensemble (MME) skill was better than most of the individual models; (ii) both actual prediction skill and potential predictability increased as the averaging time scale increased from days to months; (iii) there is no significant difference in actual skill between coupled and uncoupled models, in contrast with the potential predictability where coupled models performed better than uncoupled models; (iv) relative entropy (REA) is an effective measure in characterizing the potential predictability of individual prediction, whereas the mutual information (MI) is a reliable indicator of overall prediction skill; and (v) compared with conventional potential predictability measures of the signal-to-noise ratio, the MI-based measures characterized more potential predictability when the ensemble spread varied over initial conditions.Further analysis found that the signal component dominated the dispersion component in REA for PNA potential predictability from days to seasons. Also, the PNA predictability is highly related to the signal of the tropical sea surface temperature (SST), and SST-PNA correlation patterns resemble the typical ENSO structure, suggesting that ENSO is the main source of PNA seasonal predictability. The predictable component analysis (PrCA) of atmospheric variability further confirmed the above conclusion; that is, PNA is one of the most predictable patterns in the climate variability over the Northern Hemisphere, which originates mainly from the ENSO forcing.","[Younas, Waqar; Tang, Youmin] Univ No British Columbia, Prince George, BC V2N 4Z9, Canada; [Tang, Youmin] State Key Lab Satellite Ocean Environm Dynam, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",University of Northern British Columbia,"Tang, YM (corresponding author), Univ No British Columbia, 3333 Univ Way, Prince George, BC V2N 4Z9, Canada.",ytang@unbc.ca,,,NSERC; UNBC Graduate Entrance Scholarship; NSF of China [41276029],NSERC(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); UNBC Graduate Entrance Scholarship; NSF of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This work is supported by NSERC Discovery Grant and UNBC Graduate Entrance Scholarship, as well as the research grant from NSF of China (41276029).",,59,22,24,1,27,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0894-8755,1520-0442,,J CLIMATE,J.

As the share of PV rises, the challenge of system integration will increase. This favors CSP, which can be combined with thermal storage and co-firing to reduce variability. It is thus an open question how important solar power will be for achieving climate mitigation targets, and which solar technology will be dominant in the long-term. We address these questions with the state-of-the-art integrated energy-economy-climate model REMIND 1.5, which embodies an advanced representation of the most important drivers of solar deployment. We derive up-to-date values for current and future costs of solar technologies. We calculate a consistent global resource potential dataset for both CSP and PV, aggregated to country-level. We also present a simplified representation of system integration costs of variable renewable energies, suitable for large-scale energy-economy-models. Finally, we calculate a large number of scenarios and perform a sensitivity study to analyze how robust our results are towards future cost reductions of PV and CSP. The results show that solar power becomes the dominant electricity source in a scenario limiting global warming to 2 degrees C, with PV and CSP together supplying 48% of total 2010-2100 electricity. Solar technologies have a stabilizing effect on electricity price: if both solar technologies are excluded in a climate policy scenario, electricity prices rise much higher than in the case with full technology availability. We also analyze the competition between PV and CSP: PV is cheaper on a direct technology basis and is thus deployed earlier, but at high supply shares the PV integration costs become so high that CSP gains a competitive advantage and is rapidly developed, eventually overtaking PV. Even in the most pessimistic scenario of our sensitivity study with no further cost reductions, CSP and PV still supply 19% of 2010-2100 electricity.

Identifying the source of abnormal methane in groundwater of shale gas development areas is becoming a research hotspot in the fields of groundwater and climate change. This paper reviews the traditional methodology in identifying sources of methane and its deficiency in groundwater application. Then potential and advantages of using noble gases were discussed on how to overcome these limitations of the traditional method. Finally, based on noble gas, the current application status and future challenges of methane source identification in groundwater were analyzed. It can be summarized as: (1) due to chemical and/or microbial processes in the aquifer system, the traditional methodology for methane source identification, which utilizes molecular and isotopic compositions of hydrocarbon gas, has multiple interpretationsand large uncertainties; (2) the non-reactive nature and well-characterized isotopic compositions of noble gases in the atmosphere, hydrosphere, and crust, make noble gases ideal indicators of the sources of methane in groundwater. Moreover, the mechanism of formation and release of crustal noble gas prevent shale gas signatures from being interfered with by natural gas; (3) the key scientific tasks surrounding the use of noble gases for methane source identification include quantitatively separating the components of atmosphere-derived, mantle-derived, and crust-derived noble gases from the bulk noble gases in groundwater. It quantifies the solubility fractionation of noble gases induced by water-gas interaction during methane migration to the aquifer. The application of noble gases can bring a new perspective to tracing the source of methane in groundwater and is of great significance to the protection of groundwater quality in shale gas development areas and mitigation of climate change.","[Zheng, Zhao-xian; Liu, Ling-xia; Cui, Xiao-shun] Chinese Acad Geol Sci, Inst Hydrogeol & Environm Geol, Shijiazhuang 050061, Hebei, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Zhao-xian; Cui, Xiao-shun] Minist Nat Resources, Key Lab Groundwater Sci & Engn, Shijiazhuang 050061, Hebei, Peoples R China; [Liu, Ling-xia] Minist Nat Resources, Technol Innovat Ctr Geothermal & Hot Dry Rock Exp, Shijiazhuang 050061, Hebei, Peoples R China",Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences; Ministry of Natural Resources of the People's Republic of China; Ministry of Natural Resources of the People's Republic of China,"Liu, LX (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Geol Sci, Inst Hydrogeol & Environm Geol, Shijiazhuang 050061, Hebei, Peoples R China.;Liu, LX (corresponding author), Minist Nat Resources, Technol Innovat Ctr Geothermal & Hot Dry Rock Exp, Shijiazhuang 050061, Hebei, Peoples R China.",llingxia-2004@163.com,,,"Basic Research Fund Project of Chinese Academy of Geological Science [SK202005, SK202110]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41502336, 41302192]; Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province of China [D2018504011]; China Geological Survey [DD20190555]",Basic Research Fund Project of Chinese Academy of Geological Science; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province of China(Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province); China Geological Survey(China Geological Survey),"This study was supported by the Basic Research Fund Project of Chinese Academy of Geological Science (SK202110), National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41302192), Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province of China (Grant No. D2018504011), National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41502336), Basic Research Fund Project of Chinese Academy of Geological Science (SK202005) and China Geological Survey (Grant No. DD20190555).",,68,0,0,8,11,GROUNDWATER SCIENCE & ENGINEERING LTD,HEBEI,"C/O 268, ZHONGHUA NORTH ST, SHIJIAZHUANG, HEBEI, 050061, PEOPLES R CHINA",2305-7068,,,J GROUNDW SCI ENG,J.

How the China cold extreme events change is still an outstanding issue. From observational and modeling perspectives, this study investigates the change of the leading mode of the China coldwave duration (CWD) in a warming climate. CWD significantly reduces across China during 1957-2009. The reduction in northern China is much more than that in southern China. The CWD leading mode derived from the Empirical Orthogonal Function analysis is characterized by extreme value centers located in northern China during the cold period (1957-1979) and shifting to southern China during the warm period (1980-2009). This indicates that southern China may experience longer or shorter coldwaves in the past three decades, while those in northern China tend to vary less vigorously. The multi-model ensemble of seven state-of-the-art climate models from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) show that under the IPCC SRES A1B scenario, the maximum loading of the CWD leading mode extends to southern China at the end of twenty-first century (2080-2099). These results indicate that the primary change of the CWD leading mode in a warming climate might be the southward shift of the variation center and such position change may lead to more intense coldwave variations in southern China as observed in the past decades. Possible physical mechanisms on the variation of the CWD major mode are also investigated in this study.","[Wu, Zhiwei] Environm Canada, Meteorol Res Div, Dorval, PQ H9P 1J3, Canada; [Jiang, Zhihong; Ma, Tingting] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Minist Educ, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Environment & Climate Change Canada; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology,"Wu, ZW (corresponding author), Environm Canada, Meteorol Res Div, Dorval, PQ H9P 1J3, Canada.",zhiweiwu@hawaii.edu,,,National Basic Research Program 973 [2010CB950401]; Special Research Program for Public Welfare (Meteorology) of China [GYHY200906016]; Priority Academic Program Development (PAPD) of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions,National Basic Research Program 973(National Basic Research Program of China); Special Research Program for Public Welfare (Meteorology) of China; Priority Academic Program Development (PAPD) of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions,"The authors are supported by the National Basic Research Program 973 (Grant No. 2010CB950401), the Special Research Program for Public Welfare (Meteorology) of China under Grant No. GYHY200906016 and a project Funded by the Priority Academic Program Development (PAPD) of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions.",,42,15,18,3,21,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0177-798X,1434-4483,,THEOR APPL CLIMATOL,Theor.

However, most drift correction studies consider a relatively small sample of variables and models. Here, we present a systematic application of the existing drift correction strategies for decadal predictions of various sea surface temperature-based metrics from a suite of five state-of-the-art climate models (CanCM4i1, GFDL-CM2.1, HadCM3i2&i3, MIROC5, and MPI-ESM-LR). The best method of drift correction for each metric and model is reported. Preliminary analysis suggests that there is no single method of drift correction that consistently performs best. Initial condition-based drift correction provides the lowest errors in most regions for MIROC5 and the two HadCM3 models, whereas the trend-based drift correction produces lowest errors for CanCM4i1, GFDL-CM2.1, and MPI-ESM-LR over the largest share of the area. There is no merit in using a k-nearest neighbor approach for these drift correction methods. Further, in almost all cases, the multimodel ensemble outperforms the individual models, and thus, the study conclusively suggests using forecasts based on multimodel averages. We also show some additional benefit to be gained by drift correcting each model/metric using their best correction method prior to model averaging and suggest that the results presented here would help potential users expend time and resources judiciously while dealing with outputs from these experiments.","[Choudhury, Dipayan; Sharma, Ashish; Mehrotra, Rajeshwar; Sivakumar, Bellie] Univ New South Wales, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Choudhury, Dipayan; Sen Gupta, Alexander] Univ New South Wales, ARC Ctr Excellence Climate Syst Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Sen Gupta, Alexander] Univ New South Wales, Climate Change Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Sivakumar, Bellie] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Land Air & Water Resources, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of New South Wales Sydney; ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science; University of New South Wales Sydney; University of New South Wales Sydney; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Sharma, A (corresponding author), Univ New South Wales, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",a.sharma@unsw.edu.au,"Gupta, Alexander R Sen/B-7995-2011","Gupta, Alexander R Sen/0000-0001-5226-871X; Sharma, Ashish/0000-0002-6758-0519",Australian Government; Australian Research Council (ARC) [FT110100328]; Australian Bureau of Meteorology; New South Wales State Water Corporation,Australian Government(Australian GovernmentCGIAR); Australian Research Council (ARC)(Australian Research Council); Australian Bureau of Meteorology; New South Wales State Water Corporation,"The World Climate Research Program's Working Group on Coupled Modeling is responsible for CMIP.

To test this hypothesis, we study the response of the atmosphere to Arctic amplification for a projected summer sea-ice-free period using an atmospheric model with prescribed surface boundary conditions from a state-of-the-art Earth system model. Besides a standard global warming simulation, we also conducted a sensitivity experiment with sea ice and sea surface temperature anomalies in the Arctic. We show that when global climate warms, enhancement of the northward heat transport provides the major contribution to decrease the northward temperature gradient in the polar troposphere in cold seasons, causing more oscillation of the planetary waves. However, while Arctic amplification significantly enhances near-surface air temperature in the polar region, it is not large enough to invoke an increased oscillation of the planetary waves.","[Meleshko, Valentin P.; Baidin, Andrey V.; Pavlova, Tatiana V.; Govorkova, Veronika A.] Voeikov Main Geophys Observ, St Petersburg, Russia; [Johannessen, Ola M.] Nansen Environm & Remote Sensing Ctr, N-5006 Bergen, Norway; [Johannessen, Ola M.] Nansen Sci Soc, N-5006 Bergen, Norway",Nansen Environmental & Remote Sensing Center (NERSC),"Meleshko, VP (corresponding author), Voeikov Main Geophys Observ, St Petersburg, Russia.",vpmeleshko@mail.ru,"Pavlova, Tatiana V/D-1456-2016",,"joint Russian-Norwegian projects NORRUS-CLIMARC [225032]; RFBR [12-05-93092 Norv_a, 15-06- 08163 a]",joint Russian-Norwegian projects NORRUS-CLIMARC; RFBR(Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR)),"This work has been supported by the joint Russian-Norwegian projects NORRUS-CLIMARC (225032) and RFBR (12-05-93092 Norv_a).

Transition studies can play a key role in this regard by creating new perspectives, approaches and understanding and helping to move society in the direction of sustainability.","[Koehler, Jonathan] Fraunhofer ISI, Breslauerstr 48, D-76139 Karlsruhe, Germany; [Geels, Frank W.; Boons, Frank; McMeekin, Andrew; Turnheim, Bruno; Welch, Dan] Univ Manchester, Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Kern, Florian] Inst Ecol Econ Res, Potsdamer Str 105, D-10785 Berlin, Germany; [Onsongo, Elsie] Int Inst Social Studies, Kortenaerkade 12, NL-2518 AX The Hague, Netherlands; [Wieczorek, Anna; Alkemade, Floortje] Eindhoven Univ Technol, POB 513, NL-5600 MB Eindhoven, Netherlands; [Avelino, Flor] Erasmus Univ, DRIFT, Postbus 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Bergek, Anna; Sanden, Bjorn] Chalmers Univ Technol, S-41296 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Funfschilling, Lea] Lund Univ, CIRCLE, Box 117, S-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Hess, David] Vanderbilt Univ, Nashville, TN 37235 USA; [Holtz, Georg] Wuppertal Inst Climate Environm & Energy, Wuppertal, Germany; [Hyysalo, Sampsa] Aalto Univ, Sch Art Design & Architecture, POB 11000, FI-00076 Aalto, Hyysalo, Finland; [Jenkins, Kirsten] Univ Brighton, Sch Environm & Technol, Brighton BN2 4GJ, E Sussex, England; [Markard, Jochen] ETH, Zurich, Switzerland; [Kivimaa, Paula; Martiskainen, Mari; Schot, Johan; Sovacool, Benjamin; Turnheim, Bruno] Univ Sussex, SPRU, Sussex House, Brighton BN1 9RH, E Sussex, England; [Muehlemeier, Marie Susan] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, EPFL ENAC IIE HERUS, GR C1 492,Batiment GR,Stn 2, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Nykvist, Bjorn] SEI, Box 24218, S-10451 Stockholm, Sweden; [Pel, Bonno] Univ Libre Bruxelles, IGEAT, CP 130-03,Av FD Roosevelt 50, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Raven, Rob] Monash Univ, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Rohracher, Harald] Linkoping Univ, SE-58183 Linkoping, Sweden; [Turnheim, Bruno] Univ Paris Est Marne Vallee, LISIS, Champs Sur Marne, France; [Wells, Peter] Cardiff Univ, Cardiff Business Sch, Aberconway Bldg,Colum Rd, Cardiff CF10 3EU, S Glam, Wales",University of Manchester; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Eindhoven University of Technology; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Chalmers University of Technology; Lund University; Vanderbilt University; Aalto University; University of Brighton; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; University of Sussex; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne; Stockholm Environment Institute; Universite Libre de Bruxelles; Monash University; Linkoping University; Universite Gustave-Eiffel; Cardiff University,"Kohler, J (corresponding author), Fraunhofer ISI, Breslauerstr 48, D-76139 Karlsruhe, Germany.",j.koehler@isi.fraunhofer.de,"Sovacool, Benjamin/Y-2392-2019; Kern, Florian/D-3727-2013; Bergek, Anna/A-3279-2009; Raven, Rob/V-5710-2019; Pel, Bonno/ABF-5605-2020; Martiskainen, Mari/ABA-7139-2021; Hyysalo, Sampsa/AAB-9280-2019; Markard, Jochen/L-5338-2013; Raven, Rob/C-3048-2017; Raven, Rob/GXG-2362-2022; Kivimaa, Paula/AAY-3418-2021; Geels, Frank/B-5771-2012; Alkemade, Floortje/AAL-9931-2021; Turnheim, Bruno/T-8280-2018; Boons, Frank/N-1203-2013","Sovacool, Benjamin/0000-0002-4794-9403; Kern, Florian/0000-0002-3968-330X; Bergek, Anna/0000-0003-1952-902X; Raven, Rob/0000-0002-6330-0831; Pel, Bonno/0000-0001-6863-2475; Markard, Jochen/0000-0002-6470-7211; Raven, Rob/0000-0002-6330-0831; Raven, Rob/0000-0002-6330-0831; Kivimaa, Paula/0000-0003-2812-8017; Geels, Frank/0000-0001-8778-4757; Alkemade, Floortje/0000-0002-2231-1913; Holtz, Georg/0000-0002-8248-9828; Martiskainen, Mari/0000-0002-3503-9197; Rohracher, Harald/0000-0003-3945-0183; Turnheim, Bruno/0000-0003-0395-2501; McMeekin, Andrew/0000-0001-5392-8361; Welch, Daniel/0000-0002-9433-863X; Hyysalo, Sampsa/0000-0003-0545-0011; Avelino, Flor/0000-0002-3709-9791; Boons, Frank/0000-0001-8743-7800",,,,,382,704,710,61,327,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2210-4224,2210-4232,,ENVIRON INNOV SOC TR,Environ.

As a continuation of the first effort, in collaboration with the Optical Communications Group at the NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), here we present a new generation of the ICI that can be used to monitor the cloud coverage of a site that can house a ground telescope dedicated to Earth-space optical communication paths. This new instrument, based around the FLIR Photon camera, expands the field of view (FOV) from 20 degrees to 50 degrees (up to 100 degrees in the latest version), reduces instrument size, reduces instrument cost, and extends the time between calibrations to hours instead of minutes. This has been accomplished by characterizing the changes in the output data for changes in the camera's internal temperature while viewing a constant source.

As such, the need to shift the publics' perspective and awareness of their interconnectedness with nature continues to drive education and communication programs that aim to deepen the connection between people and nature. This has led to mounting interest in integrating art with science as an influential communication practice to tackle complex concepts such as climate change and biodiversity loss. Art can provide alternative pathways of knowing and understanding the ecological crisis through provoking embodied, mindful and emotional responses. The arts create a dais for personal expression and reflection that traditional education and outreach methods typically cannot. Here, we explore an art-based approach to science communication and nature connectedness through a series of participatory ArtScience workshops. These workshops were delivered at The Living Pavilion, an Indigenous-led, temporary event space that took place in Melbourne, Australia. An integrated and transdisciplinary approach using interactive and participatory ArtScience workshops underpins the key outcomes and findings of this research. Our analysis revealed three themes emerging from the participants' experience: discovery, where participants learn or discover something new about biodiversity which is a thrilling and motivating experience; being in a state of flow, where participants are intrinsically motivated, focused and find joy in the activity; and attunement, where participants experience ecological awareness, relational knowing and a mindful connection to nature. Integrating the head, heart and hands' learning framework into the ArtScience workshops allowed a more nuanced and ground-up approach to our research and helped further understanding of how people create connections to more than human nature. The interrelated themes of discovery, flow and attunement open the potential for new ways of noticing and knowing nature, creating an embodied and holistic relationship with the more than human world. We suggest this is a strong foundation to deepen ecological awareness, which may lead to subtle yet positive changes in attitudes and behaviours towards biodiversity at a local level.

Setup and basic performance of the experiments are presented. The Last Glacial Maximum was one of the most extreme climate states during the Quaternary and conducting numerical modeling experiments of this period has long been a challenge for the paleoclimate community. We conducted a Last Glacial Maximum experiment with a long spin-up of nearly 9000 years. Globally, there was reasonable agreement between the anomalies relative to the present day derived from model climatology and those derived from proxy data archives, while some regional discrepancies remained. By changing orbital and greenhouse gas forcings, we conducted experiments for two interglacial periods: 6000 and 127 000 years before present. Model anomalies relative to the present day were qualitatively consistent with variations in solar forcing. However, anomalies in the model were smaller than those derived from proxy data archives, suggesting that processes that play a role in past interglacial climates remain lacking in this state-of-the-art model. We conducted transient simulations from 850 to 1850 CE and from 1850 to 2014 CE. Cooling in the model indicated a clear response to huge volcanic eruptions, consistent with paleo-proxy data. The contrast between cooling during the Little Ice Age and warming during the 20th to 21st centuries was represented well at the multidecadal timescale.","[Ohgaito, Rumi; Yamamoto, Akitomo; Hajima, Tomohiro; Abe, Manabu; Tatebe, Hiroaki; Abe-Ouchi, Ayako; Kawamiya, Michio] Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, Res Ctr Environm Modeling & Applicat, Kanazawa Ku, 3173-25 Showamachi, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2360001, Japan; [O'ishi, Ryouta; Abe-Ouchi, Ayako] Univ Tokyo, Atmosphere & Ocean Res Inst, Kashiwa, Chiba 2778568, Japan; [Abe-Ouchi, Ayako] Natl Inst Polar Res, Tachikawa, Tokyo 1908518, Japan",Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science & Technology (JAMSTEC); University of Tokyo; Research Organization of Information & Systems (ROIS); National Institute of Polar Research (NIPR) - Japan,"Ohgaito, R (corresponding author), Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, Res Ctr Environm Modeling & Applicat, Kanazawa Ku, 3173-25 Showamachi, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2360001, Japan.",ohgaito@jamstec.go.jp,"Yamamoto, Akitomo/F-2488-2013; Abe, Manabu/A-9221-2008; Kawamiya, Michio/GPS-7720-2022; Yamamoto, Akitomo/S-2759-2019; Abe-Ouchi, Ayako/M-6359-2013","Yamamoto, Akitomo/0000-0003-0314-4854; Yamamoto, Akitomo/0000-0003-0314-4854; Abe-Ouchi, Ayako/0000-0003-1745-5952; Ohgaito, Rumi/0000-0002-5717-1594; Abe, Manabu/0000-0002-4822-3321","TOUGOU project Integrated Research Program for Advancing Climate Models of Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology of Japan (MEXT) [JPMXD0717935715]; MEXT KAKENHI [17H06323, 17H06104]","TOUGOU project Integrated Research Program for Advancing Climate Models of Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology of Japan (MEXT); MEXT KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This work was supported by the TOUGOU project Integrated Research Program for Advancing Climate Models (grant no.

This model requires few input data and ensures the closure of the surface energy balance. This study aims to test the capability of such a model to realistically simulate evapotranspiration (ET) over a wide range of climates and vegetation covers. A weighting coefficient is introduced to calculate total ET from soil evaporation and vegetation transpiration over partially vegetated land surfaces, resulting in the MEP-ET model. Using this coefficient, the model outputs are compared with in situ observations of ET at eight FLUXNET sites across the continental United States. Results confirm the close agreement between the MEP-ET predicted daily ET and the corresponding observations at sites characterized by moderately limited water availability. Poor ET results were obtained under high water stress conditions. A regulation parameter was therefore introduced in the MEP-ET model to properly take into account the effects of soil water stress on stomata, yielding the generalized MEP-ET model. This parameter considerably reduced model biases under water stress conditions for various heterogeneous land surface sites. The generalized MEP-ET model outperforms several popular ET models, including Penman-Monteith (PM), modified Priestley-Taylor-Jet Propulsion Laboratory (PT-JPL), and air-relative-humidity-based two-source model (ARTS) at all test sites.","[Hajji, Islem; Nadeau, Daniel F.; Music, Biljana; Anctil, Francois] Univ Laval, Dept Civil & Water Engn, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Music, Biljana] Ouranos Consortium Reg Climatol & Adaptat Climate, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Wang, Jingfeng] Georgia Inst Technol, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA",Laval University; Ouranos Consortium; University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology,"Hajji, I (corresponding author), Univ Laval, Dept Civil & Water Engn, Quebec City, PQ, Canada.",islem.hajji.1@ulaval.ca,"wang, jing/GVT-8700-2022; wang, jing/GRS-7509-2022","Music, Biljana/0000-0002-8760-8996; Anctil, Francois/0000-0003-4568-4883","Ouranos Consortium on Regional Climatology and Adaptation to Climate Change, Hydro-Quebec; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; MDDELCC; Environment and Climate Change Canada [RDC-477125-14]; NSF CZO [EAR-1331846]; NASA NEWS [NNX15AT41G]","Ouranos Consortium on Regional Climatology and Adaptation to Climate Change, Hydro-Quebec; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR); MDDELCC; Environment and Climate Change Canada; NSF CZO(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)); NASA NEWS","The authors would like to acknowledge Anne Morais, who performed some preliminary tests with the MEP model.

In the existing studies, there is a lack of thermal comfort comparison between hot spots and cold spots. In this study, we selected the coastal city of Dalian in China as our study area and conducted field investigations on the thermal comfort of two landmark resorts, namely, a downtown commercial street and coastal leisure park. The study was conducted on typical summer days and consisted of interviewing several residents to understand their thermal comfort requirements. We investigated the thermal expectations of the interviewees through meteorological measurements and questionnaires. The universal thermal climate index (UTCI) was used to determine the thermal benchmarks of the on-site subjects. The results indicated that (1) globe temperature and air temperature were the most important factors that affected thermal comfort, followed by relative humidity and wind speed in summer daytime. (2) Shaded spaces are more comfortable than open spaces, and tree shade is preferred over artificial shade in coastal park. (3) The neutral UTCI (NUTCI) of the respondents were 24.1 degrees C (coastal park) and 26.0 degrees C (commercial street); the neutral UTCI ranges (NUTCIR) were 20.8-27.4 degrees C (coastal park) and 23.3-28.7 degrees C (commercial street). (4) The upper thermal acceptable range limits of the coastal park and commercial street were 30.2 and 32.1 degrees C, respectively, which were substantially higher than the upper NUTCIR limit, indicating that the residents in Dalian were well-adapted to hot weather. The results can provide a good reference for determining ideal design strategies to optimize the thermal environment of urban outdoor recreation spaces in summers and improve the quality of life in coastal cities.","[Zhang, Hongchi; Guo, Fei; Liu, Kaitong; Wang, Jie; Dong, Jing; Zhu, Peisheng] Dalian Univ Technol, Sch Architecture & Fine Art, Dalian, Peoples R China",Dalian University of Technology,"Guo, F (corresponding author), Dalian Univ Technol, Sch Architecture & Fine Art, Dalian, Peoples R China.",guofei@dlut.edu.cn,,"Guo, Fei/0000-0001-5739-9436",,,,,86,0,0,11,11,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-2565,,FRONT PUBLIC HEALTH,Front.

The multisectional discharge gap with length of 25 cm was formed by 25 pairs of anode-cathode plates. The narrow discharge width of <= 1 mm was realized. The buffer gases He and Ne with F-2 as the donor of fluorine were used. The maximum laser energy was approximate to 6 mJ by using Ne/Kr/F-2 mixture at a total pressure of 1.6...3.2 atm. The maximum laser efficiency was approximate to 1.4%. For measuring of the gas flow velocity in discharge gap the original optical method is used. The maximum gas velocity in the working gap is 19 m s(-1). The average output power of KrF laser is approximate to 12 W at the pulse repetition rate of 3...4 kHz. The relative root-mean-square deviation of the laser pulse energy is sigma = 2...3.8%. It was shown, that laser beam profile formation in a laser cavity essentially depends on a gradient of refractive index of the active medium Delta n, was made by free plasma electrons. The value of a refractive index gradient at the KrF laser wavelength is grad n >= 10(-5) cm(-1).","Russian Fed Nucl Ctr, VNIIEF, Sarov, Nizhni Novgorod, Russia",,"Andramanov, AV (corresponding author), Russian Fed Nucl Ctr, VNIIEF, Mira Prosp 37, Sarov, Nizhni Novgorod, Russia.",,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,1,SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING,BELLINGHAM,"1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010 USA",0277-786X,,0-8194-6328-0,P SOC PHOTO-OPT INS,,,2005,,,,,26304,26304,626304,10.1117/12.677388,http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.677388,,,7,Optics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Optics,BEQ94,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000238988600004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here we study time-accumulated impacts of the strongest observed droughts on vegetation. The results show that drought duration, the time during which surface soil moisture is below seasonal average, is a key diagnostic variable for predicting drought-integrated changes in (i) gross primary productivity, (ii) evapotranspiration, (iii) vegetation greenness, and (iv) crop yields. Drought-integrated anomalies in these vegetation-related variables scale linearly with drought duration with a slope depending on climate. In arid regions, the slope is steep such that vegetation drought response intensifies with drought duration, whereas in humid regions, it is small such that drought impacts on vegetation are weak even for long droughts. These emergent large-scale linearities are not well captured by state-of-the-art hydrological, land surface, and vegetation models. Overall, the linear relationship of drought duration versus vegetation response and crop yield reductions can serve as a model benchmark and support drought impact interpretation and prediction.","[Orth, Rene; Jung, Martin; Reichstein, Markus] Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, Dept Biogeochem Integrat, D-07745 Jena, Germany; [Destouni, Georgia] Stockholm Univ, Bolin Ctr Climate Res, Dept Phys Geog, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden",Max Planck Society; Stockholm University,"Orth, R (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, Dept Biogeochem Integrat, D-07745 Jena, Germany.",rene.orth@bgc-jena.mpg.de,"Reichstein, Markus/A-7494-2011; Destouni, Georgia/AAS-5375-2020; Orth, Rene/AAF-9279-2022; Orth, Rene/AAG-7034-2021; Orth, Rene/AFK-1975-2022","Reichstein, Markus/0000-0001-5736-1112; Destouni, Georgia/0000-0001-9408-4425; Orth, Rene/0000-0002-9853-921X",German Research Foundation (DFG) [391059971]; Swedish Research Council Formas [2016-02045],German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Swedish Research Council Formas(Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council Formas),This research has been supported by the German Research Foundation (DFG) (grant no. 391059971) and the Swedish Research Council Formas (grant no. 2016-02045).,,38,20,20,2,13,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1726-4170,1726-4189,,BIOGEOSCIENCES,Biogeosciences,15-May,2020,9,,,,2647,2656,,10.5194/bg-17-2647-2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-2647-2020,,,10,"Ecology; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology,LQ8TP,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,12/21/22,WOS:000535271400004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Based on the Stratospheric Water and OzOne Satellite Homogenized (SWOOSH) SWV data (100-1 hPa, 60 degrees S to 60 degrees N), variations in the middle and upper SWV are mainly investigated over the past two decades. Water vapour variations below 10 hPa are found to result from upward transport of the lower SWV. Using empirical orthogonal function analysis and regression analysis of the anomalous upper SWV variability, it is found that upper SWV variations have an 11-year period controlled by the solar cycle as well as a 2-year cycle regulated by the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO). Our results also show that state-of-the-art chemistry-climate models perform poorly in simulating the upper SWV variations. It is possibly because the effect of lower-middle SWV changes on the upper SWV variations is too strong in the simulations.","[Xie, Fei; Li, Jianping; Ma, Xuan] Beijing Normal Univ, Coll Global Change & Earth Syst Sci, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Xie, Fei; Li, Jianping; Ma, Xuan] Joint Ctr Global Change Studies, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Tian, Wenshou] Lanzhou Univ, Coll Atmospher Sci, Minist Educ, Key Lab Semiarid Climate Change, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Xin] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, State Key Lab Numer Modeling Atmospher Sci & Geop, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Xin] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China","Beijing Normal University; Lanzhou University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Li, JP (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, Coll Global Change & Earth Syst Sci GCESS, Xueyuan South Rd, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",ljp@bnu.edu.cn,"Li, Jianping/I-2661-2012","Li, Jianping/0000-0003-0625-1575; Zhou, Xin/0000-0001-5311-0092","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41225018, 41575039, 41305036]; 973 Program [2014CB441202]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); 973 Program(National Basic Research Program of China),"This work was jointly supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41225018, 41575039, and 41305036), 973 Program (2014CB441202).

Most of these models are the ocean and sea-ice components of the coupled climate models used in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) experiments. We mainly focus on the hydrography of the Arctic interior, the state of Atlantic Water layer and heat and volume transports at the gateways of the Davis Strait, the Bering Strait, the Fram Strait and the Barents Sea Opening. We found that there is a large spread in temperature in the Arctic Ocean between the models, and generally large differences compared to the observed temperature at intermediate depths. Warm bias models have a strong temperature anomaly of inflow of the Atlantic Water entering the Arctic Ocean through the Fram Strait. Another process that is not represented accurately in the CORE-II models is the formation of cold and dense water, originating on the eastern shelves. In the cold bias models, excessive cold water forms in the Barents Sea and spreads into the Arctic Ocean through the St. Anna Through. There is a large spread in the simulated mean heat and volume transports through the Fram Strait and the Barents Sea Opening. The models agree more on the decadal variability, to a large degree dictated by the common atmospheric forcing. We conclude that the CORE-II model study helps us to understand the crucial biases in the Arctic Ocean. The current coarse resolution state-of-the-art ocean models need to be improved in accurate representation of the Atlantic Water inflow into the Arctic and density currents coming from the shelves.

The wave climate in the past 60 years (1950-2009) was simulated by a third generation wave model driven by the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis wind data. Based on the statistical analysis of the numerical results, the mean wave fields and the extreme wave fields with 100-year and 50-year return period on the whole computational domain were obtained. The spatial variations of the wave fields show that the statistical waves decrease from south to north and from sea to coast in general, which can be associated with the local topography of the East China Sea. The seasonal variations show that the mean waves in the winter and autumn are slightly larger than those in the spring and summer, while the extreme waves in the summer are much larger than those in the other seasons, which is mainly due to the seasonal variation of monsoonal winds and the occurrence of typhoon events in the summer. The outputs of this paper are helpful to understand the distribution of mean and extreme waves in the East China Sea, and also useful to calculate the design waves in the coastal area if nearshore wave model like the SWAN model is introduced.","[Chen, Yongping] Hohai Univ, State Key Lab Hydrol Water Resources & Hydraul En, Nanjing 210098, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Xie, Dongmei; Zhang, Changkuan; Qian, Xuesheng] Hohai Univ, Coll Harbor Coastal & Offshore Engn, Nanjing 210098, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Hohai University; Hohai University,"Chen, YP (corresponding author), Hohai Univ, State Key Lab Hydrol Water Resources & Hydraul En, Nanjing 210098, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",ypchen@hhu.edu.cn; yezi123@hhu.edu.cn; ckzhang@hhu.edu.cn; 904957446@qq.com,"Chen, Yongping/ADH-6430-2022","Chen, Yongping/0000-0001-7976-7690",,,,,18,17,18,0,6,COASTAL EDUCATION & RESEARCH FOUNDATION,COCONUT CREEK,"5130 NW 54TH STREET, COCONUT CREEK, FL 33073 USA",0749-0208,1551-5036,,J COASTAL RES,J.

This study aims to evaluate fungal pollution in the indoor air environment, deposited dust and surfaces of works of art in a historic house museum Prince's Mohamed Ali museum, Giza, Egypt. Fungal pollution was evaluated at six museum's buildings differed in size, design, location and content, for 2 years of campaign. The deposited dust was collected once every 3 months, while surface swabs were collected twice, after 1 year and 2 years of exposure. Airborne fungal concentrations were evaluated using volumetric (Andersen 2 stage impactor) and gravimetric (index microbial air contamination) air samplers. Airborne fungal concentrations ranged within 47-784 CFU/m(3) and 175-40,250 CFU/m(2)/h using volumetric and gravimetric samplers, respectively. Indoor/outdoor ratio confirmed that outdoor environment was the main source of indoor fungal pollution. The rate of deposited dust was similar to 90-folds lower indoor than outdoor. Fungal concentrations associated deposited dust ranged between 10(2) and 10(4) CFU/g, representing a cause of concern. In respect to medium type, fungal diversity profile was in order of deposited dust >= airborne >= surfaces. Alternaria, Aspergillus and Cladosporium were the common fungal taxa. Secondary and tertiary fungal colonizers were detected after 2 years of exposure, indicating the presence of adequate moisture content inside the museum. No clear relationship patterns were found between microclimatic conditions and fungal culturability. The measured indoor fungal pollution and microclimatic conditions represented a problem for works of art and early indicator for fungal accumulation and biodegradation.","[Awad, Abdel Hameed A.; Saeed, Yuosra; Shakour, Alia A.; Abdellatif, Nasser M.; Ibrahim, Yasser H.] Natl Res Ctr, Air Pollut Res Dept, PO 12622, Giza, Egypt; [Elghanam, Manal; Elwakeel, Fatma] Natl Museum Egyptian Civilizat, Restorat & Conservat Dept, Cairo, Egypt",Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); National Research Centre (NRC),"Awad, AHA (corresponding author), Natl Res Ctr, Air Pollut Res Dept, PO 12622, Giza, Egypt.",abed196498@yahoo.com,"saeed, yuosra/N-5074-2018; Awad, Abdel Hameed/P-4485-2015","saeed, yuosra/0000-0002-5183-4342; Awad, Abdel Hameed/0000-0003-0784-9835","National Research Centre, Dokki, Giza, Egypt [11070108]","National Research Centre, Dokki, Giza, Egypt(National Research Centre (NRC))","This study was funded by Research Grant No. 11070108 from the National Research Centre, Dokki, Giza, Egypt.",,63,12,12,1,26,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0393-5965,1573-3025,,AEROBIOLOGIA,Aerobiologia,JUN,2020,2,,,,197,209,,10.1007/s10453-019-09623-w,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10453-019-09623-w,,20-Jan,13,Biology; Environmental Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,LR3BE,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000505323500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Part II: Interannual variability,JOURNAL OF CLIMATE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,LAND-SURFACE PROCESSES; FRANCE CLIMATE MODEL; EURASIAN SNOW COVER; INDIAN MONSOON; METEO-FRANCE; SIMPLE PARAMETERIZATION; ATMOSPHERIC PREDICTION; GLOBAL PRECIPITATION; PACIFIC SST; ASSIMILATION,"The relevance of soil moisture (SM) for simulating the interannual climate variability has not been much investigated until recently. Much more attention has been paid on SST anomalies, especially in the Tropics where the El Nino-Southern Oscillation represents the main mode of variability. In the present study, ensembles of atmospheric integrations based on the Action de Recherche Petit Echelle Grande Echelle (ARPEGE) climate model have been performed for two summer seasons: 1987 and 1988, respectively. The aim is to compare the relative impacts of using realistic boundary conditions of SST and SM on the simulated variability of the Asian and African monsoons. Besides control runs with interactive SM, sensitivity tests have been done in which SM is relaxed toward a state-of-the-art SM climatology, either globally or regionally over the monsoon domain. The simulations indicate that the variations of the Asian monsoon between 1987 and 1988 are mainly driven by SST anomalies. This result might be explained by the strong teleconnection with the ENSO and by a weak SM-precipitation feedback over south Asia (Part I of the study). The influence of SM is more obvious over Africa. The model needs both realistic SST and SM boundary conditions to simulate the observed variability of the Sahelian monsoon rainfall. The positive impact of the SM relaxation is not only due to a local mechanism whereby larger surface evaporation leads to larger precipitation. The best results are obtained when the relaxation is applied globally, suggesting that remote SM impacts also contribute to the improved simulation of the precipitation variability. A relationship between the Sahelian rainfall anomalies and the meridional wind anomalies over North Africa points out the possible influence of the Northern Hemisphere midlatitudes. The comparison of the low- and midtropospheric anomalies in the various pairs of experiments indicates that SM anomalies can trigger stationary waves over Europe, and thereby promote the intrusion of dry air from the midlatitudes into the Tropics. The study therefore emphasizes the relevance of SM for seasonal climate predictions, at least in summer in the Northern Hemisphere, and shows a dynamical interaction between the Tropics and extratropics.","Meteo France, UDC, GMGEC, CNRM, F-31057 Toulouse, France",Meteo France,"Douville, H (corresponding author), Meteo France, UDC, GMGEC, CNRM, 42 Ave Coriolis, F-31057 Toulouse, France.",,,,,,,,42,104,110,1,10,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0894-8755,,,J CLIMATE,J.

A large proportion of this energy is used for thermal comfort in buildings. This paper reviews thermal comfort research work and discusses the implications for building energy efficiency. Predicted mean vote works well in air-conditioned spaces but not naturally ventilated buildings, whereas adaptive models tend to have a broader comfort temperature ranges. Higher indoor temperatures in summertime conditions would lead to less prevalence of cooling systems as well as less cooling requirements. Raising summer set point temperature has good energy saving potential, in that it can be applied to both new and existing buildings. Further research and development work conducive to a better understanding of thermal comfort and energy conservation in buildings have been identified and discussed. These include (i) social-economic and cultural studies in general and post-occupancy evaluation of the built environment and the corresponding energy use in particular, and (ii) consideration of future climate scenarios in the analysis of co- and tri-generation schemes for HVAC applications, fuel mix and the associated energy planning/distribution systems in response to the expected changes in heating and cooling requirements due to climate change.

Cloud albedo enhancement has been proposed as a feasible geoengineering approach, but previous research suggests undesirable consequences of globally uniform cloud brightening. The present study uses GFDL's Climate Model version 2G (CM2G) global coupled model to simulate cloud albedo enhancement via increases in cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) to 1000 cm(-3) targeted at the marine stratus deck of the Pacific Ocean, where persistent low clouds suggest a regional approach to cloud brightening. The impact of this regional geoengineering on global circulation and climate in the presence of a 1% annual increase of CO2 was investigated. Surface temperatures returned to near pre-industrial levels over much of the globe with cloud modifications in place. In the first 40 years and over the 140-yr mean, significant cooling over the equatorial Pacific, continued Arctic warming, large precipitation changes over the western Pacific, and a westward compression and intensification of the Walker circulation were observed in response to cloud brightening. The cloud brightening caused a persistent La Nina condition associated with an increase in hurricane maximum potential intensity and genesis potential index, and decreased vertical wind shear between July and November in the tropical Atlantic, South China Sea, and to the east of Japan. Responses were similar with CCN = 500 cm(-3).","[Baughman, E.] Univ Washington, Dept Atmospher Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Gnanadesikan, A.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Baltimore, MD USA; [Degaetano, A.] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY USA; [Adcroft, A.] Princeton Univ, Atmospher & Ocean Sci Program, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; Johns Hopkins University; Cornell University; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Princeton University,"Baughman, E (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Dept Atmospher Sci, 408 ATG Bldg, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",eowynb@atmos.washington.edu,"Gnanadesikan, Anand/A-2397-2008; Adcroft, Alistair/E-5949-2010","Gnanadesikan, Anand/0000-0001-5784-1116; Adcroft, Alistair/0000-0001-9413-1017",NOAA Ernest F.

As the distribution of land and oceans differs between hemispheres and along latitudes, and atmospheric and oceanic circulation moves energy in all directions, the global pattern of coastal forms and processes due to climate-triggered conditions is very complex. Moreover, each single pattern is dynamic and subject to revision by changes in the climate. Some coastal zones (e.g. humid tropics or high polar zones) can be delimited rather easily, while others (e.g. temperate cool or those with alternating tropical climate) are more difficult to define. This paper provides a short overview of the state of the art in geographical zonality of coastal environments (not only of coastlines) from the poles to the Equator, with the main emphasis on cold and warm zones, pointing to climate-induced differences in the context of Quaternary climate change or those occurring over the last centuries and decades.","[Kelletat, D.

However, the issue of how to achieve resilient communities has received less attention. The present study aims to develop a framework for devising strategies in order to improve community resilience, particularly to slow-onset hazards such as drought. Hence, the relevant literature was reviewed in order to establish a conceptual framework. Afterwards, the researchers investigated the framework in the context of two local communities (Barazandeh and Abbas Abad neighborhood) in Iran, i.e., Isfahan, against drought as well as drying up of Zayandehrood River and its aqueducts using a qualitative research design and retroductive strategy. For data gathering, semi-structured in-depth interviews were used and data analysis was performed through qualitative content analysis using ATLAS-ti software. Totally, 32 interviews with authorities, experts, researchers, and other stakeholders were conducted in two local communities of Isfahan. Findings indicated that any policy making regarding community resilience should not be restricted to local community level and should be expanded to multiple scales of local, regional, urban, and national community levels, even considering the two major disaster risk reduction (DRR) and climate change adaptation (CCA) categories.","[Amirzadeh, Melika; Barakpour, Naser] Univ Art, Fac Architecture & Urban Planning, Tehran, Iran",,"Amirzadeh, M (corresponding author), 56 Sakhai St,Hafez Ave, Tehran 1136813518, Iran.",melika.amirzadeh@gmail.com; barakpoo@art.ac.ir,,"Amirzadeh, Melika/0000-0002-5223-818X",,,,,91,1,1,4,19,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-4209,,,INT J DISAST RISK RE,Int.

This uncertainty is a fundamental complexity faced in vulnerability assessments and adaptation planning. Robust decision making (RDM) and dynamic adaptive policy pathways (DAPP) are two state-of-the-art decision support methods that are useful in such situations. In this study we use RDM to identify a small set of conditions that cause unacceptable impacts from coastal flooding, signifying that an adaptation tipping point is reached. Flexible adaptation pathways can then be designed using the DAPP framework. The methodology is illustrated using a case study in Australia and underpinned by a geographic information system model. The results suggest that conditions identified in scenario discovery direct the attention of decision-makers towards a small number of uncertainties most influential on the vulnerability of a community to changing flood patterns. This can facilitate targeted data collection and coastal monitoring activities when resources are scarce. Importantly, it can also be employed to illustrate more broadly how uncontrolled societal development, land use and historic building regulations might exacerbate flood impacts in low-lying urban areas. Notwithstanding the challenges that remain around simulation modelling and detection of environmental change, the results from our study suggest that RDM can be embedded within a DAPP framework to better plan for changing coastal flood risks.","[Ramm, Timothy David; White, Christopher John] Univ Tasmania, Sch Engn & ICT, Private Bag 65, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Ramm, Timothy David] Bushfire & Nat Hazards Cooperat Res Ctr, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Watson, Christopher Stephen] Univ Tasmania, Sch Land & Food, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [White, Christopher John] Antarctic Climate & Ecosyst Cooperat Res Ctr, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [White, Christopher John] Univ Strathclyde, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland",University of Tasmania; University of Tasmania; Antarctic Climate & Ecosystems Cooperative Research Centre (ACE CRC); University of Strathclyde,"Ramm, TD (corresponding author), Univ Tasmania, Sch Engn & ICT, Private Bag 65, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia.",timothy.ramm@utas.edu.au,,"Ramm, Timothy/0000-0003-2496-7075; Watson, Christopher/0000-0002-7464-4592",Bushfire and Natural Hazards Cooperative Research Centre program [W0024280]; Australian Government Research Training Program scholarship,"Bushfire and Natural Hazards Cooperative Research Centre program(Australian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and ScienceCooperative Research Centres (CRC) Programme); Australian Government Research Training Program scholarship(Australian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and Science)","The authors are grateful for the financial support from the Bushfire and Natural Hazards Cooperative Research Centre program (W0024280) and the Australian Government Research Training Program scholarship.

The Rio de la Plata represents the largest fluvial discharge of the Southwest Atlantic (23.000 m(3)/s of water and 57.000.000 m(3)/year of sediment for the South Atlantic Ocean). The sub-surface and deep circulation are characterized by the confluence of water masses with contrasting thermohaline characteristics that determine the formation of well-marked hydrological fronts. In the continental shelf, this characteristic is represented by the Subtropical Shelf Front, as a shallow extension of the Brazil-Malvinas Confluence that occurs in deep water off the shelf. Although the knowledge of the regional circulation is acceptable, there are significant gaps in the knowledge related to the influence of this complex hydrological system on sedimentation processes. The objective of this work is to synthesize the present knowledge about the morpho-sedimentary characteristics of the Uruguayan Continental Margin and the processes involved in its formation. It also aims to discuss some knowledge gaps that are the subject of current research in the region. The knowledge reflects the scientific-technological evolution at a global level that is translated in the increase of recent works on the continental slope. Nowadays, most of the available information is associated with the inner shelf and upper slope. Starting from the basis of the close relationship between bathymetry and sedimentological distribution it is clear that efforts should be concentrated on the better understanding of the interaction between the shelf and the slope. The scientific knowledge regarding sedimentology and geochemistry along the Uruguayan Continental Margin is still, scarce and heterogeneous. However, it indicates complexity in the sedimentary coverture present both in the continental shelf and slope. The Uruguayan Continental Margin can be considered as an in situ laboratory to improve the understanding of the influence of oceanic hydrodynamics on the margin configuration, a key point to achieve better paleoceanographic interpretations. In this sense, due to the complexity of both modern hydrology and morphological configuration of the margin, it would be interesting to understand the relative importance of the control of each environment on surface sedimentation. A better understanding of the processes that link the near bottom circulation and continental slope features is needed. At the same time, this will allow deepening a new field of research in Uruguay, considering the joint and interrelated vision between sedimentary and oceanographic processes.","[Burone, Leticia; Franco-Fraguas, Paula; Ortega, Leonardo] Univ Republica, Inst Ciencias Ambient IECA, Fac Ciencias, Dept Oceanog Ciencia & Tecnol Marina Cincytema, Montevideo, Uruguay; [Mahiques, Michel] Univ Sao Paulo, IO, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Mahiques, Michel] Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Energia & Ambiente, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Ortega, Leonardo] Minist Ganaderia Agr & Pesca, Direcc Nacl Recursos Acuaticos DINARA, Dept Oceanog, Montevideo, Uruguay","Universidad de la Republica, Uruguay; Universidade de Sao Paulo; Universidade de Sao Paulo","Burone, L (corresponding author), Univ Republica, Inst Ciencias Ambient IECA, Fac Ciencias, Dept Oceanog Ciencia & Tecnol Marina Cincytema, Montevideo, Uruguay.",lburone@fcien.edu.uy,"Mahiques, Michel/D-1526-2010","Mahiques, Michel/0000-0002-5249-5610",,,,,69,5,5,0,3,"UNIV ESTADO RIO DE JANEIRO, FAC GEOLOGIA",RIO DE JANEIO,"DEPT PALEONTOLOGIA & ESTRATIGRAFIA, R SAO FRANCISCO XAVIER, 524-SALA 1050-BLOCO F, MARACANA, RIO DE JANEIO, CEP20550-013, BRAZIL",2447-9462,,,J SEDIMENT ENVIRON,J.

However, the relationship between SST in these two basins underwent a dramatic transformation beginning around 1985. Prior to that, SST variations associated with the Indian Ocean basin mode (IOB) and the interdecadal Pacific oscillation (IPO) were positively correlated, whereas afterward they weremuch less clearly synchronized. Evidence is presented from both observations and coupled state-of-the-art climate models that enhanced external forcing, particularly from increased anthropogenic greenhouse gases, was the principal cause of this changed relationship. Using coupled climate model experiments, it is shown that without external forcing, the evolution of the IOB would be strongly forced by variations in the IPO. However, with strong external forcing, the dynamical linkage between the IOB and the IPO weakens so that the negative phase IPO after 2000 is unable to force a negative phase IOB-induced cooling of the Indian Ocean. This changed relationship in the IOB and IPO led to unique SST patterns in the Indo-Pacific region after 2000, which favored exceptionally strong easterly trade winds over the tropical Pacific Ocean and a pronounced global warming hiatus in the first decade of the twenty-first century.","[Dong, Lu; Mcphaden, Michael J.] NOAA, Pacific Marine Environm Lab, 7600 Sand Point Way Ne, Seattle, WA 98115 USA",National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Dong, L (corresponding author), NOAA, Pacific Marine Environm Lab, 7600 Sand Point Way Ne, Seattle, WA 98115 USA.",lu.dong@noaa.gov,"Dong, Lu/K-6072-2019; McPhaden, Michael J/D-9799-2016","McPhaden, Michael J/0000-0002-8423-5805",National Research Council Research Associateship Award at NOAA/PMEL,National Research Council Research Associateship Award at NOAA/PMEL,"This research was performed while the first author held a National Research Council Research Associateship Award at NOAA/PMEL.

Particles are deposited physically on leaves and thus the process depends on leaf area and surface properties, which change throughout the year. Current state-of-the-art modeling accounts for these changes only by altering leaf longevity, which may be selected by vegetation type and geographic location. Particle removal also depends on weather conditions, which determine deposition and resuspension but generally do not consider properties that are specific to species or plant type. In this study, we modeled <2.5 mu m-diameter particulate-matter (PM2.5) deposition, resuspension, and removal from urban trees along a latitudinal gradient (Berlin, Munich, Rome) while comparing coniferous with broadleaf (deciduous and evergreen) tree types. Accordingly, we re-implemented the removal functionality from the i-Tree Eco model, investigated the uncertainty connected with parameterizations, and evaluated the efficiency of pollution mitigation depending on city conditions. We found that distinguishing deposition velocities between conifers and broadleaves is important for model results, i.e., because the removal efficiency of conifers is larger. Because of the higher wind speed, modeled PM2.5 deposition from conifers is especially large in Berlin compared to Munich and Rome. Extended periods without significant precipitation decrease the amount of PM2.5 removal because particles that are not occasionally washed from the leaves or needles are increasingly resuspended into the air. The model predicted this effect particularly during the long summer periods in Rome with only very little precipitation and may be responsible for less-efficient net removal from urban trees under climate change. Our analysis shows that the range of uncertainty in particle removal is large and that parameters have to be adjusted at least for major tree types if not only the species level. Furthermore, evergreen trees (broadleaved as well as coniferous) are predicted to be more effective at particle removal in northern regions than in Mediterranean cities, which is unexpected given the higher number of evergreens in southern cities. We discuss to what degree the effect of current PM2.5 abundance can be mitigated by species selection and which model improvements are needed.","[Pace, Rocco; Grote, Ruediger] KIT, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res Atmospher Environm Re, Karlsruhe, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology,"Grote, R (corresponding author), KIT, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res Atmospher Environm Re, Karlsruhe, Germany.",ruediger.grote@kit.edu,"Grote, Rüdiger/A-7350-2013; Pace, Rocco/ABA-4384-2020","Grote, Rüdiger/0000-0001-6893-6890; Pace, Rocco/0000-0002-3126-635X",Graduate School for Climate and Environment (GRACE); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; Open Access Publishing Fund of Karlsruhe Institute of Technology,Graduate School for Climate and Environment (GRACE); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Open Access Publishing Fund of Karlsruhe Institute of Technology,This research was supported by the Graduate School for Climate and Environment (GRACE).

Here, we use a fully coupled state-of-the-art global climate model to show that internal variability alone can produce such multidecadal periods of Antarctic SIA expansion even as atmospheric CO2 increases at observed rates and the planet warms. When our model is started from a relatively warm Southern Ocean state, Antarctic SIA sometimes (in one of three ensemble members) expands over multidecadal time scales at a rate comparable to that over the satellite era. SIA expansion occurs concurrently with rising atmospheric CO2 and warming global surface temperatures, and SIA trends by region and sector resemble those over the satellite era. Our results suggest that internal variability over long time scales in the Southern Ocean region may suffice to explain Antarctic SIA expansion over the satellite era.","[Singh, H.

The use of artistic media, instead of the prevalent technical and normative approaches to sustainability, allows to develop a reflective aesthetic enquiry, supporting a learning by heart, that should parallel analytical thinking. First, some key methodological elements to be applied to the playwriting process were defined. In particular, the process of interactive meaning-making among researchers, the multisensory knowing as forms of expression of the self and creativity and the experience of action. Moreover, the integration scientific knowledge, the communication of complexity and the focus of feelings, as element of authenticity, were considered. The methodological elements were integrated into the writing process of The Wizard of RobOz, inspired by Baum's novel, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. The play focused on human identity, in contrast to robot identity. Feelings (altruism and love) emerged as the core of good choices. The contrast between human and non-human agents, was, then, resolved considering the importance of design in obtaining a good integration between the two worlds. The topic of the play is relevant at societal level, due to the foreseen transition to a society 5.0, where humans and non-human agents will have to be integrated. The evaluation phase showed that a coherent and structure story was generated though the fixed technique. However, the perceived authenticity and resonance evaluation should be implemented with further work. The focus on social sustainability of robotization and AI constituted a novelty with respect to previous works, which only investigated the technological application of robots to theatre. the use of a scientific literature review to support the brainstorming phase served to implement the integration between science and art. Another element of innovation was the use of professional performers, instead than scientists. In parallel, this play allowed to apply an open source robot design, building and programming for theatrical purpose. The large participation of public to the representation showed the potentiality to transfer this playwriting technique into the domains of new education and communication projects. However, it would be recommended to integrate, within the research and meaning-making process, the other dimensions of sustainability, as well as a relevant presence of ethical reasoning.

Attempts to explain this feature have focused primarily on identifying the associated climate feedbacks, particularly the ice-albedo and lapse-rate feedbacks. Here we use a state-of-the-art global climate model in idealized seasonal forcing simulations to show that Arctic warming (especially in winter) and sea ice decline are particularly sensitive to radiative forcing in spring, during which the energy is effectively 'absorbed' by the ocean (through sea ice melt and ocean warming, amplified by the ice-albedo feedback) and consequently released to the lower atmosphere in autumn and winter, mainly along the sea ice periphery. In contrast, winter radiative forcing causes a more uniform response centered over the Arctic Ocean. This finding suggests that intermodel differences in simulated Arctic (winter) warming can to a considerable degree be attributed to model uncertainties in Arctic radiative fluxes, which peak in summer.","[Bintanja, R.; Krikken, F.] Royal Netherlands Meteorol Inst KNMI, Utrechtseweg 297, NL-3731 GH De Bilt, Netherlands; [Krikken, F.] Wageningen Univ, Meteorol & Air Qual Sect, Wageningen, Netherlands",Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute; Wageningen University & Research,"Bintanja, R (corresponding author), Royal Netherlands Meteorol Inst KNMI, Utrechtseweg 297, NL-3731 GH De Bilt, Netherlands.",bintanja@knmi.nl,,,,,,,29,21,21,0,29,NATURE RESEARCH,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",2045-2322,,,SCI REP-UK,Sci Rep,2-Dec,2016,,,,,,,38287,10.1038/srep38287,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep38287,,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,ED9JQ,27910905,"Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000389186400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

It is possible that recent gains in crop production arc mainly due to improvement of yield rather than growth of harvest area. However, it remains unclear about the geographical patterns of their relative contributions at fine scales and the possible mechanisms. Analysis of US maize production shows that maize production has increased significantly at a rate of 2.1%/year during 1980-2010. Although yield is the dominant factor contributing to production growth for the country as a whole, the importance of harvest area has become more evident with time. In 56% of US's maize growing counties, harvest area has also contributed more than yield to production changes. High spatial correlation between the change rates of harvest area and production is observed (R = 0.96), while a weak relation (R = 0.21) is found between the spatial patterns of yield and production. This suggests that harvest area has exerted the dominant role in modulating the spatial distribution pattern of maize production changes. Further analysis suggests that yield and harvest area respond differently to climate variability, which has great implications for adaptation strategies. Comparing 11 state-of-the-art crop model simulations against census data reveals large bias in the simulated spatial patterns of maize production. Nevertheless, such bias can be reduced substantially by incorporating the observed dynamics of harvest area, pointing to a potential pathway for future model improvement. This study highlights the importance of accounting for harvest area dynamics in assessing agricultural production empirically or with crop models. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, most coupled climate models misrepresent and/or underestimate these teleconnections, which have important implications on the periodicity of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Imposing the observed sea surface temperature over the tropical Atlantic from 1970 onwards, a pacemaker experiment is constructed using the second version of the Australian Community Climate and Earth System Simulator Coupled Model (ACCESS-CM2). Compared with control runs which reasonably simulate the interaction between ENSO and the north tropical Atlantic variability, the pacemaker experiment significantly improves the impact of the Atlantic Niiio/Niiia on ENSO. This enhanced teleconnection contributes to a more realistic ENSO periodicity compared with the control runs, thus suggesting that capturing the influence from equatorial Atlantic variability is important for an improved ENSO simulation. Plain Language Summary The El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is one of the most important drivers of extreme weather and climate events on Earth. Achieving a realistic ENSO, which is critical for accurate climate predictions and projections, has been a challenge for many climate models. For example, the ACCESS-CM2, one of the latest state-of-the-art climate models contributing to the sixth IPCC report, is found to only generate a quasi-biennial ENSO, failing to reproduce the observed dominant 3-7 year periodicities. Here, we show that the problem is at least partly due to the model's persistent and extensive tropical Atlantic warm bias. Replacing the tropical Atlantic SST with the observed over the course of 50-year simulation results in a more realistic ENSO variability. This result suggests that equatorial Atlantic variability plays an important role in shaping Pacific ENSO events. Improving the model's representation of the tropical Atlantic is therefore crucial for enhancing its skill in ENSO simulation, prediction, and projection.","[Bi, Daohua; Wang, Guojian; Cai, Wenju; Santoso, Agus; Sullivan, Arnold; Ng, Benjamin] CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere, Ctr Southern Hemisphere Oceans Res CSHOR, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Wang, Guojian; Cai, Wenju] Ocean Univ China, Inst Adv Ocean Studies, Key Lab Phys Oceanog, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Wang, Guojian; Cai, Wenju; Jia, Fan] Qingdao Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Santoso, Agus] Univ New South Wales, Australian Res Council ARC, Ctr Excellence Climate Extremes, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Sullivan, Arnold] Monash Univ, Sch Earth Atmosphere & Environm, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Jia, Fan] Chinese Acad Sci, CAS Key Lab Ocean Circulat & Waves, Inst Oceanol, Ctr Ocean Megasci, Beijing, Peoples R China","Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Ocean University of China; Qingdao National Laboratory for Marine Science & Technology; University of New South Wales Sydney; Monash University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Oceanology, CAS","Bi, DH; Wang, GJ (corresponding author), CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere, Ctr Southern Hemisphere Oceans Res CSHOR, Hobart, Tas, Australia.;Wang, GJ (corresponding author), Ocean Univ China, Inst Adv Ocean Studies, Key Lab Phys Oceanog, Qingdao, Peoples R China.;Wang, GJ (corresponding author), Qingdao Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol, Qingdao, Peoples R China.",dave.bi@csiro.au; guojian.wang@csiro.au,"Wang, Guojian/AAF-9297-2020; Santoso, Agus/P-1918-2019; Bi, Daohua/O-4508-2015; cai, wenju/C-2864-2012","Wang, Guojian/0000-0002-8881-7394; Santoso, Agus/0000-0001-7749-8124; cai, wenju/0000-0001-6520-0829",Centre for Southern Hemisphere Oceans Research; Australian Government,Centre for Southern Hemisphere Oceans Research; Australian Government(Australian GovernmentCGIAR),"This work is supported by the Centre for Southern Hemisphere Oceans Research, a joint research center between QNLM and CSIRO.

Green roofs mitigate urban heat islands, improve urban air quality, buffer stormwater and improve runoff quality, absorb emissions and increase the thermal efficiency of buildings. Green roofs therefore are an interesting technology for densely populated urban areas in Thailand, but still at a rather low diffusion stage. The aim of this paper thus is to identify and quantify the main factors that influence green roof adoption using a mixed-method research design. The relevant factors were (1) identified in a qualitative content analysis, (2) structured alongside two dimensions (internal/external and positive/negative factors), and (3) quantitatively assessed in an Analytical Hierarchy Process based on expert judgments. The analysis yields three main factors influencing the diffusion potential of green roofs in Thailand: While their potential to mitigate urban heat islands is the most important facilitating factor, the lack of proper subsidy schemes as well as the lack of knowledge and skilled workforce, represent major adoption barriers. In spite of the discussed challenges and issues, a light trend towards greener buildings can already be observed among planners, architects, and also on policy levels in Thailand. If the identified issues are addressed properly, green roofs eventually could become a significant contributor to climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts in Thailand. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

However, optical properties of aerosols from individual wildfire smoke plumes and their resultant impact on regional climate are highly variable. Therefore, there is a critical need for observations that can constrain the partitioning between different types of aerosols. Here we present the apparent influence of regional ecosystem types on optical properties of wildfire-induced aerosols based on remote sensing observations from two satellite instruments and three ground stations. The independent observations commonly show that the ratio of the absorbing aerosols is significantly lower in smoke plumes from the Maritime Continent than those from Central Africa, so that their impacts on regional climate are different. The observed light-absorbing properties of wildfire-induced aerosols are explained by dominant ecosystem types such as wet peatlands for the Maritime Continent and dry savannah for Central Africa, respectively. These results suggest that the wildfire-aerosol-climate feedback processes largely depend on the terrestrial environments from which the fires originate. These feedbacks also interact with climate under greenhouse warming. Our analysis shows that aerosol optical properties retrieved based on satellite observations are critical in assessing wildfire-induced aerosols forcing in climate models. The optical properties of carbonaceous aerosol mixtures used by state-of-the-art chemistry climate models may overestimate emissions for absorbing aerosols from wildfires over the Maritime Continent.","[Lee, Huikyo; Kalashnikova, Olga] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA USA; [Jeong, Su-Jong] Seoul Natl Univ, Grad Sch Environm Studies, Environm Planning Dept, Seoul, South Korea; [Tosca, Mika] Art Inst Chicago, Chicago, IL 60603 USA; [Kim, Sang-Woo] Seoul Natl Univ, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Seoul, South Korea; [Kug, Jong-Seong] Pohang Univ Sci & Technol, Div Environm Sci & Engn, Pohang, South Korea",California Institute of Technology; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL); Seoul National University (SNU); School of the Art Institute of Chicago; Seoul National University (SNU); Pohang University of Science & Technology (POSTECH),"Jeong, SJ (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, Grad Sch Environm Studies, Environm Planning Dept, Seoul, South Korea.",sujong@snu.ac.kr,"Tosca, Mika/AAJ-5419-2020; Kalashnikova, Olga V/E-6818-2019; Tosca, Mika/J-4908-2015","Kalashnikova, Olga V/0000-0002-1330-1529; Tosca, Mika/0000-0003-1301-8341; KUG, JONG-SEONG/0000-0003-2251-2579; Lee, Huikyo/0000-0003-3754-3204",KMA RD Program [KMIPA 2015-2011],KMA RD Program,"This work was performed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under contract with NASA.

An intensive and complex multi-cropping irrigated agricultural system has developed here to optimize the use of these mountain water resources in conjunction with monsoonal rainfall. Snow and glacier melt thereby modulate the seasonal pattern of river flows and, together with groundwater, provide water when rainfall is scarce. Climate change is expected to weaken this modulating effect, with potentially strong effects on food production in one of the world's breadbaskets. Here we quantify the space-, time-and crop-specific dependence of agriculture in the Indo-Gangetic Plains on mountain water resources, using a coupled state-of-the-art, high-resolution, cryosphere-hydrology-crop model. We show that dependence varies strongly in space and time and is highest in the Indus basin, where in the pre-monsoon season up to 60% of the total irrigation withdrawals originate from mountain snow and glacier melt, and that it contributes an additional 11% to total crop production. Although dependence in the floodplains of the Ganges is comparatively lower, meltwater is still essential during the dry season, in particular for crops such as sugar cane. The dependency on meltwater in the Brahmaputra is negligible. In total, 129 million farmers in the Indus and Ganges substantially depend on snow and glacier melt for their livelihoods. Snow and glacier melt provides enough water to grow food crops to sustain a balanced diet for 38 million people. These findings provide important information for agricultural and climate change adaptation policies in a climate change hot spot where shifts in water availability and demand are projected as a result of climate change and socio-economic growth.","[Biemans, H.; Siderius, C.] Wageningen Univ & Res, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Biemans, H.; Nepal, S.; Wester, P.; Shrestha, A.

Part B: Comfort,JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING,,,English,Article,,,,,,Rammed earth; Thermal comfort; Environmental monitoring; Rural housing,AUSTRALIA,"Heating and cooling of residential buildings consumes around ten percent of the world's energy. One approach for reducing these costs is solar passive design using building materials with high thermal mass such as Rammed Earth (RE). Several studies have examined the performance of small RE structures or individual rooms within RE dwellings and have demonstrated the material's capacity to provide comfortable internal conditions passively. However, there is a lack of scientific evidence about the performance of full RE houses in real-world settings spanning several seasons. This research investigated the thermal performance of RE structures prior to occupancy and over the course of an occupied year. Two custom-designed houses were built in the hot-arid city of Kalgoorlie-Boulder, Western Australia: one with traditional solid RE walls and the other with walls with an insulating polystyrene core (iRE). Otherwise the houses were identical in orientation and design. This study is presented in two Parts. Part A examined the houses' performance without occupants: This Part examines their occupied behaviour in terms of the occupants' thermal comfort. Comfort was examined using qualitative and quantitative data from sensor measurements as well as occupant surveys and simulated results using state-of-the-art assessment software BERS Pro. Comfort scores for measured and simulated data were determined using rules built into BERS Pro's engine Chenath and a modified version of the ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 55-2010 SET* method. Real-world thermal comfort of both houses outperformed their simulated behaviours: occupants reported comfortable conditions throughout Summer (outdoor maxima 45 degrees C) and Winter (minima 1 degrees C) with no artificial cooling and with minimal heating. The Chenath and SET* methods agreed with comfort performance in Summer but scored Winter performance poorly. Similarly, simulations predicted poor performance in Winter. Consequently, predicted energy demands due to heating were likely far higher than those needed in reality. This paper therefore argues from measured evidence of RE and iRE houses for the suitability of RE as a sustainable building material able to curb domestic energy demands. Collected data has been made publicly available for future analyses.","[Beckett, C. T.

The assessment process under IPBES (the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services) has however shown that the current predominantly biophysical and economic models and scenario processes for exploring the future of biodiversity, ecosystem services and their contributions to human wellbeing are insufficient to capture the complexity and context-specific nature of the problems facing these sectors. Several important challenges have been identified that require a more in-depth analysis of where more imaginative scenario efforts can be undertaken to address this gap. In this paper, we identify six key characteristics necessary for scenario processes: adaptability across diverse contexts, inclusion of diverse knowledge and value systems, legitimate stakeholder engagement that foregrounds the role of power and politics, an ability to grapple with uncertainty, individual and collective thinking mechanisms and relevance to policy making. We compared four cases of imaginative, arts-based scenario processes that each offer aspects of meeting these criteria. These approaches emphasise the importance of engaging the imagination of those involved in a process and harnessing it as a tool for identifying and conceptualising more transformative future trajectories. Drawing on the existing literature, we argue that there is value in fostering more inclusive and creative participatory processes that acknowledge the importance of understanding multiple value systems and relationships in order to reimagine a more inclusive and just future. Based on this, we reflect on future research to understand the transformative role that imagination can play in altering and enhancing knowledge-making for global assessments, including IPBES. We conclude that creative scenario co-development processes that promote imagination and create an opening for more empathetic responses should be considered as complementary tools within the suite of methodologies used for future IPBES scenario development.","[Pereira, Laura; Sitas, Nadia] Stellenbosch Univ, Ctr Complex Syst Transit, Stellenbosch, South Africa; [Pereira, Laura] City Univ London, Ctr Food Policy, London, England; [Pereira, Laura; Jimenez-Aceituno, Amanda; Merrie, Andrew] Univ Stockholm, Stockholm Resilience Ctr, Stockholm, Sweden; [Sitas, Nadia] Stellenbosch Univ, Dept Conservat Ecol & Entomol, Stellenbosch, South Africa; [Ravera, Federica] Univ Evora, ICAAM, Evora, Portugal; [Ravera, Federica] Univ Victoria, Cent Univ Catalunya, Chair Agroecol, Vic, Spain",Stellenbosch University; City University London; Stockholm University; Stellenbosch University; University of Evora,"Pereira, L (corresponding author), Stellenbosch Univ, Ctr Complex Syst Transit, Stellenbosch, South Africa.;Pereira, L (corresponding author), City Univ London, Ctr Food Policy, London, England.;Pereira, L (corresponding author), Univ Stockholm, Stockholm Resilience Ctr, Stockholm, Sweden.",pereira.laura18@gmail.com,"Pereira, Laura M./L-7258-2013","Pereira, Laura M./0000-0002-4996-7234; Ravera, Federica/0000-0001-6282-6236; Sitas, Nadia/0000-0003-0888-8617; Jimenez Aceituno, Amanda/0000-0002-5950-4751","Sida; Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness (Spain) [IJCI-2015-25586]; AXA Research Fund (2017-2019); MISTRA (The Swedish foundation for strategic environmental research); FORMAS (Swedish Research Council for Sustainable Development); National Research Foundation of South Africa [115300]","Sida; Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness (Spain)(Spanish Government); AXA Research Fund (2017-2019); MISTRA (The Swedish foundation for strategic environmental research); FORMAS (Swedish Research Council for Sustainable Development); National Research Foundation of South Africa(National Research Foundation - South Africa)","The authors would like to thank the anonymous reviewers of the manuscript for their insightful comments and -suggestions for strengthening the paper.

Some field tests investigated the microclimate, the gaseous and particulate air pollution and the biological contamination to suggest mitigative techniques that may reduce the potential for damage in the long run. Potential risk factors are generated by imbalance in temperature and humidity, generated by heating, air conditioning or ventilating system (HVAC), or the building structures, exchange of outside air, or large visitor numbers. HVAC may also enhance indoor gaseous pollution. Plants and carpets represent potential niches for bacterial colonisation. Pollutants and particles have been recognised having partly external and partly internal origin. Tourism has a direct negative impact, i.e. transport of external particles, release of heat, vapour and CO2, as well as generation of turbulence, which increases the deposition rate of particulate matter. However, the main problem is that the microclimate has been planned for the well being of visitors during only the visiting time, disregarding the needs of conservation that requires a constant climate by day and by night. In some of these cases, better environmental niches have been obtained with the help of showcases. In other cases, showcases worsened the situation, especially when incandescent lamps were put inside. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Strange feelings, bizarre deviations and psychotic anxieties generate a mixture of feelings and emotions sometimes difficult to represent and hardly bearable for the caregivers. Our aim in this paper is to study this kind of feeling in the perspective of the atmosphere and its association with symbolization processes. Method. - We first propose to study the atmosphere of the atmosphere, i.e. what surrounds it, the defining envelope, with several examples from the arts and sciences. We also study how this concept has been used in the domains of health, care and phenomenology. It is then mainly from the viewpoint of psychoanalytical theory, using a few clinical cases, that we go on to analyze the relationship between symbolization and atmospheric processes in more detail. Results. - The atmosphere appears as a rich and fruitful notion from both theoretical and clinical points of view. It meets and extends several notions that are relatively close, such as climate and ambience. Discussion. - There is a specific atmosphere essential for symbolization, enabling the emergence of processes of symbolization of the atmosphere, which in psychotic patients are expressed in an amplified manner during the emergence of psychotic reminiscences. Conclusion. - The shapelessness of the atmosphere can be considered as one of the most archaic forms of expression of psychic reality, close to the first envelopes of the psyche and breath. The sensitivity of the clinician to this concept and its implications in the dynamics of transference and counter-transference, especially with psychotic patients, enables the emergence and the expression of early, traumatic experiences through what we propose to call atmospheric signifiers.

This study was designed to analyze the effects of air temperature on the risk of deaths for all and specific causes in two regions of Brazil (Florianopolis and Recife), between 2005 and 2014. The association between temperature and mortality was performed through the fitting of a quasi-Poisson non-linear lag distributed model. The association between air temperature and mortality was identified for both regions. The results showed that temperature exerted influence on both general mortality indicators and specific causes, with hot and cold temperatures bringing different impacts to the studied regions. Cerebrovascular and cardiovascular deaths were more sensitive to cold temperatures for Florianopolis and Recife, respectively. Based on the application of the very-well documented state-of-the-art methodology, it was possible to conclude that there was evidence that extreme air temperature influenced general and specific deaths. These results highlighted the importance of consolidating evidence and research in tropical countries such as Brazil as a way of understanding climate change and its impacts on health indicators.","[Peres, Wolmir Ercides; Nunes, Baltazar] Univ Nova Lisboa, Escola Nacl Saude Publ, Ctr Invest Saude Publ, P-1600560 Lisbon, Portugal; [Peres, Wolmir Ercides] Univ Pernambuco, Curso Grad Enfermagem, Campus Petrolina, BR-56328900 Petrolina, PE, Brazil; [Ribeiro, Andreia F.

In this study, two contrasting model tests are performed to investigate the sensitivity of precipitation around steep slopes. The first model solves a true moisture advection equation, whereas the second solves an artificial advection equation with an additional moisture divergence term. It is shown that the orographic precipitation can be largely impacted by this term. Excessive (insufficient) precipitation amounts at the high (low) parts of the steep slopes decrease (increase) when the moisture divergence term is added. The precipitation changes between the two models are primarily attributed to large-scale precipitation, which is directly associated with water vapor saturation and condensation. Numerical weather prediction experiments using these two models suggest that precipitation differences between the models emerge shortly after the model startup. The implications of the results are also discussed.","[Zhang, Yi; Li, Jian] China Meteorol Adm, Chinese Acad Meteorol Sci, LaSW, 46 Zhongguancun South St, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yi] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, LASG, Beijing, Peoples R China","China Meteorological Administration; Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences (CAMS); Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS","Zhang, Y (corresponding author), China Meteorol Adm, Chinese Acad Meteorol Sci, LaSW, 46 Zhongguancun South St, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.;Zhang, Y (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, LASG, Beijing, Peoples R China.",zhange@camscma.cn,"Zhang, Yi/L-7562-2019; LI, Jian/E-3497-2018","Zhang, Yi/0000-0002-6823-7915; LI, Jian/0000-0001-7223-0022","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41505066, 41322034, 41221064]; Basic Scientific Research and Operation Foundation of the Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences [2015Z002, 2015Y005]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Basic Scientific Research and Operation Foundation of the Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences,"The authors are grateful to two anonymous reviewers for the comments, which helped improve the original manuscript.

The tropical CRE is binned according to midtropospheric vertical velocities and then regressed in frequency space versus tropical mean surface temperatures. Low clouds play a leading role in the relationship between clouds and surface temperature variability, amplifying ENSO-induced surface temperature anomalies through thermodynamically driven changes in the shortwave CRE. Changes in CRE driven by changes in the large-scale dynamics have a minor influence on surface temperature variability. It is shown that the regression coefficients at ENSO frequencies between the CRE in regions of moderate subsidence and of weak ascent, and tropical mean surface temperatures are well correlated with models' climate sensitivities, constituting a potential emergent constraint on climate sensitivity. Plain Language Summary The relationship between clouds and surface temperature anomalies generated by El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events is still poorly understood. This is concerning, both because we would like to better understand the dynamics of ENSO and because we would like to use this relationship to constrain the long-term response of clouds to increased CO2 concentrations. Here a new approach is taken to investigate the behavior of different cloud types during ENSO events in ENSO events in state-of-the-art climate models. It is found that in the models, ENSO-induced surface temperature anomalies are mainly affected by changes in the amount of low clouds, with variations in high clouds and in the relative fraction of low versus high clouds playing minor roles. Furthermore, the changes in low clouds during ENSO events are strongly correlated with the models' climate sensitivities and their long-term warming in response to doubling CO2 concentrations. This shows that the changes of tropical low clouds during ENSO events can be used to better constrain the warming that Earth will experience if CO2 concentrations continue increasing.","[Lutsko, Nicholas J.] MIT, Dept Earth Atmospher & Planetary Sci, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Lutsko, NJ (corresponding author), MIT, Dept Earth Atmospher & Planetary Sci, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",lutsko@mit.edu,,,NSF [AGS-1623218],NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"I thank Max Popp, Cristian Proistosescu, Mike Byrne, and Paul O'Gorman for helpful conversations and comments on earlier versions of this manuscript and two anonymous reviewers for constructive comments, which improved the manuscript significantly.

Our systematic review presents a systems understanding of the nexus between drought and antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence in HIV-positive individuals in the African setting. Narrative synthesis of 111 studies retrieved from Web of Science, PubMed/MEDLINE, and PsycINFO suggests that livelihoods and economic conditions, comorbidities and ART regimens, human mobility, and psychobehavioural dispositions and support systems interact in complex ways in the drought-ART adherence nexus in Africa. Economic and livelihood-related challenges appear to impose the strongest impact on human interactions, actions, and systems that culminate in non-adherence. Indeed, the complex pathways identified by our systems approach emphasise the need for more integrated research approaches to understanding this phenomenon and developing interventions.","[Orievulu, Kingsley Stephen; Ngema, Sthembile; Baisley, Kathy; Tanser, Frank; Ngwenya, Nothando; Seeley, Janet; Hanekom, Willem; Herbst, Kobus; Iwuji, Collins C.] Africa Hlth Res Inst, Kwa Zulu, South Africa; [Orievulu, Kingsley Stephen] Univ Johannesburg, Ctr Africa China Studies, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Orievulu, Kingsley Stephen; Ayeb-Karlsson, Sonja; Iwuji, Collins C.] Univ Sussex, Dept Global Hlth & Infect, Brighton & Sussex Med Sch, Brighton BN1 9PX, E Sussex, England; [Ayeb-Karlsson, Sonja] United Nations Univ, Inst Environm & Human Secur, Bonn, Germany; [Ayeb-Karlsson, Sonja] UCL, Inst Risk & Disaster Reduct, London, England; [Hanekom, Willem] UCL, Div Infect & Immun, London, England; [Baisley, Kathy] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Fac Epidemiol & Populat Hlth, London, England; [Seeley, Janet] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Global Hlth & Dev Dept, London, England; [Tanser, Frank] Univ Lincoln, Lincoln Inst Hlth, Lincoln, England; [Ngwenya, Nothando] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Nursing & Publ Hlth, Durban, South Africa; [Herbst, Kobus] DSI MRC South African Populat Res Infrastruct Net, Durban, South Africa; [Ayeb-Karlsson, Sonja; Kniveton, Dominic] Univ Sussex, Sch Global Studies, Brighton, E Sussex, England",Africa Health Research Institute; University of Johannesburg; University of Brighton; University of Sussex; University of London; University College London; University of London; University College London; University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine; University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine; University of Lincoln; University of Kwazulu Natal; University of Sussex,"Iwuji, CC (corresponding author), Univ Sussex, Dept Global Hlth & Infect, Brighton & Sussex Med Sch, Brighton BN1 9PX, E Sussex, England.",c.iwuji@bsms.ac.uk,,"Ayeb-Karlsson, Dr Sonja/0000-0001-6124-2730; Seeley, Janet/0000-0002-0583-5272; Orievulu, Kingsley/0000-0002-6154-3231; Iwuji, Collins/0000-0003-2045-1717",social science department at the Africa Health Research Institute (AHRI); Wellcome (Wellcome Strategic Core award) [201433/Z/16/A]; SSRP [SSRP2017-009],social science department at the Africa Health Research Institute (AHRI); Wellcome (Wellcome Strategic Core award); SSRP,"The authors are grateful to the social science department at the Africa Health Research Institute (AHRI) for their support in the development of this piece of research.

This results in large uncertainties when predicting cirrus radiative effects and their role in Earth's climate system. The goal of this case study is to simulate the composition, and thus activation conditions, of ice nucleating particles (INPs) to evaluate their contribution to heterogeneous cirrus ice formation in relation to homogeneous ice nucleation. For this, the regional model COSMO-Aerosols and Reactive Trace Gases (COSMO-ART) was used to simulate a synoptic cirrus cloud over Texas on 13 April 2011. The simulated INP composition was then compared to measured ice residual particle (IRP) composition from the actual event obtained during the NASA Midlatitude Airborne Cirrus Properties Experiment (MACPEX) aircraft campaign. These IRP measurements indicated that the dominance of heterogeneous ice nucleation was mainly driven by mineral dust with contributions from a variety of other particle types. Applying realistic activation thresholds and concentrations of airborne transported mineral dust and biomass-burning particles, the model implementing the heterogeneous ice nucleation parameterization scheme of Ullrich et al. is able to reproduce the overall dominating ice formation mechanism in contrast to the model simulation with the scheme of Phillips et al. However, the model showed flaws in reproducing the IRP composition.","[Ullrich, Romy; Hoose, Corinna; Vogel, Bernhard; Rieger, Daniel; Leisner, Thomas; Moehler, Ottmar] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Karlsruhe, Germany; [Cziczo, Daniel J.] MIT, Dept Earth Atmospher & Planetary Sci, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Cziczo, Daniel J.] MIT, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Froyd, Karl D.; Schwarz, Joshua P.; Perring, Anne E.] NOAA, Chem Sci Div, Earth Syst Res Lab, Boulder, CO USA; [Bui, Thaopaul V.] NASA, Ames Res Ctr, Atmospher Sci Branch, Mountain View, CA USA; [Schmitt, Carl G.] NCAR, Mesoscale & Microscale Meteorol Lab, Dynam & Phys Meteorol, Boulder, CO USA; [Rieger, Daniel] German Meteorol Serv, Offenbach, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Ames Research Center; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; Deutscher Wetterdienst,"Hoose, C (corresponding author), Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Karlsruhe, Germany.",corinna.hoose@kit.edu,"Leisner, Thomas K/A-2391-2013; Schmitt, Carl G/P-5490-2015; Hoose, Corinna/A-4295-2009; Froyd, Karl D/H-6607-2013; Vogel, Bernhard/A-9558-2013; Möhler, Ottmar/J-9426-2012; PERRING, ANNE/G-4597-2013","Leisner, Thomas K/0000-0001-9693-7671; Hoose, Corinna/0000-0003-2827-5789; Froyd, Karl D/0000-0002-0797-6028; Vogel, Bernhard/0000-0002-8894-0165; Möhler, Ottmar/0000-0002-7551-9814; PERRING, ANNE/0000-0003-2231-7503; Ullrich, Romy/0000-0002-8162-4354; Schmitt, Carl/0000-0003-3829-6970","NASA Earth Science Division Atmospheric Composition program [NNH11AQ58UI, NNX13AO15G]; NOAA Atmospheric Chemistry, Carbon Cycle and Climate program [3RR1GFK-P00]; NASA Radiation Science program [NNH14AX25I]; NASA Upper Atmospheric Research program [NNH09ZDA001N-MACPEX]; NASA MACPEX [NNX11AC07G]; Helmholtz Association through the Helmholtz Climate Initiative REKLIM; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) through the research unit INUIT [FOR 1525, HO4612/1-1, HO4612/1-2, MO 668/4-1, MO 668/4-2]; President's Initiative and Networking Fund","NASA Earth Science Division Atmospheric Composition program; NOAA Atmospheric Chemistry, Carbon Cycle and Climate program; NASA Radiation Science program(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); NASA Upper Atmospheric Research program(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); NASA MACPEX; Helmholtz Association through the Helmholtz Climate Initiative REKLIM; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) through the research unit INUIT(German Research Foundation (DFG)); President's Initiative and Networking Fund","The authors thankDr. HeikeVogel and Konrad Deetz for providing the GLC, FCOVER, HWSD, and GME datasets.

Here, we provide a state-of-the-art review of the use of SIA for assessing anthropogenic pressures on natural ecosystems, in order to establish current knowledge gaps and identify promising applications for evaluating the ecological status of marine coastal waters. Specifically, the potential of SIA to provide food web-scale indicators for estimating cumulative anthropogenic pressures is addressed. The review indicates that the methodology has been used for virtually the whole spectrum of human pressures known to influence marine ecosystems. However, only the effects of chemical pollution, release of dissolved and particulate nutrients, and invasive species have been extensively investigated. For the first two pressures, substantial efforts have been made to implement isotopic quantitative approaches and metrics for inter-system comparisons; however, with the exception of nutrient release, the majority of aquatic studies have been carried out in freshwater systems, and only limited information is available on marine environments. In particular, the effects of invasive species on coastal habitats have received scant attention. Trophic position of indicator species emerges as the isotopic metric most ubiquitously adopted for measuring the impact of anthropogenic pressures. Conversely, the application of other recently implemented metrics, proven to be highly effective in integrating information on the spatial-temporal dynamics of aquatic food webs, is to date still limited. The potential of stable isotope analysis to provide a unifying methodological-theoretical framework for effective, inter-ecosystem comparisons of both single and multiple anthropogenic pressures is emphasised. Additionally, a plea for the implementation and intercalibration of community-scale isotopic metrics is made, in order to provide useful tools and indicators for current and future environmental legislative initiatives.

More recently, the research on this realm has grown rapidly, with diverse research activity covering a wide range of application areas. Considering the sustainable development goals, the innovative business models have brought a competitive advantage to improve the sustainability performance of organizations. The concept of the sustainable business model describes the rationale of how an organization creates, delivers, and captures value, in economic, social, cultural, or other contexts, in a sustainable way. The process of sustainable business model construction forms an innovative part of a business strategy. Different industries and businesses have utilized sustainable business models' concept to satisfy their economic, environmental, and social goals simultaneously. However, the success, popularity, and progress of sustainable business models in different application domains are not clear. To explore this issue, this research provides a comprehensive review of sustainable business models literature in various application areas. Notable sustainable business models are identified and further classified in fourteen unique categories, and in every category, the progress -either failure or success- has been reviewed, and the research gaps are discussed. Taxonomy of the applications includes innovation, management and marketing, entrepreneurship, energy, fashion, healthcare, agri-food, supply chain management, circular economy, developing countries, engineering, construction and real estate, mobility and transportation, and hospitality. The key contribution of this study is that it provides an insight into the state of the art of sustainable business models in various application areas and future research directions. This paper concludes that popularity and the success rate of sustainable business models in all application domains have been increased along with the increasing use of advanced technologies.","[Nosratabadi, Saeed] Szent Istvan Univ, Inst Business Studies, H-2103 Godollo, Hungary; [Mosavi, Amir] Oxford Brookes Univ, Sch Built Environm, Oxford OX3 0BP, England; [Mosavi, Amir] Obuda Univ, Inst Automat, Kando Kalman Fac Elect Engn, H-1034 Budapest, Hungary; [Mosavi, Amir; Rakotonirainy, Andry] QUT, CARRS Q, 130 Victoria Pk Rd, Kelvin Grove, Qld 4059, Australia; [Shamshirband, Shahaboddin] Ton Duc Thang Univ, Dept Management Sci & Technol Dev, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Shamshirband, Shahaboddin] Ton Duc Thang Univ, Fac Informat Technol, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Inst Sustainable Construct, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Rakotonirainy, Andry] QUT, IHBI, 130 Victoria Pk Rd, Kelvin Grove, Qld 4059, Australia; [Chau, Kwok Wing] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Hung Hom, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Hungarian University of Agriculture & Life Sciences; Oxford Brookes University; Obuda University; Queensland University of Technology (QUT); Ton Duc Thang University; Ton Duc Thang University; Vilnius Gediminas Technical University; Queensland University of Technology (QUT); Hong Kong Polytechnic University,"Shamshirband, S (corresponding author), Ton Duc Thang Univ, Dept Management Sci & Technol Dev, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.;Shamshirband, S (corresponding author), Ton Duc Thang Univ, Fac Informat Technol, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.",Saeed.Nosratabadi@phd.uni-szie.hu; amir.mosavi@kvk.uni-obuda.hu; shahaboddin.shamshirband@tdtu.edu.vn; edmundas.zavadskas@vgtu.lt; r.andry@qut.edu.au; dr.kwok-wing.chau@polyu.edu.hk,"Josephberg, Richard/D-9585-2019; S.Band, Shahab/AAD-3311-2021; S.Band, Shahab/ABI-7388-2020; Nosratabadi, Saeed/P-7552-2016; Chau, Kwok-wing/E-5235-2011; Mosavi, Amir/I-7440-2018; Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras/Q-6048-2018","Josephberg, Richard/0000-0002-1375-2362; S.Band, Shahab/0000-0002-8963-731X; Nosratabadi, Saeed/0000-0002-0440-6564; Chau, Kwok-wing/0000-0001-6457-161X; Mosavi, Amir/0000-0003-4842-0613; Rakotonirainy, Andry/0000-0002-2144-4909; Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras/0000-0002-3201-949X",Australian Education International at Queensland University of Technology; CARRS-Q,Australian Education International at Queensland University of Technology; CARRS-Q,"Authors would like to thank Professor Ramin Keivani from the School of the Built Environment, Oxford Brookes University, for his constructive comments and support during the preparation of this paper.

This would be approximately 5% of all emissions caused by tropical land use changes. Despite the significance of the phenomenon, these emissions are rarely measured, monitored, or addressed in climate change mitigation plans, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa. Therefore, we demonstrated a state-of-the-art approach predicting AGC loss of Zanzibar City Region under multiple alternative urban planning scenarios between 2013 and 2030. The AGC information was modeled based on field measured forest inventory sample plots and RapidEye satellite data from 2013, while the future urban expansion model was calibrated with data of happened expansion between 2004, 2009 and 2013, and geospatial independent variables influencing the expansion patterns. This model was then projected until 2030, while alternative urban planning scenarios were integrated to the model by modifying the geospatial variables. The combination of these two models indicates that 42,000 Mg or 15% of total AGC in Zanzibar City Region can be anticipated to be lost by 2030 due to urban expansion. Majority of the loss will take place in the agroforest and fruit tree plantations surrounding the city, while natural forest face limited impacts. None of the tested alternative urban planning scenarios significantly impact the loss of AGC compared to the business-as-usual scenario. Therefore, alternative policies and plans are seriously needed to address the issue in Zanzibar. These could include promoting urban densification, directing urban expansion to low carbon areas, improving soil carbon management, and preparing an urban forestry and greenery strategy. All in all, the study indicates that data and methods are available for monitoring and predicting the phenomenon in Sub-Saharan Africa. Research based on a comparable methodology should be produced from all the main cities in the region that are surrounded by significant carbon storages and facing high urban expansion rates to support climate change mitigation.","[Kukkonen, M.

The GOSAT main sensor is a Fourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS) named TANSO-FTS, which covers a wide terrestrial radiation spectrum including CO2 absorption bands at 1.6 mu m (Short Wavelength InfraRed, SWIR), and 15 mu m (Thermal InfraRed, TIR). The former band is used to estimate columnar concentration of CO2; the latter is used to retrieve the vertical profile of CO2 in the upper atmosphere above the ca. 700 hPa pressure level. We adopt the maximum a posteriori method (MAP) to retrieve the vertical profile of CO2 concentrations using the meteorological analysis data for temperature profiles. Key techniques for retrieving CO2 concentrations are 1) reduction of temperature estimation error through channel selection, 2) optimization of the a priori CO2 profile based on the output from a CO2 transport model, and 3) usage of SWIR data as an additional constraint in retrieval of vertical profiles of CO2. Simulation studies using the output from a CO2 transport model show that, although thermal infrared spectrum has poor sensitivity to the CO2 concentration change in the lower atmosphere, particularly in the boundary layer, we expect that CO2 concentration profiles in the lower atmosphere can be reproduced statistically by combining CO2 columnar data derived from SWIR as an additional constraint in retrieving a CO2 concentration profile from TIR data.","[Imasu, Ryoichi; Saitoh, Naoko; Niwa, Yosuke] Univ Tokyo, Ctr Climate Syst Res, Kashiwa, Chiba 2778568, Japan",University of Tokyo,"Imasu, R (corresponding author), Univ Tokyo, Ctr Climate Syst Res, Gen Res Bldg,Room 315b,5-1-5 Kashiwanoha, Kashiwa, Chiba 2778568, Japan.",,"Niwa, Yosuke/H-7004-2018",,,,,,10,4,4,1,5,SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING,BELLINGHAM,"1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010 USA",0277-786X,,978-0-8194-6902-1,P SOC PHOTO-OPT INS,,,2007,,,,,F7440,F7440,,10.1117/12.737796,http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.737796,,,10,Remote Sensing; Optics; Telecommunications,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Remote Sensing; Optics; Telecommunications,BHH79,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000253362700013,View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper focuses on the significance of climate change on the future representation of the Samanalawewa Reservoir Hydropower Project using an architecture of the Cascaded ANFIS algorithm. Moreover, we assess the capacity of the novel Cascaded ANFIS algorithm for handling regression problems and compare the results with the state-of-art regression models. The inputs to this system were the rainfall data of selected weather stations inside the catchment. The future rainfalls were generated using Global Climate Models at RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 and corrected for their biases. The Cascaded ANFIS algorithm was selected to handle this regression problem by comparing the best algorithm among the state-of-the-art regression models, such as RNN, LSTM, and GRU. The Cascaded ANFIS could forecast the power generation with a minimum error of 1.01, whereas the second-best algorithm, GRU, scored a 6.5 error rate. The predictions were carried out for the near-future and mid-future and compared against the previous work. The results clearly show the algorithm can predict power generation's variation with rainfall with a slight error rate. This research can be utilized in numerous areas for hydropower development.","[Rathnayake, Namal; Hoshino, Yukinobu] Kochi Univ Technol, Sch Syst Engn, 185 Miyanokuchi, Kami, Kochi 7828502, Japan; [Rathnayake, Upaka] Fac Engn, Sri Lanka Inst Informat Technolog, Dept Civil Engn, Malabe 10115, Sri Lanka; [Tuan Linh Dang] Hanoi Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Informat & Commun Technol, 1 Dai Co Viet Rd, Hanoi 100000, Vietnam",Kochi University Technology; Hanoi University of Science & Technology,"Rathnayake, N (corresponding author), Kochi Univ Technol, Sch Syst Engn, 185 Miyanokuchi, Kami, Kochi 7828502, Japan.",246007h@gs.kochi-tech.ac.jp; upaka.r@sliit.lk; linh.dangtuan@hust.edu.vn; hoshino.yukinobu@kochi-tech.ac.jp,"Sanjeewa, Upaka/S-2435-2019","Sanjeewa, Upaka/0000-0002-7341-9078; Hoshino, Yukinobu/0000-0001-5285-8007; Rathnayake, Namal/0000-0002-5235-8552; Dang, Tuan Linh/0000-0002-9966-5576",,,,,50,3,3,8,9,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1424-8220,,SENSORS-BASEL,Sensors,APR,2022,8,,,,,,2905,10.3390/s22082905,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s22082905,,,18,"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation,0R2ZL,35458890,"gold, Green Published",,,12/21/22,WOS:000785469700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this work the spread in the simulation of climatological SST in the tropical Atlantic by 24 CMIP5 models is examined, and its relationship with the mean systematic biases in the region is explored. The modes of intermodel variability are estimated by applying principal component (PC) analysis to the SSTs in the region 70 degrees W-20 degrees E, 20 degrees S-20 degrees N. The intermodel variability is approximately explained by the first three modes. The first mode is related to warmer SSTs in the basin, shows worldwide connections with same-signed loads over most of the tropics, and is connected with lower low cloud cover over the eastern parts of the subtropical oceans. The second mode is restricted to the Atlantic, where it shows negative and positive loads to the north and south of the equator, respectively, and is connected to a too weak Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC). The third mode is related to the double intertropical convergence zone bias in the Pacific and to an interhemispheric asymmetry in the net radiation at the top of the atmosphere. The structure of the second mode is closer to the mean bias than that of the others in the tropical Atlantic, suggesting that model difficulties with the AMOC contribute to the regional biases.","[Mohino, Elsa; Rodriguez-fonseca, Belen; Losada, Teresa; Polo, Irene] Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Phys Earth & Astrophys, Madrid, Spain; [Rodriguez-fonseca, Belen] Inst Geociencias, Madrid, Spain; [Mechoso, C.

Self-compassion, characterized by the ability to be kind to oneself, to see one's experiences as part of the larger human experience and have a balanced awareness to one's emotions and thoughts, was recently studied as a stepping stone to performance optimization and personal development. Despite a mistrust of this concept in the sports world, various studies show its benefits within athletes. A major question remains the environment that fosters or hinders the development of self-compassion: when role models extend compassionate attitudes, does it allow performers to respond in more self-compassionate ways? The relationship between self-compassion, mental toughness, and social environment is still unclear and is an important direction for future research within performers. This semi-systematic literature review aims at proposing an overview of the state of the art regarding self-compassion, mental toughness, and the influence of performer's, and social environments. Sixteen studies were retrieved. We conclude that the number of multi-day intervention programs and longitudinal studies should be increased. The studies should also consider assessing the specific aspects of performance culture and settings. In addition, overall performance-specific measures could be developed to assess general levels of self-compassion. The development of a theoretical framework explaining how self-compassion affects a performer, the role of their entourage and its link to other psychological resources, such as mental toughness, could help to better understand this concept.","[Kosirnik, Celine; Philippe, Roberta Antonini] Univ Lausanne, Inst Sports Sci, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Pomini, Valentino] Univ Lausanne, Inst Psychol, Lausanne, Switzerland",University of Lausanne; University of Lausanne,"Kosirnik, C (corresponding author), Univ Lausanne, Inst Sports Sci, Lausanne, Switzerland.",celine.kosirnik@unil.ch,,"Antonini Philippe, Roberta/0000-0001-9650-5174",,,,,73,0,0,4,4,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-1078,,,FRONT PSYCHOL,Front.

The SMCM configuration we use here has been tuned to represent observed tropical convection by associating the occurrence and strength of deep convection to midtropospheric vertical velocity and relative humidity. We show that compared to the ECHAM6.3 standard model, the SMCM-modified version shows improved capacity to simulate features of tropical intraseasonal variability, including MJO-like disturbances, without significantly distorting the mean model climate. This improvement goes in hand with ameliorated coupling of atmospheric convection to tropospheric moisture and spatiotemporal coherence of tropical convection compared to reanalysis and observations. We attribute these effects to (i) improved coupling of triggering and suppression of deep convective events to the model's large-scale environment and (ii) the observations-informed closure formulation which leads to an overall reduction of deep convective mass fluxes. Sensitivity tests show that while (ii) improves the convection-moisture relationship, it is (i) which improves the spatiotemporal coherence of tropical rainfall and is important for MJO simulation. Further, the simulated spatiotemporal coherence of tropical rainfall is an intrinsic property of the convection schemes themselves and not of their parameters. We stress that this study serves as a proof-of-concept and motivates further efforts towards building a novel convection parameterization with the SMCM as a central element.","[Peters, Karsten; Jakob, Christian; Mobis, Benjamin] Monash Univ, Sch Earth Atmosphere & Environm, ARC Ctr Excellence Climate Syst Sci, Clayton, Vic, Australia; [Peters, Karsten; Crueger, Traute] Max Planck Inst Meteorol, Hamburg, Germany",Monash University; Max Planck Society,"Peters, K (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Sch Earth Atmosphere & Environm, ARC Ctr Excellence Climate Syst Sci, Clayton, Vic, Australia.;Peters, K (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Meteorol, Hamburg, Germany.",karsten.peters@mpimet.mpg.de,"Jakob, Christian/A-1082-2010; Peters-von Gehlen, Karsten/A-3164-2012","Jakob, Christian/0000-0002-5012-3207; Peters-von Gehlen, Karsten/0000-0003-0158-2957",Australian Research Council within the Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science [CE110001028]; Deutscher Wetterdienst (DWD) within the Hans-Ertel-Zentrum for Weather Research (HErZ); Cluster of Excellence CliSAP'' of Hamburg funded through the German Science Foundation (DFG) [EXC177],Australian Research Council within the Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science(Australian Research Council); Deutscher Wetterdienst (DWD) within the Hans-Ertel-Zentrum for Weather Research (HErZ); Cluster of Excellence CliSAP'' of Hamburg funded through the German Science Foundation (DFG),"We thank Mirjana Sakradzija and two anonymous reviewers for constructive comments on earlier versions of the manuscript and Robert Pincus for his supportive role as editor during the review process.

This study investigates the responses of the EASM from observations, theoretical, and modeling perspectives. Observational and theoretical evidence demonstrates that, in contrast to the dramatic global-warming trend within the past 50 years, the regional-mean EASM rainfall is basically dominated by considerable interannual-to-decadal fluctuations, concurrent with enhanced precipitation over the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and over southern Japan and suppressed rainfall amount over the South China and Philippine Seas. From 1958 through 2008, the EASM circulation exhibits a southward shift in its major components (the subtropical westerly jet stream, the western Pacific Ocean subtropical high, the subtropical mei-yu-baiu-changma front, and the tropical monsoon trough). Such a southward shift is very likely or in part due to the meridional asymmetric warming with the most prominent surface warming in the midhigh latitudes (45 degrees-60 degrees N), which induces a weakened meridional thermal contrast over eastern Asia. Another notable feature is the enhanced ENSO EASM relationship within the past 50 years, which is opposite to the ISM. Fourteen state-of-the-art coupled models from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change show that the EASM strength does not respond with any pronounced trend to the global-warming A1B forcing scenario (with an atmospheric CO2 concentration of 720 ppm) but shows interannual-to-decadal variations in the twenty-first century (2000-99). These results indicate that the primary response of the EASM to a warming climate may be a position change instead of an intensity change, and such position change may lead to spatial coexistence of floods and droughts over eastern Asia as has been observed in the past 50 years.","[Li, Jianping] Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Numer Modeling Atmospher Sci & Geop, Inst Atmospher Phys, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Wu, Zhiwei] Environm Canada, Meteorol Res Div, Dorval, PQ, Canada; [Jiang, Zhihong; He, Jinhai] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Minist Educ, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster, Nanjing, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology","Li, JP (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Numer Modeling Atmospher Sci & Geop, Inst Atmospher Phys, POB 9804, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.",ljp@lasg.iap.ac.cn,"Li, Jianping/I-2661-2012","Li, Jianping/0000-0003-0625-1575; Wu, Zhiwei/0000-0002-8163-2215",National Basic Research Program 973 [2010CB950400]; Special Research Program for Public Welfare (Meteorology) of China [GYHY200906016]; Sustainable Agriculture Environment Systems (SAGES) through the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC),National Basic Research Program 973(National Basic Research Program of China); Special Research Program for Public Welfare (Meteorology) of China; Sustainable Agriculture Environment Systems (SAGES) through the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)),The authors acknowledge the reviewers' helpful and important comments.

Estimating surface flux using satellite remote sensing techniques is one possible answer to this challenge. In this paper, we introduce J-OFURO3, a third-generation data set developed by the Japanese Ocean Flux Data Sets with Use of Remote-Sensing Observations (J-OFURO) research project, which represents a significant improvement from older data sets as the result of research and development conducted from several perspectives. J-OFURO3 offers data sets for surface heat, momentum, freshwater fluxes, and related parameters over the global oceans (except regions of sea ice) from 1988 to 2013. The surface flux data, based on a 0.25A degrees grid system, have a higher spatial resolution and are more accurate than the previous efforts. This has been achieved through the adopting of the state-of-the-art algorithms that estimate the near-surface air specific humidity and the improvement of techniques using observations from multi-satellite sensors. Comparisons with in situ observations using a systematic system developed along with the J-OFURO3 data set confirmed these improvements in accuracy, as did comparisons with other data sets. J-OFURO3 data are of good quality, facilitating a clearer understanding of more fine-scale ocean-atmosphere features (such as ocean fronts, mesoscale eddies, and geographic features) and their effects on surface fluxes. The information contained in this long-term (26 year) data set is demonstrably beneficial to understanding climate change and its relationship to oceans and the atmosphere.","[Tomita, Hiroyuki] Nagoya Univ, Inst Space Earth Environm Res, Chikusa Ku, F3-1 200 Furo Cho, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan; [Hihara, Tsutomu] Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, Applicat Lab, Kanazawa Ku, 3173-25 Showa Machi, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2360001, Japan; [Kako, Shin'ichiro] Kagoshima Univ, Dept Ocean Civil Engn, Grad Sch Sci & Engn, 1-21-40 Korimoto, Kagoshima 8900065, Japan; [Kubota, Masahisa] Tokai Univ, Inst Ocean Res & Dev, Shimizu Ku, 3-20-1 Orido, Shizuoka, Shizuoka 4248610, Japan; [Kutsuwada, Kunio] Tokai Univ, Sch Marine Sci & Technol, Shimizu Ku, 3-20-1 Orido, Shizuoka, Shizuoka 4248610, Japan",Nagoya University; Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science & Technology (JAMSTEC); Kagoshima University; Tokai University; Tokai University,"Tomita, H (corresponding author), Nagoya Univ, Inst Space Earth Environm Res, Chikusa Ku, F3-1 200 Furo Cho, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan.",tomita@isee.nagoya-u.ac.jp,"Tomita, Hiroyuki/AAA-3635-2019","Tomita, Hiroyuki/0000-0003-2693-2044; Kako, Shin'ichiro/0000-0001-7383-9315; Hihara, Tsutomu/0000-0003-1244-0946; Kutsuwada, Kunio/0000-0003-2691-687X","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI [JP26287114, JP15H03726, JP18H03737]; Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA); Institute for Space-Earth Environmental Research of Nagoya University; Institute of Oceanic Research and Development of Tokai University [2016-5, 2017-5]","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA); Institute for Space-Earth Environmental Research of Nagoya University; Institute of Oceanic Research and Development of Tokai University","This research was supported partly by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI Grant Numbers JP26287114, JP15H03726, JP18H03737, with support also provided by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), Institute for Space-Earth Environmental Research of Nagoya University, and the Institute of Oceanic Research and Development of Tokai University (Grants #2016-5 and 2017-5).

Food security is currently a huge challenge to feed 10 billion people by 2050. Crop domestication through conventional approaches is not good enough to meet the food demands and unable to fast-track the crop yields. Also, intensive breeding and rigorous selection of superior traits causes genetic erosion and eliminates stress-responsive genes, which makes crops more prone to abiotic stresses. Salt stress is one of the most prevailing abiotic stresses that poses severe damages to crop yield around the globe. Recent innovations in state-of-the-art genomics and transcriptomics technologies have paved the way to develop salinity tolerant crops. De novo domestication is one of the promising strategies to produce superior new crop genotypes through exploiting the genetic diversity of crop wild relatives (CWRs). Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies open new avenues to identifying the unique salt-tolerant genes from the CWRs. It has also led to the assembly of highly annotated crop pan-genomes to snapshot the full landscape of genetic diversity and recapture the huge gene repertoire of a species. The identification of novel genes alongside the emergence of cutting-edge genome editing tools for targeted manipulation renders de novo domestication a way forward for developing salt-tolerance crops. However, some risk associated with gene-edited crops causes hurdles for its adoption worldwide. Halophytes-led breeding for salinity tolerance provides an alternative strategy to identify extremely salt tolerant varieties that can be used to develop new crops to mitigate salinity stress.","[Razzaq, Ali; Saleem, Fozia] Univ Agr Faisalabad, Ctr Agr Biochem & Biotechnol, Faisalabad, Pakistan; [Wani, Shabir Hussain] Sher E Kashmir Univ Agr Sci & Technol Kashmir, Div Genet & Plant Breeding, Srinagar, India; [Abdelmohsen, Shaimaa A.

Earth observation (EO) technology provides an informative source of data covering the entire globe in a spatial and spectral resolution appropriate to better and easier classify land cover than traditional or conventional methods. The use of high spatial and spectral resolution imagery from EO sensors has increased remarkably over the past decades, as more and more platforms are placed in orbit and new applications emerge in different disciplines. The aim of the present review work is to provide all-inclusive critical reflection on the state of the art in the use of EO technology in LULC mapping and change detection. The emphasis is placed on providing an overview of the different EO datasets, spatial-spectral-temporal characteristics of satellite data and classification approaches employed in land cover classification. The review concludes providing recommendations and remarks on what should be done in order to overcome hurdle faced using above-mentioned problems in LULC mapping. This also provides information on using classifier algorithms depending upon the data types and dependent on the regional ecosystems. One of the main messages of our review is that in future, there will be a need to assemble techniques specifically used in LULC with their merit and demerits that will enable more comprehensive understanding at regional or global scale and improve understanding between different land cover relationship and variability among them and these remains to be seen.","[Pandey, Prem Chandra] Shiv Nadar Univ, Sch Nat Sci, Ctr Environm Sci & Engn, Greater Noida, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Koutsias, Nikos] Univ Patras, Dept Environm Engn, Agrinion, Greece; [Petropoulos, George P.] Tech Univ Crete, Sch Mineral & Resources Engn, Iraklion, Greece; [Petropoulos, George P.] Hellen Agr Org Demeter, Inst Ind & Forage Crops, Dept Soil & Water Resources, Larisa, Greece; [Srivastava, Prashant K.] Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Environm & Sustainable Dev, Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Srivastava, Prashant K.] Banaras Hindu Univ, DST Mahamana Ctr Excellence Climate Change Res, Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Ben Dor, Eyal] Tel Aviv Univ, Fac Exact Sci, Sch Geosci, Dept Geog, Tel Aviv, Israel",Shiv Nadar University; University of Patras; Technical University of Crete; Banaras Hindu University (BHU); Banaras Hindu University (BHU); Tel Aviv University,"Pandey, PC (corresponding author), Shiv Nadar Univ, Sch Nat Sci, Ctr Environm Sci & Engn, Greater Noida, Uttar Pradesh, India.",prem26bit@gmail.com,"Pandey, Prem Chandra/D-4409-2011; Petropoulos, George P./N-5810-2019; Petropoulos, George P/F-2384-2013","Pandey, Prem Chandra/0000-0002-0049-1415; Petropoulos, George P./0000-0003-1442-1423; Petropoulos, George P/0000-0003-1442-1423; Ben Dor, Eyal/0000-0001-6757-3530; Koutsias, Nikos/0000-0001-8898-9957; Srivastava, Prashant K./0000-0002-4155-630X",EU Marie Curie Project-ENViSIon-EO [752094]; Tel Aviv University Israel; Shiv Nadar University India,EU Marie Curie Project-ENViSIon-EO; Tel Aviv University Israel; Shiv Nadar University India,Dr. G.P.'s contribution to this work has been supported by the EU Marie Curie Project-ENViSIon-EO (project contract-ID 752094).

However, the aquaculture industry faces several challenges with regard to producing a profitable, ethical and environmentally sustainable product, which are exacerbated by the ongoing intensification of operations and increasingly extreme and unpredictable climate conditions. Fortunately, bio-sensors capable of measuring a range of environmental, behavioural and physiological variables (e.g. temperature, dissolved gases, depth, acceleration, ventilation, heart rate, blood flow, glucose and l-lactic acid) represent exciting and innovative tools for assessing the health and welfare of farmed animals in aquaculture. Here, we illustrate how these state-of-the-art technologies can provide unique insights into variables pertaining to the inner workings of the animal to elucidate animal-environment interactions throughout the production cycle, as well as to provide insights on how farmed animals perceive and respond to environmental and anthropogenic perturbations. Using examples based on current challenges (i.e. sub-optimal feeding strategies, sub-optimal animal welfare and environmental changes), we discuss how bio-sensors can contribute towards optimizing the growth, health and welfare of farmed animals under dynamically changing on-farm conditions. While bio-sensors currently represent tools that are primarily used for research, the continuing development and refinement of these technologies may eventually allow farmers to use real-time environmental and physiological data from their stock as 'early warning systems' and/or for refining day-to-day operations to ethically and sustainably optimize production.

The high temperature and the oxidizing conditions in the off-gas stream of the electric arc furnace form iron (III) oxide (Fe2O3), zinc oxide (ZnO), and zinc ferrite (ZnOFe2O3). The state-of-the-art treatment for EAFD is based on the carbothermal reduction of these oxides, thus emitting CO2 contributing to the anthropogenic climate change. An approach to reduce CO2 emissions in electric arc furnace dust recycling processes is the substitution of carbon with hydrogen. An economic evaluation of the industrial feasibility of using hydrogen requires basic research dealing with its influence on the reduction behavior of iron (III) oxide (Fe2O3) and zinc ferrite (ZnOFe2O3), when carbon is substituted with hydrogen. This work gives an insight into thermogravimetric analysis comparing carbon monoxide and hydrogen-based reduction in a tailor-made thermogravimetric analysis instrument (TGA). It allows for the investigation of sole reactions with mixtures of hydrogen and water vapor, showing that the reduction of Fe2O3 is three times and the reduction of ZnOFe2O3 two times faster when hydrogen substitutes carbon monoxide at 800 degrees C.","[Brandner, Ulrich; Antrekowitsch, Juergen; Hoffelner, Felix; Leuchtenmueller, Manuel] Univ Leoben, Chair Nonferrous Met, Franz Josef Str 18, A-8700 Leoben, Austria",University of Leoben,"Brandner, U (corresponding author), Univ Leoben, Chair Nonferrous Met, Franz Josef Str 18, A-8700 Leoben, Austria.",ulrich.brandner@unileoben.ac.at; juergen.antrekowitsch@unileoben.ac.at; felix.hoffelner@unileoben.ac.at; manuel.leuchtenmueller@unileoben.ac.at,,,,,,,15,0,0,1,1,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2367-1181,2367-1696,978-3-030-92381-5; 978-3-030-92380-8,MINERAL MET MAT SER,,,2022,,,,,917,926,,10.1007/978-3-030-92381-5_88,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-92381-5_88,,,10,"Materials Science, Multidisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Materials Science,BS8PT,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000775473000087,View Full Record in Web of Science

Several recent studies have used the latest reanalysis datasets to evaluate the SAF induced warming, but without fully considering the fidelity of the surface albedo change and surface downward solar radiation in the reanalysis datasets, which directly affect the amplitude of SAF induced warming. This study finds that the state-of-the-art reanalysis datasets (ERA-Interim, ERA5, MERRA, MERRA-2, JRA-55 and CRA) and climate models that participated in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) exhibit varying biases compared with observations in both surface albedo change and surface downward solar radiation over the TP. The state-of-the-art reanalysis datasets present no obvious advantages over the lower resolution but less constrained CMIP6 multi-model ensemble in representing SAF related processes over the TP. The surface albedo change drives most of the spread in SAF induced warming. The reanalysis datasets and CMIP6 climate models reveal a significant linear relationship between surface albedo change and its contribution to surface temperature change over the TP. Using the observation constrained linear relationship and satellite surface albedo products, the spread of warming contribution due to SAF in reanalysis datasets and climate models is greatly reduced, the estimated TP warming due to SAF is in the range of 0.26-0.50 K in winter and 0.27-0.77 K in spring over recent decades.","[Chen, Yan; Ji, Duoying; Moore, John C.; Hu, Jiangling] Beijing Normal Univ, Coll Global Change & Earth Syst Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Moore, John C.] Univ Lapland, Arctic Ctr, Rovaniemi, Finland; [Moore, John C.] CAS Ctr Excellence Tibetan Plateau Earth Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [He, Yanyi] Tsinghua Univ, Inst Global Change Studies, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Key Lab Earth Syst Modeling,Minist Educ, Beijing, Peoples R China",Beijing Normal University; University of Lapland; Tsinghua University,"Ji, DY (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, Coll Global Change & Earth Syst Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.",duoyingji@bnu.edu.cn,"moore, john/B-2868-2013","moore, john/0000-0001-8271-5787",National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFA0603603]; National Nature Science Foundation of China [41875126],National Key R&D Program of China; National Nature Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),The authors thank the relevant organizations and teams for providing the datasets used in this study and the Super Computing Center of Beijing Normal University for providing computing resources.

By bestowing much of the color and flavor on fruits and vegetables, they are components of the human diet and, thanks to their radical-scavenging properties, are not considered exclusively as food products but also as therapeutic agents. Several cultivars of red (or blood) oranges [Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck], such as Tarocco, Moro, and Sanguinello, are characterized by the presence of anthocyanins in both the rind and fruit juice vesicles. The amount and composition of anthocyanins in the pigmented orange cultivar vary greatly depending on variety, maturity, region of cultivation, and many other environmental conditions. Most of the blood orange varieties require a wide day-night thermal range to maximize color formation. Therefore, the production of red oranges characterized by high anthocyanin levels is limited to a few regions and in particular to the Sicilian area around Mount Etna in Italy, where the characteristic climate conditions yield fruits of unique color intensity and quality. In this review, both the basic information and the most recent advances in red orange anthocyanins are reported, with intense attention given to their biosynthesis and regulation.","Univ Catania, Dept Agr Food & Environm Di3A, I-95123 Catania, Italy",University of Catania,"Lo Piero, AR (corresponding author), Univ Catania, Dept Agr Food & Environm Di3A, Via Santa Sofia 98, I-95123 Catania, Italy.",rlopiero@unict.it,,"Lo Piero, Angela Roberta/0000-0002-2065-9617",,,,,87,54,56,7,102,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0021-8561,1520-5118,,J AGR FOOD CHEM,J.

Over the past two decades, remote sensing using satellite imaging has already been adopted in various tasks related to the monitoring of coastal hydro-enviro nment, including the detection of oil spills, identification of turbid plumes, mapping of marine ecosystems, etc. Despite their usefulness, space-borne sensors are subjected to constraints such as low spatial resolution, clouds and atmospheric interference, sparse frequency, and inflexible scheduling. Recently, remote sensing with portable Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (pUAVs) is emerging as a promising alternative for high spatial-resolution monitoring of coastal hydro-environment, with the key advantages that they can minimize the effects of atmospheric disruptions and be implemented with a frequent schedule to perform on-demand monitoring. In addition, with the technological advances in the sensor's design, UAVs are now capable of capturing data with fine spectral resolutions, ranging from several (multispectral) to hundreds (hyperspectral) of spectral bands. Data analytic is also improving rapidly with the advancement in artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning algorithms. In this paper, we present a systematic review of the recent developments in the utilization of UAV-based remote sensing for the sustainable development of the coastal hydro-environment, particularly with pUAVs. The key technical issues, including the design of UAV systems and the processing of data, are examined for specific applications. Future prospects for implementation are also discussed.","[Kieu, Hieu Trung; Law, Adrian Wing-Keung] Nanyang Technol Univ, Environm Proc Modelling Ctr, Nanyang Environm & Water Res Inst, 50 Nanyang Ave, Singapore 639798, Singapore; [Law, Adrian Wing-Keung] Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, 50 Nanyang Ave, Singapore 639798, Singapore",Nanyang Technological University & National Institute of Education (NIE) Singapore; Nanyang Technological University; Nanyang Technological University & National Institute of Education (NIE) Singapore; Nanyang Technological University,"Law, AWK (corresponding author), Nanyang Technol Univ, Environm Proc Modelling Ctr, Nanyang Environm & Water Res Inst, 50 Nanyang Ave, Singapore 639798, Singapore.;Law, AWK (corresponding author), Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, 50 Nanyang Ave, Singapore 639798, Singapore.",trunghieu.kieu@ntu.edu.sg; cwklaw@ntu.edu.sg,"Law, Wing Keung Adrian/A-3786-2011","Law, Wing Keung Adrian/0000-0002-2593-6361; Kieu, Hieu/0000-0003-3116-9012",Singapore Maritime Institute [SMI-2020-MA-02],Singapore Maritime Institute,We thank Ms. Trang Ha Nguyen for providing the platform for literature search and analysis.

J,"Gapp, I",,,,"Gapp, Isabelle",,,Water in the Wilderness: The Group of Seven and the Coastal Identity of Lake Superior,JOURNAL OF CANADIAN STUDIES-REVUE D ETUDES CANADIENNES,,,English,Article,,,,,,Lake Superior; Group of Seven; coastal landscapes; ecocriticism; wilderness,CANADA,"This paper challenges the wilderness ideology with which the Group of Seven's coastal landscapes of the north shore of Lake Superior are often associated. Focusing my analysis around key works by Lawren Harris, A.Y. Jackson, J.E.H. MacDonald, and Franklin Carmichael, I offer an alternative perspective on commonly-adopted national and wilderness narratives, and instead consider these works in line with an emergent ecocritical consciousness. While a conversation about wilderness in relation to the Group of Seven often ignores the colonial history and Indigenous communities that previously inhabited coastal Lake Superior, this paper identifies these within a discussion of the environmental history of the region. That the environment of the north shore of Lake Superior was a primordial space waiting to be discovered and conquered only seeks to ratify the landscape as a colonial space. Instead, by engaging with the ecological complexities and environmental aesthetics of Lake Superior and its surrounding shoreline, I challenge this colonial and ideological construct of the wilderness, accounting for the prevailing fur trade, fishing, and lumber industries that dominated during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. A discussion of environmental history and landscape painting further allows for a consideration of both the exploitation and the preservation of nature over the course of the twentieth century, and looks beyond the theosophical and mystical in relation to the Group's Lake Superior works. As such, the timeliness of an ecocritical perspective on the Group of Seven's landscapes represents an opportunity to consider how we might recontextualize these paintings in a time of unprecedented anthropogenic climate change, while recognizing the people and history to whom this land traditionally belongs.","[Gapp, Isabelle] Univ Toronto, Dept Art Hist, Toronto, ON, Canada",University of Toronto,"Gapp, I (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Art Hist, Toronto, ON, Canada.",,,,Association for Art History,Association for Art History,I would like to thank the Association for Art History for awarding this project a scholarly researcher grant to help support third-party image rights (2021).

In order to favour implementation of European Union Regulation no. 1143/2014 on invasive alien species, the Italian Society of Vegetation Science carried out a large survey led by a task force of 49 contributors with expertise in vegetation across all the Italian administrative regions. The survey summed up the knowledge on impact mechanisms of invasive alien plants in Italy and their outcomes on plant communities and the EU habitats of Community Interest, in accordance with Directive no. 92/43/EEC. The survey covered 241 alien plant species reported as having deleterious ecological impacts. The data collected illustrate the current state of the art, highlight the main gaps in knowledge, and suggest topics to be further investigated. In particular, the survey underlined competition as being the main mechanism of ecological impact on plant communities and Natura 2000 habitats. Of the 241 species, only Ailanthus altissima was found to exert an ecological impact on plant communities and Natura 2000 habitats in all Italian regions; while a further 20 species impact up to ten out of the 20 Italian administrative regions. Our data indicate that 84 out of 132 Natura 2000 Habitats (64%) are subjected to some degree of impact by invasive alien plants. Freshwater habitats and natural and semi-natural grassland formations were impacted by the highest number of alien species, followed by coastal sand dunes and inland dunes, and forests. Although not exhaustive, this research is the first example of nationwide evaluation of the ecological impacts of invasive alien plants on plant communities and Natura 2000 Habitats.","[Lazzaro, Lorenzo;

A good example of these rough surfaces is wind turbine blades with ice formation on its leading edge. Instead of resolving the airflow field using a fine computational grid near the wall, rough wall functions (RWFs) can be used to model the flow behavior in case of the presence of roughness. This work aims to investigate the performance of state-of-the-art RWFs to show which of these models can provide the most accurate results with the lowest computational cost possible. This aim is achieved by comparing coefficients of lift and pressure resulting from CFD simulations with wind tunnel results of an airfoil with actual ice profiles collected from the site. The RWFs are used to simulate airflow field over the airfoil profiles with ice profile attached to its leading edge using OpenFOAM CFD framework. The comparison of the numerical simulations and the wind tunnel measurements showed that the Colebrook RWF provided the best agreement between simulation and experimental results while using about 20% of the number of cells used with smooth RWF.","[Yassin, Khaled; Peinke, Joachim] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Inst Phys, ForWind Ctr Wind Energy Res, D-26129 Oldenburg, Germany; [Kassem, Hassan; Stoevesandt, Bernhard] Fraunhofer Inst Wind Energy Syst, Kupkersweg 70, D-26129 Oldenburg, Germany; [Klemme, Thomas] Senvion GmbH, Uberseering 10, D-22297 Hamburg, Germany; [Yassin, Khaled] Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Energy & Climate Res IEK 14, D-52425 Julich, Germany; [Klemme, Thomas] Nordex Energy SE & Co KG, Serv Prod Management, Langenhorner Chaussee 600, D-22419 Hamburg, Germany",Carl von Ossietzky Universitat Oldenburg; Helmholtz Association; Research Center Julich,"Yassin, K (corresponding author), Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Inst Phys, ForWind Ctr Wind Energy Res, D-26129 Oldenburg, Germany.;Yassin, K (corresponding author), Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Energy & Climate Res IEK 14, D-52425 Julich, Germany.",khaled.yassin@uni-oldenburg.de,,"Peinke, Joachim/0000-0002-0775-7423; Kassem, Hassan/0000-0002-5101-8273",German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi) [0324232C]; BMWi,German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi); BMWi(Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi)),"This work is part of project OptAnIce: Optimales Anti-Icing fur Rotorblatter im kalten Klima, funded by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi), fund No.: 0324232C.

A prominent hypothesis is that these megadroughts were driven by a centuries-long radiatively forced shift in the mean state of the tropical Pacific Ocean. Here we use a novel combination of spatiotemporal tree ring reconstructions of Northern Hemisphere hydroclimate to infer the atmosphere-ocean dynamics that coincide with megadroughts over the American West and find that these features are consistently associated with 10-30 year periods of frequent cold El Nino-Southern Oscillation conditions and not a centuries-long shift in the mean of the tropical Pacific Ocean. These results suggest an important role for internal variability in driving past megadroughts. State-of-the-art climate models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5, however, do not simulate a consistent association between megadroughts and internal variability of the tropical Pacific Ocean, with implications for our confidence in megadrought risk projections.","[Coats, S.] Univ Colorado, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Smerdon, J.

In the thesis we introduce the basic design of the solar ultraviolet telescope and imaging system Because of small-band transmission of the vacuum ultraviolet optical prism, we take double-Cassegrain reflector optical system. The sunlight could be gathered to CCD detection system in order to image the sun in three specific spectrums involving 30.4nm, 58.4nm and 121.6nm. The reason we choose the center wavelength of 30.4nm. 58.4nm and 121.6nm is that these three spectrums contain a lot of bright lines, have a great radiation flux and play a significant role in ionizing and heating the Earth's upper atmosphere. We make UV telescope imaging system and ultraviolet light as a whole, then pump the whole system into vacuum to simulate space environment. We introduce the calibration device in our system innovatively. Our thesis gives a detailed description of the way of simulation of optical design, the vacuum system design and system calibration. Owing that our system have the characteristic of Lightness, simple structure, small power, it is rather fit for astronomical observations on the moon. The imaging results could provide very important research data for the middle and upper atmospheric composition and ionospheric electron changes in density and communications research.","[Huang Gang; Xiao Qirong; Zheng Chao; Chu Kaili; Jin Zhe] Beijing Inst Technol, Stn Optoelect Innovat Expt, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China",Beijing Institute of Technology,"Huang, G (corresponding author), Beijing Inst Technol, Stn Optoelect Innovat Expt, 5 Zhongguancun S St,Haidian Dist, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,0,SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING,BELLINGHAM,"1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010 USA",0277-786X,,978-0-8194-6764-5,P SOC PHOTO-OPT INS,,,2008,,,,,L6221,L6221,,10.1117/12.790889,http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.790889,,,10,"Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Optics; Physics, Applied; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Engineering; Optics; Physics; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,BHO09,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000254728700056,View Full Record in Web of Science

Model results show that 21 000 yr ago the water column was substantially stratified due to the presence of a saltier-than-today Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW), forming a salinity barrier that prevented dense waters from the Northern Hemisphere from sinking. This salinity barrier started to erode after the termination of the Heinrich event 1, when its associated meltwater was transported southward, freshening the AABW. The removal of the barrier after 14 ka triggered the production of the North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW), which spread into the deeper layers of the South Atlantic at the onset of the Holocene. At this point, the NADW acquired its modern-day structure, establishing a deeper Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC).","[Marson, J.

Sources of uncertainty were defined as the selected variables that influence the total variance of the model results. Simulations were made: (i) for ten regional climate models (RCMs) based on the IPCC scenario A1B and providing an ensemble of climate projections up to 2100; (ii) with two forest model types (FMTYPEs); (iii) for four forest management intensities (MANFORs); and (iv) for three time windows (TIMEWINDs), each spanning 15 years, starting in 2019, in 2049 and in 2079. Both models, the empirical SIBYLA model and the process-based ANAFORE model, were calibrated using experimental tree growth data from four plots in central Slovakia between 1989 and 2003. Three of these plots, representing the four MANFORs, were subject to different prior intensities of thinning while one was left untouched as a control. The FMTYPE explained most of the total variance in the simulation results (39.9%), followed by MANFOR (i.e. thinning intensity; 22.2%) and TIMEWIND (12.0%), while the effect of RCMs on model uncertainty was limited (<1%). Stem biomass increment results obtained from the two FMTYPES were different in absolute terms, but the models agreed well in their relative response to RCM, to MANFOR and to TIMEWIND. The total variance of the predictions was 10 times higher for the process-based model (ANAFORE) than for the empirical model (SIBYLA). These observations are the reason for the large contribution of FMTYPE to the total variance of the simulated stem biomass increment results. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

A potential driver of this significant increase relates to the mass loss of the Antarctic ice sheet. Subsurface ocean warming causes basal ice-shelf melt, freshening the surface waters around Antarctica, which leads to increases in sea-ice cover. With climate warming ongoing, future mass-loss rates are projected to accelerate, which has the potential to affect future Antarctic sea-ice trends. Here we investigate to what extent future sea-ice trends are influenced by projected increases in Antarctic freshwater flux due to subsurface melt, using a state-of-the-art global climate model (EC-Earth) in standardized Climate Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) climate-change simulations. Virtually all CMIP5 models disregard ocean-ice-sheet interactions and project strongly retreating Antarctic sea ice. Applying various freshwater flux scenarios, we find that the additional fresh water significantly offsets the decline in sea-ice area and is even able to reverse the trend in the strongest freshwater forcing scenario that can reasonably be expected, especially in austral winter. The model also simulates decreasing sea surface temperatures (SSTs), with the SST trends exhibiting strong regional variations that largely correspond to regional sea-ice trends.","[Bintanja, R.; Van Oldenborgh, G.

We employ optimal fingerprinting, which uses information from reanalysis data sets and experiments with seven state-of-the-art climate models, to assess the role of anthropogenic and natural influences on changes in the geopotential height during the satellite era. A significant global increase in the annual and seasonal mean geopotential height due to human influence is detected, a result confirmed with four different reanalysis data sets. A more moderate increase in the annual mean associated with natural forcings is also detected. Our findings, consistent with previous detection and attribution studies of changes in temperature and sea level pressure, indicate the prominent role of human influence on some recent climatic changes.","[Christidis, Nikolaos; Stott, Peter A.] Met Off Hadley Ctr, Exeter, Devon, England",Met Office - UK; Hadley Centre,"Christidis, N (corresponding author), Met Off Hadley Ctr, Exeter, Devon, England.",nikos.christidis@metoffice.gov.uk,"Stott, Peter/N-1228-2016; Scott, Peter/GYA-5335-2022","Stott, Peter/0000-0003-4853-7686; ",Joint DECC/DEFRA Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme [GA01101],Joint DECC/DEFRA Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme,"We are grateful to the two reviewers for their constructive comments.

Such techniques are typically applied to analyses of digital images, but they represent powerful tools that are more widely applicable: basic techniques and considerations for geophysical applications are outlined herein. Segmentation, descriptive, and tracking algorithms are combined in the Characterization and Analysis of Vortex Evolution using Algorithms for Region Tracking (CAVE-ART) package, which was developed to comprehensively describe dynamical and geometrical evolution of polar vortices. CAVE-ART can characterize and track multiple vortex regions through time, providing an extensive suite of region, moments, and edge diagnostics for each. CAVE-ART is valuable for identifying vortex-splitting events including, but not limited to, previously cataloged vortex-split sudden stratospheric warmings. An algorithm for identifying such events detects 52 potential events between 1980 and 2017; of these, 38 are subjectively classified as distinct split-like events. The algorithm based on CAVE-ART is also compared with moment-based methods previously used to detect split events. Furthermore, vortex edge-averaged wind speeds from CAVE-ART are used to define extreme weak and strong polar vortex events over multiple vertical levels; this allows characterization of their occurrence frequencies and extents in time and altitude. Weak and strong events show distinct signatures in CAVE-ART diagnostics: in contrast to weak events, strong vortices are more cylindrical and pole centered, and less filamented, than the climatological state. These results from CAVE-ART exemplify the value of computer vision techniques for analysis of geophysical phenomena. Plain Language Summary A large-scale cyclone called the stratospheric polar vortex forms in the middle atmosphere over the pole every fall in each hemisphere and lasts until spring. The Arctic and Antarctic vortices share many characteristics, including that they consist of strong eastward winds, and they extend from roughly 14km above the surface to beyond 50km. Understanding the behavior of these vortices is important because they affect stratospheric ozone depletion and influence weather and climate. In general, the Arctic stratospheric vortex exhibits anomalous behavior more often than its Antarctic counterpart; understanding such behavior can be aided by examining vortex geometry-their size, shape, location, etc. Here we use computer vision techniques similar to those used to analyze digital images to analyze the geometry of the Arctic polar vortex over years from 1980 to 2017. With these techniques, we find a large number of split-like events in which the Arctic polar vortex breaks apart into two separate vortices. We also find important differences in vortex geometry when the Arctic vortex is strong versus when it is weak. Our results draw attention to details of stratospheric vortex variability that motivate further investigation of the physics that can help scientists better understand middle atmosphere weather and climate.","[Lawrence, Zachary D.; Manney, Gloria L.] New Mexico Inst Min & Technol, Dept Phys, Socorro, NM 87801 USA; [Manney, Gloria L.] NorthWest Res Associates, Socorro, NM USA",New Mexico Institute of Mining Technology; NorthWest Research Associates,"Lawrence, ZD (corresponding author), New Mexico Inst Min & Technol, Dept Phys, Socorro, NM 87801 USA.",zachary.lawrence@student.nmt.edu,"Lawrence, Zachary/X-6766-2019","Manney, Gloria/0000-0003-4489-4811; Lawrence, Zachary/0000-0003-0901-3839",NASA Earth and Space Science Fellowship [NNX16AO19H]; NASA [NNX14AE85G]; JPL Microwave Limb Sounder project through JPL [1521127],NASA Earth and Space Science Fellowship; NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); JPL Microwave Limb Sounder project through JPL,"We thank Ken Minschwaner and Peter Hitchcock for helpful comments and discussion regarding this manuscript.

This imbalance is coined Earth's Energy Imbalance (EEI). It is mostly caused by anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and is driving the current warming of the planet. Precise monitoring of EEI is critical to assess the current status of climate change and the future evolution of climate. But the monitoring of EEI is challenging as EEI is two orders of magnitude smaller than the radiation fluxes in and out of the Earth system. Over 93% of the excess energy that is gained by the Earth in response to the positive EEI accumulates into the ocean in the form of heat. This accumulation of heat can be tracked with the ocean observing system such that today, the monitoring of Ocean Heat Content (OHC) and its long-term change provide the most efficient approach to estimate EEI. In this community paper we review the current four state-of-the-art methods to estimate global OHC changes and evaluate their relevance to derive EEI estimates on different time scales. These four methods make use of: (1) direct observations of in situ temperature; (2) satellite-based measurements of the ocean surface net heat fluxes; (3) satellite-based estimates of the thermal expansion of the ocean and (4) ocean reanalyses that assimilate observations from both satellite and in situ instruments. For each method we review the potential and the uncertainty of the method to estimate global OHC changes. We also analyze gaps in the current capability of each method and identify ways of progress for the future to fulfill the requirements of EEI monitoring. Achieving the observation of EEI with sufficient accuracy will depend on merging the remote sensing techniques with in situ measurements of key variables as an integral part of the Ocean Observing System.","[Meyssignac, Benoit;

Few empirical studies exist exploring why universities increasingly invest in these amenities; however, one compelling explanation is that in an increasingly competitive market universities use amenities as a means of attracting students. Using resource dependency theory, this article examines these investments through the lens of marketization of public services. A unique dataset of HEI investments in cultural consumption amenities from 2000 to 2016 is used to estimate the effect of investing in cultural consumption amenities on various student-level outcomes. The evidence suggests that consumption amenities investments are associated with an increase in the yield rate (the proportion of admitted students who choose to enroll in the institution) and a decrease in the percentage of students paying in-state tuition. Also, higher-value investments are associated with a modest increase in out-of-state tuition, a decrease in in-state and out-of-state fees, and an increase in SAT scores. Taken together, the findings suggest that cultural consumption amenities investments may help attract more lucrative students and students who are strongly considering enrolling (as indicated by their application).","[Mughan, Sian] Arizona State Univ, Sch Publ Affairs, 411 N Cent Ave, Phoenix, AZ 85004 USA; [Sherrod Hale, Jessica; Woronkowicz, Joanna] Indiana Univ Bloomington, ONeill Sch Publ & Environm Affairs, 1315 E 10th St, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Downtown Phoenix; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Mughan, S (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Sch Publ Affairs, 411 N Cent Ave, Phoenix, AZ 85004 USA.",smughan@asu.edu; sherrodj@iu.edu; jworonko@iu.edu,,"Mughan, Sian/0000-0003-2404-7463; Hale, Jessica/0000-0001-5455-9609",National Endowment for the Arts [17-3800-7015],National Endowment for the Arts,Funding was provided by National Endowment for the Arts (Grant No. 17-3800-7015).,,60,0,0,1,3,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0361-0365,1573-188X,,RES HIGH EDUC,Res.

Here, we show that the radiative forcing due to geospatially redistributed anthropogenic aerosols mainly determined the spatial variations of winter extreme weather in the Northern Hemisphere during 1970-2005, a unique transition period for global aerosol forcing(4). Over this period, the local Rossby wave activity and extreme events (top 10% in wave amplitude) exhibited marked declining trends at high latitudes, mainly in northern Eurasia. The combination of long-term observational data and a state-of-the-art climate model revealed the unambiguous signature of anthropogenic aerosols on the wintertime jet stream, planetary wave activity and surface temperature variability on interdecadal timescales. In particular, warming due to aerosol reductions in Europe enhanced the meridional temperature gradient on the jet's poleward flank and strengthened the zonal wind, resulting in significant suppression in extreme events over northern Eurasia. These results exemplify how aerosol forcing can impact large-scale extratropical atmospheric dynamics, and illustrate the importance of anthropogenic aerosols and their spatiotemporal variability in assessing the drivers of extreme weather in historical and future climate. Anthropogenic aerosol emissions decreased over North America and Europe but increased over Asia since the 1970s. This caused jet stream winds to shift poleward over the Atlantic, decreasing planetary wave activity and partially inhibiting extreme winter weather over northern Eurasia.","[Wang, Yuan; Le, Tianhao; Yung, Yuk L.] CALTECH, Div Geol & Planetary Sci, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Wang, Yuan; Yung, Yuk L.; Su, Hui; Jiang, Jonathan H.] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Chen, Gang] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Seinfeld, John H.] CALTECH, Div Chem & Chem Engn, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Seinfeld, John H.] CALTECH, Div Engn & Appl Sci, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA",California Institute of Technology; California Institute of Technology; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL); University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; California Institute of Technology; California Institute of Technology,"Wang, Y (corresponding author), CALTECH, Div Geol & Planetary Sci, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.;Wang, Y; Jiang, JH (corresponding author), CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",yuan.wang@caltech.edu; jonathan.h.jiang@jpl.nasa.gov,"Wang, Yuan/A-5816-2013; Yung, Yuk/AAM-4850-2021; Le, Tianhao/GXA-0473-2022","Wang, Yuan/0000-0001-6657-8401; Yung, Yuk/0000-0002-4263-2562; Seinfeld, John/0000-0003-1344-4068; Jiang, Jonathan/0000-0002-5929-8951; Su, Hui/0000-0003-1265-9702; Le, Tianhao/0000-0002-6600-8270; Chen, Gang/0000-0003-4934-1909","NASA ROSES ACMAP; CCST; NSF [AGS-1700727, AGS-1742178]; Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology; NASA; National Science Foundation","NASA ROSES ACMAP; CCST; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology; NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF))","This study is supported by the NASA ROSES ACMAP and CCST, and NSF grants AGS-1700727 and AGS-1742178.

In 2018, a 15.5 m long sediment section was retrieved from the deep basin of Lake Iseo (Italy) at 251 m water depth. A seismic survey associated with a multi-proxy approach using sedimentological and geochemical analyses, reveals that event deposits correspond to 61.4% of the total sedimentation during the last 2000 years. The great heterogeneity of textures, colours and grain-size distribution between the different types of event layers can be explained by the high number of potential sources of sediment in this large lake system. By combining a proxy of sediment sources with proxies of transport processes, flood events were distinguished from destabilizations of the slopes and the main delta. The three thickest mass wasting deposits correspond to major regional earthquakes events of 1222 ce, 1117 ce and around 700 ce. From a thorough comparison with regional climatic fluctuations and human activities in the watershed, it appears that periods of high sediment remobilization can be linked to a preceding increase in erosion in the watershed mainly under human forcing. Hence, even in large catchments, human activities play a key role on erosion processes and on sediment availability, disrupting the recording of extreme events in lacustrine archive.","[Rapuc, William; Arnaud, Fabien; Sabatier, Pierre; Bastien, Antoine] Univ Savoie Mt Blanc, EDYTEM, CNRS, F-73000 Chambery, France; [Anselmetti, Flavio S.] Univ Bern, Inst Geol Sci, Baltzerstr 1-3, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Anselmetti, Flavio S.] Univ Bern, Oeschger Ctr Climate Change Res, Baltzerstr 1-3, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Piccin, Andrea] Reg Lombardia DG Terr & Urbanist, Struttura Sistema Informat Territoriale, I-20124 Milan, Italy; [Peruzza, Laura] Ist Nazl Oceanog & Geofis Sperimentale OGS, Borgo Grotta Gigante 42-C, I-34010 Sgonico, Italy; [Augustin, Laurent] CNRS, Div Tech, INSU CAROTTAGE CONTINENTAL FRANCE, UPS855, ZP Bregaillon CS 20330, F-83507 La Seyne Sur Mer, France; [Regnier, Edouard; Von Grafenstein, Ulrich] Univ Versailles St Quentin, CNRS, Commissariat Energie Atom, LSCE, F-91198 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Gaillardet, Jerome] Univ Paris, Inst Phys Globe Paris, CNRS, F-75005 Paris, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Savoie; University of Bern; University of Bern; Istituto Nazionale di Oceanografia e di Geofisica Sperimentale; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Universite Paris Saclay; CEA; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Cite,"Rapuc, W (corresponding author), Univ Savoie Mt Blanc, EDYTEM, CNRS, F-73000 Chambery, France.",william.rapuc@hotmail.fr,"GAILLARDET, Jerome/F-9096-2010; Arnaud, Fabien/F-7003-2012; Sabatier, Pierre/F-4250-2010; von Grafenstein, Ulrich/F-6991-2010","GAILLARDET, Jerome/0000-0001-7982-1159; Arnaud, Fabien/0000-0002-8706-9902; Sabatier, Pierre/0000-0002-9620-1514; von Grafenstein, Ulrich/0000-0002-3338-5627; Rapuc, William/0000-0001-8258-4545",AAP Universite Savoie Mont Blanc,AAP Universite Savoie Mont Blanc,"This work was conducted in the framework of the CRITLAKE project funded by the AAP Universite Savoie Mont Blanc in 2018 and thanks to the support of the entire staff of the C2FN-DT-INSU associated to the CLIMCORE project.

Within the Australian continent, glacial cycles were not associated with changes in ice cover and instead largely resulted in fluctuations from moist to arid conditions across the landscape. We investigated the role of hydrological and coastal topographic changes brought about by Plio-Pleistocene climatic changes on the biogeographic history of a small Australian freshwater fish, the southern pygmy perch Nannoperca australis. Using 7958 ddRAD-seq (double digest restriction-site associated DNA) loci and 45,104 filtered SNPs, we combined phylogenetic, coalescent and species distribution analyses to assess the various roles of aridification, sea level and tectonics and associated biogeographic changes across southeast Australia. Sea-level changes since the Pliocene and reduction or disappearance of large waterbodies throughout the Pleistocene were determining factors in strong divergence across the clade, including the initial formation and maintenance of a cryptic species, N. 'flindersi'. Isolated climatic refugia and fragmentation due to lack of connected waterways maintained the identity and divergence of inter- and intraspecific lineages. Our historical findings suggest that predicted increases in aridification and sea level due to anthropogenic climate change might result in markedly different demographic impacts, both spatially and across different landscape types.","[Buckley, Sean James; Brauer, Chris; Beheregaray, Luciano B.] Flinders Univ S Australia, Coll Sci & Engn, Mol Ecol Lab, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia; [Unmack, Peter J.] Univ Canberra, Inst Appl Ecol, Ctr Appl Water Sci, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Hammer, Michael P.] Nat Sci Museum & Art Gallery Northern Terr, Darwin, NT, Australia",Flinders University South Australia; University of Canberra,"Beheregaray, LB (corresponding author), Flinders Univ S Australia, Coll Sci & Engn, Mol Ecol Lab, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia.",Luciano.beheregaray@flinders.edu.au,"Unmack, Peter J./AAU-3023-2020; Beheregaray, Luciano/AAY-6384-2021","Unmack, Peter J./0000-0003-1175-1152; Beheregaray, Luciano/0000-0003-0944-3003; Buckley, Sean/0000-0003-4929-6693; Brauer, Chris/0000-0003-2968-5915",Australian Research Council [FT130101068],Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"Australian Research Council, Grant/Award Number: FT130101068",,116,4,4,7,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0962-1083,1365-294X,,MOL ECOL,Mol.

We converted 71-year time series of inundation area and rainfall data from the freshwater marsh Las Tablas de Daimiel into a soprano and bass voice, respectively. We composed The Lament of Las Tablas de Daimiel, which sings the biophysical disruption of the wetland due to the agricultural transformation. More generally, the song testifies to the demise of the natural aquatic environment due to unsustainable use of limited water resources in dryland countries and elsewhere. Making the mute voices of ecosystem heard may have potential to increase awareness about the unsustainable use of short water supplies and other social-ecological challenges.

The variable Sun is the most likely candidate for the natural forcing of past climate changes on time scales of 50 to 1000 years. Evidence for this understanding is that the terrestrial climate correlates positively with the solar activity. During the past 10 000 years, the Sun has experienced the substantial variations in activity and there have been numerous attempts to reconstruct solar irradiance. While there is general agreement on how solar forcing varied during the last several hundred years - all reconstructions are proportional to the solar activity - there is scientific controversy on the magnitude of solar forcing. Aims. We present a reconstruction of the total and spectral solar irradiance covering 130 nm-10 mu m from 1610 to the present with an annual resolution and for the Holocene with a 22-year resolution. Methods. We assume that the minimum state of the quiet Sun in time corresponds to the observed quietest area on the present Sun. Then we use available long-term proxies of the solar activity, which are Be-10 isotope concentrations in ice cores and 22-year smoothed neutron monitor data, to interpolate between the present quiet Sun and the minimum state of the quiet Sun. This determines the long-term trend in the solar variability, which is then superposed with the 11-year activity cycle calculated from the sunspot number. The time-dependent solar spectral irradiance from about 7000 BC to the present is then derived using a state-of-the-art radiation code. Results. We derive a total and spectral solar irradiance that was substantially lower during the Maunder minimum than the one observed today. The difference is remarkably larger than other estimations published in the recent literature. The magnitude of the solar UV variability, which indirectly affects the climate, is also found to exceed previous estimates. We discuss in detail the assumptions that lead us to this conclusion.","[Shapiro, A. I.; Schmutz, W.; Rozanov, E.; Schoell, M.; Haberreiter, M.; Shapiro, A.

This work by two New York-based artists is installed in the centre of the Calgary city downtown to invoke, in Thorp's words, a long-distance conversation between a glacier and a city. Real-time data is collected from geophones embedded into the Bow Glacier, some 220 km west of Calgary. The data is then translated into aural form (by way of an algorithm devised by Rubin and Thorp) and relayed via satellite, with a mere 5-minute delay, to a sixteen-channel speaker installation located on the forecourt of the city's tallest building, Brookfield Place. The installation at once provides a place of repose and an injunction to listen. The glacier's soundtrack heralds the past and the present, the Pleistocene and the Anthropocene eras, Indigenous and settler populations, natural and built environments. At the same time, the installation is a harbinger, asking its audiences to listen to where our climate crisis seems destined to go. The conversation hailed by Herald/Harbinger is all the more poignant and most certainly urgent in a city whose economic prosperity remains overdetermined by the fossil fuel industry.","[Bennett, Susan] Univ Calgary, Dept English, Calgary, AB, Canada",University of Calgary,"Bennett, S (corresponding author), Univ Calgary, Dept English, Calgary, AB, Canada.",,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,2,UNIV TORONTO PRESS INC,TORONTO,"JOURNALS DIVISION, 5201 DUFFERIN ST, DOWNSVIEW, TORONTO, ON M3H 5T8, CANADA",0315-0836,1920-941X,,CAN THEATRE REV,Can.

This work is focused on paleoenvironmental and paleoclimatic changes that occurred in the northern Balkan Peninsula with a special focus on fossil record from Smolucka cave aging from MIS 5 to MIS 3. Based on available data, an attempt has been made to establish a synthetic chronological context for the faunal assemblages recovered from Smolucka cave. Tentative attribution of layer 5 to MIS 5 relies on the interstadial pattern of our reconstructions, with favorable climate conditions for a large diversity of species and with mean annual temperature (MAT) reaching up to 3 degrees C higher than present values and abundant rainfall in the area. Cold conditions for MIS 4 are not present in Smolucka, although layer 4 (late MIS 5 or early MIS 4) shows somewhat dryer and cooler climate when compared with other layers. Layers 3z and 3 (MIS 3) are characterized by temperate and humid conditions together with a complex system of mosaic habitats with high environmental heterogeny but generally favorable conditions for a large diversity of life. Although still not fully chronologically constrained, Smolucka cave presents an interesting opportunity for future research, in the time period when only Neanderthals occupied the Balkans and thrived in local conditions. The transition between the Neanderthals and anatomically modern humans has not yet been established but can be expected in future research.","[Jovanovic, Mihailo; Agusti, Jordi; Sanchez-Bandera, Christian; Manuel Lopez-Garcia, Juan; Blain, Hugues-Alexandre] Inst Catala Paleoecol Humana & Evolucio Social IP, Zona Educac 4,Campus Sescelades URV,Edifici W3, Tarragona 43007, Spain; [Jovanovic, Mihailo; Agusti, Jordi; Sanchez-Bandera, Christian; Manuel Lopez-Garcia, Juan; Blain, Hugues-Alexandre] Univ Rovira & Virgili, Dept Hist & Hist Art, Avinguda Catalunya 35, Tarragona 43002, Spain; [Jovanovic, Mihailo] Univ Business Acad Novi Sad, Fac Social Sci, Blvd Art 2a, Belgrade 11070, Serbia; [Bogicevic, Katarina] Univ Belgrade, Fac Min & Geol, Dept Palaeontol, Kamenicka 6, Belgrade 11000, Serbia; [Nenadic, Drazenko] Univ Belgrade, Fac Min & Geol, Dept Reg Geol, Kamenicka 6, Belgrade 11000, Serbia; [Agusti, Jordi] Inst Catalana Recerca & Estudis Avancats ICREA, Barcelona, Spain",Universitat Rovira i Virgili; Catalan Institute of Human Paleo-Ecology & Social Evolution (IPHES); Universitat Rovira i Virgili; University of Belgrade; University of Belgrade; ICREA,"Jovanovic, M (corresponding author), Inst Catala Paleoecol Humana & Evolucio Social IP, Zona Educac 4,Campus Sescelades URV,Edifici W3, Tarragona 43007, Spain.;Jovanovic, M (corresponding author), Univ Rovira & Virgili, Dept Hist & Hist Art, Avinguda Catalunya 35, Tarragona 43002, Spain.;Jovanovic, M (corresponding author), Univ Business Acad Novi Sad, Fac Social Sci, Blvd Art 2a, Belgrade 11070, Serbia.",mica.rex@gmail.com,"López-García, Juan Manuel/R-8565-2016","López-García, Juan Manuel/0000-0003-1605-9763; Jovanovic, Mihailo/0000-0003-2440-2189","Universitat Rovira i Virgili; AGAUR/Generalitat de Catalunya [2017-SGR-859]; Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [PID2021-122533NB-I00]; Erasmus Mundus Programme International Doctorate in Quaternary and Prehistory; FPI Predoctoral Scholarship [PRE2020-094482, CEX2019-000945-M-20-1]; Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation; Ramon y Cajal contract [RYC-2016-19386]; Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation through the Maria de Maeztu program for Units of Excellence [CEX2019-000945-M]; Project NEEMO of the Fund for Science of the Republic of Serbia [7746827]; Agreement on the implementation and financing of scientific research work of the SRO (NIO) [451-03-68/2022-14/200126]","Universitat Rovira i Virgili; AGAUR/Generalitat de Catalunya(Agencia de Gestio D'Ajuts Universitaris de Recerca Agaur (AGAUR)Generalitat de Catalunya); Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Ministry of Science and Innovation, Spain (MICINN)Spanish Government); Erasmus Mundus Programme International Doctorate in Quaternary and Prehistory; FPI Predoctoral Scholarship(National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia); Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Ministry of Science and Innovation, Spain (MICINN)Spanish Government); Ramon y Cajal contract(Spanish Government); Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation through the Maria de Maeztu program for Units of Excellence(Ministry of Science and Innovation, Spain (MICINN)); Project NEEMO of the Fund for Science of the Republic of Serbia; Agreement on the implementation and financing of scientific research work of the SRO (NIO)","Open access funding provided by Universitat Rovira i Virgili.

We are able to attribute the modeled changes in the ASL to stratospheric ozone depletion by contrasting ensembles of historical integrations with and without a realistic ozone hole. In the presence of very large natural variability, the robustness of the ozone impact on the ASL is established by (1) examining ensembles of model runs to isolate the forced response, (2) repeating the analysis with two different climate models, and (3) considering the entire period of stratospheric ozone depletion, the beginning of which predates the satellite era by a couple of decades.","[England, Mark R.; Polvani, Lorenzo M.; Smith, Karen L.] Columbia Univ, Dept Appl Phys & Appl Math, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Polvani, Lorenzo M.; Smith, Karen L.] Columbia Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, New York, NY USA; [Landrum, Laura; Holland, Marika M.] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA",Columbia University; Columbia University; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA,"England, MR (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Dept Appl Phys & Appl Math, New York, NY 10027 USA.",mre2126@columbia.edu,"England, Mark/AAI-5481-2020; Polvani, Lorenzo M/E-5949-2011","England, Mark/0000-0003-3882-872X; Smith, Karen/0000-0002-4652-6310; Holland, Marika/0000-0001-5621-8939; Landrum, Laura/0000-0002-6003-1146",Frontiers of Earth System Dynamics (FESD) from the U.S. National Science Foundation; National Science Foundation,Frontiers of Earth System Dynamics (FESD) from the U.S. National Science Foundation; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This work is funded by a Frontiers of Earth System Dynamics (FESD) grant from the U.S. National Science Foundation.

IRB conducts trans-disciplinary field work that reflects on interspecies relations, questions the intentionality of evolution and speculates on the (im)possibility of intra-and inter-species communication. Rather than showing solutions, it addresses the complexity of the systems that are at stake. It departs from both the climate crisis and the loss of biodiversity and habitat. Inspired by the scientific discourse on facilitated adaptation or managed relocation, the IRB investigates endangered species and provides them with relocation tutorials, e.g. video tutorials. The artistic process includes the selection of an endangered species (fauna, flora, microbial). Then, research of its habitat, living conditions and the mesh of relations is conducted.

For the past two decades, various studies have been conducted in which metagenomics data have been collected over extended periods and analyzed spatially and temporally to understand the dynamics of microbial communities in DWDS. In this literature review, we outline the findings which were reported in the literature on what kind of occupancy-abundance patterns are exhibited in the drinking water microbiome, how the drinking water microbiome dynamically evolves spatially and temporally in the distribution networks, how different microbial communities co-exist, and what kind of clusters exist in the drinking water ecosystem. While data analysis in the current literature concerns mainly with confirmatory and exploratory questions pertaining to the use of metagenomics data for the analysis of DWDS microbiome, we present also future perspectives and the potential role of artificial intelligence (AI) and mechanistic models to address the predictive and mechanistic questions. The integration of meta-omics, AI, and mechanistic models transcends metagenomics into functional metagenomics, enabling deterministic understanding and control of DWDS for clean and safe drinking water systems of the future.","[Mahajna, Asala; Dinkla, Inez J.

Although they are very efficient in producing clean energy, the harsh environmental conditions they are subjected to, mainly strong winds and waves, produce structural fatigue and may cause them to lose efficiency. Thus, it is imperative to develop models to facilitate their deployment while maximizing energy production and ensuring the structure's safety. This work applies machine learning (ML) techniques to obtain predictive models of the most relevant metocean variables involved. Specifically, wind speed, significant wave height, and the misalignment between wind and waves have been analyzed, pre-processed and modeled based on actual data. Linear regression (LR), support vector machines regression (SVR), Gaussian process regression (GPR) and neural network (NN)-based solutions have been applied and compared. The results show that Nonlinear autoregressive with an exogenous input neural network (NARX) is the best algorithm for both wind speed and misalignment forecasting in the time domain (72% accuracy) and GPR for wave height (90.85% accuracy). In conclusion, these models are vital to deploying and installing FOWTs and making them profitable.","[Sacie, Montserrat; Lopez, Rafael] Univ Complutense Madrid, Fac Comp Sci, Madrid 28040, Spain; [Santos, Matilde] Univ Complutense Madrid, Inst Knowledge Technol, Madrid 28040, Spain; [Pandit, Ravi] Cranfield Univ, Sch Aerosp Transport & Mfg, Cranfield MK43 0AL, Beds, England",Complutense University of Madrid; Complutense University of Madrid; Cranfield University,"Santos, M (corresponding author), Univ Complutense Madrid, Inst Knowledge Technol, Madrid 28040, Spain.",msacie22@gmail.com; msantos@ucm.es; rlopez@ucm.es; raviwithfuture@gmail.com,"Santos Peñas, Matilde/GVS-3581-2022; Pandit, Ravi Kumar/P-1114-2019","Santos Peñas, Matilde/0000-0003-1993-8368; Pandit, Ravi Kumar/0000-0001-6850-7922","Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities under MCI/AEI/FEDER [RTI2018-094902-B-C21]","Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities under MCI/AEI/FEDER","This work was partially supported by the Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities under MCI/AEI/FEDER Project number RTI2018-094902-B-C21.",,41,0,0,7,7,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2077-1312,,J MAR SCI ENG,J.

Eight years of each model's twentieth-century climate simulation are analyzed. The authors focus on the three major components of Asian summer monsoon: the Indian summer monsoon (ISM), the western North Pacific summer monsoon (WNPSM), and the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM), together with the two dominant subseasonal modes: the eastward-and northward-propagating boreal summer intraseasonal oscillation (BSIO) and the westward-propagating 12-24-day mode. The results show that current state-of-the-art GCMs still have difficulties and display a wide range of skill in simulating the subseasonal variability associated with Asian summer monsoon. During boreal summer (May-October), most of the models produce reasonable seasonal-mean precipitation over the ISM region, but excessive precipitation over the WNPSM region and insufficient precipitation over the EASM region. In other words, models concentrate their rain too close to the equator in the western Pacific. Most of the models simulate overly weak total subseasonal (2-128 day) variance, as well as too little variance for BSIO and the 12-24-day mode. Only 4-5 models produce spectral peaks in the BSIO and 12-24-day frequency bands; instead, most of the models display too red a spectrum, that is, an overly strong persistence of precipitation. For the seven models with three-dimensional data available, five reproduce the preconditioning of moisture in BSIO but often with a too late starting time, and only three simulate the phase lead of low-level convergence. Interestingly, although models often have difficulty in simulating the eastward propagation of BSIO, they tend to simulate well the northward propagation of BSIO, together with the westward propagation of the 12-24-day mode. The northward propagation in these models is thus not simply a NW-SE-tilted tail protruding off of an eastward-moving deep-tropical intraseasonal oscillation.","[Lin, Jia-Lin; Weickman, Klaus M.; Kiladis, George N.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Geog, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Lin, Jia-Lin] CIRES Climate Diagnost Ctr, NOAA ESRL, Boulder, CO USA; [Mapes, Brian E.] Univ Miami, RSMAS, Miami, FL USA; [Schubert, Siegfried D.; Suarez, Max J.; Bacmeister, Julio T.; Lee, Myong-In] NASA GSFC Global Modeling & Assimilat Off, Greenbelt, MD USA; [Bacmeister, Julio T.; Lee, Myong-In] Univ Maryland Baltimore Cty, Goddard Earth Sci & Technol Ctr, Baltimore, MD 21228 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Miami; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland Baltimore County,"Lin, JL (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, Dept Geog, 1105 Derby Hall,154 N Oval Mall, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",lin.789@osu.edu,"Mapes, Brian/A-5647-2010; Lee, Myong-In/F-3578-2010","Lee, Myong-In/0000-0001-8983-8624",,,,,75,101,104,2,18,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0894-8755,,,J CLIMATE,J.

Globally, 15% of the world's terrestrial lands and inland waters, excluding Antarctica, are designated as PAs. About 4.12% of the global ocean and 10.2% of coastal and marine areas under national jurisdiction are set as marine protected areas (MPAs). Protected lands and waters serve as the fundamental building blocks of virtually all national and international conservation strategies, supported by governments and international institutions. Some of the PAs are the only places that contain undisturbed landscape, seascape and ecosystems on the planet Earth. With intensified impacts from climate and environmental change, PAs have become more important to serve as indicators of ecosystem status and functions. Earth's remaining wilderness areas are becoming increasingly important buffers against changing conditions. The development of remote sensing platforms and sensors and the improvement in science and technology provide crucial support for the monitoring and management of PAs across the world.

The mode intensity depends on the rainfall variation over the western North Pacific (WNP) and the North America (NAM) monsoon regions. This study suggests that relative importance of the WNP and NAM rainfall anomalies is asymmetric between the strong positive (SP) and strong negative (SN) phases of this mode, which can be attributed to the distinct seasonal evolution of ENSO events. In the SP-phase, the suppressed summer rainfall over the WNP determines the mode following a decaying El Nino event. When the tropical Indian Ocean (TIO) warms and the eastern Equatorial Pacific (EEP) cools, the emanating Kelvin wave- and zonal SST difference-induced low-level WNP anticyclone thus gets enhanced to damp the local rainfall, which further affects the other members of the BSM. However, the SN-phase of this mode, showing closer association with anomalous NAM rainfall, appears with a developing El Nino event. The tropical North Atlantic (TNA) becomes colder from spring to summer, when the EEP warms due to the zonal circulation anomalies. A stronger zonal SST difference between the warm EEP and cold TNA suppresses the NAM rainfall by strengthening the low-level anticyclone in situ. Such asymmetry in different phases of the BSM co-variation mode is validated by the pre-industrial control runs in a state-of-the-art CGCM, indicating the roles of ENSO evolution in regulating the interaction between the BSM members.","[Hao, Yuqian; Liu, Boqi; Zhu, Congwen] Chinese Acad Meteorol Sci, State Key Lab Severe Weather, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Hao, Yuqian; Liu, Boqi; Zhu, Congwen] Chinese Acad Meteorol Sci, Inst Climate Syst, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Hao, Yuqian] Tianjin Climate Ctr, Tianjin 300074, Peoples R China; [He, Bian] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, State Key Lab Numer Modeling Atmospher Sci & Geop, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences (CAMS); Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences (CAMS); Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS","Zhu, CW (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Meteorol Sci, State Key Lab Severe Weather, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.;Zhu, CW (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Meteorol Sci, Inst Climate Syst, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",zhucw@cma.gov.cn,"Liu, Boqi/L-6632-2019; Liu, Boqi/M-5383-2013; 何, 编/O-5907-2014","Liu, Boqi/0000-0001-7606-8747; Liu, Boqi/0000-0001-7606-8747; He, Bian/0000-0002-7290-2201; Zhu, Congwen/0000-0002-3663-4481","National Key RD Program [2018YFC1505904]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41830969, 41775052, 91637312]; Basic Scientific Research and Operation Foundation of the CAMS [2018Z006, 2017R001]; Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center for Climate Change",National Key RD Program; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Basic Scientific Research and Operation Foundation of the CAMS; Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center for Climate Change,"This work was jointly supported by the National Key R&D Program (2018YFC1505904), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41830969, 41775052, 91637312) and the Basic Scientific Research and Operation Foundation of the CAMS (2018Z006 and 2017R001).

However, there is a lack of recommendations of optimal NbS and appropriate typologies fitting to different contexts and urban design. The analytical frameworks for NbS implementation and impact evaluation, that integrate NbS into local policy frameworks, socio-economic transition pathways, and spatial planning, remain fragmented. In this article, the NbS concept and its related terminologies are first discussed. Second, the types of NbS implemented in Europe are reviewed and their benefits over time are explored, prior to categorizing them and highlighting the key methods, criteria, and indicators to identify and assess the NbS's impacts, co-benefits, and trade-offs. The latter involved a review of the websites of 52 projects and some relevant publications funded by EU Research and Innovation programs and other relevant publications. The results show that there is a shared understanding that the NbS concept encompasses benefits of restoration and rehabilitation of ecosystems, carbon neutrality, improved environmental quality, health and well-being, and evidence for such benefits. This study also shows that most NbS-related projects and activities in Europe use hybrid approaches, with NbS typically developed, tested, or implemented to target specific types of environmental-social-economic challenges. The results of this study indicate that NbS as a holistic concept would be beneficial in the context of climate action and sustainable solutions to enhance ecosystem resilience and adaptive capacity within cities. As such, this article provides a snapshot of the role of NbS in urban sustainability development, a guide to the state-of-the-art, and key messages and recommendations of this rapidly emerging and evolving field.","[Liu, Hai-Ying] NILU Norwegian Inst Air Res, Dept Environm Impacts & Sustainabil, POB 100, N-2027 Kjeller, Norway; [Jay, Marion] Adelphi Res gGmbH, Alt Moabit 91, D-10559 Berlin, Germany; [Chen, Xianwen] NINA Norwegian Inst Nat Res, Oslo Dept, Sognsveien 68, N-0855 Oslo, Norway; [Chen, Xianwen] Inland Norway Univ Appl Sci, Inland Sch Business & Social Sci, Dept Business Adm, POB 400, N-2418 Elverum, Norway",Norwegian Institute for Air Research; Norwegian Institute Nature Research; Inland Norway University of Applied Sciences,"Liu, HY (corresponding author), NILU Norwegian Inst Air Res, Dept Environm Impacts & Sustainabil, POB 100, N-2027 Kjeller, Norway.",hyl@nilu.no; jay@adelphi.de; xianwen.chen@gmail.com,"Liu, Hai-Ying/P-5557-2014","Liu, Hai-Ying/0000-0001-8667-3465; Marion, Jay/0000-0003-1653-5096; Chen, Xianwen/0000-0001-9262-2568","NILU-Norwegian Institute for Air Research; NILU-NIVA SIS project on urban sustainable development; EEA ETC/CME task on urban environmental sustainability; ETC/ATNI task on urban environmental sustainability; NILU internal project on nature-based solutions for improving environmental quality, health, and well-being","NILU-Norwegian Institute for Air Research(Bioforsk); NILU-NIVA SIS project on urban sustainable development; EEA ETC/CME task on urban environmental sustainability; ETC/ATNI task on urban environmental sustainability; NILU internal project on nature-based solutions for improving environmental quality, health, and well-being","Open-access publication was funded by NILU-Norwegian Institute for Air Research.

The Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO) is the dominant mode of variability in the tropical atmosphere on sub-seasonal time scales, and can promote or enhance extreme events in both, the tropics and the extratropics. Forecasting extreme events on the sub-seasonal time scale (from 10 days to about 3 months) is very challenging due to a poor understanding of the phenomena that can increase predictability on this time scale. Here we show that two artificial neural networks (ANNs), a feed-forward neural network and a recurrent neural network, allow a very competitive MJO prediction. While our average prediction skill is about 26-27 days (which competes with that obtained with most computationally demanding state-of-the-art climate models), for some initial phases and seasons the ANNs have a prediction skill of 60 days or longer. Furthermore, we show that the ANNs have a good ability to predict the MJO phase, but the amplitude is underestimated.","[Silini, Riccardo; Masoller, Cristina] Univ Politecn Cataluna, Dept Fis, Edifici Gaia,Rambla St Nebridi 22, Barcelona 08222, Spain; [Barreiro, Marcelo] Univ Republica, Fac Ciencias, Dept Ciencias Atmosfera, Igua 4225, Montevideo 11400, Uruguay","Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya; Universidad de la Republica, Uruguay","Silini, R (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Cataluna, Dept Fis, Edifici Gaia,Rambla St Nebridi 22, Barcelona 08222, Spain.",riccardo.silini@outlook.com,"Masoller, Cristina/M-3696-2014","Masoller, Cristina/0000-0003-0768-2019","European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under the Marie Skodowska Curie Grant [8138444]; Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovacion y Universidades [PGC2018-099443-B-I00]; ICREA ACADEMIA program of Generalitat de Catalunya","European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under the Marie Skodowska Curie Grant; Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovacion y Universidades; ICREA ACADEMIA program of Generalitat de Catalunya","This work received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under the Marie Skodowska Curie Grant Agreement No 8138444.

They are the first tropospheric clouds that can scatter incoming solar radiation and the last which can trap outgoing terrestrial heat. Considering their extensive global coverage, estimated at between 25 and 33% of the Earth's surface, cirrus exert a measurable climate forcing. The global radiative influence depends on a number of properties including their altitude, ice crystal size and number density, and vertical extent. These properties in turn depend on the ability of upper tropospheric aerosol particles to initiate ice formation. Because aerosol populations, and therefore cirrus formation mechanisms, may change due to human activities, the sign of cirrus forcing (a net warming or cooling) due to anthropogenic effects is not universally agreed upon although most modeling studies suggest a positive effect. Cirrus also play a major role in the water cycle in the tropopause region, affecting not only redistribution in the troposphere but also the abundance of vapor entering the stratosphere. Both the current lack of understanding of cirrus properties and the need to improve our ability to project changes due to human activities in the future highlight the critical need to determine the aerosol particles on which cirrus form. This review addresses what is currently known about the abundance, size and composition of cirrus-forming particles. We review aircraft-based field studies which have either collected cirrus ice residuals for off-line analysis or determined their size, composition and other properties in situ by capturing ice crystals and sublimating/removing the condensed phase water. This review is predominantly restricted to cirrus clouds. Limited comparisons are made to other ice-containing (e.g., mixed-phase) cloud types. The findings of recent reviews on laboratory measurements that mimic upper tropospheric cirrus formation are briefly summarized. The limitations of the current state of the art in cirrus ice residual studies are outlined. Important ancillary measurements and how they are integrated with ice residual data are also presented. Concluding statements focus on the need for specific instrumentation and future studies. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Here we quantify the latitudinal shift of the location of the Intertropical Convergence Zone ( ITCZ) in the tropical regions during boreal summer and the change in precipitation in the northern part of the ITCZ. For both periods the shift is more pronounced over the continents and East Asia. The maritime continent is the region where the largest spread is found between models. We also clearly establish that the larger the increase in the meridional temperature gradient in the tropical Atlantic during summer at the MH, the larger the change in precipitation over West Africa. The vegetation feedback is however not as large as found in previous studies, probably due to model differences in the control simulation. Finally, we show that the feedback from snow and sea-ice at mid and high latitudes contributes for half of the cooling in the Northern Hemisphere for the LGM, with the remaining being achieved by the reduced CO2 and water vapour in the atmosphere. For the MH the snow and albedo feedbacks strengthen the spring cooling and enhance the boreal summer warming, whereas water vapour reinforces the late summer warming. These feedbacks are modest in the Southern Hemisphere. For the LGM most of the surface cooling is due to CO2 and water vapour.","CEA, Lab Sci Climat & Environnement, Unite Mixte, CNRS,UVSQ, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; Univ Bristol, Sch Geog Sci, Bristol BS8 1SS, Avon, England; Univ Tokyo, Ctr Climate Syst Res, Tokyo 2778568, Japan; JAMSTEC, FRCGC, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2360001, Japan; Met Off Hadley Ctr, Exeter EX1 3PB, Devon, England; Catholic Univ Louvain, Inst Astron & Geophys Georges Lemaitre, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium; Meteorol Res Inst, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050052, Japan; Univ Bremen, D-28334 Bremen, Germany; Royal Netherlands Meteorol Inst, NL-3730 AE De Bilt, Netherlands; Chinese Acad Sci, LASG, Inst Atmospher Phys, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China","UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; CEA; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; University of Bristol; University of Tokyo; Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science & Technology (JAMSTEC); Met Office - UK; Hadley Centre; Universite Catholique Louvain; Meteorological Research Institute - Japan; University of Bremen; Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS","Braconnot, P (corresponding author), CEA, Lab Sci Climat & Environnement, Unite Mixte, CNRS,UVSQ, Orme Merisiers,Bat 712, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France.",pascale.braconnot@cea.fr,"Abe-Ouchi, Ayako/M-6359-2013; KAGEYAMA, Masa/F-2389-2010; Kitoh, Akio/F-1765-2010; Loutre, Marie-France/L-3594-2018; Valdes, Paul/C-4129-2013; Ramstein, Gilles/L-3328-2014; Marti, Olivier/B-2378-2009; Valdes, Paul/T-2004-2019; Otto-Bliesner, Bette/AAY-7691-2020; Yu, Yongqiang/K-7808-2012","Abe-Ouchi, Ayako/0000-0003-1745-5952; KAGEYAMA, Masa/0000-0003-0822-5880; Loutre, Marie-France/0000-0001-6944-4038; Ramstein, Gilles/0000-0002-1522-917X; Marti, Olivier/0000-0002-8246-5578; Valdes, Paul/0000-0002-1902-3283; Yu, Yongqiang/0000-0001-8596-3583; Hewitt, Chris/0000-0002-4718-4009; Crucifix, Michel/0000-0002-3437-4911; Harrison, Sandy/0000-0001-5687-1903; Peterschmitt, Jean-Yves/0000-0003-3486-3157",,,,,60,279,291,1,68,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1814-9324,1814-9332,,CLIM PAST,Clim.

The cold SST bias in the northwestern Pacific (NWP), one of the most distinct and persistent biases in all generations of climate models, was previously attributed to the local and remote influences of the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, but has never been related to the Indian Ocean. By analyzing simulations from 52 state-of-the-art CMIP6 models and a series of model experiments, we find the strong cold bias in the NWP is primarily caused by the weak cold bias in the tropical Indian Ocean (TIO). Eliminating the TIO bias induces a prominent pressure high over the NWP, which favors a SST warming there through the enhancement of warm oceanic Ekman advection. Our results indicate that the large NWP cold bias could be reduced by similar to 66% once the weak TIO bias is corrected.","[Feng, Jie; Lian, Tao; Chen, Dake] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Oceanog, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Lian, Tao; Chen, Dake] Minist Nat Resources, State Key Lab Satellite Ocean Environm Dynam, Inst Oceanog 2, Hangzhou, Peoples R China; [Lian, Tao; Chen, Dake] Southern Marine Sci & Engn Guangdong Lab Zhuhai, Zhuhai, Peoples R China; [Li, Yanjie] Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Numer Modeling Atmospher Sci & Geop, Inst Atmospher Phys, Beijing, Peoples R China","Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Ministry of Natural Resources of the People's Republic of China; Southern Marine Science & Engineering Guangdong Laboratory; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS","Chen, DK (corresponding author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Oceanog, Shanghai, Peoples R China.;Chen, DK (corresponding author), Minist Nat Resources, State Key Lab Satellite Ocean Environm Dynam, Inst Oceanog 2, Hangzhou, Peoples R China.;Chen, DK (corresponding author), Southern Marine Sci & Engn Guangdong Lab Zhuhai, Zhuhai, Peoples R China.",dchen@sio.org.cn,,"Chen, Dake/0000-0002-8193-7158; Li, Yanjie/0000-0001-6091-0303; Feng, Jie/0000-0001-5349-7688","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41690121, 42022043, 41690120]; Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China [LR19D060001]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China(Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province),"We thank the editor and the two anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments and suggestions.

However, shortcomings in their representation of microscale processes, like the interaction of cloud droplets and ice crystals with radiation, can still restrict their utility. Here, we illustrate how changes to the ice microphysics scheme dramatically alter both the vertical profile of cloud-radiative heating and top-of-atmosphere outgoing longwave radiation (terrestrial infrared cooling) in storm-resolving simulations over the Asian monsoon region. Poorly-constrained parameters in the ice nucleation scheme, overactive conversion of ice to snow, and inconsistent treatment of ice crystal effective radius between microphysics and radiation alter cloud-radiative heating by a factor of four and domain-mean infrared cooling by 30 W m(-2). Vertical resolution, on the other hand, has a very limited impact. Even in state-of-the-art models then, uncertainties in microscale cloud properties exert a strong control on the radiative budget that propagates to both atmospheric circulation and regional climate. These uncertainties need to be reduced to realize the full potential of storm-resolving models. Even within the newest generation of storm-resolving simulations, ice microphysical uncertainties can propagate to large uncertainties in tropical cloud radiative heating and outgoing longwave radiation.","[Sullivan, Sylvia C.] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Karlsruhe, Germany; [Voigt, Aiko] Univ Vienna, Dept Meteorol & Geophys, Vienna, Austria; [Voigt, Aiko] Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, New York, NY 10027 USA",Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; University of Vienna; Columbia University,"Sullivan, SC (corresponding author), Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Karlsruhe, Germany.;Voigt, A (corresponding author), Univ Vienna, Dept Meteorol & Geophys, Vienna, Austria.;Voigt, A (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, New York, NY 10027 USA.",sylvia.sullivan@kit.edu; aiko.voigt@univie.ac.at,"Keyes, Dennis/AAZ-9285-2021; Voigt, Aiko/H-4691-2012","Voigt, Aiko/0000-0002-7394-8252; Sullivan, Sylvia/0000-0003-0203-3052",DFG [VO 1765/6-1]; German Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF); FONA: Research for Sustainable Development [01LK1509A]; NSF-PIRE project [1743753],DFG(German Research Foundation (DFG)); German Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); FONA: Research for Sustainable Development; NSF-PIRE project(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD)),"S.C.S. was funded by DFG project VO 1765/6-1 (TropiC).

But, in addition to paleontological and geophysical links, Antarctica has increasing interrelationship with Africa's climactic future. Africa is widely predicted to be the continent worst affected by climate change, and Antarctica and its surrounding Southern Ocean are uniquely implicated as crucial mediators for changing global climate and currents, rainfall patterns, and sea level rise. This paper proposes that there are in fact several ways of imagining the far South from Africa in literary and cultural terms. One is to read against the grain for southern-directed perspectives in existing African literature and the arts, from southern coastlines looking south; another is to reexamine both familiar and new, speculative narratives of African weather - drought, flood and change - for their Antarctic entanglements. In the context of ongoing work on postcolonial Antarctica and calls to decolonise Antarctic studies - such readings can begin to bridge the Antarctica-Africa divide.","[Lavery, Charne] Univ Pretoria, Dept English, Private Bag X20, ZA-0028 Hatfield, South Africa; [Lavery, Charne] Univ Witwatersrand, Wits Inst Social & Econ Res, Private Bag 3,POB Wits, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Pretoria; University of Witwatersrand,"Lavery, C (corresponding author), Univ Pretoria, Dept English, Private Bag X20, ZA-0028 Hatfield, South Africa.;Lavery, C (corresponding author), Univ Witwatersrand, Wits Inst Social & Econ Res, Private Bag 3,POB Wits, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa.",charnelavery@gmail.com,,"Lavery, Charne/0000-0002-9907-4143","South African National Antarctic Programme grant, Southern Oceanic Humanities, from South African National Research Foundation","South African National Antarctic Programme grant, Southern Oceanic Humanities, from South African National Research Foundation","This work was supported by a South African National Antarctic Programme grant, Southern Oceanic Humanities, from the South African National Research Foundation.",,34,2,2,4,4,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0032-2474,1475-3057,,POLAR REC,POLAR REC.,SEP,2019,5,,,,347,350,,10.1017/S0032247419000743,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0032247419000743,,,4,Ecology; Environmental Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,KE3AS,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000508432300010,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this paper we elaborate on how practice theories can inform the discussion of experimentation. Practice theory suggests that the everyday life of people appears recalcitrant. Practices are robust, resilient and have multiple, historically formed constituents and are thereby difficult to destabilize and change quickly. The making and breaking of links inside and between practices is highlighted, as is the need for enduring, multi-sited change efforts. Practice theory further helps us to better understand the constitution of new, levelled forms of expertise, the distributed nature of experimentation and the enrolment of citizens as active participants in sustainability transitions. We have operationalized and examined these suggestions in a Finnish research project related to climate change mitigation and energy use in detached houses. We report specific modes of experimentation and innovation, including user innovations, and the shared resources of situated expertise, the collective and shared processes of empowerment and the ways in which normality is challenged by ruptures in everyday life. Based on the results, we derive suggestions for effective policy interventions. We also bring forward a set of generic suggestions for more sensitive, appreciative and effective public policies on sustainability transitions and cast experimentation in a particular and partial role in such policies.

In StISSM v1.0, stochastic parameterizations target climatic fields with internal variability, as well as glaciological processes exhibiting variability that cannot be resolved at the spatiotemporal resolution of ice sheet models: calving and subglacial hydrology. Because both climate and unresolved glaciological processes include internal variability, stochastic parameterizations allow StISSM v1.0 to account for the impacts of their high-frequency variability on ice dynamics and on the long-term evolution of modeled glaciers and ice sheets. StISSM v1.0 additionally includes statistical models to represent surface mass balance and oceanic forcing as autoregressive processes. Such models, once appropriately calibrated, allow users to sample irreducible uncertainty in climate prediction without the need for computationally expensive ensembles from climate models. When combined together, these novel features of StISSM v1.0 enable quantification of irreducible uncertainty in ice sheet model simulations and of ice sheet sensitivity to noisy forcings. We detail the implementation strategy of StISSM v1.0, evaluate its capabilities in idealized model experiments, demonstrate its applicability at the scale of a Greenland ice sheet simulation, and highlight priorities for future developments. Results from our test experiments demonstrate the complexity of ice sheet response to variability, such as asymmetric and/or non-zero mean responses to symmetric, zero-mean imposed variability. They also show differing levels of projection uncertainty for stochastic variability in different processes. These features are in line with results from stochastic experiments in climate and ocean models, as well as with the theoretical expected behavior of noise-forced non-linear systems.","[Verjans, Vincent; Robel, Alexander A.] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Earth & Atmospher Sci, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Seroussi, Helene] Dartmouth Coll, Thayer Sch Engn, Hanover, NH USA; [Ultee, Lizz] Middlebury Coll, Dept Earth & Climate Sci, Middlebury, VT USA; [Thompson, Andrew F.] CALTECH, Environm Sci & Engn, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology; Dartmouth College; California Institute of Technology,"Verjans, V (corresponding author), Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Earth & Atmospher Sci, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.",vverjans3@gatech.edu,,"Robel, Alexander/0000-0003-4520-0105",NSF Navigating the New Arctic program,NSF Navigating the New Arctic program,"Helene Seroussi was also funded by the NSF Navigating the New Arctic program.

Updated observational estimates of full-depth OHC change since 1970 are presented that account for recent advancements in reducing observation errors and biases. The full-depth OHC has increased by 0.74 [0.68, 0.80] x 10(22) J yr(-1) (0.46Wm(-2)) and 1.22 [1.16-1.29] x 10(22) J yr(-1) (0.75Wm(-2)) for 1970-2005 and 1992-2005, respectively, with a 5 to 95% confidence interval of the median. The CMIP5 models show large spread in OHC changes, suggesting that some models are not state-of-the-art and require further improvements. However, the ensemble median has excellent agreement with our observational estimate: 0.68 [0.54-0.82] x 10(22) J yr(-1) (0.42 Wm(-2)) from 1970 to 2005 and 1.25 [1.10-1.41] x 10(22) J yr(-1) (0.77Wm(-2)) from 1992 to 2005. These results increase confidence in both the observational and model estimates to quantify and study changes in Earth's energy imbalance over the historical period.

Frequency and intensity aspects of the HW events are considered using the total number of the HW events per season and the amplitude. We first contrast ERA5 with several surface meteorological stations in central Chile to evaluate its ability to capture daily maximum temperature variability and the HW events. We then use synoptic- and large-scale fields and teleconnection patterns to address the most favorable conditions of the HW events from a climatological perspective as well as from the extreme January 2017 HW event that swept central Chile with temperature records and wildfires. ERA5 tends to capture temperature extremes and the HW events at the inland stations; on the contrary, it has difficulties in capturing the maximum temperature variability at the coastal stations, which is plausible given the complex terrain features and confined coastal climate zone (only similar to 7% of all grid boxes within central Chile). The composite HW days based on ERA5 reveals a mid-level trough-ridge dipole pattern exhibiting a blocking anticyclone on the surface over a large part of southwest South America. Relatively dry and warm easterly flow appears to accompany the anomalous warming in a large part of central Chile. The temporal evolution of the HW events yields a wave-like propagation pattern and enhancement of trough-ridge pattern along the South Pacific. This meridional dipole pattern is found to be largely associated with the Pacific South American pattern. In addition, the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) appears to be a key component of the HW events in central Chile. In particular, while active MJO phases 2 and 7 promote sub-seasonal patterns that favor the South Pacific dipole mode, synoptic anomalies can superimpose on them and favor the formation of a migrating anticyclone over central-southern Chile and coastal lows over central Chile. Agreeing with the climatological findings, the extreme January 2017 HW analysis suggests that an eastward migratory mid-latitude trough-ridge pattern associated with MJO phase 2 was at work. We highlight that in addition to large- and synoptic-scale features, sub-synoptic processes such as coastal lows can have an important role in shaping the HW events and can lead to amplification of temperature extremes during the HW events.","[Demortier, Alan] Ecole Natl Meteorol, Toulouse, France; [Bozkurt, Deniz] Univ Valparaiso, Dept Meteorol, Valparaiso, Chile; [Bozkurt, Deniz] Univ Valparaiso, Ctr Estudios Atmosfer & Astroestadist CEAAS, Valparaiso, Chile; [Bozkurt, Deniz] Univ Valparaiso, Ctr Invest & Gest Recursos Nat CIGREN, Valparaiso, Chile; [Bozkurt, Deniz; Jacques-Coper, Martin] Ctr Climate & Resilience Res CR 2, Santiago, Chile; [Jacques-Coper, Martin] Univ Concepcion, Dept Geofis, Concepcion, Chile",Universite Federale Toulouse Midi-Pyrenees (ComUE); Universite de Toulouse; Institut National Polytechnique de Toulouse; Universidad de Valparaiso; Universidad de Valparaiso; Universidad de Valparaiso; Universidad de Concepcion,"Bozkurt, D (corresponding author), Univ Valparaiso, Dept Meteorol, Valparaiso, Chile.;Bozkurt, D (corresponding author), Univ Valparaiso, Ctr Estudios Atmosfer & Astroestadist CEAAS, Valparaiso, Chile.;Bozkurt, D (corresponding author), Univ Valparaiso, Ctr Invest & Gest Recursos Nat CIGREN, Valparaiso, Chile.;Bozkurt, D (corresponding author), Ctr Climate & Resilience Res CR 2, Santiago, Chile.",deniz.bozkurt@uv.cl,,"Bozkurt, Deniz/0000-0003-1021-8241",l'Ecole Nationale de la Meteorologie; ANID/CONICYT [77190080];  [ANID/FONDAP/15110009];  [ANID/PIA/Anillo INACH ACT192057];  [ANID/FONDECYT/11200101];  [ANID/FONDECYT/11170486],l'Ecole Nationale de la Meteorologie; ANID/CONICYT; ; ; ; ,"This work was partially funded by ANID/FONDAP/15110009.

The paper concludes with an outlook on new tendencies in the EU's secondary law, especially in terms of Internal Market as well as environment and climate protection related aspects.","[Pielow, Johann-Christian] Ruhr Univ Bochum, Inst Min & Energy Law, Fac Econ, Bochum, Germany",Ruhr University Bochum,"Pielow, JC (corresponding author), Ruhr Univ Bochum, Inst Min & Energy Law, Fac Econ, Bochum, Germany.",christian.pielow@rub.de,,"Johann-Christian, Pielow/0000-0002-7547-0352",,,,,23,6,6,0,3,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",,,978-3-642-19708-6,,,,2011,,,,,147,165,,10.1007/978-3-642-19709-3_9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-19709-3_9,10.1007/978-3-642-19709-3,,19,Economics,Book Citation Index – Social Sciences & Humanities (BKCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BWH46,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000293879300009,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, determining how to set up an external shading system remains a notable issue. In the early design stage, architects have adopted the process of designing the form and function first and then checking whether those characteristics meet the energy-saving specifications. However, this process involves a great deal of repetitive and inefficient work and cannot meet the requirements of energy savings and emission reductions in a global context. Therefore, it is particularly important to seek a design method that combines energy-saving design with form-based design. This paper takes a construction project in Northwest China as its research object. In this study, typical parametric models for external shading are designed. Furthermore, indoor performance objectives based on light environment analysis are proposed, and Ladybug Tools and the genetic algorithm (GA) are used for optimization and verification. The optimization results show that the adaptive shading system can significantly reduce the total cooling energy consumption per unit area in summer by 20% and 15%, respectively. The comfort level throughout the year improved by 14.8% (air conditioning on) and 4.7% (air conditioning off). This study proposes a fast and effective shading parametric design method for architects in the early stage, improving the efficiency and accuracy of performance-based design.","[Wang, Shiliang; Zhang, Qun; Liu, Peng] Xian Univ Architecture & Technol, Sch Architecture, Xian 710064, Peoples R China; [Liang, Rui] Xian Fine Art Acad, Dept Architecture & Environm, Xian 710065, Peoples R China; [Fu, Zitian] Sichuan Agr Univ, Sch Econ, Chengdu 625014, Peoples R China",Xi'an University of Architecture & Technology; Sichuan Agricultural University,"Liu, P (corresponding author), Xian Univ Architecture & Technol, Sch Architecture, Xian 710064, Peoples R China.;Fu, ZT (corresponding author), Sichuan Agr Univ, Sch Econ, Chengdu 625014, Peoples R China.",penman@xauat.edu.cn; 2021208028@stu.sicau.edu.cn,"liu, peng/GMX-0972-2022","liu, peng/0000-0001-6697-8739",National Natural Science Foundation of China [51678466],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This research was funded by National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant No. 51678466.",,53,0,0,5,5,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4433,,ATMOSPHERE-BASEL,Atmosphere,AUG,2022,8,,,,,,1244,10.3390/atmos13081244,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos13081244,,,20,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,4C3WV,,"Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000846389000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, knowledge about the annual and seasonal variations of green roof carbon uptake due to changes in meteorological conditions and water availability remains scarce. We studied the annual variation of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) by eddy-covariance flux measurements during a 5-year period from 2014 to 2019 on a large and unirrigated green roof at the Berlin-Brandenburg airport (BER) in Berlin, Germany. The roof vegetation was dominated by Sedum species and herbs. The BER green roof showed net uptake of carbon in each of the 5 study years with an average uptake of -141.1 g C m(-2) y(-1) and an average measurement uncertainty of +/- 15.5 g C m(-2) y(-1). The NEE, however, was characterized by significant interannual variation in which the maximum annual uptake of -189 g C m(-2) y(-1) in a year with above average precipitation roughly doubles the minimum uptake of -95 g C m(-2) y(-1) in a dry year. The variation of NEE was a function of the annual amount of precipitation and the frequency of rainfall, that is, the number of dry days per year (DDY). The roof might lose its carbon uptake function in a warmer future climate with an increasing number of DDY. Sustainable irrigation of the roof (e.g., rainwater harvesting) could help to maintain the carbon uptake function of the green roof vegetation.","[Konopka, J.; Heusinger, J.; Weber, S.] Tech Univ Carolo Wilhelmina Braunschweig, Inst Geoecol, Climatol & Environm Meteorol, Braunschweig, Germany",Braunschweig University of Technology,"Konopka, J (corresponding author), Tech Univ Carolo Wilhelmina Braunschweig, Inst Geoecol, Climatol & Environm Meteorol, Braunschweig, Germany.",j.konopka@tu-braunschweig.de,,"Weber, Stephan/0000-0003-0335-4691; Heusinger, Jannik/0000-0002-6178-5644",ProjektDEAL,ProjektDEAL,"We thank Hagen Mittendorf (Climatology and Environmental Meteorology, Technische Universitat Braunschweig) for EC station maintenance and Kai Johannsen (Department of Environment of the Berlin Brandenburg Airport) for granting permission to set-up EC-measurements at the green roof site.

Comparing various modeling strategies is crucial for reducing uncertainty related to these responses and for guiding the interpretation of model results. Here, we compared outputs of a dynamic vegetation model (DVM) and an ensemble of statistical bioclimatic envelope models (BEMs) in predicting range shifts of 14 representative tree species in continental Europe. Expanding the number of species and geographic extent compared to previous model comparisons, we found that the DVM produced more conservative range shift estimates, even in long-term equilibrium simulations. The differences in range shift projections were greatest for Mediterranean species, whose expansion northwards was inhibited in the DVM by more competitive prevailing temperate species. In contrast to our expectation, competitive traits of the species studied did not consistently affect the differences. The agreement between BEM and DVM results was highest in boreal species, suggesting that BEMs are an efficient method for modeling species under strong control of abiotic factors. BEMs produced substantially larger range contractions at the southern edge of distribution, in contrary to the DVM, where contractions were more modest. Despite these differences, both approaches also yielded consistent northwards shifts of forest types, which may have substantial negative impacts on forest economy, and alter species composition in natural forest stands.","[Takolander, Antti; Meller, Laura; Cabeza, Mar] Univ Helsinki, Fac Biol & Environm, Global Change & Conservat Grp, POB 65, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Takolander, Antti; Cabeza, Mar] Univ Helsinki, Helsinki Inst Sustainabil Sci, Helsinki, Finland; [Hickler, Thomas] Senckenberg Biodivers & Climate Res Ctr BiK F, Senckenberganlage 25, D-60325 Frankfurt, Germany; [Hickler, Thomas] Goethe Univ, Inst Phys Geog, Geosci, Altenhoferallee 1, D-60438 Frankfurt, Germany; [Meller, Laura] Greenpeace Norden, Kaenkuja 3aB, Helsinki 00560, Finland",University of Helsinki; University of Helsinki; Senckenberg Biodiversitat & Klima- Forschungszentrum (BiK-F); Senckenberg Gesellschaft fur Naturforschung (SGN); Goethe University Frankfurt,"Takolander, A (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Fac Biol & Environm, Global Change & Conservat Grp, POB 65, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland.;Takolander, A (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Helsinki Inst Sustainabil Sci, Helsinki, Finland.",antti.takolander@helsinki.fi; thomas.hickler@senckenberg.de; laura.meller@greenpeace.org; mar.cabeza@helsinki.fi,"Hickler, Thomas/S-6287-2016; Takolander, Antti/H-8878-2019; Cabeza, Mar/ABC-4297-2020","Hickler, Thomas/0000-0002-4668-7552; Takolander, Antti/0000-0002-9237-3765; Cabeza, Mar/0000-0002-7410-7631","LUOVA Doctoral Programme in Wildlife Biology Research, University of Helsinki; research funding program LOEWE-Landesoffensive zur Entwicklung Wissenschaftlichokonomischer Exzellenz of Hesse's Ministry of Higher Education; Academy of Finland [257686]","LUOVA Doctoral Programme in Wildlife Biology Research, University of Helsinki; research funding program LOEWE-Landesoffensive zur Entwicklung Wissenschaftlichokonomischer Exzellenz of Hesse's Ministry of Higher Education; Academy of Finland(Academy of Finland)","We thank the two anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments on the manuscript, and the AFE secretariat for providing species distribution data.

The strategic planning and prioritization of various SDSs require multi-sectoral integrated assessment to ensure sustainability goals are effectively met. This research establishes a systematic integrated framework to assess selected state-of-the-art SDSs in three carbon-intensive sectors: transportation, waste management, and energy production. Multiple sustainable development scenarios were included based on: (1) electrified/intelligent transportation (EV/ITS), (2) waste-to-energy (WTE), and (3) renewable energy sources (RES). The proposed cost-integrated environmental assessment was applied on the case of Dubai which has some of the world highest per capita records of carbon footprint, energy demand, and waste generation. It was found that WTE systems were the most economically viable with required investments of around 8-20 USD/tCO(2)e-reduced, compared to 50-600 and 600-1500 USD/tCO(2)e-reduced with RES and EV/ITS strategies, respectively. The implementation of the optimum multi-sectoral plan, comprising autonomous vehicles, waste incineration, and concentrated solar towers, would achieve around 38% of the national target for carbon reduction in Dubai. The proposed methodology is applicable to other metropolises, particularly where there is limited local data and previous experiences with such sustainable systems.","[Abdallah, Mohamed; Shabib, Ahmad] Univ Sharjah, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates; [Alozi, Abdul Razak; Hussein, Mohamed] McMaster Univ, Dept Civil Engn, 1280 Main St West, Hamilton, ON, Canada",University of Sharjah; McMaster University,"Abdallah, M (corresponding author), Univ Sharjah, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates.",mabdallah@sharjah.ac.ae,,"Abdallah, Mohamed/0000-0002-4304-7234; Alozi, Abdul Razak/0000-0003-0694-1461",,,,,59,1,1,5,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1387-585X,1573-2975,,ENVIRON DEV SUSTAIN,Environ.

Here we perform numerical experiments using a state-of-the-art, fully coupled climate model in which the external forcings with or without the observed SSTs in the tropical eastern Pacific Ocean (TEP) are applied for 1871-2012. Both the observed timing and magnitude of the IO decadal variations are well reproduced in those experiments with the TEP SSTs prescribed to observations. Although the external forcings account for most of the warming trend, the decadal variability in IO SSTs is dominated by internal variability that is induced by the TEP SSTs, especially the Inter-decadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO). The IPO weakens (enhances) the warming of the external forcings by about 50% over the IO during IPO's cold (warm) phase, which contributes about 10% to the recent global warming hiatus since 1999. The decadal variability in IO SSTs is modulated by the IPO-induced atmospheric adjustment through changing surface heat fluxes, sea surface height and thermocline depth.","[Dong, Lu; Zhou, Tianjun; Song, Fengfei; Wu, Bo; Chen, Xiaolong] Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Numer Modeling Atmospher Sci & Geop, Inst Atmospher Phys, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Dong, Lu; Song, Fengfei; Chen, Xiaolong] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Tianjun] JCGCS, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Dai, Aiguo] SUNY Albany, Dept Atmospher & Environm Sci, Albany, NY 12222 USA; [Dai, Aiguo] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Albany; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA","Zhou, TJ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Numer Modeling Atmospher Sci & Geop, Inst Atmospher Phys, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.;Zhou, TJ (corresponding author), JCGCS, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",zhoutj@lasg.iap.ac.cn,"Dong, Lu/K-6072-2019; Chen, Xiaolong/AAO-7147-2020; Dai, Aiguo/D-3487-2009; Wu, Bo/C-8644-2009; Song, Fengfei/L-8239-2015; ZHOU, Tianjun/C-3195-2012; Dai, Aiguo/Y-2443-2019","ZHOU, Tianjun/0000-0002-5829-7279; ","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41330423, 41125017]; Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA05110301]; U.S. National Science Foundation [AGS-1353740]; U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Science [DE-SC0012602]; U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [NA15OAR4310086]; Directorate For Geosciences [1353740] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); U.S. National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Science(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); Directorate For Geosciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)),"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos 41330423 and 41125017) and the Strategic Priority Research Program -Climate Change: Carbon Budget and Related Issues of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Grant No. XDA05110301).

Sherman's series was a response to the National Endowment for the Arts controversy, in which American artists such as Andres Serrano and the late Robert Mapplethorpe, whose work was considered obscene by the Republican Congress, were censored. Many artists in the culture-war period had their grants rescinded. The American avant-garde writer Kathy Acker published My Mother: Demonology in 1993. A prominent concern of Acker's in the work is what she termed her ` writing freedom' in a climate of cultural expurgation by the Republican elite. In particular, Acker was worried that she was ` internalizing certain censorships'. This article addresses Sherman's and Acker's work in a comparative context to explore, through the theoretical work of Julia Kristeva, the ways in which their responses to a climate of political censorship can be read as forms of intimate revolt. Kristeva's notion of ejection-the act of placing something beyond the scope of the possible-transpires as ` a condition of art's creation' in Sherman's and Acker's work. Acker and Sherman use the pornographic reference in their work to disrupt and dislocate the narrative and image from convention in order to de-eroticize the body, against heteronormativity's terms, and empower the female sex organs. Eversion-that is, in Sherman's and Acker's works, the act of turning the institutional and maternal body inside out-emerges as a mode of resistance to the danger of the writer and the artist internalizing cultural restrictions. The everted body creates a site of radical interiority which becomes the ( impossible) site for the radical ( re-) embodiment of the feminine subject.","[Colby, Georgina] Sothebys Inst Art, Photog, London, England",Sotheby's Institute of Art,"Colby, G (corresponding author), Royal Holloway Univ London, English, London, England.",,,,,,,,28,3,3,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0957-4042,1470-1367,,WOMEN,Women,,2012,2,,,,182,200,,10.1080/09574042.2012.677236,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09574042.2012.677236,,,19,"Humanities, Multidisciplinary",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Arts & Humanities - Other Topics,V63BD,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000211008000003,View Full Record in Web of Science

This is the first time that the CCLM is adapted and evaluated for the East Asia Monsoon region; the setup is considered a starting point for further improvements in this region by the CCLM community. The evaluation results show that the CCLM is able to reasonably capture the climate features in this region, especially the monsoon dynamics on small scales. However, total precipitation in the northern part of the domain, over the Tibetan Plateau, and over east Indonesia has a pronounced wet bias.

In order to use NOAA images, they need to be transformed from image coordinate system into map coordinate system. This paper proposes a method that corrects the errors caused by this transformation. First, elevation values are read from GTOPO30 database and they are verified to divide data into flat and rough blocks. The elevation errors of all blocks are then calculated based on the elevation values. After correcting elevation errors, residual errors are specified by GCP template matching. On the flat blocks, residual errors are corrected by affine transformation; on the rough blocks, residual errors are corrected by applying Radial Basic Function Transformation to the residual errors of the blocks that match GCP templates. With this correction method, residual errors are corrected precisely and the errors of interpolation process are reduced. This method was applied to correct the errors for NOAA images receiving in Tokyo, Bangkok and Ulaanbaatar. The results proved that this is a high accurate geometric correction method.","[Van, An Ngoc; Nakazawa, Mitsuru; Aoki, Yoshimitsu] Shibaura Inst Technol, Koto Ku, Tokyo 1358548, Japan",Shibaura Institute of Technology,"Van, AN (corresponding author), Shibaura Inst Technol, Koto Ku, 3-5-7 Toyosu, Tokyo 1358548, Japan.",,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,0,SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING,BELLINGHAM,"1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010 USA",0277-786X,,978-0-8194-6906-9,P SOC PHOTO-OPT INS,,,2007,,,,,74810,74810,,10.1117/12.737643,http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.737643,,,9,"Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Remote Sensing",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Engineering; Remote Sensing,BHJ09,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000253478400031,View Full Record in Web of Science

Some of the major challenges facing hospital nurses are the personnel turnover, emotional loading and health care reforms. After primary occupational safety and risk management, complementary positive health promotion approaches with cultural interventions can be experimented. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between well-being indicators of hospital nurses and their participation in cultural events provided by the employer (theater, concerts, exhibitions, museums, sight-seeing, and musicals) during past 6 months. METHODS: Subjective well-being was measured by work engagement, workplace support for new ideas, work satisfaction and experienced stress. RESULTS: A dose-dependent association was found between participation in cultural events and positive psychology parameters of occupational well-being (support for new ideas and work engagement), but the experience of stress was unrelated to participation in cultural events. Collective participation has a positive covariant effect on work engagement and seems to mediate the innovative work climate measured by workplace support for new ideas. CONCLUSIONS: Collective cultural events for employees may promote positive aspects of occupational wellbeing.","[Tuisku, Katinka] Univ Helsinki, Outpatient Clin Assessment Abil Work, Helsinki, Finland; [Tuisku, Katinka] Univ Helsinki, Cent Hosp, Helsinki, Finland; [Pulkki-Raback, Laura] Univ Helsinki, Helsinki Coll Adv Studies, Helsinki, Finland; [Pulkki-Raback, Laura] Natl Inst Hlth & Welf, Mental Hlth Promot Unit, Vaasa, Finland; [Virtanen, Marianna] Finnish Inst Occupat Hlth, Unit Expertise Work & Org, Helsinki, Finland",University of Helsinki; University of Helsinki; Helsinki University Central Hospital; University of Helsinki; Finland National Institute for Health & Welfare; Finnish Institute of Occupational Health,"Tuisku, K (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Helsinki 00029, Finland.;Tuisku, K (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Cent Hosp, Outpatient Clin Assessment Abil Work, PB 442, Helsinki 00029, Finland.",katinka.tuisku@hus.fi,,,Juho Vainio Foundation; Signe and Ane Gyllenberg Foundation; Bothnia Welfare Coalition for Research and Knowledge network,Juho Vainio Foundation; Signe and Ane Gyllenberg Foundation; Bothnia Welfare Coalition for Research and Knowledge network,"We thank the Medical Unit of the Helsinki Central Hospital for its participation, and we especially thank the Director of Nursing, Marja Renholm, Occupational Safety Officer, Eva Ihaksi and her predecessor, Occupational Safety Officer, Riitta Sahrman for their co-operation in the study design, and Development Manager Juho Mattila for carrying out the Digium questionnaire.

In addition, climate change has both positive and negative impacts on ecosystem productivity. To combat climate change, the Paris Agreement has set the goal of limiting global warming well below 2 degrees C with an ultimate target of 1.5 degrees C above preindustrial levels. It remains unclear how ecosystem productivity will respond to these warming targets. Here, we project global changes in gross (GPP) and net (NPP) primary productivity under 1.5 degrees C/2 degrees C warming using a dynamic vegetation model coupled with a state-of-art climate model. We use site-level observations to validate the present-day simulations and the multimodel ensemble to validate the future projections. We identify the main drivers of ecosystem changes by distinguishing between the impacts of CO2 fertilization, fast climatic responses to CO2 radiative perturbation, and slow climatic feedbacks to ocean warming due to the large heat capacity. Compared with the present day, global GPP increases by 11.5% (20.9%) and NPP increases by 14.8% (27.1%) under the 1.5 degrees C (2 degrees C) warming scenario with similar magnitudes of change in the tropics and subtropics. Changes in the leaf area index mainly follow those of GPP/NPP but with more significant enhancement in boreal regions. CO2 fertilization causes the dominant contributions to GPP changes over 83% of land areas. The slow responses to ocean warming cause negative changes in GPP/NPP and partly offset regional CO2 fertilization over the tropics, where the climate is projected to be drier due to atmosphere-ocean feedback. The fast climatic responses to CO2 radiative perturbation further decrease GPP/NPP but with a moderate magnitude. The projection suggests that ecosystem productivity will increase in a warmer climate but with large spatial heterogeneity.","[Tian, Chenguang; Zhou, Hao; Lei, Yadong; Ma, Yimian; Cao, Yang] Chinese Acad Sci, Climate Change Res Ctr, Inst Atmospher Phys, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Tian, Chenguang; Zhou, Hao; Lei, Yadong; Ma, Yimian; Cao, Yang] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Yue, Xu] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol NUIST, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Atmospher Environm & Equip, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Jiangsu Key Lab Atmospher Environm Monitoring & P, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology","Yue, X (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol NUIST, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Atmospher Environm & Equip, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Jiangsu Key Lab Atmospher Environm Monitoring & P, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China.",yuexu@nuist.edu.cn,"Yue, Xu/ABD-9066-2021",,National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFA0603802]; Jiangsu Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars [BK20200040]; Startup Foundation for Introducing Talent of NUIST,National Key Research and Development Program of China; Jiangsu Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars; Startup Foundation for Introducing Talent of NUIST,"This work was jointly supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (grant no. 2017YFA0603802) , Jiangsu Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars (grant no.

J,"Coppes, W; Jansen, L",,,,"Coppes, Wietse; Jansen, Leo",,,Beyond categorisation: On Piet Mondrian's artistry and success (1911-1919),OUD HOLLAND,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"This article examines the strategies and means Piet Mondrian (1872-1944) employed to attract attention to his work and ideas, and the kind of success this brought him. The authors have concentrated on the years 1911-1919, because Mondrian's work underwent drastic changes at this time and the period is well documented. Our findings were tested against the 'laws' of success as formulated by Alan Bowness in The conditions of success (1989) and Albert-Laszlo Barabasi in The formula (2018). Although, as a case study, Mondrian could be considered to conform partially with the theories laid down by Bowness and Barabasi, his career also flouts them. Joining various artists' societies and exhibition initiatives allowed Mondrian to build up a reputation as a talented artist in the years to 1910. He also had a strong network of collectors, critics and museum curators, which enabled him to sell his work, although he still had to make other kinds of work to earn a living. When, in around 1908, what he produced became too modern for the art climate of the Netherlands, he looked for new ways to gain recognition for his endeavours, which were focused on finding an expressive form for a new, spiritual art. In 1912 he moved to Paris to take advantage of the modernising influence of Cubism there. However, his stay was cut short by the outbreak of the First World War. Back in the Netherlands, he had to find new supporters for his now radically changed art. He did this by once again choosing suitable moments to strike up new relationships, or maintain existing ones, with the right people in the art world. Meeting Theo van Doesburg (1883-1931) led to the founding of De Stijl magazine, in which Mondrian published his art-theoretical creed 'De nieuwe beelding in de schilderkunst' ('Neo-Plasticism in painting'). This positioned him within the context of the international avant-garde for a long time to come. Yet Mondrian never enjoyed major success among a broader audience. In fact, he was unsuccessful, according to the models formulated by Bowness and Barabasi, because he did not become rich and famous. However, Mondrian's priority was never personal success, but the dissemination of his art and his theory of art, which pointed the way to a better society for the people of the future.","[Coppes, Wietse] RKD Netherlands Inst Art Hist, Mondrian & De Stijl arch, The Hague, Netherlands; [Jansen, Leo] Royal Netherlands Acad Arts & Sci, Huygens Inst, Amsterdam, Netherlands",Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts & Sciences; Huygens Institute for the History of the Netherlands (KNAW),"Coppes, W (corresponding author), RKD Netherlands Inst Art Hist, Mondrian & De Stijl arch, The Hague, Netherlands.",,,,Fondation Custodia;  [1600-1920],Fondation Custodia; ,"This article is part of the theme issue Chance, strategy and success in the lives of Dutch artists (1600-1920).

(2014), which was based on the Angstrom-Prescott relationship between global radiation and sunshine duration, was evaluated. The parameters of this relationship seemed to be rather stable across the dimming and brightening periods. Thus, the authors concluded that the variation in global radiation is more influenced by changes in cloud cover and sunshine duration than by the direct aerosol effects. In our study, done for the Potsdam station (one of six globally distributed stations, the source of one of the longest observational records and closely located to former hot spots of aerosol emission), we tested and rejected the hypothesis that the dimming of global radiation directly caused by aerosols is negligible. The residuals of the Angstrom-Prescott regression reveal a statistically significant positive temporal trend and a temporal level segmentation. The latter was consistent with the temporal emission patterns around Potsdam. The trend in the residuals only disappeared when the model intercept varied according to the temporal level segmentation. The magnitude of the direct aerosol effect on the level changes in global radiation derived from the modified Angstrom-Prescott relationship was in the range indicated in previous studies. Thus, from here, a specific request cannot be made for a revision of current climate models state-of-the-art representation of both the cooling effect directly caused by aerosols and the temperature sensitivity to the increase of greenhouse gases.","[Vetter, Tobias; Wechsung, Frank] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Potsdam, Germany",Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung,"Vetter, T (corresponding author), Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Potsdam, Germany.",,,"Vetter, Tobias/0000-0001-7627-9464",project ISI-MIP2 [FKZ 01LS1201A1],project ISI-MIP2,We thank Julia Reinhardt and Valentina Krysanova for their helpful comments on earlier versions of the manuscript.

This presents a challenge for the detection of anthropogenically forced hydroclimate changes on these spatiotemporal scales because the signal of anthropogenic changes is modest, compared to the noise of natural variability. However, previous studies have shown that this signal-to-noise ratio can be greatly improved in a large model ensemble where each member contains the same signal but different noise. Here, using multiple state-of-the-art large ensembles from two climate models, the authors quantitatively assess the detectability of anthropogenically caused decadal shifts in precipitation-minus-evaporation (PmE) mean state against natural variability, focusing on North America during 2000-50. Anthropogenic forcing is projected to cause detectable (signal larger than noise) shifts in PmE mean state relative to the 1950-99 climatology over 50%-70% of North America by 2050. The earliest detectable signals include, during November-April, a moistening over northeastern North America and a drying over southwestern North America and, during MayOctober, a drying over central North America. Different processes are responsible for these signals. Changes in submonthly transient eddy moisture fluxes account for the northeastern moistening and central drying, while monthly atmospheric circulation changes explain the southwestern drying. These model findings suggest that despite the dominant role of natural internal variability on decadal time scales, anthropogenic shifts in PmE mean state can be detected over most of North America before the middle of the current century.","[Zhang, Honghai] Princeton Univ, Program Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Zhang, Honghai; Delworth, Thomas L.] NOAA, Geophys Fluid Dynam Lab, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA",National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Princeton University; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Zhang, HH (corresponding author), Princeton Univ, Program Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.;Zhang, HH (corresponding author), NOAA, Geophys Fluid Dynam Lab, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA.",honghai.zhang@noaa.gov,"Delworth, Thomas L/C-5191-2014","Delworth, Thomas L/0000-0003-4865-5391",NOAA/GFDL,NOAA/GFDL(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA),"We thank Salvatore Pascale, Hiroyuki Murakami, and three anonymous reviewers for insightful and constructive comments on the manuscript.

The results show that the models and their multimodel ensemble mean (MME) perform well in reproducing the interannual variability of the climatology and the spatiotemporal distribution of the first mode of summer precipitation in the pan-Asian monsoon region. The associated oceanic and atmospheric circulation indicators are also well captured, such as the spatiotemporal structures of the simultaneous El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Antarctic Oscillation in the Pacific Ocean (AAO(SP)). Moreover, the interannual variation of the preceding AAO(SP) can also be captured by some of the coupled models. For individual models, the ECMWF, Meteo-France, and Met Office models exhibit better skill with respect to the first mode of summer precipitation in the pan-Asian monsoon region, which displays a tripole pattern from north to south over 80 degrees-140 degrees E. In addition, these models can successfully predict the intensity and location of the associated ENSO, as well as the simultaneous summer AAO(SP) distributions. By contrast, the prediction capabilities of the Leibniz Institute of Marine Sciences (IFM-GEOMAR) and Euro-Mediterranean Center for Climate Change (CMCC-INGV) models are relatively weaker. Furthermore, the predictions of the second mode of the summer precipitation in the pan-Asian monsoon region are investigated. Some of the ENSEMBLES models show good capability in predicting the spatiotemporal distribution of the second mode, owing to the successful prediction of the atmospheric convection activities over the tropical Indian Ocean.","[Gao, Ya; Wang, Huijun; Chen, Dong] Chinese Acad Sci, Nansen Zhu Int Res Ctr, Inst Atmospher Phys, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Wang, Huijun; Chen, Dong] Chinese Acad Sci, Climate Change Res Ctr, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Chen, Dong] Chinese Acad Sci, Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Gao, Y (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Nansen Zhu Int Res Ctr, Inst Atmospher Phys, Hua Yan Li 40, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.",gaoy@mail.iap.ac.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [41421004, 41210007]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grants 41421004 and 41210007).,,64,4,6,0,10,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0894-8755,1520-0442,,J CLIMATE,J.

It was suggested that, while a direct link between environmental change and significant cultural change in the archaeological record has yet to be demonstrated unambiguously, midden analysis has the potential to provide the as-yet missing link between changes in climate, environment and human responses over past millennia. We test this hypothesis with a preliminary sclerochronological analysis (i.e. of sequential stable isotopes of oxygen) of archaeological shell samples from all three regions.

Unfortunately, model changes have adversely affected the stability of the climatologic fields, introducing time-varying biases in the anomaly patterns of the Climate Diagnostic Data Base (CDDB). Fortunately, NCEP has addressed this issue by rerunning a state-of-the-art model using fixed assimilation, parameterization, and physics in order to derive a true climatology and anomalies. The authors compare the previous CDDB temperatures with those derived from the stable reanalysis. Results show major improvements for climate diagnostics and monitoring. Also compared are the reanalysis temperatures with brightness temperature T-b observed by the Microwave Sounding Units (MSU), flown aboard the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) series of polar-orbiting satellites (TIROS-N to NOAA-14). This MSU dataset has a precision of about 0.02 degrees C globally, and it is available from December 1978. Therefore, the 17 levels of the reanalysis level temperature were weighted to simulate the MSU T-b in order to measure its precision over the 17-yr record. Global time series of the spatial correlations between full fields approach 1.0 throughout the entire record, whereas correlations for the anomaly fields can drop below 0.8 during the high sun season in the Northern Hemisphere. In 1994 the correlations drop below 0.65, which is the largest difference between the two datasets. An EOF on the global T-b differences from both datasets identified a relative drift beginning in 1991. The maximum loading was in the tropical Pacific, although it also extended over the tropical Indian Ocean and the Asian landmass. Results indicate that the reanalysis anomalies are getting progressively colder, relative to the MSU, during the early 1990s. The authors associate this drift with the changes in satellite retrievals and a reduction of Soviet Union data during its breakup. Additional sources of bias may be associated with aerosol contamination after the Mt. Pinotuba eruption and/or drift in the NOAA-11 sensor. Although there is a relative offset in the anomalies, the reanalysis temperatures have a better correspondence with the radiosonde network after 1990. Therefore it appears that the bias is associated with an improvement in the reanalysis input data during the last several years. Since changes in the datasets assimilated into the model can introduce a slight bias, new procedures should be developed to minimizes these effects in any future reanalysis. Finally, although the reanalysis has a slight drift in the later years, the comparison with the MSU spatial anomalies generally showed excellent results. The reanalysis represents a substantial improvement over the CDDB for monitoring climate variability.","NOAA,NATL WEATHER SERV,NCEP,CLIMATE PREDICT CTR,WASHINGTON,DC 20233",National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Basist, AN (corresponding author), NOAA,NESDIS,NATL CLIMA DATA CTR,GLOBAL CLIMATE LAB,151 PATTON AVE,RM 120,ASHEVILLE,NC 28801, USA.",,,,,,,,28,63,69,0,3,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693",0003-0007,,,B AM METEOROL SOC,Bull.

Studies that focus on climatic variations such as variability in rainfall and temperature are vital, particularly in predominant rainfed areas. Forecasting rainfall is very essential in the agriculture sector due to the dependence of many people, while it is very complex to accurately predict rainfall due to its dynamic nature. This study aims to present a deep forecasting model based on optimized (Gated Recurrent Unit) GRU neural network to predict rainfall in Pakistan based on the 30 years of climate data from 1991 to 2020. The climatic variables were first extracted and then fine-tuned by eliminating outliers and extreme values from the data set for precise forecasting. Data normalization strategies were further utilized to adjust numeric values into a standard scale without distorting divergences or losing useful information. The proposed model achieved high prediction accuracy by maintaining minimal Normalized Mean Absolute Error (NMAE) and Normalized Root Mean Squared Error (NRMSE) compared to state-of-the-art rainfall forecasting models. Climatic variables used in the forecasting were evaluated in terms of correlation and regression analysis. The correlation results showed that temperature has a negative association and air quality variables have a positive association with rainfall in each quarter of the year. The second and third quarters of the year showed a high association with rainfall, whereas the air quality variables showed a lesser or no association with rainfall during the first and second quarters of the year. The results further showed a strong association of climatic variables with rainfall for all months of the year. The minimal loss achieved by the proposed model also demonstrated the feasibility of selected variables in precise forecasting of rainfall regardless of volatile climatic conditions.","[Fahad, Shah; Wei, Kailei] Hainan Univ, Sch Management, Haikou 570228, Hainan, Peoples R China; [Su, Fang] Northwest Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Xian, Peoples R China; [Khan, Sufyan Ullah] Univ Stavanger, UiS Business Sch, Dept Econ & Finance, N-4036 Stavanger, Norway; [Naeem, Muhammad Rashid] Leshan Normal Univ, Sch Elect Informat & Artificial Intelligence, Leshan 614000, Peoples R China",Hainan University; Northwest University Xi'an; Universitetet i Stavanger; Leshan Normal University,"Wei, KL (corresponding author), Hainan Univ, Sch Management, Haikou 570228, Hainan, Peoples R China.",shah.fahad@mail.xjtu.edu.cn; weikailei@hainanu.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [72173036]; INFO,National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); INFO,This research is fi nancially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China Grant No. (72173036) .INFO,,60,2,2,10,10,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0048-9697,1879-1026,,SCI TOTAL ENVIRON,Sci.

It is evident that precipitation causes a significant reduction in speed and maximum flow on many links of the corridor as well as a downward reduction in the overall speed-flow relationship.

It is now crucial to understand the intricate relationships between precipitation and evapotranspiration in these environments, particularly in less-studied locations characterized by a cold and humid climate. This study presents state-of-the-art measurements of energy and water budgets components over three years (2016-2018) at the Montmorency Forest, Quebec, Canada: a balsam fir boreal forest that receives similar to 1600mm of precipitation annually (continental subarctic climate; Koppen classification subtype Dfc). Precipitation, evapotranspiration and potential evapotranspiration at the site are compared with observations from thirteen experimental sites around the world. These intercomparison sites (89 study-years) encompass various types of climate and vegetation (black spruces, jack pines, etc.) encountered in boreal forests worldwide. The Montmorency Forest stands out by receiving the largest amount of precipitation. Across all sites, water availability seems to be the principal evapotranspiration constraint, as precipitation tends to be more influential than potential evapotranspiration and other factors. This leads to the Montmorency Forest generating the largest amount of evapotranspiration, on average similar to 550mm y(-1). This value appears to be an ecosystem maximum for evapotranspiration, which may be explained either by a physiological limit or a limited energy availability due to the presence of cloud cover. The Montmorency Forest water budget evacuates the precipitation excess mostly by watershed discharges, at an average rate of similar to 1050mm y(-1), with peaks during the spring freshet. This behaviour, typical of mountainous headwater basins, necessarily influence downstream hydrological regimes to a large extent. This study provides a much needed insight in the hydrological regimes of a humid boreal-forested mountainous watershed, a type of basin rarely studied with precise energy and water budgets before.","[Isabelle, Pierre-Erik; Nadeau, Daniel F.; Anctil, Francois; Jutras, Sylvain] Univ Laval, CentrEau Water Res Ctr, 1065 Ave Med, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Isabelle, Pierre-Erik; Nadeau, Daniel F.; Anctil, Francois] Univ Laval, Dept Civil & Water Engn, 1065 Ave Med, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Jutras, Sylvain] Univ Laval, Dept Forestry & Wood Sci, 2405 Rue Terrasse, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Rousseau, Alain N.] Inst Natl Rech Sci, Ctr Eau Terre Environm, 490 Rue Couronne, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Music, Biljana] Ouranos Consortium, 550 Sherbrooke St West, Montreal, PQ, Canada",Laval University; Laval University; Laval University; University of Quebec; Institut national de la recherche scientifique (INRS); Ouranos Consortium,"Nadeau, DF (corresponding author), Univ Laval, Dept Civil & Water Engn, 1065 Ave Med, Quebec City, PQ, Canada.",pierre-erik.isabelle.1@ulaval.ca; daniel.nadeau@gci.ulaval.ca,"Isabelle, Pierre-Erik/AAT-3776-2021","Isabelle, Pierre-Erik/0000-0002-2819-1377; Music, Biljana/0000-0002-8760-8996; Anctil, Francois/0000-0003-4568-4883; Jutras, Sylvain/0000-0002-6916-3575","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Ouranos Consortium; Hydro-Quebec, Environment and Climate Change Canada; Ministere de l'Environnement et de la Lutte contre les Changements climatiques (MELCC); NSERC [RDCPJ-477125-14]; Fonds de recherche du Quebec -Nature et Technologies (FRQNT)","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); Ouranos Consortium; Hydro-Quebec, Environment and Climate Change Canada; Ministere de l'Environnement et de la Lutte contre les Changements climatiques (MELCC); NSERC(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); Fonds de recherche du Quebec -Nature et Technologies (FRQNT)","The authors acknowledge all Montmorency Forest staff, especially Patrick Pineault and Charles Villeneuve, for their extremely valuable help in the field.

We use the latest state-of-the-art composition-climate model simulations to contrast human exposure to fine particulate matter in Africa under a baseline scenario with high material consumption, population growth, and warming to that projected under a sustainability scenario with lower consumption, population growth, and warming. Evaluating the mortality impacts of these exposures, we find that under the low warming scenario annual premature deaths due to PM2.5 are reduced by roughly 515,000 by 2050 relative to the high warming scenario (100,000, 175,000, 55,000, 140,000, and 45,000 in Northern, West, Central, East, and Southern Africa, respectively). This reduction rises to similar to 800,000 by the 2090s, though by that time much of the difference is attributable to the projected differences in population. By contrast, during the first half of the century benefits are driven predominantly by emissions changes. Depending on the region, we find large intermodel spreads of similar to 25%-50% in projected future exposures owing to different physics across the ensemble of 6 global models. The spread of projected deaths attributable to exposure to fine particulate matter, including uncertainty in the exposure-response function, are reduced in every region to similar to.20%-35% by the non-linear exposure-response function. Differences between the scenarios have an even narrower spread of similar to 5%-25% and are highly statistically significant in all regions for all models. These results provide valuable information for policy-makers to consider when working toward climate change mitigation and sustainable development goals. Plain Language Summary The economies in many low- and middle-income countries in Africa are heavily reliant on fossil fuel consumption; many of these countries are on development trajectories that will lead to increased fossil fuel use in the future. Burning fossil fuels produces air pollution, such as fine particulate matter, that has large-scale health consequences. However, reduced fossil fuel consumption under more sustainable and climate-friendly development pathways has the potential to provide enormous public health benefits via reduced air pollution, especially in currently polluted regions. We examine changes in human exposure to air pollution, and associated premature deaths, in various regions in Africa under a future scenario with high consumption, population growth, and warming, and under a more sustainable scenario with lower consumption, population growth, and warming. We find that under the low warming scenario, premature deaths due to air pollution are reduced by about half a million people per year by 2050 relative to the high warming scenario. Benefits are especially large in West and East Africa, dominated by Nigeria and by Ethiopia and Uganda/Rwanda/Burundi, respectively. These findings provide information for policy-makers to consider when working toward climate change mitigation and sustainable development goals.","[Shindell, D.; Parsons, L.; Nagamoto, E.; Chang, J.] Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Faluvegi, G.] Columbia Univ, Ctr Climate Syst Res, New York, NY USA; [Faluvegi, G.] NASA, Goddard Inst Space Studies, New York, NY USA",Duke University; Columbia University; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center,"Shindell, D (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",drew.shindell@duke.edu,"Shindell, Drew/D-4636-2012","Shindell, Drew/0000-0003-1552-4715; Chang, Jonathan/0000-0003-3296-8182",NASA [80NSSC19M0138],NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)),"We thank Steven Turnock for CMIP6 surface PM data and the NASA High-End Computing Program through the NASA Center for Climate Simulation at Goddard Space Flight Center and the Duke Compute Cluster for computational resources.

The country has also become the world's leading producer of cashew nuts. How to understand this boom? It is partly driven by markets (stagnation of cotton and cocoa prices versus rising prices of cashew nuts over two periods) but its determining factors are much more complex. The global hypothesis of this study is that the adoption of cashew tree is an adaptation to the loss of forest rent and to climate change, to the increasing cost of chemical inputs for cotton and cocoa, but also responds to land insecurity. An in-depth study was conducted in 2016-2017 in 6 sites chosen along a north-south gradient: Mankono, Konahiri, Bonon, Yamoussoukro, Bayota-Gagnoa and Soubre, with 40 to 100 farms per site, with partial updates in 2018. The survey confirms the hypothesis. Cashew tree, a robust, drought-tolerant tree, for the time being avoids planters relying on chemical inputs and credit, rebuilds a kind of forest canopy, but is also a land marker (it brings an informal land security in the home villages of the migrants but also in their cocoa villages). It becomes the tool of a social and ecological transition. That transition includes significant information, labour and investment flows between the two economic spaces. It is essentially a smallholders' innovation. In the cocoa regions, in its agroforestry version made of cocoa and cashew intercropping, the cashew tree reduces the mortality of cocoa seedlings, and its adoption takes its full dimension of agro-ecological transition.

When midday air temperature was 30-32 degrees C, fruit surfaces were on average 5.6 (SN), 4.6 (EC), 3.8 (RE) and 2.4 degrees C (SU) cooler than CO fruit. RY did not significantly reduce fruit skin temperature compared to the CO on all measurement days. Total sunburn incidence was 34.3% for the CO. All treatments significantly reduced sunburn browning (Class 2), necrosis (Class 3) and total sunburn compared to the CO. Shade net was most effective, followed by RE, EC, SU and RY, in order of decreasing efficacy. Sunburn browning contributed about 78% to total sunburn in the CO but over 90% in the sunburn control treatments. SN reduced blush color significantly. EC and RE increased fruit mass and diameter while under SU they were reduced compared to the CO and other treatments. However, EC and RE fruit had lower firmness than CO fruit on the shaded side. Starch degradation pattern was reduced by SN and RE, while soluble solids concentrations and titratable acid concentrations were not affected. In conclusion, all control measures can potentially reduce sunburn although none would eliminate it. Availability of water for EC, and financial feasibility are factors which will influence the choice of technology for each farm.","[Gindaba, J.; Wand, S. J.

The aim of this study is to assess the skill of fully initialized September and March pan-Arctic sea ice forecasts in terms of climatology and interannual anomalies. The predictions are initialized using full field initialization of each component of the system. In spite of a drift due to radiative biases in the coupled model during the melt season, the full initialization of the sea ice cover on 1 May leads to skillful forecasts of the September sea ice extent (SIE) anomalies. The skill of the prediction is also significantly high when considering anomalies of the SIE relative to the long-term linear trend. It confirms that the anomaly of spring sea ice cover in itself plays a role in preconditioning a September SIE anomaly. The skill of predictions for March SIE initialized on 1 November is also encouraging, and it can be partly attributed to persistent features of the fall sea ice cover. The present study gives insight into the current ability of state-of-the-art coupled climate systems to perform operational seasonal forecasts of the Arctic sea ice cover up to 5 months in advance.","[Chevallier, Matthieu; Salas y Melia, David; Voldoire, Aurore; Deque, Michel] Meteo France, Ctr Natl Rech Meterol, Grp Etude Atmosphere Meterol, CNRS, F-31057 Toulouse, France; [Garric, Gilles] Mercator Ocean, Ramonville St Agne, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Meteo France,"Chevallier, M (corresponding author), Meteo France, CNRM GAME GMGEC ASTER, 42 Ave Gaspard Coriolis, F-31057 Toulouse, France.",matthieu.chevallier@meteo.fr,"Garric, Gilles/O-9065-2016","Garric, Gilles/0000-0002-5385-710X; Chevallier, Matthieu/0000-0003-2033-166X","Ecole des Ponts ParisTech, Marne-la-Vallee (France); Total RD","Ecole des Ponts ParisTech, Marne-la-Vallee (France); Total RD","This work formed part of a Ph.D. thesis at the Centre National de Recherches Meteorologiques, Toulouse (France), funded by Ecole des Ponts ParisTech, Marne-la-Vallee (France).

This contribution examines the state of research and practice of ML for its applications to wind engineering. In addition to ML applications to wind climate, terrain/topography, aerodynamics/aeroelasticity and structural dynamics (following traditional Alan G. Davenport Wind Loading Chain), the review also extends to cover wind damage assessment and wind-related hazard mitigation and response (considering emerging performance-based and resilience-based wind design methodologies). This state-of-the-art review suggests to what extend ML has been utilized in each of these topic areas within wind engineering and provides a comprehensive summary to improve understanding how learning algorithms work and when these schemes succeed or fail. Moreover, critical challenges and prospects of ML applications in wind engineering are identified to facilitate future research efforts.","[Wu, Teng] SUNY Buffalo, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA; [Snaiki, Reda] Univ Quebec, Ecole Technol Super, Dept Construct Engn, Montreal, PQ, Canada",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Buffalo; University of Quebec; Ecole de Technologie Superieure - Canada; University of Quebec Montreal,"Wu, T (corresponding author), SUNY Buffalo, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA.",tengwu@buffalo.edu,,"Snaiki, Reda/0000-0003-4326-3655",,,,,307,4,4,18,24,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2297-3362,,FRONT BUILT ENVIRON,Front.

There are numerous proposed methodologies to perform the adjustments - ranging from simple scaling approaches to advanced multi-variate distribution-based mapping. In practice, the actual bias adjustment method is a small step in the application, and most of the processing handles reading, writing, and linking different data sets. These practical processing steps become especially heavy with increasing model domain size and resolution in both time and space. Here, we present a new implementation platform for bias adjustment, which we call MIdAS (MultI-scale bias AdjuStment). MIdAS is a modern code implementation that supports features such as modern Python libraries that allow efficient processing of large data sets at computing clusters, state-of-the-art bias adjustment methods based on quantile mapping, and day-of-year-based adjustments to avoid artificial discontinuities, and it also introduces cascade adjustment in time and space. The MIdAS platform has been set up such that it will continually support development of methods aimed towards higher-resolution climate model data, explicitly targeting cases where there is a scale mismatch between data sets. The paper presents a comparison of different quantile-mapping-based bias adjustment methods and the subsequently chosen code implementation for MIdAS. A current recommended setup of the MIdAS bias adjustment is presented and evaluated in a pseudo-reference setup for regions around the world. Special focus is put on preservation of trends in future climate projections, and it is shown that the cascade adjustments perform better than the standard quantile mapping implementations and are often similar to methods that explicitly preserve trends.","[Berg, Peter; Bosshard, Thomas; Yang, Wei; Zimmermann, Klaus] Swedish Meteorol & Hydrol Inst, Hydrol Res Unit, Folkborgsvagen 17, S-60176 Norrkoping, Sweden",Swedish Meteorological & Hydrological Institute,"Berg, P (corresponding author), Swedish Meteorol & Hydrol Inst, Hydrol Res Unit, Folkborgsvagen 17, S-60176 Norrkoping, Sweden.",peter.berg@smhi.se,,,SMHI; project DIRT-X; FFG Austria; BMBF Germany; FORMAS Sweden; NWO NL; RCN Norway; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme of the European Union [776608],SMHI; project DIRT-X; FFG Austria; BMBF Germany(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); FORMAS Sweden(Swedish Research Council Formas); NWO NL; RCN Norway; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme of the European Union,"The development of MIdAS was supported by SMHI and the project DIRT-X.

Here we explore possible ways in which science can learn from the arts, focusing specifically on experiences derived from the art of magic and on the limitations of human cognition. Generations of stage magicians or illusionists have made sophisticated use of the weaknesses in human systems of perception and interpretation. We highlight three important principles of magic tricks, including: (1) the audience see what it expects, (2) it is blind to all but the focus of attention, and (3) ideas spring predictably from a primed mind. These principles highlight a number of important tendencies, which we argue are shortcomings in the ability of scientists to perceive the world, and which scientists need to be aware of. Consciously addressing these shortcomings may help scientists improve their creativity, and will strengthen their capacity to address complex and global challenges.","[Osterblom, Henrik] Stockholm Univ, Stockholm Resilience Ctr, Stockholm, Sweden; [Scheffer, Marten] Wageningen Univ, Aquat Ecol & Water Qual Management, NL-6700 AP Wageningen, Netherlands; [Westley, Frances R.] Univ Waterloo, Waterloo Inst Social Innovat, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; [van Esso, Miguel L.] Univ Buenos Aires, Coll Agr, RA-1053 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Miller, John] Gray Jay Graph, Madison, WI USA; [Bascompte, Jordi] Univ Zurich, Inst Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland",Stockholm University; Wageningen University & Research; University of Waterloo; University of Buenos Aires; University of Zurich,"Osterblom, H (corresponding author), Stockholm Univ, Stockholm Resilience Ctr, Stockholm, Sweden.",,"Bascompte, Jordi/B-7596-2008","Bascompte, Jordi/0000-0002-0108-6411",BEAM (Baltic Ecosystem Adaptive Management); Mistra,BEAM (Baltic Ecosystem Adaptive Management); Mistra,"This work originates from discussions during the 2013 and 2014 annual meetings of SARAS (South American Institute for Resilience and Sustainability Studies) in Maldonado, Uruguay.

For insects, quantifying stress and associating it with environmental factors has been challenging due to a paucity of time-series data and because detectable population-level responses can show varying lag effects. One solution is to leverage historic entomological specimens to detect morphological proxies of stress experienced at the time stressors emerged, allowing us to more accurately determine population responses. Here we studied specimens of four bumblebee species, an invaluable group of insect pollinators, from five museums collected across Britain over the 20th century. We calculated the degree of fluctuating asymmetry (FA; random deviations from bilateral symmetry) between the right and left forewings as a potential proxy of developmental stress. We: (a) investigated whether baseline FA levels vary between species, and how this compares between the first and second half of the century; (b) determined the extent of FA change over the century in the four bumblebee species, and whether this followed a linear or nonlinear trend; (c) tested which annual climatic conditions correlated with increased FA in bumblebees. Species differed in their baseline FA, with FA being higher in the two species that have recently expanded their ranges in Britain. Overall, FA significantly increased over the century but followed a nonlinear trend, with the increase starting c. 1925. We found relatively warm and wet years were associated with higher FA. Collectively our findings show that FA in bumblebees increased over the 20th century and under weather conditions that will likely increase in frequency with climate change. By plotting FA trends and quantifying the contribution of annual climate conditions on past populations, we provide an important step towards improving our understanding of how environmental factors could impact future populations of wild beneficial insects.","[Arce, Andres N.; Cantwell-Jones, Aoife; Tansley, Michael; Eatough, Emma; Rhodes, Marcus W.; Bian, Xueni; Dixit, Mahika K.; Pearse, William D.; Gill, Richard J.] Imperial Coll London, Georgina Mace Ctr Living Planet, Dept Life Sci, Silwood Pk, Ascot, Berks, England; [Arce, Andres N.] Univ Suffolk, Sch Engn Arts Sci & Technol, Ipswich, Suffolk, England; [Tansley, Michael] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Oxford, England; [Barnes, Ian; Brace, Selina; Mullin, Victoria E.; Notton, David; Bian, Xueni; Broad, Gavin; Kokkini, Phaedra; Livermore, Laurence] Nat Hist Museum, Dept Earth Sci, London, England; [Mullin, Victoria E.] Trinity Coll Dublin, Smurfit Inst Genet, Dublin, Ireland; [Notton, David; Whiffin, Ashleigh; Blagoderov, Vladimir] Natl Museum Scotland, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Ollerton, Jeff] Univ Northampton, Fac Arts Sci & Technol, Northampton, England; [Hogan, James] Univ Oxford, Museum Nat Hist, Oxford, England; [Hunter, Tony; Judd, Steve] World Museum, Liverpool, Merseyside, England; [Jackson, Simon] Tullie House Museum & Art Gallery Trust, Cumbria, England; [Jackson, Simon] Ipswich Museum, Colchester Museum, Ipswich, Suffolk, England; [Jackson, Simon] Ipswich Museums, Ipswich, Suffolk, England",Imperial College London; University of Oxford; Natural History Museum London; Trinity College Dublin; University of Northampton; University of Oxford,"Arce, AN; Cantwell-Jones, A (corresponding author), Imperial Coll London, Georgina Mace Ctr Living Planet, Dept Life Sci, Silwood Pk, Ascot, Berks, England.;Arce, AN (corresponding author), Univ Suffolk, Sch Engn Arts Sci & Technol, Ipswich, Suffolk, England.",a.arce@uos.ac.uk; aoife.aoife.cantwell-jones15@imperial.ac.uk,"Livermore, Laurence/H-8062-2019","Livermore, Laurence/0000-0002-7341-1842; Arce, Andres/0000-0002-3577-2110; Cantwell-Jones, Aoife/0000-0002-4874-1807; Ollerton, Jeff/0000-0002-0887-8235; Rhodes, Marcus/0000-0002-7971-828X","Natural Environment Research Council [NE/P012574/1, NE/P012914/1]",Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"Natural Environment Research Council, Grant/Award Number: NE/P012574/1 and NE/P012914/1",,115,0,0,5,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

This study analyzed the spatiotemporal variation in RH in Guangdong Province, South China, in the period of 1959-2017. The RH data were collected from 74 national standard meteorological stations. The spatiotemporal variation in RH was evaluated using rotate empirical orthogonal function (REOF) zoning, Mann-Kendall test, and wavelet transform methods. Based on the REOF decomposition situation of monthly RH field, Guangdong was divided into six subareas. The annual mean of RH in the whole province was 78.90%. In terms of spatial variation, overall annual mean RH decreased from southwest to northeast in the province. Temporally, annual mean RH showed a declining trend in the last six decades. Particularly, the RH in the Pearl River Delta area declined at the rate of 1.349%/10a. Mann-Kendall tests showed that mutation points of annual mean RH mostly appeared in the 1990s, especially in the early 1990s. Continuous wavelet transforms of annual mean RH displayed that inland subareas have similar cycle characteristics, and the east coast and Pearl River Delta have no significant period in most time domains. The results provide new understanding of RH variation in the last six decades in South China, which is valuable for detecting climate change, monitoring hazardous weather, and predicting future environmental change.","[Liu, Zhanming; Yang, Hong; Wei, Xinghu] Foshan Univ, Res Ctr Ecol Civilizat Construct & Sustainable De, Foshan 528000, Peoples R China; [Yang, Hong] Univ Reading, Dept Geog & Environm Sci, Reading RG6 6AB, Berks, England",Foshan University; University of Reading,"Yang, H (corresponding author), Foshan Univ, Res Ctr Ecol Civilizat Construct & Sustainable De, Foshan 528000, Peoples R China.;Yang, H (corresponding author), Univ Reading, Dept Geog & Environm Sci, Reading RG6 6AB, Berks, England.",liuzhanminglzm@163.com; hongyanghy@gmail.com; weixinghu1964@163.com,"Hong, YANG/C-1739-2008","Hong, YANG/0000-0001-9940-8273",Natural Science Foundation of China [41571091]; Youth Fund of Humanistic and Social Sciences of the Ministry of Education of PRC in 2017 [17YJCZH114]; 13th Five-year Planning Item of Guangdong Philosophy and Social Sciences [GD16CGL10]; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province [2015A030310505]; Foshan University Interdisciplinary Program in Art and Science [2019xw102]; Foshan University Lingnan Visiting Professor scheme,Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Youth Fund of Humanistic and Social Sciences of the Ministry of Education of PRC in 2017; 13th Five-year Planning Item of Guangdong Philosophy and Social Sciences; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province(National Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province); Foshan University Interdisciplinary Program in Art and Science; Foshan University Lingnan Visiting Professor scheme,"This study was financially supported by Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41571091); Youth Fund of Humanistic and Social Sciences of the Ministry of Education of PRC in 2017 (No. 17YJCZH114); the 13th Five-year Planning Item of Guangdong Philosophy and Social Sciences (No. GD16CGL10); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province (No. 2015A030310505); Foshan University Interdisciplinary Program in Art and Science (No. 2019xw102), and Foshan University Lingnan Visiting Professor scheme.",,103,3,3,4,15,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,DEC,2020,12,,,,,,3576,10.3390/w12123576,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w12123576,,,17,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,PK9LI,,"gold, Green Accepted",,,12/21/22,WOS:000602756600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Their intermittent behavior and limited storage capabilities present a new challenge to power system operators to maintain power quality and reliability. Additional technical complexity arises from the large number of small distributed generation units and their allocation within the power system. Market liberalization and changing regulatory framework lead to additional organizational complexity. As a result, the design and operation of the future electric energy system have to be redefined. Sophisticated information and communication architectures, automation concepts, and control approaches are necessary in order to manage the higher complexity of so-called smart grids. This paper provides an overview of the state of the art and recent developments enabling higher intelligence in future smart grids. The integration of renewable sources and storage systems into the power grids is analyzed.

Questions related to key drivers of energy technology in the UK, capture and engineering, CO2 transport, storage, risks and leakage, monitoring and remediation, costs and economics, incentives, regulation, international context. The survey has constructed a comprehensive picture of expert opinion on the current status of CCS in the UK from across the CCS and related energy supply community. The results contribute to understanding how large-scale deployment of CCS might be realised in the UK and the challenges associated therein. The survey revealed that key barriers to implementation of CCS are currently a lack of long-term policy framework in the UK and costs. There remain aspects of the process that require further investigation but until the technology is adopted on a commercial scale, in the context of a commitment to significant reductions in CO2 emissions across all demand sectors, it is neither possible nor appropriate to predict the details of how the process will evolve.

For the midlatitudes, shifts in the extratropical jet streams have important consequences for precipitation, blocking, and extreme events. It has proven to be a challenge, however, to predict. For example, the North Atlantic jet stream plays a vital role in the climate of eastern North America and Europe; in the last intercomparison of state-of-the-art climate models, the models did not even agree on the sign of its wintertime response to global warming. Perhaps this should not come as a surprise, as we also lack a comprehensive theory for the impact of warming on the midlatitude circulation. In a recent study, Tan et al. (2019, ) constructed models of simpler atmospheres to explore the response of the midlatitude jet to global warming. Their idealized atmospheres highlight the difficulty of developing a comprehensive theory for the midlatitude circulation but also provide pathways to improve models of Earth's atmosphere. Models of simpler atmospheres allow one to isolate the impact of specific atmospheric processes and connect theoretical understanding with comprehensive climate prediction systems. Such models can also be used to explore very different atmospheric regimes, from Earth's past to distant planets.","[Gerber, Edwin P.; DallaSanta, Kevin; Gupta, Aman] NYU, Courant Inst Math Sci, New York, NY 10003 USA",New York University,"Gerber, EP (corresponding author), NYU, Courant Inst Math Sci, New York, NY 10003 USA.",gerber@cims.nyu.edu,"DallaSanta, Kevin/GPC-8701-2022","Gerber, Edwin/0000-0002-6010-6638; Gupta, Aman/0000-0002-2215-7135; DallaSanta, Kevin/0000-0002-5411-7728",National Science Foundation [AGS-1852727]; European Research Council [677756],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)European Commission),"No original data were produced or used in this commentary.

While state-of-the-art dynamical forecast models appear to be increasingly skillful in predicting the NAO, statistical methods with comparable or higher predictive skill are still often used. An inherent problem with statistical methods is that any empirical relationship between predictors and the NAO may be valid for some periods but subject to change over time. Here we use a set of new centennial reanalyses and large-ensemble simulations with multiple climate models to discover clear evidence of nonstationarity in the lagged correlation between autumn Barents-Kara sea ice and the winter NAO. This nonstationarity leads us to question the causality and/or robustness of the ice-NAO link. We caution against indiscriminately using Barents-Kara sea ice to predict the NAO. Plain Language Summary European winter weather is heavily influenced by the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). The so-called positive NAO brings mild and wet conditions to northern Europe in winter, and the negative NAO tends to be cold and dry. Scientists attempt to forecast the NAO in advance by one of two ways: using complex weather forecast models or using relatively simple statistical equations. Although statistical methods can outperform more complicated forecast models, they assume that predictor relationships do not change over time. This assumption is not always valid. In this study we examined the relationship over time between autumn sea ice in the Barents-Kara Seas and the winter NAO. In recent decades, a strong relationship has been observed whereby especially reduced autumn sea ice often precedes negative NAO in the following winter. When we looked further back in time, however, we found that the ice-NAO relationship has been highly changeable and sometimes, the complete opposite to that seen recently. An analysis of hundreds of simulations from multiple climate models confirms that the ice-NAO relationship varies a lot, just due to natural climate variability. Our results suggest it is unwise to make predictions of the winter NAO based on autumn sea ice.","[Kolstad, E. W.] NORCE Norwegian Res Ctr, Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, Bergen, Norway; [Screen, J.

Over a 2-year period, we monitored the structure of soil fungal and bacterial communities in organic and mineral soil horizons in plots warmed by greenhouses for 18years and in control plots. We found that microbial communities were stable over time but strongly structured by warming. Warming led to significant reductions in the evenness of bacterial communities, while the evenness of fungal communities increased significantly. These patterns were strongest in the organic horizon, where temperature change was greatest and were associated with a significant increase in the dominance of the Actinobacteria and significant reductions in the Gemmatimonadaceae and the Proteobacteria. Greater evenness of the fungal community with warming was associated with significant increases in the ectomycorrhizal fungi, Russula spp., Cortinarius spp., and members of the Helotiales suggesting that increased growth of the shrub Betula nana was an important mechanism driving this change. The shifts in soil microbial community structure appear sufficient to account for warming-induced changes in nutrient cycling in Arctic tundra as climate warms.","[Deslippe, Julie R.] Landcare Res New Zealand Ltd, Palmerston North 4442, New Zealand; [Deslippe, Julie R.; Simard, Suzanne W.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Forest Sci, Fac Forest Sci, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada; [Hartmann, Martin; Mohn, William W.] Univ British Columbia, Inst Life Sci, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada; [Hartmann, Martin] Swiss Fed Res Inst WSL, Dept Soil Sci, Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Hartmann, Martin] Agroscope Reckenholz Tanikon Res Stn ART, Zurich, Switzerland; [Hartmann, Martin] Swiss Fed Res Inst WSL, Birmensdorf, Switzerland","Landcare Research - New Zealand; University of British Columbia; University of British Columbia; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape Research; Swiss Federal Research Station Agroscope; Swiss Federal Research Station for Agroecology & Agriculture; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape Research","Deslippe, JR (corresponding author), Landcare Res New Zealand Ltd, Riddet Rd,Massey Univ Campus,Private Bag 11052, Palmerston North 4442, New Zealand.",deslippej@landcareresearch.co.nz,"Hartmann, Martin/M-9371-2016","Hartmann, Martin/0000-0001-8069-5284; Deslippe, Julie/0000-0003-0511-9062",Government of Canada; National Science and Research Council of Canada,Government of Canada(CGIAR); National Science and Research Council of Canada,"The authors wish to acknowledge C.

Pattern recognition tasks such as classification, object detection, and segmentation (i.e., pixel-level classification) have remained challenging problems in the weather and climate sciences. While there exist many empirical heuristics for detecting extreme events, the disparities between the output of these different methods even for a single event are large and often difficult to reconcile.

DL, however, works best in the context of supervised learning - when labeled datasets are readily available. Reliable labeled training data for extreme weather and climate events is scarce. We create ClimateNet - an open, community-sourced human-expert-labeled curated dataset that captures tropical cyclones (TCs) and atmospheric rivers (ARs) in high-resolution climate model output from a simulation of a recent historical period. We use the curated ClimateNet dataset to train a state-of-the-art DL model for pixel-level identification - i.e., segmentation - of TCs and ARs. We then apply the trained DL model to historical and climate change scenarios simulated by the Community Atmospheric Model (CAM5.1) and show that the DL model accurately segments the data into TCs, ARs, or the background at a pixel level. Further, we show how the segmentation results can be used to conduct spatially and temporally precise analytics by quantifying distributions of extreme precipitation conditioned on event types (TC or AR) at regional scales. The key contribution of this work is that it paves the way for DL-based automated, high-fidelity, and highly precise analytics of climate data using a curated expert-labeled dataset - ClimateNet. ClimateNet and the DL-based segmentation method provide several unique capabilities: (i) they can be used to calculate a variety of TC and AR statistics at a fine-grained level; (ii) they can be applied to different climate scenarios and different datasets without tuning as they do not rely on threshold conditions; and (iii) the proposed DL method is suitable for rapidly analyzing large amounts of climate model output. While our study has been conducted for two important extreme weather patterns (TCs and ARs) in simulation datasets, we believe that this methodology can be applied to a much broader class of patterns and applied to observational and reanalysis data products via transfer learning.","[Prabhat; Kashinath, Karthik; Greiner, Annette; Mahesh, Ankur; O'Brien, Travis; Wehner, Michael; Collins, William] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Prabhat; Kim, Sol; Mahesh, Ankur; Yang, Kevin; Lewis, Colby; Chen, Jiayi; Lou, Andrew; Collins, William] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Kapp-Schwoerer, Lukas; Graubner, Andre; Karaismailoglu, Ege; von Kleist, Leo] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Zurich, Switzerland; [Kurth, Thorsten] NVIDIA, Santa Clara, CA USA; [Chandran, Sathyavat] Rice Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Houston, TX USA; [Toms, Ben] Colorado State Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Chapman, Will] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Dagon, Katherine; Shields, Christine A.] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [O'Brien, Travis] Indiana Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, Bloomington, IN USA; [Mudigonda, Mayur] Terrafuse, Berkeley, CA USA",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Nvidia Corporation; Rice University; Colorado State University; University of California System; University of California San Diego; Scripps Institution of Oceanography; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Kashinath, K (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",kkashinath@lbl.gov,"Chen, Jiayi/GZM-5106-2022; Kurth, Thorsten/Z-2117-2018","Dagon, Katherine/0000-0002-4518-8225; Kim, Sol/0000-0002-2641-8929; Graubner, Andre/0000-0002-3345-2690; Greiner, Annette/0000-0001-6465-7456; Kurth, Thorsten/0000-0003-0832-6198; Karaismailoglu, Ege/0000-0002-7510-8599","Office of Science of the US DOE [DE-AC0205CH11231]; US Department of Energy [DE340AC02-05CH11231]; Regional and Global Climate Modeling program of the Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research of the US Department of Energy; National Science Foundation [1852977]","Office of Science of the US DOE(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); US Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Regional and Global Climate Modeling program of the Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research of the US Department of Energy; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF))","This research used resources of the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center, a US Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Science User Facility supported by the Office of Science of the US DOE under contract no.

On the basis of this revised understanding this article then offers a different interpretation of Hardin's thesis by assigning hermeneutic priority to the concept of tragedy (Aristotle, Nietzsche) rather than the concept of the commons. Read through the concept of tragedy, it argues that Hardin's thesis effectively asserts a rigid incompatibility between market economics and environmental protection, and to this extent The Tragedy of the Commons is more aptly read as a political critique that questions the viability of unlimited growth as the axiomatic premise of planetary economics.","[MacLellan, Matthew] McGill Univ, Art Hist & Commun Studies, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T5, Canada",McGill University,"MacLellan, M (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Art Hist & Commun Studies, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T5, Canada.",,,,,,,,17,6,6,0,10,DUKE UNIV PRESS,DURHAM,"905 W MAIN ST, STE 18-B, DURHAM, NC 27701 USA",2201-1919,,,ENVIRON HUMANITIES,Environ.

Decoration can reflect the religious beliefs and manifestations of culture and art of the Islamic period and with all the ups and downs it has had over the centuries, it has been able to expand significantly and leave lasting works through unique and unified expressions in different climates. Among all kinds of architectural decorations, tiling and painting are the most attractive among Muslim architects and are considered the most important and effective factors in the beauty and grandeur of Islamic buildings. Research objective: The main purpose of this study is to examine the decorative patterns of the two 'Kabud' (blue) mosques of `Mazar-e-Sharif and 'Sultan Ahmed'. The unique decorations of the blue mosques are compared to clarify the similar and dissimilar items in the decorative designs used on the tiles, which are inspired by nature and ethnic and regional influences and are derived from the art of ancient Iran and Islamic Iran. Research method: The results were obtained by comparing the decorative patterns of the two mentioned mosques using the descriptive and analytical methods with the help of the tables, written documents, and data analysis. Conclusion: The origin of decorative patterns in the two buildings is rooted in Iran, but each region has used its own mechanism and creativity to localize the designs. The tiling decorations used in the two blue mosques of 'Sultan Ahmed' and 'Mazare-Sharif are simple, with emphasis on the commands of Islam, and are abstracted from nature in a vegetal, geometric and symbolic manner. Along with beautification, they have meanings and show order, multiplicity, and unity, and add to the coherence of the spiritual atmosphere of the environment.","[Joshaghani, Saeedeh] Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Analyt Hist & Comparat Studies Islamic Art, Cent Tehran Branch, Tehran, Iran; [Hassanvand, Mohammad Kazem] Tarbiat Modares Univ, Fac Art & Architecture, Dept Painting, Creat Arts Painting, Tehran, Iran; [Aref, Mohamad] Theatre Dept Fac Member Art, Tehran Branch, Art Anthropol, Tehran, Iran",Islamic Azad University; Tarbiat Modares University,"Hassanvand, MK (corresponding author), Tarbiat Modares Univ, Fac Art & Architecture, Dept Painting, Creat Arts Painting, Tehran, Iran.",mkh@modares.ac.ir,,,,,,,12,0,0,2,2,NAZAR RESEARCH CENTER ART ARCHITECTURE & URBANISM,TEHRAN,"NO 23, DR QARIB ST AZADI AVE, TEHRAN, 14198-43311, IRAN",1735-9635,2251-7197,,BAGH E NAZAR,Bagh e Nazar,MAR,2022,105,,,,5,20,,10.22034/BAGH.2021.292912,http://dx.doi.org/10.22034/BAGH.2021.292912,,,16,"Humanities, Multidisciplinary",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Arts & Humanities - Other Topics,ZN4UR,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000765031700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Observations show that all recent large tropical eruptions were followed by winter warming in the first Northern Hemisphere (NH) winter after the eruption, with little such response in the second winter, yet a number of the evaluations have combined the first and second winters. We have looked at just the first winter after large eruptions since 1850 in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 historical simulations and find that most models do produce a winter warming signal, with warmer temperatures over NH continents and a stronger polar vortex in the lower stratosphere.

(2014; hereinafter W14) conclude that western Europe experienced significantly higher temperatures in AD 1540 compared to all other years in the instrumental record, including the summer heat waves of 2003 and 2010 (Schar et al. 2004; Barriopedro et al. 2011). Based on 300+ first-hand documentary weather reports, the authors argue that large parts of Europe were hit by an unprecedented, 11-month-long, 'Megadrought' in 1540 exceeding all recorded and reconstructed levels, and falling outside the probability range of state-of-the-art palaeoclimate model simulations. Despite compiling, transforming and interpreting an exceptional pool of documentary evidence, W14 neglected to systematically analyse the existing collection of European tree ring-based climate reconstructions. An independent comparison of their findings from societal entries against natural proxy archives, however, would have been beneficial. For example, Pauling et al. (2006), already identified low precipitation amounts in 1540 derived mainly from tree-ring analyses, a study not cited in W14. In this reply we look into some of the tree-ring data available back to 1540 and before, and demonstrate that W14's conclusion regarding the inability of natural proxy archives to record climate extremes is not defensible.","[Buentgen, Ulf] Swiss Fed Res Inst WSL, Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Buentgen, Ulf] Oeschger Ctr Climate Change Res, Bern, Switzerland; [Buentgen, Ulf; Hayes, Michael] Global Change Res Ctr AS CR, Brno, Czech Republic; [Tegel, Willy] Univ Freiburg, Inst Forest Growth IWW, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany; [Carrer, Marco] Univ Padua, Dipartimento TeSAF, Agripolis, Legnaro, Italy; [Krusic, Paul J.] Navarino Environm Observ, Messinia, Greece; [Krusic, Paul J.] Stockholm Univ, Dept Phys Geog, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Hayes, Michael] Univ Nebraska, Natl Drought Mitigat Ctr, Lincoln, NE USA; [Esper, Jan] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Dept Geog, D-55122 Mainz, Germany","Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape Research; University of Bern; Czech Academy of Sciences; Global Change Research Centre of the Czech Academy of Sciences; University of Freiburg; University of Padua; Stockholm University; University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Lincoln; Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz","Buntgen, U (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Res Inst WSL, Birmensdorf, Switzerland.",buentgen@wsl.ch,"Esper, Jan/O-3127-2018; Carrer, Marco/D-8727-2011; Tegel, Willy/M-8187-2014; buentgen, ulf/J-6952-2013","Esper, Jan/0000-0003-3919-014X; Carrer, Marco/0000-0003-1581-6259; Tegel, Willy/0000-0003-4707-2848",,,,,32,13,13,1,19,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

Using the Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) as an evaluation index, subjective questionnaires and field surveys were conducted on thermal comfort in three different typical outdoor environments (sunlight, tree shade and building shade) in Dalian (Northeast China). The results demonstrated the following: (1) Air temperature and mean radiant temperature were the dominant meteorological factors affecting outdoor thermal comfort in Dalian. (2) The main thermal sensation recorded in the transition season was slightly cool. Over time, the human thermal sensation experienced a gradual transition from hot to cold. (3) Compared with direct sunlight, the average UTCI decreased by 6.6 and 3.5 degrees C for building shade and tree shade environments, and the neutral UTCI in Dalian was found to be 18.8 degrees C. Subjects were most sensitive to the thermal environment in building shade, then in tree shade and the least in sunlight. (4) When UTCI >= 21.9 degrees C, the thermal acceptability rate in building shade remained the highest; when 10.2 degrees C <= UTCI < 21.9 degrees C, it was highest in tree shade; and when the UTCI < 10.2 degrees C, it was highest in sunlight. This study verifies the UTCI applicability in the transition season in cold regions and analyzes the spatial differences in human thermal comfort. These differences play a positive role in developing optimization strategies for outdoor thermal environments, improving environmental satisfaction and facilitating pedestrian outdoor activities.","[Guo, Fei; Wang, Zuoxing; Dong, Jing; Zhang, Hongchi; Lu, Xiaodong] Dalian Univ Technol, Sch Architecture & Fine Art, Dalian 116023, Peoples R China; [Lau, Stephen Siu Yu] Shenzhen Univ, Dept Architecture, Shenzhen 518060, Peoples R China; [Miao, Yijia] Univ Hong Kong, Fac Architecture, Hong Kong 999077, Peoples R China",Dalian University of Technology; Shenzhen University; University of Hong Kong,"Dong, J (corresponding author), Dalian Univ Technol, Sch Architecture & Fine Art, Dalian 116023, Peoples R China.",guofei@dlut.edu.cn; wangzuoxing@dlut.edu.cn; jdong@dlut.edu.cn; zhanghc@dlut.edu.cn; lxd3721@dlut.edu.cn; ssylau@hku.hk; miaoyj@connect.hku.hk,"Guo, Fei/AIC-4983-2022","Guo, Fei/0000-0001-5739-9436; Zhang, Hongchi/0000-0001-8148-3435; Dong, Jing/0000-0001-7054-5434; Lau, Stephen Siu Yu/0000-0001-9937-3824",China National Social Science Fund [18BGL233],China National Social Science Fund,This research was funded by the China National Social Science Fund (No. 18BGL233).,,56,6,6,43,43,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2075-5309,,BUILDINGS-BASEL,BUILDINGS-BASEL,JUN,2022,6,,,,,,720,10.3390/buildings12060720,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/buildings12060720,,,19,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Civil",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Construction & Building Technology; Engineering,2N1FQ,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000818134500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This reversal to glacial-like conditions is one of the best known examples of abrupt change but the exact timing and global spatial extent remain uncertain. Whilst the wider Atlantic region has a network of high-resolution proxy records spanning GS-1, the Pacific Ocean suffers from a scarcity of sub-decadally resolved sequences. Here we report the results from an investigation into a tree-ring chronology from northern New Zealand aimed at addressing the paucity of data. The conifer tree species kauri (Agathis australis) is known from contemporary studies to be sensitive to regional climate changes. An analysis of a 'historic' 452-year kauri chronology confirms a tropical-Pacific teleconnection via the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO). We then focus our study on a 1010-year sub-fossil kauri chronology that has been precisely dated by comprehensive radiocarbon dating and contains a striking ring-width downturn between 12,500 and 12,380 cal BP within GS-1. Wavelet analysis shows a marked increase in ENSO-like periodicities occurring after the downturn event. Comparison to low-and mid-latitude Pacific records suggests a coherency with ENSO and Southern Hemisphere atmospheric circulation change during this period. The driver(s) for this climate event remain unclear but may be related to solar changes that subsequently led to establishment and/or increased expression of ENSO across the mid-latitudes of the Pacific, seemingly independent of the Atlantic and polar regions.

Moral rights law developed, and was implemented, under the heavy influence of the French preference to put the rights of the author at the center of intellectual property protection (with Victor Hugo leading this charge). However, as artistic practice evolves in a continually rapid fashion, it is becoming increasingly clear that moral rights are unable to properly accord with modern art forms. An examination of the social construction of authorship, the emergence of unique contemporary art forms, and the role of technology as a catalyst to intellectual property law, reveals that the Western world's legal moral rights scheme cannot survive its current form. Moral rights' endurance hinges on its ability to reconcile with a social and artistic climate alien to its origins. Artistic expression does not exist in a vacuum and is inextricably linked to, and reflective of, the social climate it is born out of. As society evolves and shifts, so too does its art and so must the law.","[Lewis, Jessica] Bennett Jones LLP, Calgary, AB, Canada",,"Lewis, J (corresponding author), Bennett Jones LLP, Calgary, AB, Canada.",lewisj@bennettjones.com,,,,,,,35,2,2,0,0,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0940-7391,1465-7317,,INT J CULT PROP,Int.

Both revealed reasonable MJO variability compared to other state-of-the-art reanalysis datasets. We detected pronounced multidecadal variations along with an increasing trend in MJO amplitude during the period 1900-2009 in both datasets, although this linear trend was less significant in the reconstructed MJO index proposed by Oliver and Thompson. The two twentieth-century reanalysis datasets and the Oliver-Thompson MJO index consistently showed the intensified amplitude of MJO precipitation and circulation in the later decades (1970-99) compared to the earlier decades (1920-49). The most significant enhancement of MJO precipitation in the later decades appeared over the western Pacific warm pool. To understand the mechanisms controlling the changes in western Pacific MJO precipitation amplitude over the twentieth century, we diagnosed the moisture budget equation. The enhanced MJO precipitation variability in the later decades mainly came from increased moisture associated with a strengthened low-level convergence anomaly working on background mean moisture [-((q) over bar del.V')]. Further diagnosis showed that the effect of anomalous circulation (del.V') change on the MJO precipitation amplitude change over the twentieth century was about an order larger than that of mean moisture (q) change, different from the mechanisms (i.e., increased gradient of (q) over bar) responsible for the intensified MJO precipitation amplitude under future warmer climate. The enhanced MJO circulation anomalies during 1970-99 may be caused by an enhanced diabatic heating anomaly, offset partly by the increased mean static stability.","[Fu, Zhen; Hsu, Pang-Chi; Liu, Fei] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Joint Int Res Lab Climate & Environm Change, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteoro, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster,Minist Educ, Nanjing, Peoples R China",Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology,"Hsu, PC (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Joint Int Res Lab Climate & Environm Change, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteoro, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster,Minist Educ, Nanjing, Peoples R China.",pangchi@nuist.edu.cn,,,National Key Research and Development Program of China [2018YFC1505804],National Key Research and Development Program of China,"The authors thank the anonymous reviewers for their comments, which helped improve the manuscript.

This development has been due to physicists venturing outside of their traditional domains of interest, but also due to scientists from other disciplines taking from physics the methods that have proven so successful throughout the 19th and the 20th century. Here we characterise the field with the term 'social physics' and pay our respect to intellectual mavericks who nurtured it to maturity. We do so by reviewing the current state of the art. Starting with a set of topics that are at the heart of modern human societies, we review research dedicated to urban development and traffic, the functioning of financial markets, cooperation as the basis for our evolutionary success, the structure of social networks, and the integration of intelligent machines into these networks. We then shift our attention to a set of topics that explore potential threats to society. These include criminal behaviour, large-scale migration, epidemics, environmental challenges, and climate change. We end the coverage of each topic with promising directions for future research. Based on this, we conclude that the future for social physics is bright. Physicists studying societal phenomena are no longer a curiosity, but rather a force to be reckoned with.

In this respect, we should consider the opportunities to reduce carbon footprint for small and large wastewater treatment plants. The use of anaerobic rather than aerobic treatment processes would achieve this aim because no aeration is required and the generation of methane can be used within the plant. High-rate anaerobic digesters receive great interests due to their high loading capacity and low sludge production. Among them, the upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactors have been most widely used. However, there are still unresolved issues inhibiting the widespread of this technology in developing countries or countries with climate temperature fluctuations (such as subtropical regions). A large number of studies have been carried out in order to enhance the performance of UASB reactors but there is a lack of updated documentation. In face of the existing limitations and the increasing importance of this technology, the authors present an up-to-date review on the performance enhancements of UASB reactors over the last decade. The important aspects of this article are: (i) enhancing the start-up and granulation in UASB reactors, (ii) coupling with post-treatment unit to overcome the temperature constraint, and (iii) improving the removal efficiencies of the organic matter, nutrients and pathogens in the final effluent. Finally the authors have highlighted future research direction based on their critical analysis. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The source of this trend is a matter of scientific debate with stratospheric ozone losses, greenhouse gas increases, and natural variability all being possible contenders. Because it is difficult to separate the contribution of various external forcings to the observed trend, a state-of-the-art global coupled model is utilized here. Ensembles of twentieth-century simulations forced with the observed time series of greenhouse gases, tropospheric and stratospheric ozone, sulfate aerosols, volcanic aerosols, solar variability, and various combinations of these are used to examine the annular mode trends in comparison to observations, in an attempt to isolate the response of the climate system to each individual forcing. It is found that ozone changes are the biggest contributor to the observed summertime intensification of the southern polar vortex in the second half of the twentieth century, with increases of greenhouse gases also being a necessary factor in the reproduction of the observed trends at the surface. Although stratospheric ozone losses are expected to stabilize and eventually recover to preindustrial levels over the course of the twenty-first century, these results show that increasing greenhouse gases will continue to intensify the polar vortex throughout the twenty-first century, but that radiative forcing will cause widespread temperature increases over the entire Southern Hemisphere.","Bur Meteorol Res Ctr, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia; Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Boulder, CO 80307 USA",Bureau of Meteorology - Australia; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA,"Arblaster, JM (corresponding author), Bur Meteorol Res Ctr, GPO Box 1289, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia.",jma@ucar.edu,"Arblaster, Julie/C-1342-2010","Arblaster, Julie/0000-0002-4287-2363",,,,,36,362,374,6,55,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0894-8755,1520-0442,,J CLIMATE,J.

His debut collection of poems, 'Tsuki ni Hoeru', contains a number of works characterized by the strange and abnormal impression they convey. The various and characteristic psychotic symptoms exhibited by this poet have been the subject of much discussion and pathographic description. However, it seems that there have been few considerations as to the meaning of such poetic expression for Sakutaro. In the present study, the relationship between his internal psychopathology and such forms of expression was examined. Furthermore, the influence of the contemporary fin de siecle art and the significance of the choice of poetry as his medium of expression was considered. It was found that his earliest psychopathological problems, such as anthropophobia (which could well be viewed as having been engendered by the particular Japanese cultural climate of that time) and systemic depersonalization, both led to his own anxiety about existence; expressing himself through the medium of poetry was a kind of self-healing act for Sakutaro, who had been suffering seriously from feelings of inadequacy and self-doubt.","Hokkaido Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat & Neurol, Kita Ku, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0608638, Japan",Hokkaido University,"Hayashi, Y (corresponding author), Hokkaido Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat & Neurol, Kita Ku, Kita 15,Nishi 7, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0608638, Japan.",,,,,,,,0,2,2,0,1,BLACKWELL SCIENCE ASIA,CARLTON,"54 UNIVERSITY ST, P O BOX 378, CARLTON, VICTORIA 3053, AUSTRALIA",1323-1316,,,PSYCHIAT CLIN NEUROS,Psychiatry Clin.

The anomalous atmospheric circulation over the region can excite wave train pattern propagating eastward and impacting the climate over the Eurasian continent. In this study, the summer (June-September) sea level pressure (SLP) prediction skill over the Mediterranean region is investigated, based on the May-start hindcasts of five state-of-the-art coupled models from the ENSEMBLES over the period of 1960-2005. The result shows that there are three models that exhibit an increased prediction skill for the Mediterranean SLP after the late 1970s. Tropical sea surface temperature (SST) is generally recognized as the major source for dynamical seasonal climate prediction. The analysis of the three models shows that they can capture well the observed impact of tropical Atlantic and Pacific SSTs on the Mediterranean atmospheric circulation after the late 1970s. Consequently, the three models have an increased prediction skill for the Mediterranean SLP over the time. In contrast, the other two models cannot reproduce the observed relationship of the Mediterranean SLP with the tropical Atlantic and Pacific SSTs, thereby exhibiting low prediction skill for the Mediterranean SLP. Further analysis indicates that the increased prediction of the Mediterranean SLP can improve dynamical prediction of surface air temperature (SAT) over the eastern Mediterranean and central East Asia, which is valuable for current regional dynamical seasonal climate prediction.","[Sun, Jianqi; Zhang, Mengqi] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Nansen Zhu Int Res Ctr, POB 9804, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Sun, Jianqi] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteoro, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Sun, Jianqi; Zhang, Mengqi] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Sun, JQ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Nansen Zhu Int Res Ctr, POB 9804, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.;Sun, JQ (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteoro, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.;Sun, JQ (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.",sunjq@mail.iap.ac.cn,"Sun, Jianqi/A-7084-2016","Sun, Jianqi/0000-0002-3879-6986; Zhang, mengqi/0000-0002-6798-8071","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41522503, 41421004]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"We deeply thank the National Centers for Environmental Prediction-National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP-NCAR), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Climatic Research Unit (CRU), Japanese Meteorological Agency (JMA), University of Delaware, and European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) for surface air temperature, atmospheric reanalysis data, SST data, and EMSEMBLES data.

A 3-D budget analysis has been performed separating the Eastern from the Western basins and the boundary layer (BL) from the free troposphere (FT). The FT of the Eastern Mediterranean is shown to be a strong receptor of polluted air masses from the Western Mediterranean, and the most important source of polluted air masses for the Eastern Mediterranean BL, with about 40% of O-3 and of CO in the BL to be transported from the FT aloft. Regional anthropogenic sources are found to have relatively small impact on regional air quality in the area, contributing by about 8% and 18% to surface levels of O-3 and CO, respectively. Projections using anthropogenic emissions for the year 2050 but neglecting climate change calculate a surface O-3 decrease of about 11% together with a surface CO increase of roughly 10% in the Eastern Mediterranean.

The aim of the present review is to describe the impact of global warming factors on aquatic ecosystems. The research articles revised within this paper are published in web of science core collection, with high impact factors. The main factors of global warming were identified as: increased water temperature, sea level rise and altered precipitation regime. Each factor was analysed and the influence on aquatic environments was described. The main conclusion of this paper is that global warming will disrupt fisheries and aquaculture activities, through degradation of aquatic ecosystems.

Kinetic analyses suggest that GhFDH1 has considerably high affinity to formate (0.76 +/- 0.07 mM) and NAD+ (0.06 +/- 0.01 mM). At the same time, the affinity (1.98 +/- 0.4 mM) and catalytic efficiency (0.0041) values of the enzyme for NADP(+) show that GhFDH1 is a valuable enzyme for protein engineering studies that is trying to change the coenzyme preference from NAD to NADP which has a much higher cost than that of NAD. Improving the NADP specificity is important for NADPH regeneration which is an important coenzyme used in many biotechnological production processes. The Tm value of GhFDH1 is 53.3 degrees C and the highest enzyme activity is measured at 30 degrees C with a half-life of 61 h. Whilst further improvements are still required, the obtained results show that GhFDH1 is a promising enzyme for NAD(P) H regeneration for its prominent thermostability and NADP(+) specificity.","[Kurt-Gur, Gunseli; Ordu, Emel] Yildiz Tech Univ, Fac Art & Sci, Dept Mol Biol & Genet, Davutpasa Campus Esenler, TR-34220 Istanbul, Turkey",Yildiz Technical University,"Ordu, E (corresponding author), Yildiz Tech Univ, Fac Art & Sci, Dept Mol Biol & Genet, Davutpasa Campus Esenler, TR-34220 Istanbul, Turkey.",bemel@yildiz.edu.tr,"GUR, GUNSELİ KURT/AAZ-7861-2020; Ordu, Emel/AAZ-8383-2020","GUR, GUNSELİ KURT/0000-0002-2911-9465; Ordu, Emel/0000-0003-3060-2806",Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK) [216Z052],Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK)(Turkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Arastirma Kurumu (TUBITAK)),"This work was supported by The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK), Project No. 216Z052.",,40,2,2,1,26,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",2190-572X,2190-5738,,3 BIOTECH,3 Biotech,10-Mar,2018,,,,,,,175,10.1007/s13205-018-1200-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13205-018-1200-8,,,11,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology,FZ5JF,29556429,Green Published,,,12/21/22,WOS:000427627700004,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, water scarcity due to climate change and pollution and the depletion of fossil fuels together with their negative impact on the environment, pose a great global threat. Solar assisted-photocatalysis is a promising tool for environmental pollution mitigation and for generating alternative renewable energy. This review provides a one-stop, comprehensive read on the most recent developments in graphene based photocatalysts towards removal of organic (dyes, emerging pollutants), inorganic (heavy metals, oxides of nitrogen), microbial pollutants and fuel generation from carbon dioxide reduction and water splitting. We began by providing a brief overview of the positive attributes of photocatalysis and the use of graphene in photocatalytic nanostructures. This is followed by the investigation of the latest applications of graphene based photocatalyst in water treatment, air purification, disinfection and energy generation. Details on the specific roles of graphene materials during photocatalysis and the underlying mechanisms propelling the different photocatalytic reactions, are outlined. Finally, some remarks in terms of the current research on graphene materials in photocatalysis for environmental pollution abatement and fuel generation and future considerations, concludes the review.","[Mamba, G.; Gangashe, G.; Moss, L.; Mishra, A.

Plants respond to droughts by partially closing their stomata to limit their evaporative water loss, at the expense of carbon uptake by photosynthesis. This trade-off maximizes their water-use efficiency (WUE), as measured for many individual plants under laboratory conditions and field experiments. Here we analyse the C-13/C-12 stable isotope ratio in atmospheric CO2 to provide new observational evidence of the impact of droughts on the WUE across areas of millions of square kilometres and spanning one decade of recent climate variability. We find strong and spatially coherent increases in WUE along with widespread reductions of net carbon uptake over the Northern Hemisphere during severe droughts that affected Europe, Russia and the United States in 2001-2011. The impact of those droughts on WUE and carbon uptake by vegetation is substantially larger than simulated by the land-surface schemes of six state-of-the-art climate models. This suggests that drought-induced carbon-climate feedbacks may be too small in these models and improvements to their vegetation dynamics using stable isotope observations can help to improve their drought response.","[Peters, Wouter; van Schaik, Erik; van der Laan-Luijkx, Ingrid T.; van der Molen, Michiel K.] Wageningen Univ, Environm Sci Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Peters, Wouter] Univ Groningen, Ctr Isotope Res, Groningen, Netherlands; [van der Velde, Ivar R.] Univ Colorado, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [van der Velde, Ivar R.; Miller, John B.; Tans, Pieter P.] NOAA, Global Monitoring Div, Earth Syst Res Lab, Boulder, CO USA; [Ciais, Philippe; Zhu, Dan] CEA CNRS UVSQ, IPSL, LSCE, Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Duarte, Henrique F.] Univ Utah, Dept Atmospher Sci, Salt Lake City, UT USA; [Scholze, Marko; Warlind, David] Lund Univ, Dept Phys Geog & Ecosyst Sci, Lund, Sweden; [Schaefer, Kevin] Univ Colorado, Natl Snow & Ice Data Ctr, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Vidale, Pier Luigi] Univ Reading, Dept Meteorol, Reading, Berks, England; [Verhoef, Anne] Univ Reading, Dept Geog & Environm Sci, Reading, Berks, England; [Vaughn, Bruce; White, James W.

They are in our phones, clothes, bottles, and cars. Yet having improved our lives considerably, they now threaten our environment and our health. The associated carbon emissions and persistency of plastics challenge the fragile balance of many ecosystems. One solution is using biodegradable plastics. Ideally, such plastics are easily assimilated by microorganisms and disappear from our environment. This can help reduce the problems of climate change, microplastics, and littering. However, biodegradable plastics are still only a tiny portion of the global plastics market and require further efforts in research and commercialization. Here, a critical overview of the state of the art of biodegradable plastics is given. Using a material flow analysis, the challenges of the plastic market are highlighted, and with it the large market potential of biodegradable plastics.

For instance, reservoir and hydropower systems call for real-time or on-line site-specific forecasting of the runoff. In this research. we present a new data-driven model called support vector machines (SVMs) based on structural risk minimization principle, which minimizes a bound on a generalized risk (error), as opposed to the empirical risk minimization principle exploited by conventional regression techniques (e.g. ANNs). Thus, this stat-of-the-art methodology for prediction combines excellent generalization property and sparse representation that lead SVMs to be a very promising forecasting method. Further, SVM makes use of a convex quadratic optimization problem; hence, the solution is always unique and globally optimal. To demonstrate the aforementioned forecasting capability of SVM, one-day lead stream flow of Bakhtiyari River in Iran was predicted using the local climate and rainfall data. Moreover, the results were compared with those of ANN and ANN integrated with genetic algorithms (ANN-GA) models. The improvements in root mean squared error (RMSE) and squared correlation coefficient (R-2) by SVM over both ANN models indicate that the prediction accuracy of SVM is at least as good as that of those models, yet in some cases actually better. as well as forecasting of high-value discharges.

A similar environment at the beginning of the 20th Century saw movements such as Constructivism and the Bauhaus emerge, with significant impact on design for the remainder of that century. I propose that discussions on the future direction of illustration may be informed by mapping practitioners on the boundaries of Illustration practice as well as the wider field of Communication Design. In my paper I have included a review of practitioners I believe to be significant in relating the diversity of contemporary illustration practice, who have adapted their practice effectively to change, and represent possible models for future illustration practice. I have also included work from recent graduates on the Masters in Communication Design at The Glasgow School of Art to relate their perspectives of illustration practice. I believe this will facilitate discussion on the possible future directions of illustration practice, informing the future teaching of illustration, and how we, as educators, equip our graduates for a climate of rapid change.","[Cairns, Brian] Glasgow Sch Art, Dept Commun Design, 167 Renfrew St, Glasgow G3 6RQ, Lanark, Scotland",Glasgow School of Art,"Cairns, B (corresponding author), Glasgow Sch Art, Dept Commun Design, 167 Renfrew St, Glasgow G3 6RQ, Lanark, Scotland.",b.cairns@gsa.ac.uk,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,0,IPCA-INST POLITECNICO CAVADO & AVE,BARCELOS,"VILA FRESCAINHA, S MARTINHO, BARCELOS, 4750-810, PORTUGAL",,,978-989-99861-6-9,,,,2018,,,,,378,387,,,,,,10,"Art; Film, Radio, Television",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH),"Art; Film, Radio & Television",BO2OJ,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000506386300040,View Full Record in Web of Science

The general formulation is built from the solution of an integration factor problem with respect to the problem written with a material derivative, so that the exponential integration scheme naturally incorporates the nonlinear advection. Semi-Lagrangian techniques are used to treat the dependence of the exponential integrator on the flow trajectories. The formulation is general, as many exponential integration techniques could be combined with different semi-Lagrangian methods. This formulation allows an accurate solution of the linear stiff operator, a property inherited by the exponential integration technique. It also provides a sufficiently accurate representation of the nonlinear advection, even with large time-step sizes, a property inherited by the semi-Lagrangian method. Aiming for application in weather and climate modeling, we discuss possible combinations of well-established exponential integration techniques and state-of-the-art semi-Lagrangian methods used operationally in the application. We show experiments for the planar rotating shallow water equations. When compared to traditional exponential integration techniques, the experiments reveal that the coupling with semi-Lagrangian allows stabler integration with larger time-step sizes. From the application perspective, which already uses semi-Lagrangian methods, the exponential treatment could improve the solution of wave dispersion when compared to semi-implicit schemes.","[Peixoto, Pedro S.] Univ Sao Paulo, Appl Math, BR-05508090 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [Schreiber, Martin] Tech Univ Munich, D-85748 Garching, Germany",Universidade de Sao Paulo; Technical University of Munich,"Peixoto, PS (corresponding author), Univ Sao Paulo, Appl Math, BR-05508090 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.",pedrosp@ime.usp.br; martin.schreiber@tum.de,"Peixoto, Pedro Silva/I-7243-2013","Peixoto, Pedro Silva/0000-0003-2358-3221","FAPESP [2014/10501-0, 2016/18445-7]; USP Santander Mobility grant [527/2016]; Shell Brasil under the ANP RD levy grant [20714-2]; NCAR",FAPESP(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)); USP Santander Mobility grant; Shell Brasil under the ANP RD levy grant; NCAR(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)),"This work was supported by FAPESP grants 2014/10501-0 and 2016/18445-7, USP Santander Mobility grant 527/2016, Shell Brasil under the ANP R&D levy grant 20714-2, and NCAR.",,57,8,8,2,4,SIAM PUBLICATIONS,PHILADELPHIA,"3600 UNIV CITY SCIENCE CENTER, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19104-2688 USA",1064-8275,1095-7197,,SIAM J SCI COMPUT,SIAM J.

Despite its ubiquitous presence in our environment, there remains a dearth of data on human exposure to both glyphosate and its main biodegradation product aminomethylphosphonic (AMPA). Herein, we reviewed and compared results from 21 studies that use human biomonitoring (HBM) to measure urinary glyphosate and AMPA. Elucidation of the level and range of exposure was complicated by differences in sampling strategy, analytical methods, and data presentation. Exposure data is required to enable a more robust regulatory risk assessment, and these studies included higher occupational exposures, environmental exposures, and vulnerable groups such as children. There was also considerable uncertainty regarding the absorption and excretion pattern of glyphosate and AMPA in humans. This information is required to back-calculate exposure doses from urinary levels and thus, then compare these levels with health-based guidance values. Back-calculations based on animal-derived excretion rates suggested that there were no health concerns in relation to glyphosate exposure (when compared with EFSA acceptable daily intake (ADI)). However, recent human metabolism data has reported as low as a 1% urinary excretion rate of glyphosate. Human exposures extrapolated from urinary glyphosate concentrations found that upper-bound levels may be much closer to the ADI than previously reported.","[Connolly, Alison; Koch, Holger M.] Ruhr Univ Bochum IPA, Inst Prevent & Occupat Med, German Social Accid Insurance Inst, Burkle Camp Pl 1, D-44789 Bochum, Germany; [Connolly, Alison; Coggins, Marie A.] Natl Univ Ireland, Ctr Climate & Air Pollut Studies, Sch Phys, Univ Rd, Galway H91 CF50, Ireland; [Connolly, Alison; Coggins, Marie A.] Natl Univ Ireland, Ryan Inst, Univ Rd, Galway H91 CF50, Ireland",Ruhr University Bochum,"Connolly, A; Koch, HM (corresponding author), Ruhr Univ Bochum IPA, Inst Prevent & Occupat Med, German Social Accid Insurance Inst, Burkle Camp Pl 1, D-44789 Bochum, Germany.;Connolly, A (corresponding author), Natl Univ Ireland, Ctr Climate & Air Pollut Studies, Sch Phys, Univ Rd, Galway H91 CF50, Ireland.;Connolly, A (corresponding author), Natl Univ Ireland, Ryan Inst, Univ Rd, Galway H91 CF50, Ireland.",Alison.connolly@nuigalway.ie; marie.coggins@nuigalway.ie; koch@ipa-dguv.de,"Koch, Holger M/B-3277-2011","Koch, Holger M/0000-0002-8328-2837; Connolly, Alison/0000-0002-3189-7426; Coggins, Ann Marie/0000-0002-7318-8994",Irish Research Council; European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant [713279],"Irish Research Council(Irish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology); European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant",The lead author has received funding from the Irish Research Council and from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement No. 713279.,,77,32,32,4,24,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2305-6304,,TOXICS,Toxics,SEP,2020,3,,,,,,60,10.3390/toxics8030060,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/toxics8030060,,,18,Environmental Sciences; Toxicology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Toxicology,OC0YI,32824707,"Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000578889400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this paper, we view anthropogenic trends in coastal hypoxia through the lens of disturbance ecology and complexity theory. Complexity theory provides a framework for describing how estuaries and other coastal aquatic ecosystems respond to hypoxia by understanding feedback loops. Can it also be valuable in understanding how these ecosystems behave under shifting (i.e., unnatural) disturbance regimes? When viewed as a disturbance regime, shifts in the spatial (areal extent and fragmentation) and temporal (frequency and duration of events) characteristics of coastal hypoxia can be used to track changes into a non-stationary future. Here, we consider options for increasing the resilience of coastal aquatic ecosystems to future, unnatural hypoxic regimes. To start, we define desirable states as ecosystems with long trophic chains and slow nutrient and carbon dynamics that produce many ecosystem services. We then work backward to describe circumstances dominated by positive feedbacks that can lead ecosystems toward an undesirable state (i.e., depauperate communities and chemically reduced sediments). Processes of degradation and recovery can be understood in the context of island biogeography whereby species diversity in habitats fragmented by hypoxia is determined by the balance between rapid local extinction, slow recolonization from the edges of hypoxic patches, and opportunities for ecological succession during between disturbance events. We review potential future changes associated with changing global climate and highlight ways to enhance coastal resilience. In addition to efforts to slow climate change, potential interventions include reduced nutrient and carbon loadings from rivers, restoration of aquatic vegetation, and managing for key species, including those that promote sediment oxygenation, that enhance water clarity, or that promote grazing on epiphytic algae through top-down control.","[Jager, Henriette I.; Dale, Virginia H.] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Div Environm Sci, POB 2008, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA; [Novello, Rebecca C.] Ohio State Univ, Sch Environm & Nat Resources, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Dale, Virginia H.] Univ Tennessee, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Dabney Hall,1416 Circle Dr, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Villnas, Anna] Univ Helsinki, Tvarminne Zool Stn, JA Palmenin Tie 260, Hango 10900, Finland; [Rose, Kenneth A.] Univ Maryland, Horn Point Lab, Ctr Environm Sci, 2020 Horns Point Rd, Cambridge, MD 21613 USA",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Oak Ridge National Laboratory; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville; University of Helsinki; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science,"Jager, HI (corresponding author), Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Div Environm Sci, POB 2008, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA.",jagerhi@ornl.gov,"Jager, Henriette I/K-6293-2012; Dale, Virginia H/ABI-6672-2020; Rose, Kenneth/AAA-3534-2022; Dale, Virginia H/GSO-3448-2022","Jager, Henriette I/0000-0003-4253-533X; Dale, Virginia H/0000-0002-4123-7202; Rose, Kenneth/0000-0002-9310-8410; Villnas, Anna/0000-0003-3077-929X","UT-Battelle, LLC [DE-AC05-00OR22725]; U.S. Department of Energy; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Center for Sponsored Coastal Ocean Research (CSCOR), NGOMEX Grant through Louisiana State University [NA16NOS4780204]; Sophie von Julins Stiftelse; BONUS COCOA project; BONUS - EU [185]; BONUS - Academy of Finland [185]; DOE Public Access Plan; NOANs CSCOR NGOMEX program [234]","UT-Battelle, LLC; U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Center for Sponsored Coastal Ocean Research (CSCOR), NGOMEX Grant through Louisiana State University; Sophie von Julins Stiftelse; BONUS COCOA project; BONUS - EU; BONUS - Academy of Finland; DOE Public Access Plan; NOANs CSCOR NGOMEX program","We thank Dr. Lisa Levin, Dr. Teresa Mathews, and two anonymous reviewers for helpful reviews that improved the manuscript.

This paper aims to investigate the relationship between the concentration of indoor air pollutants according to changes in temperature and humidity in newly built apartments before moving in. As a methodology, a field measurement was performed in 23 housing units in five different residential towers in Ajman, United Arab Emirates. Before the measurement, a 7-day bake-out was completed, and the target units were measured 30 days before moving in. The result showed that formaldehyde (HCHO) and VOCs such as benzene (C6H6), toluene (C7H8), ethylbenzene (C8H10), xylene (C8H10), and styrene (C8H8) have consistent humidity dependence within the range of 15 %-60% of relative humidity (RH). It was impossible to confirm the temperature dependency since it showed different characteristics for each apartment between 22 degrees C and 33 degrees C. There is a limit to predicting the occurrence of indoor air pollutants in the apartment only with microclimatic factors since there are many other variables, such as various building materials, management history of materials, and construction methods. However, it was proven that there is an emission cut-off point where the generation of indoor air pollutants deviates from a linear relationship in the RH 40%-50% and 25 degrees C. These temperature and humidity ranges are synchronized with daily life ranges.","[Jung, Chuloh; Mahmoud, Naglaa Sami Abdelaziz; Alqassimi, Nahla] Ajman Univ, Coll Architecture Art & Design, Dept Archietcture, Ajman, U Arab Emirates",Ajman University,"Jung, CL (corresponding author), Ajman Univ, Coll Architecture Art & Design, Dept Archietcture, Ajman, U Arab Emirates.",c.jung@ajman.ac.ae,,"Jung, Chuloh/0000-0002-0898-8450",,,,,72,0,0,0,0,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2297-3362,,FRONT BUILT ENVIRON,Front.

The warm phase of GIV exhibits a cold AMO-like pattern in the Atlantic basin and a warm IPO-like pattern in the Pacific basin. About 84% (R similar to-0.914) of Sahelian and 42% (R similar to-0.647) of Indian rainfall's temporal variance is attributed to GIV, showing substantial improvement compared to the variance explained by AMO and IPO individually. The physical mechanism for GIV-rainfall teleconnection is related to a modification of the Walker circulation. Although there is a substantial degree of uncertainty in the current generation of state-of-the-art climate models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5), some still replicate the observed GIV's spatial structure, its teleconnection, and associated physical mechanism. The results presented herein advance our knowledge about rainfall's interdecadal variability and have imperative ramifications for developing skillful decadal predictions.","[Joshi, Manish K.] Genesis Ray Energy India Pvt Ltd, Gurugram 122102, Haryana, India; [Rai, Archana; Kulkarni, Ashwini] Indian Inst Trop Meteorol, Minist Earth Sci, Pune 411008, Maharashtra, India",Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) - India; Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM),"Joshi, MK (corresponding author), Genesis Ray Energy India Pvt Ltd, Gurugram 122102, Haryana, India.",manishkumarjoshi@gmail.com,"Joshi, Manish K./T-8739-2019; Rai, Archana/AFR-1477-2022","Joshi, Manish K./0000-0001-6498-6962; ","Ministry of Earth Sciences, Govt. of India; ICTP, Trieste, Italy","Ministry of Earth Sciences, Govt. of India; ICTP, Trieste, Italy","A.R. and A.K. gratefully acknowledge the Director, Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) for support and encouragement.

A fairly comprehensive description of stratospheric chemistry is included in a state-of-the-art GCM which has been extended to the middle mesosphere. The predicted ozone concentration is used in the model radiation scheme, thereby coupling the dynamical and chemical processes. Simulations commence on 1 March in each of the years 1979, 1994, 1999, 2004, 2009 and 2014, and consist of a 4 month spin-up period, followed by a 1-year integration. Past and projected values of halogen amounts and greenhouse gases (GHGs) are imposed on the model. The results for 1979-80 and 1994-95 are generally in good agreement with observations, indicating in the latter case a deep Antarctic ozone hole and some Arctic ozone loss. For the 1979 simulation only a very shallow ozone hole was simulated, in agreement with observations. In about the year 2005, the Antarctic ozone hole reaches its maximum size and globally averaged ozone reaches its minimum, depending on the month. Tropical ozone continues to decrease until about 2010. Results in the Arctic are dominated by interannual variability, but minimum ozone may not be attained until the year 2010. The results suggest that the increase in GHGs is delaying the onset of ozone recovery. Relative to 1980 conditions, the model changes in ozone result in small predicted increases in surface ultraviolet radiation in the Arctic and mid-latitude summer but large increases in the tropics and in the Antarctic summer.","Met Off, Bracknell RG12 2SZ, Berks, England",Met Office - UK,"Austin, J (corresponding author), Met Off, London Rd, Bracknell RG12 2SZ, Berks, England.",,,,,,,,46,26,26,0,3,ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOC,READING,"104 OXFORD ROAD, READING, BERKS, ENGLAND RG1 7LJ",0035-9009,,,Q J ROY METEOR SOC,Q.

Advances in climate modelling have enabled us to make useful predictions of the seasonal Asian summer monsoon up to approximately half a year ahead, but long-range predictions remain challenging. Here, using a 52-member large ensemble hindcast experiment spanning 1980-2016, we show that a state-of-the-art climate model can predict the Asian summer monsoon and associated summer tropical cyclone activity more than one year ahead. The key to this long-range prediction is successfully simulating El Nino-Southern Oscillation evolution and realistically representing the subsequent atmosphere-ocean response in the Indian Ocean-western North Pacific in the second boreal summer of the prediction. A large ensemble size is also important for achieving a useful prediction skill, with a margin for further improvement by an even larger ensemble. Long-range predictions of the Asian summer monsoon remain challenging due to its complex atmosphere-land-ocean interactions. Here, the authors show that a large ensemble of model simulations can predict the Asian summer monsoon and associated summer tropical cyclone activity more than one year ahead.","[Takaya, Yuhei] Japan Meteorol Agcy, Meteorol Res Inst, Ibaraki, Japan; [Kosaka, Yu] Univ Tokyo, Res Ctr Adv Sci & Technol, Tokyo, Japan; [Watanabe, Masahiro] Univ Tokyo, Atmosphere & Ocean Res Inst, Chiba, Japan; [Maeda, Shuhei] Japan Meteorol Agcy, Aerol Observ, Ibaraki, Japan",Japan Meteorological Agency; Meteorological Research Institute - Japan; University of Tokyo; University of Tokyo; Japan Meteorological Agency,"Takaya, Y (corresponding author), Japan Meteorol Agcy, Meteorol Res Inst, Ibaraki, Japan.",yuhei.takaya@mri-jma.go.jp,"Kosaka, Yu/C-2792-2009","Kosaka, Yu/0000-0001-5575-4668; Takaya, Yuhei/0000-0002-7359-8897","JSPS KAKENHI [JP17K14395, JP17K01223, JP18H01278, JP18H01281, JP19H05703]; Integrated Research Programme for Advancing Climate Models (TOUGOU) from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), Japan [JPMXD0717935561, JPMXD0717935457]","JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Integrated Research Programme for Advancing Climate Models (TOUGOU) from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), Japan(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT))","Y.T. is supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Numbers JP17K14395 and JP17K01223.

This interaction has been recognized for more than 3 decades, during which time a large body of research has emerged from laboratory, field, and modeling studies. NO3-BVOC reactions influence air quality, climate and visibility through regional and global budgets for reactive nitrogen (particularly organic nitrates), ozone, and organic aerosol. Despite its long history of research and the significance of this topic in atmospheric chemistry, a number of important uncertainties remain. These include an incomplete understanding of the rates, mechanisms, and organic aerosol yields for NO3-BVOC reactions, lack of constraints on the role of heterogeneous oxidative processes associated with the NO3 radical, the difficulty of characterizing the spatial distributions of BVOC and NO3 within the poorly mixed nocturnal atmosphere, and the challenge of constructing appropriate boundary layer schemes and non-photochemical mechanisms for use in state-of-the-art chemical transport and chemistry-climate models. This review is the result of a workshop of the same title held at the Georgia Institute of Technology in June 2015. The first half of the review summarizes the current literature on NO3-BVOC chemistry, with a particular focus on recent advances in instrumentation and models, and in organic nitrate and secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation chemistry. Building on this current understanding, the second half of the review outlines impacts of NO3-BVOC chemistry on air quality and climate, and suggests critical research needs to better constrain this interaction to improve the predictive capabilities of atmospheric models.","[Ng, Nga Lee] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Chem & Biomol Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Ng, Nga Lee] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Earth & Atmospher Sci, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Brown, Steven S.] NOAA, Div Chem Sci, Earth Syst Res Lab, Boulder, CO USA; [Brown, Steven S.; Day, Douglas A.] Univ Colorado, Dept Chem & Biochem, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Archibald, Alexander T.; Day, Douglas A.; Jimenez, Jose L.] Univ Cambridge, Natl Ctr Atmospher Sci, Cambridge, England; [Atlas, Elliot] Univ Miami, RSMAS, Dept Atmospher Sci, Miami, FL USA; [Cohen, Ronald C.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Crowley, John N.] Max Planck Inst Chem, Div Atmospher Chem, Mainz, Germany; [Day, Douglas A.; Jimenez, Jose L.] Univ Colorado, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Donahue, Neil M.] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Ctr Atmospher Particle Studies, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Fry, Juliane L.] Reed Coll, Dept Chem, Portland, OR USA; [Fuchs, Hendrik; Kiendler-Scharr, Astrid] Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Energ & Klimaforschung Troposphare IEK 8, Julich, Germany; [Griffin, Robert J.] Rice Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Houston, TX USA; [Guzman, Marcelo I.] Univ Kentucky, Dept Chem, Lexington, KY 40506 USA; [Herrmann, Hartmut; Iinuma, Yoshiteru; Mutzel, Anke; Tilgner, Andreas] Leibniz Inst Tropospher Res, Atmospher Chem Dept, Leipzig, Germany; [Hodzic, Alma] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Atmospher Chem Observat & Modeling, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [Lee, Ben H.] Univ Washington, Dept Atmospher Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Luecken, Deborah J.; Pye, Havala O.

Once at the centre of the inter-war avant-garde, Surrealists endured accusations of irrelevance issued by Existentialist writer Jean-Paul Sartre and Communist Party taunts of anti-revolutionary tendencies, advanced by Louis Aragon and others. Yet Surrealism retained and attracted many supporters and as such still constituted a potent threat to Sartre's and Aragon's groups. This paper employs Pierre Bourdieu's concept of boundaries to explore exchanges between and strategic positioning of these cultural entities. In order to fully legitimise their cultural relevance, Existentialist and Communist writers defined the discursive boundaries of their groups in part by comparing themselves with Surrealism. Paradoxically, their very public engagement with the tenets of Surrealism attests to the continued influence of the post-war Surrealist movement.","[Adams, Ellen E.] Grand Valley State Univ, Frederik Meijer Honors Coll, Art Hist, Grand Rapids, MI USA",Grand Valley State University,"Adams, EE (corresponding author), Grand Valley State Univ, 126 Glenn A Niemeyer Honors Hall, Allendale, MI 49401 USA.",adamsell@gvsu.edu,,,,,,,57,0,0,0,9,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0957-1558,1740-2352,,FR CULT STUD,Fr.

Various studies have acknowledged the potential of CABS with seasonal adaptation, but thus far, there is no method available to quantify their performance potential. This paper presents a framework for design and performance analysis of CABS with optimal seasonal adaptation strategies. The framework is based on a sequence of multi-objective optimization scenarios and uses a genetic algorithm in combination with coupled building energy and daylighting simulations. Findings from a case study with an office building in the Netherlands demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework in quantifying the potential of seasonal CABS. Results of the case study show that monthly adaptation of six facade design parameters can lead to improved IEQ conditions and 15-18% energy savings compared to the best performing non-adaptive building shell. Through post-optimization analysis of monthly and annual solutions, a better understanding of the key elements of seasonal facade adaptation is obtained. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

A linear inverse model is trained on each simulation and observational data set to assess if trends in the SST gradient are significant relative to the stationary statistics of internal variability, as would suggest an important role for external forcings such as anthropogenic greenhouse gasses. None of the 83 simulations have a positive trend in the SST gradient, a strengthening of the climatological SST gradient with more warming in the western than eastern tropical Pacific, as large as the mean trend across the five observational data sets. If the observed trends are anthropogenically forced, this discrepancy suggests that state-of-the-art climate models are not capturing the observed response of the tropical Pacific to anthropogenic forcing, with serious implications for confidence in future climate projections. There are caveats to this interpretation, however, as some climate models have a significant strengthening of the SST gradient between 1900 and 2013 Common Era, though smaller in magnitude than the observational data sets, and the strengthening in three out of five observational data sets is insignificant. When combined with observational uncertainties and the possibility of centennial time scale internal variability not sampled by the linear inverse model, this suggests that confident validation of anthropogenic SST gradient trends in climate models will require further emergence of anthropogenic trends. Regardless, the differences in SST gradient trends between climate models and observational data sets are concerning and motivate the need for process-level validation of the atmosphere-ocean dynamics relevant to climate change in the tropical Pacific.","[Coats, S.] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Adv Studies Program, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [Coats, S.; Karnauskas, K.

However, a recent reconstruction of spring-summer temperatures for WE resulted in the likelihood of significantly higher temperatures in 1540. In order to check the plausibility of this result we investigated the severity of the 1540 drought by putting forward the argument of the known soil desiccation-temperature feedback. Based on more than 300 first-hand documentary weather report sources originating from an area of 2 to 3 million km(2), we show that Europe was affected by an unprecedented 11-month-long Megadrought. The estimated number of precipitation days and precipitation amount for Central and Western Europe in 1540 is significantly lower than the 100-year minima of the instrumental measurement period for spring, summer and autumn. This result is supported by independent documentary evidence about extremely low river flows and Europe-wide wild-, forest- and settlement fires. We found that an event of this severity cannot be simulated by state-of-the-art climate models.","[Wetter, Oliver; Pfister, Christian; Camenisch, Chantal; Rohr, Christian] Univ Bern, Oeschger Ctr Climate Change Res, Bern, Switzerland;

Conservation status of brown bears is least concerned and black bear is vulnerable in the world, and critically endangered (brown) (Ahmed et.al . 2013: Sheikh and Molur 2004) and threatened in Pakistan. It is reported that roughly 92% of past black bear habitat is now empty or without them. Similarly 30% previously known distribution has now lost its population in Pakistan. Considering the problems this species is facing, a reintroduction plan was organized in which the confiscated bear cubs from poachers were raised in a specialized and least human contact enclosure. Considering regional habitat difficulties, the sites were properly studied and discussed. Due to an appropriate monitoring system, five rehabilitated bears were readied for release in those habitats in the last three years. Monitoring of the released individuals confirmed their survival and success in their adaptation. The first year release was not discussed publicly so complaints or any negative impact was never discussed. Second year release because of the involvement of the country?s prime minister went public. The media itself reported positively. The conservationists unanimously opposed the release for their own reasons.

Spatial patterns of oxygen change, however, differ considerably between observed and modelled estimates. Particularly in the tropical thermocline that hosts open-ocean oxygen minimum zones, observations indicate a general oxygen decline, whereas most of the state-of-the-art models simulate increasing oxygen levels. Possible reasons for the apparent model-data discrepancies are examined. In order to attribute observed historical variations in oxygen levels, we here study mechanisms of changes in oxygen supply and consumption with sensitivity model simulations. Specifically, the role of equatorial jets, of lateral and diapycnal mixing processes, of changes in the wind-driven circulation and atmospheric nutrient supply, and of some poorly constrained biogeochemical processes are investigated. Predominantly wind-driven changes in the low-latitude oceanic ventilation are identified as a possible factor contributing to observed oxygen changes in the low-latitude thermocline during the past decades, while the potential role of biogeochemical processes remains difficult to constrain. We discuss implications for the attribution of observed oxygen changes to anthropogenic impacts and research priorities that may help to improve our mechanistic understanding of oxygen changes and the quality of projections into a changing future.

Sensitivity runs show the ability of the model to simulate thin ash layers when an increased vertical resolution is used. Calibration of the model results with measured data allows for a quantitative forecast of the ash concentration. After this calibration an independent comparison of the simulated number concentration of 3 mu m particles and observations at Hohenpeissenberg gives a correlation coefficient of 0.79.

Because the production of biomass or biofuels, wherever it takes place, comes along with externalities, positive or negative, the need for biomass and bioenergy sustainability criteria is more than ever felt. Research on sustainability criteria and certification systems has started through several national and international initiatives. Considering the benefits of an increased use of bioenergy but also the urge for limiting potential negative environmental and socio-economic impacts, the aim of these initiatives was to make the first move regarding bioenergy sustainability, while waiting for the European legislation to regulate this crucial issue. Land use changes, whether direct or indirect, are one of the most important consequences of bioenergy production. While direct land use changes are more easily assessed locally, indirect land use changes exceed the company level and need to be considered at a global scale. Methodologies for dealing with direct and indirect land use changes are proposed among others in the European, Dutch, British and German sustainability initiatives. This paper aims at presenting and comparing those four European initiatives, with a focus on their propositions for direct and indirect land use changes assessment. Key issues are discussed and recommendations are made for steps to overcome identified difficulties in accurately assessing the effects of indirect land use change due to bioenergy production.

In contrast, GFDL-ESM2M is an exception that exhibits a La Nina-like mean-state warming with a strengthening of the Walker circulation. This study explores the cause of this exceptional response and proposes a new mechanism, the nonlinear ENSO warming suppression (NEWS), where the transient heating rate difference between the atmospheric and oceanic reservoirs annihilates extreme El Ninos, causing a suppression of mean-state warming in the east. Heat budget analyses of GFDL-ESM2M robustly show that nonlinear dynamical heating, which is necessary for extremely warm El Ninos, becomes negligible under warming. An idealized nonlinear recharge oscillator model suggests that, if the temperature difference between the atmospheric and oceanic reservoirs becomes larger than some threshold value, the upwelling becomes too efficient for El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) to retain its nonlinearity. Therefore, extreme El Ninos dissipate but La Ninas remain almost unchanged, causing a La Nina-like mean-state warming. NEWS is consistent with observations and GFDL-ESM2M but not with the majority of state-of-the-art models, which lack realistic ENSO nonlinearity. NEWS and its opposite response to atmospheric cooling, the nonlinear ENSO cooling suppression (NECS), might contribute to the Pacific multidecadal natural variability and global warming hiatuses.","[Kohyama, Tsubasa; Hartmann, Dennis L.] Univ Washington, Dept Atmospher Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Kohyama, T (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Dept Atmospher Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",kohyama@uw.edu,"Kohyama, Tsubasa/Q-6214-2017","Kohyama, Tsubasa/0000-0002-5606-2062",National Science Foundation (NSF) [AGS1549579]; Takenaka Scholarship Foundation; Directorate For Geosciences [1549579] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Takenaka Scholarship Foundation; Directorate For Geosciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)),The work was supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) under Grant AGS1549579 and Takenaka Scholarship Foundation.

They range from simple and pragmatic Bias Correction (BC) methods, which directly adjust the model outputs of interest (e.g. precipitation) according to the available local observations, to more complex Perfect Prognosis (PP) ones, which indirectly derive local predictions (e.g. precipitation) from appropriate upper-air large-scale model variables (predictors). Statistical downscaling methods have been extensively used and critically assessed in climate change applications; however, their advantages and limitations in seasonal forecasting are not well understood yet. In particular, a key problem in this context is whether they serve to improve the forecast quality/skill of raw model outputs beyond the adjustment of their systematic biases. In this paper we analyze this issue by applying two state-of-the-art BC and two PP methods to downscale precipitation from a multimodel seasonal hindcast in a challenging tropical region, the Philippines. To properly assess the potential added value beyond the reduction of model biases, we consider two validation scores which are not sensitive to changes in the mean (correlation and reliability categories). Our results show that, whereas BC methods maintain or worsen the skill of the raw model forecasts, PP methods can yield significant skill improvement (worsening) in cases for which the large-scale predictor variables considered are better (worse) predicted by the model than precipitation. For instance, PP methods are found to increase (decrease) model reliability in nearly 40% of the stations considered in boreal summer (autumn). Therefore, the choice of a convenient downscaling approach (either BC or PP) depends on the region and the season.","[Manzanas, R.; Gutierrez, J.

These CGCMs show better skills in prediction of the atmospheric circulation and precipitation within the SCSSM domain during 1979-2005 than that during 1960-1978. Possible reasons for this improvement are investigated. First, the relationship between the SSTs over the tropical Pacific, North Pacific and tropical Indian Ocean, and SCSSM has intensified since the late 1970s. Meanwhile, the SCSSM-related SSTs, with their larger amplitude of interannual variability, have been better predicted. Moreover, the larger amplitude of the interannual variability of the SCSSM and improved initializations for CGCMs after the late 1970s contribute to the better prediction of the SCSSM. In addition, considering that the CGCMs have certain limitations in SCSSM rainfall prediction, we applied the year-to-year increment approach to these CGCMs from the DEMETER and ENSEMBLES projects to improve the prediction of SCSSM rainfall before and after the late 1970s.","[Fan Yi; Fan Ke; Tian Baoqiang] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Nansen Zhu Int Res Ctr, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Fan Ke; Tian Baoqiang] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteoro, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Fan Yi] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Fan, K (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Nansen Zhu Int Res Ctr, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.;Fan, K (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteoro, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",fanke@mail.iap.ac.cn,"Fan, K/GXH-3734-2022; Fan, Ke/AAJ-2315-2020",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [41421004, 41325018, 41575079]; State Administration for Foreign Expert Affairs of the Chinses Academy of Sciences (CAS/SAFEA)",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); State Administration for Foreign Expert Affairs of the Chinses Academy of Sciences (CAS/SAFEA),"Supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41421004, 41325018, and 41575079) and State Administration for Foreign Expert Affairs of the Chinses Academy of Sciences (CAS/SAFEA).",,63,6,6,1,23,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",2095-6037,2198-0934,,J METEOROL RES-PRC,J.

Here, we provide an overview of the state of the art, knowledge gaps and key open questions in the study of extreme weather events over the vulnerable eastern Mediterranean. This region is situated in a transition zone between subtropical and mid-latitude climates. The large-scale atmospheric circulation and its interaction with regional synoptic systems (i.e., Cyprus Lows, Red Sea Troughs, Persian Troughs, Sharav Lows) and high-pressure systems mainly govern extreme weather. Complex orographic features further play an important role in the generation of extreme weather. Most extreme weather events, including heavy precipitation, cold spells, floods and windstorms, are associated with Cyprus Lows or active Red Sea Troughs, whereas heat waves are related with either Persian Troughs and sub-tropical high-pressure systems in summer or the Sharav Low during springtime. In future decades, heat waves and droughts are projected to significantly increase in both frequency and intensity. Changes in heavy precipitation may vary in sign and magnitude depending on the scale, severity and region of interest. There are still relatively large uncertainties concerning the physical understanding and the projected changes of cold spells, windstorms and compound extremes, as these types of events received comparatively little attention in the literature. We further identify knowledge gaps that relate to the societal impacts of extreme weather. These gaps mainly relate to the effects extreme weather may have on mortality, morbidity and infrastructure in the eastern Mediterranean. Research is currently limited in this context, and we recommend strengthening the database of analyzed case studies. We trust that this can only be suitably accomplished by inter-disciplinary and international regional collaboration (in spite of political unrest).","[Hochman, Assaf; Pinto, Joaquim G.] Karlsruhe Inst Technol KIT, Dept Tropospher Res IMK TRO, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Karlsruhe, Germany; [Hochman, Assaf] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem HUJI, Fredy & Nadine Hermann Inst Earth Sci, Jerusalem, Israel; [Marra, Francesco] Natl Res Council Italy CNR ISAC, Inst Atmospher Sci & Climate, Bologna, Italy; [Messori, Gabriele] Stockholm Univ, Dept Meteorol, Stockholm, Sweden; [Messori, Gabriele] Stockholm Univ, Bolin Ctr Climate Res, Stockholm, Sweden; [Messori, Gabriele] Uppsala Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Uppsala, Sweden; [Messori, Gabriele] Uppsala Univ, Ctr Nat Hazards & Disaster Sci CNDS, Uppsala, Sweden; [Raveh-Rubin, Shira] Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Rehovot, Israel; [Yosef, Yizhak] Israel Meteorol Serv, Bet Dagan, Israel; [Zittis, Georgios] Cyprus Inst, Climate & Atmosphere Res Ctr CARE C, Nicosia, Cyprus",Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Scienze dell'Atmosfera e del Clima (ISAC-CNR); Stockholm University; Uppsala University; Centre of Natural Hazards & Disaster Science (CNDS); Uppsala University; Weizmann Institute of Science,"Hochman, A (corresponding author), Karlsruhe Inst Technol KIT, Dept Tropospher Res IMK TRO, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Karlsruhe, Germany.;Hochman, A (corresponding author), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem HUJI, Fredy & Nadine Hermann Inst Earth Sci, Jerusalem, Israel.",assaf.hochman@kit.edu,"Marra, Francesco/I-3520-2019; Pinto, Joaquim G./A-7352-2009","Marra, Francesco/0000-0003-0573-9202; Raveh-Rubin, Shira/0000-0001-6244-8693; Zittis, George/0000-0002-6839-5622; Pinto, Joaquim G./0000-0002-8865-1769","German Helmholtz Association (Changing Earth program); AXA Research Fund; European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program [948309]; National Research Council of Italy; Institute of Atmospheric Sciences and Climate (CNR-ISAC); EMME-CARE project, from the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme [856612]; Government of the Republic of Cyprus","German Helmholtz Association (Changing Earth program); AXA Research Fund(AXA Research Fund); European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program(European Research Council (ERC)); National Research Council of Italy(Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR)); Institute of Atmospheric Sciences and Climate (CNR-ISAC); EMME-CARE project, from the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme; Government of the Republic of Cyprus","This research has been supported by the German Helmholtz Association (Changing Earth program) in the case of Assaf Hochman.

Bats might compete for key resources, and cases of exaggerated divergence of resource-related characters or trait overdispersion in bat assemblages are often explained in terms of current or past interspecific competition. However, other pressures leading to patterns that mimic the outcome of competition cannot always be ruled out. We present the state of knowledge on IC among bats, providing a critical evaluation of the information available and identifying open questions and challenges. We reviewed 100 documents addressing potential or actual IC in bats and categorised them in terms of the resource for which bats compete (food, foraging habitat, roosts, water, and acoustic space). We also examined the ecomorphological and behavioural traits considered therein to highlight responses to IC or niche partitioning. We found that: although resources should be limiting in order for competition to occur, this is seldom tested; sympatry is sometimes taken as synonymous of syntopy (yet sympatric species that are not syntopic will never experience competition); comparisons between sympatry and allopatry are rare; and testing of objective criteria exploring the existence of niche partitioning or character displacement is not commonly adopted. While morphological examination of food remains in droppings has often led to coarse-grained analysis that proved insufficient to establish the occurrence of food niche overlap or partitioning, new frontiers are being opened by state-of-the-art molecular dietary analysis. A better understanding of IC in bats is paramount, since distributional changes leading to novel bat assemblages driven by climate change are already taking place, and the dramatic decline in insect availability, as well as the global loss or alteration of foraging habitat, may generate new competitive interactions or exacerbate existing interactions in the Anthropocene, and into the future.","[Salinas-Ramos, Valeria B.; Ancillotto, Leonardo; Bosso, Luciano; Russo, Danilo] Univ Napoli Federico II, Dipartimento Agr, Wildlife Res Unit, Via Univ 100, I-80055 Naples, Italy; [Sanchez-Cordero, Victor] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Biol, Dept Zool, Lab Sistemas Informac Geog, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico",University of Naples Federico II; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico,"Russo, D (corresponding author), Univ Napoli Federico II, Dipartimento Agr, Wildlife Res Unit, Via Univ 100, I-80055 Naples, Italy.",valeria.salinasramos@unina.it; leonardo.ancillotto@unina.it; luciano.bosso@unina.it; victor@ib.unam.mx; danrusso@unina.it,"Salinas-Ramos, Valeria/AAK-3597-2021","Salinas-Ramos, Valeria/0000-0002-3854-6637; Bosso, Luciano/0000-0002-9472-3802; Russo, Danilo/0000-0002-1934-7130",CONACYT scholarship [294178],CONACYT scholarship(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)),We thank Henry Schofield and Tom Kitching for providing information about IC in rhinolophids and Clara Marcela Salinas Ramos for helping with the figures.

The grid-based model has a grid cell size of 25 km(2,) and the HRU-based model was set with an average HRU area of 25.2 km(2) to keep a balance between the discretization of the two models. Both the model setups are calibrated against the observed streamflow over the period 1977 to 1990 (with 1976 as the warm-up period) and validated over the period 1991 to 2004 by comparing simulated and observed hydrographs as well as using coefficient of determination (R-2), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), and percent bias (PBIAS) as statistical indices. Result of SHM simulation (NSE: 0.92 for calibration period; NSE: 0.92 for validation period) appears to be superior in comparison to SWAT simulation (NSE: 0.72 for calibration period; NSE: 0.50 for validation period) for both calibration and validation periods. The models' performances are also analyzed for annual peak flow, monthly flow variability, and for different flow percentiles. SHM has performed better in simulating annual peak flows and has reproduced the annual variability of observed streamflow for every month of the year. In addition, SHM estimates normal, moderately high, and high flows better than SWAT. Furthermore, total uncertainties of models' simulation have been analyzed using quantile regression technique and eventually quantified with scatter plots between P (measured data bracketed by the 95 percent predictive uncertainty (PPU) band) and R (the relative length of the 95PPU band with respect to the model simulated values)-values, for calibration and validation periods, for both the model simulations. The analysis confirms the superiority of SHM over its counterpart. Differences in data interpolation techniques and physical processes of the models are identified as the probable reasons behind the differences among the models' outputs.","[Paul, Pranesh Kumar] IIT Khragpur, Kharagpur 721302, W Bengal, India; [Zhang, Yongqiang] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Water Cycle & Related Land Surface Proc, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Mishra, Ashok; Singh, Rajendra] IIT Kharagpur, AgFE Dept, Kharagpur 721302, W Bengal, India; [Panigrahy, Niranjan] Odisha Univ Agr & Technol, Bhubaneswar 751003, Odisha, India","Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Kharagpur; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Kharagpur; Orissa University of Agriculture & Technology","Zhang, YQ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Water Cycle & Related Land Surface Proc, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",paulpranesh@iitkgp.ac.in; zhangyq@igsnrr.ac.cn; amishra@agfe.iitkgp.ernet.in; n.panigrahy@gmail.com; rsingh@agfe.iitkgp.ernet.in,"Paul, Pranesh Kumar/L-9815-2019; YONGQIANG, ZHANG/C-5708-2008","Paul, Pranesh Kumar/0000-0002-8504-3477; YONGQIANG, ZHANG/0000-0002-3562-2323","Space Application Centre (SAC), Ahmedabad [IIT/SRIC/AGFE/DWI/2013-14/124]; CAS Pioneer Hundred Talents Program","Space Application Centre (SAC), Ahmedabad; CAS Pioneer Hundred Talents Program","This research was funded by Space Application Centre (SAC), Ahmedabad, grant number IIT/SRIC/AGFE/DWI/2013-14/124 and the APC was funded by the CAS Pioneer Hundred Talents Program.",,70,13,13,0,7,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,MAY,2019,5,,,,,,871,10.3390/w11050871,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w11050871,,,20,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,IE9FN,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,12/21/22,WOS:000472680400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Retrieval simulations in which the maximum a posteriori (MAP) method was applied to pseudo-spectra at 700-800 cm(-1) from TANSO-FTS (CO2 15-mu m band) showed that retrieved CO2 profiles agreed with true CO2 profiles to within the total errors throughout the troposphere above 700-800 hPa when atmospheric conditions such as temperature used in the computation of the spectra were known. In contrast, discrepancies between retrieved CO2 and true CO2 concentrations increased if temperatures used in the retrieval included random errors; a random scatter of +/- 0.5 K caused a discrepancy that was 12 times larger at similar to 750 hPa. However, appropriate channel selection based on CO2 and temperature information could reduce the effect of temperature uncertainty on CO2 retrievals in this spectral region: the discrepancy between retrieved and true concentrations at similar to 750 hPa in the case with channel selection was about one-third of the discrepancy without any channel selection.","Univ Tokyo, Ctr Climate Syst Res, Kashiwa, Chiba 2778568, Japan",University of Tokyo,"Saitoh, N (corresponding author), Univ Tokyo, Ctr Climate Syst Res, 5-1-5 Kashiwanoha, Kashiwa, Chiba 2778568, Japan.",,"Ota, Yoshifumi/HCH-6263-2022","Ota, Yoshifumi/0000-0003-4441-4734",,,,,21,1,1,2,6,SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING,BELLINGHAM,"1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010 USA",0277-786X,,978-0-8194-6512-2,P SOC PHOTO-OPT INS,,,2006,,,,,40508,40508,640508,10.1117/12.693803,http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.693803,,,10,Instruments & Instrumentation; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Instruments & Instrumentation; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,BFZ50,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000245645300005,View Full Record in Web of Science

The IGP is monotonously flat with a spread of surface soils in hot arid conditions of Rajasthan in west to per-humid conditions in West Bengal. The soil-geomorphology of the IGP detailed during the last few decades is useful in determining the interrelationship among the pedogenesis, the climate, and the landscape evolution during the Holocene. These studies demonstrate that the IGP soils developed on five geomorphic surfaces with varying degree of development. Soils occurring on older geomorphic surfaces (>2.5 ka) are polygenetic with a distinct record of climatic changes and neotectonics. The present synthesis is based on recent developments in pedology achieved through macro- and micromorphology, clay mineralogy, pedogenic calcrete, and polygenetic pedogenic features of the IGP soils. A critical evaluation of the IGP soils has helped to comprehend the subtle nuances of the pedogenic processes that were also influenced by anthropogenic activities and cultivation over this vast agricultural tract during the Holocene. We provide state-of-the-art information on the pedology, polygenesis, and soil degradation (natural and anthropogenic) over the last 10 ka. The review has potential as a reference for critical assessment of the pedosphere for health and quality in different parts of the world. In addition, it facilitates developing a suitable management practices for the food security in the 21st century. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Srivastava, Pankaj; Aruche, K.

However, the extent to which these torrential rains are connected to other regions outside the Mediterranean remains uncertain. Here we simulate 160 extreme precipitation events with an atmospheric model enabled for state-of-the-art moisture tracking and demonstrate that large scale moisture transport is a more important factor than evaporation over local sources. We find that the average precipitation fraction with source in the Mediterranean is only 35%, while 10% is from evapotranspiration over nearby land in continental Europe and 25% originates in the North Atlantic. The remaining 30% comes from several more distant source regions, sometimes as remote as the tropical Pacific or the Southern Hemisphere, indicating direct connections with multiple locations on the planet and a global scale energy redistribution. Our results point to the importance of approaching these extreme episodes from a more global rather than purely regional perspective, especially when attempting to attribute them to climate change.","[Insua-Costa, Damian; Senande-Rivera, Martin; Miguez-Macho, Gonzalo] Univ Santiago Compostela, CRETUS, Nonlinear Phys Grp, Galicia, Spain; [Llasat, Maria Carmen] Univ Barcelona, Dept Appl Phys, Barcelona, Spain",Universidade de Santiago de Compostela; University of Barcelona,"Insua-Costa, D (corresponding author), Univ Santiago Compostela, CRETUS, Nonlinear Phys Grp, Galicia, Spain.",damian.insua@usc.es,"Llasat, Maria Carmen/AAB-7873-2020","Llasat, Maria Carmen/0000-0001-8720-4193; Senande-Rivera, Martin/0000-0002-2675-3196; Insua Costa, Damian/0000-0001-9699-2806; Miguez-Macho, Gonzalo/0000-0002-4259-7883","Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad OPERMO project [CGL2017-89859-R]; Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad M-CostAdapt project [CTM2017-83655C2-2-R]; European Union Interreg V POCTEFA project [EFA210/16 PIRAGUA]; CRETUS strategic partnership [AGRUP2015/02]; European Union ERDF; Xunta de Galicia [ED481A 2019/112]; Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities [PRE2018-084425]","Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad OPERMO project; Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad M-CostAdapt project; European Union Interreg V POCTEFA project; CRETUS strategic partnership; European Union ERDF(European Commission); Xunta de Galicia(Xunta de GaliciaEuropean Commission); Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities(Spanish Government)","Funding comes from the Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad OPERMO (CGL2017-89859-R to G.M.M., D.I.C., and M.S.R.) and M-CostAdapt (CTM2017-83655C2-2-R to M.C.LL.) projects, the European Union Interreg V POCTEFA project (EFA210/16 PIRAGUA to M.C.LL.) and the CRETUS strategic partnership (AGRUP2015/02 to G.M.M., D.I.C., and M.S.R.).

Snow cover over Baffin Island in the eastern Canadian Arctic shows large-scale expansion (as seen in proxy records) in two of the five models with snow cover information available, although it is not sustained beyond a decade. Sea ice expansion in the North Atlantic is seen in some PMIP3 models after large eruptions, although none of these models produce significant centennial-scale effects. Warm Baffin Island summer climates stunt snow expansion in some models completely, and model topography tends to miss the critical plateau elevations that could sustain snow on the island. Northern Hemisphere sea ice extent is lower in six of the eight models than in reconstructions over the past millennium. Annual average Northern Hemisphere mean climates have a range of 3K across models, while Arctic summer land-only climates span more than 6K. This has critical consequences on ice and snow formation and persistence in regions such as the Arctic where temperatures are near the freezing point and small temperature changes affect ice and snow feedback that could induce further climate changes. Thus, it is critical that models accurately represent absolute temperature.","[Berdahl, Mira; Robock, Alan] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Environm Sci, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA",Rutgers State University New Brunswick,"Berdahl, M (corresponding author), Rutgers State Univ, Dept Environm Sci, 14 Coll Farm Rd, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA.",mberdahl@envsci.rutgers.edu,"Robock, Alan/B-6385-2016","Robock, Alan/0000-0002-6319-5656","NSF [ARC-0908834, AGS-1157525]; Div Atmospheric & Geospace Sciences [1157525] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Div Atmospheric & Geospace Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)),"We thank Giff Miller, Davide Zanchettin, and an anonymous reviewer for their thoughtful comments on this paper, which very much improved this manuscript.

This paper aims to explore the effectiveness of an Annual Energy Challenge in curtailing electricity use by changing consumption behaviors at one liberal arts college. Design/methodology/approach - From 2010 to 2014, Allegheny College (Meadville, PA, USA) ran four-week energy challenges. Electricity consumption was measured and compared to a baseline year of 2008. An alternate baseline, more granular data for 20 sub-metered buildings and historic utility bill consumption trends were further analyzed to identify any persisting change and understand the impact of behavior change separate from efficiency retrofits, changes in population and normal seasonal shifts. Findings - Electricity consumption during the challenge period dropped an average of 9 per cent compared to the 2008 baseline and 6 per cent compared to the baseline of the 4 weeks preceding each challenge. Consumption trends changed in the years during challenge implementation compared to the years before engaging the campus community. All analyses reinforce that the challenge reduces electricity consumption. However, results must be analyzed in multiple ways to isolate for behavior change. Practical implications - The analyses used to isolate energy challenge results due to behavior change are replicable at other institutions and would allow campuses to compare results and share proven strategies. Originality/value - While many campuses organize energy challenges, few have published details about the results both during the challenge and continuing afterwards. Nor has a research explored the need to put results into contexts such as natural seasonal trends to isolate the impacts of behavior change.","[Boulton, Kelly] Allegheny Coll, Off Sustainabil, Meadville, PA 16335 USA; [Pallant, Eric; Bradshaw-Wilson, Casey; Choate, Beth; Carbone, Ian] Allegheny Coll, Dept Environm Sci, Meadville, PA 16335 USA",Allegheny College; Allegheny College,"Pallant, E (corresponding author), Allegheny Coll, Dept Environm Sci, Meadville, PA 16335 USA.",epallant@allegheny.edu,,"Carbone, Ian/0000-0002-9147-2833",Demmler Endowment,Demmler Endowment,This research was supported by a grant from the Demmler Endowment.,,25,6,6,1,13,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1467-6370,1758-6739,,INT J SUST HIGHER ED,Int.

Similarly important is understanding how environmental changes and trophic interactions shape future trajectories of key species with potential implications for ecosystem state and service provision. We here present a statistical modeling framework to assess and quantify cumulative effects on the long-term dynamics of the copepod Pseudocalanus acuspes, a key species in the Baltic Sea. Our model integrates linear and non-linear responses to changes in life stage density, climate and predation pressure as well as stochastic processes. We use the integrated life cycle model to simulate copepod dynamics under a combination of stressor scenarios and to identify conditions under which population responses are potentially mitigated or magnified. Our novel modeling approach reliably captures the historical P. acuspes population dynamics and allows us to identify females in spring and younger copepodites in summer as stages most sensitive to direct and indirect effects of the main environmental stressors, salinity and temperature. Our model simulations furthermore demonstrate that population responses to stressors are dampened through density effects. Multiple stressor interactions were mostly additive except when acting on the same life stage. Here, negative synergistic and positive dampening effects lead to a lower total population size than expected under additive interactions. As a consequence, we found that a favorable increase of oxygen and phosphate conditions together with a reduction in predation pressure by 50% each could counteract the negative effect of a 25% decrease in salinity by only 6%. Ultimately, our simulations suggest that P. acuspes will most certainly decline under a potential freshening of the Baltic Sea and increasing temperatures, which is conditional on the extent of the assumed climate change. Also the planned nutrient reduction strategy and fishery management plan will not necessarily benefit the temporal development of P. acuspes. Moving forward, there is a growing opportunity for using population modeling in cumulative effects assessments. Our modeling framework can help here as simple tool for species with a discrete life cycle to explore stressor interactions and the safe operating space under future climate change.","[Otto, Saskia A.; Moellmann, Christian] Univ Hamburg, Ctr Earth Syst Res & Sustainabil, Inst Marine Ecosyst & Fishery Sci, Hamburg, Germany; [Niiranen, Susa; Blenckner, Thorsten] Stockholm Univ, Stockholm Resilience Ctr, Stockholm, Sweden; [Tomczak, Maciej T.; Mueller-Karulis, Barbel] Stockholm Univ, Baltic Sea Ctr, Stockholm, Sweden; [Rubene, Gunta] Inst Food Safety Anim Hlth & Environm, Dept Fish Resources Res, Riga, Latvia","University of Hamburg; Stockholm University; Stockholm University; Institute of Food Safety, Animal Health & Environment BIOR","Otto, SA (corresponding author), Univ Hamburg, Ctr Earth Syst Res & Sustainabil, Inst Marine Ecosyst & Fishery Sci, Hamburg, Germany.",saskia.otto@uni-hamburg.de,"Möllmann, Christian/C-4788-2011","Möllmann, Christian/0000-0001-9161-6342; Blenckner, Thorsten/0000-0002-6991-7680; Niiranen, Susa/0000-0001-8405-8717",BONUS (Art 185); Stockholm University's Strategic Marine Environmental Research Funds through the Baltic Ecosystem Adaptive Management Program (BEAM); BONUS BLUEWEBS project - BONUS (Art 185); EU Horizon 2020 project ClimeFish [677039],BONUS (Art 185); Stockholm University's Strategic Marine Environmental Research Funds through the Baltic Ecosystem Adaptive Management Program (BEAM); BONUS BLUEWEBS project - BONUS (Art 185); EU Horizon 2020 project ClimeFish,"This study is a contribution to the BONUS AMBER project supported by BONUS (Art 185).

Thus, seasonal forecasts of precipitation and temperature are an essential tool for stakeholders to make timely choices regarding the strategies required to maximize their expected cereal yield outcomes. The availability of state-of-the-art seasonal forecasts such as the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) system 5 (SEAS5) may be an asset to help decision making. However, uncertainties and reduced skill may hamper the use of seasonal forecasts in several applications. Hence, in this work, we aim to understand the added value of such dynamical forecasts when compared to persistent anomalies of climate conditions used to predict the production of wheat and barley yields. With that in mind, empirical models relating annual wheat and barley yields in Spain to monthly values of precipitation and temperature are developed by taking advantage of ECMWF ERA5 reanalysis. Then, dynamical and persistence forecasts are issued at different lead times, and the skill of the subsequent forecasted yield is verified through probabilistic metrics. The results presented in this study demonstrate two different outcomes: (1) wheat and barley yield anomaly forecasts (dynamical and persistent) start to gain skill later in the season (typically from April onwards); and (2) the added value of using the SEAS5 forecast as an alternative to persistence ranges from 6 to 16%, with better results in the southern Spanish regions.","[Bento, Virgilio A.; Russo, Ana; Dutra, Emanuel; Ribeiro, Andreia F.

However, this cost-benefit approach may not guarantee robustness under uncertain future conditions, for instance under climatic changes. In this paper, we expand risk-based decision analysis to explore possible ways of enhancing robustness in engineered water resources systems under different risk attitudes. Risk is measured as the expected annual cost of water use restrictions, while robustness is interpreted in the decision-theoretic sense as the ability of a water resource system to maintain performance-expressed as a tolerable risk of water use restrictionsunder a wide range of possible future conditions. Linking risk attitudes with robustness allows stakeholders to explicitly trade-off incremental increases in robustness with investment costs for a given level of risk. We illustrate the framework through a case study of London's water supply system using state-of-the -art regional climate simulations to inform the estimation of risk and robustness. Plain Language Summary Faced with pressures from rising populations, competing demands, limited budgets, and climate change, water managers find it increasingly difficult to identify investments to cost-effectively secure water supplies. Traditional approaches to identify water-related investments suggest that water managers should invest up to the point where the benefit of an investment, for instance to reduce the risk of water shortages, equals the cost of achieving that benefit. However, some of the uncertainties around future climate change and population growth mean that this approach, called cost-benefit analysis, will not tell water managers all they need to know with regards to their investment's ability to provide secure water supplies. This study combines traditional investment planning based on cost-benefit analysis with recent advances in decision-making under uncertainty to show how water managers can identify investments that are resilient to future uncertainties, including climate change and population growth. London, a city of global significance, is taken as a case study. A computer model of London's water supply system is developed and then computer simulations are run to unravel investments that secure supplies under a wide range of uncertainties.","[Borgomeo, Edoardo; Mortazavi-Naeini, Mohammad; Hall, Jim W.; Guillod, Benoit P.] Univ Oxford, Environm Change Inst, Oxford, England; [Guillod, Benoit P.] ETH, Inst Environm Decis, Zurich, Switzerland; [Guillod, Benoit P.] ETH, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, Zurich, Switzerland",University of Oxford; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Borgomeo, E (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Environm Change Inst, Oxford, England.",edoardo.borgomeo@gmail.com,"Hall, Jim W/ABF-1407-2020; Guillod, Benoit P./K-3191-2015","Hall, Jim W/0000-0002-2024-9191; Guillod, Benoit P./0000-0003-1807-6997; Borgomeo, Edoardo/0000-0002-8351-9064",Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); NERC [NE/L010364/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/L010364/1] Funding Source: researchfish,Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"The authors would also like to thank the participants to the February 2016 Food Energy Environment and Water (FE2W) network meeting in Bellagio for interesting discussions on some of the issues explored in this paper.

This paper provides a synthesis of three previously published and one partially published sets of environmental and climatic data from the Middle to Upper Paleolithic sites of Cova del Rinoceront, Cova del Gegant, Cova del Coll Verdaguer and Terrasses de la Riera dels Canyars, all of which are located in the Garraf Massif mountain range. Using the habitat weighting and mutual ecogeographic range methods to reconstruct the environmental and climatic parameters, the results show great variability in the landscape and climate of the area. However, although the human occupation is not intense in the analyzed sites, the various layers of the sites in which the human presence is relatively more intense coincide with landscapes dominated by woodland formations in mild climatic conditions. A comparison of our results with those from other sites with studies of small vertebrates in Greece, Italy, southern France, and the Iberian Peninsula reveals the same pattern, showing that the hominins that inhabited the western Mediterranean region in the late Middle Pleistocene and Late Pleistocene were closely related to forested areas. 0 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

According to the importance of nonrenew-able energies such as fossil fuels and the increase in recent environmental pollution, ventilation plays an important role in buildings. Using air flow, reducing humidity and increasing surface evaporation, creates comfort condition in hot and humid climates. The city of Dezful, due to its special geographic situation, topographic conditions and the environmental systems, devoted particular climate Conditions to itself; so long-term warming has caused many problems for the citizens. In Dezful- as one of the warm and humid cities- builders have applied conglomeration soil to build a space at the depth of 5 to 12 meters underground to moderate and adapt the house climatic conditions. This underground space is called Shavadoon which is one of the suitable approaches to create thermal comfort by using earth annual temperature stability and natural ventilation. Earth temperature is less than outside temperature in the summer and higher in the winter. Expect the Caspian, Persian and Oman coasts, Iran old houses have basement often, and especially in the summer, dwellers went into the basement for thermal comfort. To recognize and analyze the natural ventilation condition and main effective criteria, twelve houses which have Shavadoon have been studied first; Based on this study the depth and area of Shavadoon, Darizeh -Darizeh is a pit 1 meter in diameter in order to supply light & vertical ventilation in shavadoons. Shavadoons reach the yard by darizeh - cross section area and geometric shape of plan are the most effective parameters on natural ventilation in shavadoons, changing the parameters result in significant changes in the air flow. On average by increasing house area, shavadoon area has been increased, the proportion between depth of shavadoon and yard area is also significant. So with more yard area the depth of shavadoon has been increased directly. Four separate phases have been taken to consider the parameters which will be analyzed separately. The results are presented in comparison. There are different ways to study natural ventilation in internal spaces, such as real-scale testing, wind tunnel and modeling approaches. In this study, CFD modeling is used by Design Builder software. The research method of this study is descriptive research and the method of gathering data is based on library and field studies and the analysis method is causal and based on modeling results. The history of this study goes back to the 1930s and early 1940s when there were plentiful interests in air conditioning engineering, caused numerous published books and articles. The air flow Knowledge inside the indoors is notable for three reasons: thermal comfort, indoor air quality and the decrease in building energy consuming. Studies show that in the last two decades attentions to the air flow in terms of modern science have been significantly increased. There is another article (in 2008) which defined and analyzed Dezful's shavadoons, while a comprehensive investigation about air natural flow and the operation of natural ventilation in this place is not available. The final results show that, in the classification of the considered shavadoons which were selected to be analyzed, the maximum depth is 11.8 m and minimum depth is 4.7m. The desired result has been concluded from the one with the minimum depth. Darizeh cross section is another effective parameter. The calculated velocity in darizehs which have different cross section along them is better than the ones which have the same cross section. Then, the location of Darizeh was analyzed. The best natural ventilation will take place when the darizeh is placed in sahn-shavadoon center-which makes balanced ventilation along the shavadoon. Next condition takes place when darizeh is in terminal cat- shavadoons have some small rooms which are called cats- which the air flow is desirable along Shavadoon but the amount of air flow decreases in adjacent cats. Finally Shavadoons, based on their appearance, are classified in to two types, pure space (without Cat) and Chalipa space. The results of analysis showed air flow and air circulation was better in pure space, however Chalipa form is better in structure and architecture.","[Hazbei, Morteza; Adib, Zahra; Nasrollahi, Farshad] Art Univ Isfhan, Isfhan, Iran; [Nasrollahi, Farshad] Univ Berlin, Berlin, Germany",,"Hazbei, M (corresponding author), Art Univ Isfhan, Isfhan, Iran.",m.hazbei@gmail.com; Zahra.Adib67@Gmail.Com; f.nasrollahi@udk-berlin.de,,"Hazbei, Morteza/0000-0001-5436-3833",,,,,20,1,1,0,0,NAZAR RESEARCH CENTER ART ARCHITECTURE & URBANISM,TEHRAN,"NO 3, DR QARIB ST AZADI AVE, TEHRAN, 14198-43311, IRAN",1735-9635,2251-7197,,BAGH E NAZAR,Bagh e Nazar,OCT,2014,30,,,,43,54,,,,,,12,"Humanities, Multidisciplinary",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Arts & Humanities - Other Topics,VH0SA,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000450015600004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Approximately 110 participants presented and discussed 60 talks and 25 posters. Of these, ten articles are published in this symposium issue. The goal of this symposium was to discuss the role of shellfish, both as harvestable resources and as important ecosystem players in northern hemisphere cold marine environments. To provide perspective for the symposium, the development of four major crustacean fisheries (northern shrimp, snow crab, Homarus, Norway lobster) are reviewed. Our review showed that landings of all these fisheries are still in a state of flux due to inherent population dynamics, fishing, and climate change. The talks and posters covered a broad range of state-of-the-art bioecological knowledge and present challenges in the assessment and management of the most ecologically and/or commercially important cold-water shellfish species belonging to the phyla Arthropoda, Mollusca, and Echinodermata. Various alternative harvesting and management techniques were presented along with perspectives for shellfish aquaculture. Methods and models for stock assessment were thoroughly covered as well as the ecological role of shellfish, their population dynamics, new insights into their biology and genetics, and their changing distribution and significance as invasive species.","[Hvingel, Carsten] Inst Marine Res, Fram Ctr, POB 6606, N-9296 Tromso, Norway; [Sainte-Marie, Bernard] Fisheries & Oceans Canada, Maurice Lamontagne Inst, 850 Route Mer, Mont Joli, PQ G5H 3Z4, Canada; [Kruse, Gordon H.] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Coll Fisheries & Ocean Sci, 17101 Point Lena Loop Rd, Juneau, AK 99801 USA",Institute of Marine Research - Norway; Fisheries & Oceans Canada; University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Fairbanks,"Hvingel, C (corresponding author), Inst Marine Res, Fram Ctr, POB 6606, N-9296 Tromso, Norway.",carsten.hvingel@imr.no,,"Sainte-Marie, Bernard/0000-0003-0196-8091",ICES; NAFO; PICES; Research Council of Norway; Lyngenfjord and Norges Ra fisklag,ICES; NAFO; PICES; Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway); Lyngenfjord and Norges Ra fisklag,"The symposium was hosted by Norway's Institute of Marine Research and was co-sponsored by ICES, PICES, NAFO, and the Research Council of Norway.

This trend corresponds to a hydrological sensitivity (HS) of 7% K-1 of global warming, which is close to the Clausius-Clapeyron (CC) rate expected from the increase in saturation water vapor pressure with temperature. Analysis of two available global ocean evaporation datasets confirms this observed intensification of the atmospheric water cycle. The observed hydrological sensitivity over the past 20-yr period is higher by a factor of 5 than the average HS of 1.4% K-1 simulated in state-of-the-art coupled atmosphere-ocean climate models for the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. However, the analysis shows that the interdecadal variability in HS in the models is high-in particular in the twentieth-century runs, which are forced by both increasing greenhouse gas (GHG) and tropospheric aerosol concentrations. About 12% of the 20-yr time intervals of eight twentieth-century climate simulations from the third phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP3) have an HS magnitude greater than the CC rate of 6.5% K-1. The analysis further indicates different HS characteristics for GHG and tropospheric aerosol forcing agents. Aerosol-forced HS is a factor of 2 greater, on average, and the interdecadal variability is significantly larger, with about 23% of the 20-yr sensitivities being above the CC rate. By thermodynamically constraining global precipitation changes, it is shown that such changes are linearly related to the difference in the radiative imbalance at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) and the surface (i.e., the atmospheric radiative energy imbalance). The strength of this relationship is controlled by the modified Bowen ratio (here, global sensible heat flux change divided by latent heat flux change). Hydrological sensitivity to aerosols is greater than the sensitivity to GHG because the former have a stronger effect on the shortwave transmissivity of the atmosphere, and thus produce a larger change in the atmospheric radiative energy imbalance. It is found that the observed global precipitation increase of 13 mm yr(-1) decade(-1) from 1987 to 2006 would require a trend of the atmospheric radiative imbalance (difference between the TOA and the surface) of 0.7 W m(-2) decade(-1). The recovery from the El Chichon and Mount Pinatubo volcanic aerosol injections in 1982 and 1991, the satellite-observed reductions in cloudiness during the phase of increasing ENSO events in the 1990s, and presumably the observed reduction of anthropogenic aerosol concentrations could have caused such a radiative imbalance trend over the past 20 years. Observational evidence, however, is currently inconclusive, and it will require more detailed investigations and longer satellite time series to answer this question.","[Liepert, Beate G.; Previdi, Michael] Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY 10964 USA",Columbia University,"Liepert, BG (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, 61 Route 9W, Palisades, NY 10964 USA.",liepert@ldeo.columbia.edu,,,"NASA MAP Program [NNG06GC66G]; Office of Science, U.S. Department of Energy","NASA MAP Program(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); Office of Science, U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE))","This work was sponsored by NASA MAP Program Grant NNG06GC66G.

The potential for skillful seasonal forecasts of the winter NAO using an ensemble-based dynamical prediction system has only recently been demonstrated. Here we show that the winter predictability can be significantly improved by refining a dynamical ensemble through subsampling. We enhance prediction skill of surface temperature, precipitation, and sea level pressure over essential parts of the Northern Hemisphere by retaining only the ensemble members whose NAO state is close to a first guess NAO prediction based on a statistical analysis of the initial autumn state of the ocean, sea ice, land, and stratosphere. The correlation coefficient between the reforecasted and observation-based winter NAO is significantly increased from 0.49 to 0.83 over a reforecast period from 1982 to 2016, and from 0.42 to 0.86 for a forecast period from 2001 to 2017. Our novel approach represents a successful and robust alternative to further increasing the ensemble size, and potentially can be used in operational seasonal prediction systems. Plain Language Summary Predicting Northern Hemisphere winter conditions, which are controlled largely by fluctuations in the pressure filed over the North Atlantic (North Atlantic Oscillation, NAO), for the next season is a major challenge. Most state-of-the-art seasonal prediction systems show a correlation between observed and predicted NAOs of less than 0.30. Our novel approach uses dynamical links (teleconnections) between the autumn state of sea surface temperature in the North Atlantic, Arctic sea ice, snow in Eurasia, and stratosphere temperature over the Northern Hemisphere as predictors of the NAO in the subsequent winter to subsample a dynamical reforecast ensemble. We select only the ensemble members that consistently reproduce winter NAO states that evolve in accordance with the autumn state of these predictors. As a result the winter NAO prediction skill increases to a correlation value of 0.83. Considering these well established NAO teleconnections in our Earth system model leads to an improved prediction skill of European winter conditions, that is, surface temperature, precipitation, and sea level pressure. Our results advance seasonal prediction of European weather to a level that is usually limited to tropical regions and are relevant for a variety of societal sectors, such as global and national economies and energy and water resources.","[Dobrynin, Mikhail; Brune, Sebastian; Duesterhus, Andre; Baehr, Johanna] Univ Hamburg, Ctr Earth Syst Res & Sustainabil CEN, Inst Oceanog, Hamburg, Germany; [Domeisen, Daniela I.

It is critical to attaining the Paris Agreement and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Since GF is regarded as the future of finance and investment, it needs to be fully understood. This paper presents the first mixed-methods systematic review with both bibliometric and qualitative analysis of the state-of-the-art and trends in GF research. A bibliometric review was performed to quantitatively examine 995 related publications retrieved from Scopus and validated with the Web of Science, Google Scholar, and ScienceDirect. Results showed that GF is still relatively an immature but interdisciplinary research area. A further qualitative-systematic analysis of 60 selected publications was conducted to identify the key findings, challenges, and recommendations for future research. Findings revealed six major research hotspots in GF: (i) green bond market and greenium, (ii) green credit (loan), (iii) carbon investment and market, (iv) green banking, (v) market stress (e.g. the COVID-19 pandemic) and GF, and (vi) domestic and international climate finance policies. This study provides insights into key applications of GF as it applies to specific research fields, a and as the pathways to realize the accruable benefits of GF to enhance research and development.","[Debrah, Caleb; Darko, Amos; Chan, Albert Ping Chuen] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Bldg & Real Estate, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Hong Kong Polytechnic University,"Debrah, C (corresponding author), Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Bldg & Real Estate, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",caleb.debrah@connect.polyu.hk,"Darko, Amos/C-4721-2018","Darko, Amos/0000-0002-7978-6039; Debrah, Caleb/0000-0002-2027-1567",Department of Building and Real Estate of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University,Department of Building and Real Estate of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University,This work was supported by Department of Building and Real Estate of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University.,,161,1,1,56,56,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-5529,1756-5537,,CLIM DEV,Clim.

J,"Cohen-Solal, E; Le Treut, H",,,,"Cohen-Solal, E; Le Treut, H",,,Unstable behaviour of an upper ocean atmosphere coupled model: role of atmospheric radiative processes and oceanic heat transport,CLIMATE DYNAMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,GENERAL-CIRCULATION MODEL; OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; SEA ICE; CLIMATE; SENSITIVITY; SYSTEM; SST,"We describe the initial bias of the climate simulated by a coupled ocean-atmosphere model. The atmospheric component is a state-of-the-art atmospheric general circulation model: whereas the ocean component is limited to the upper ocean and includes a mixed layer whose depth is computed by the model, As the full ocean general circulation is not computed by the model, the heat transport within the ocean is prescribed. When modifying the prescribed heat transport we also affect the initial drift of the model. We analyze here one of the experiments where this drift is very strong, in order to study the key processes relating the changes in the ocean transport and the evolution of the model's climate. In this simulation, the ocean surface temperature cools by 1.5 degrees C in 20 y. We can distinguish two different phases. During the first period of 5 y, the sea surface temperatures become cooler, particularly in the intertropical area: but the outgoing longwave radiation at the top-of-the-atmosphere increases very quickly. in particular at the end of the period. An off-line version of the model radiative code enables us to decompose this behaviour into different contributions (cloudiness, specific humidity, air and surface temperatures, surface albedo). This partitioning shows that the longwave radiation evolution is due to a decrease of high level cirrus clouds in the intertropical troposphere. The decrease of the cloud cover also leads to a decrease of the planetary albedo and therefore an increase of the net short wave radiation absorbed by the system. But the dominant factor is the strong destabilization by the longwave cooling, which is able to throw the system out of equilibrium. During the remaining of the simulation (second phase), the cooling induced by the destabilization at the top-of-the-atmosphere is transmitted to the surface by various processes of the climate system. Hence, we show that small variations of ocean heat transport can force the model from a Stable to an unstable state via atmospheric processes which arise when the tropics are cooling. Even if possibly overestimated by our GCM, this mechanism may be pertinent to the maintenance of present climatic conditions in the tropics. The simplifications inherent in our model's design allow us to investigate the mechanism in some detail.","Univ Paris 06, CNRS, Meteorol Dynam Lab, F-75252 Paris 05, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Universite Paris Cite,"Le Treut, H (corresponding author), Univ Paris 06, CNRS, Meteorol Dynam Lab, 4 Pl Jussieu,Case Courrier 99,5eme Etage,Tour 25, F-75252 Paris 05, France.",,,,,,,,30,1,1,0,0,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0930-7575,,,CLIM DYNAM,Clim.

The mean motile sperm observed on dilution and at pre- and post-freezing were 81.20+/-0.35, 75.79+/-0.37 and 46.92+/-0.70%. The values after 30,60 and 120 min of post-thaw incubation (37 degrees C) were 34.70+/-1.00, 22.04+/-1.03 and 11.46+/-0.84%. The mean glutamic oxaloacetic and glutamic pyruvic transaminase (GOT-GPT) activities in the pre-freeze seminal plasma (60 millon sperm/ml) averaged 19.08+/-0.39 and 5.87+/-0.17 mu mole/litre, which increased to the levels of 28.67+/-0.55 and 9.90+/-0.22 mu mole/litre in frozen-thawed samples. The mean conception rate obtained with frozen semen inseminations was 59.13%. All these traits were highly significantly influenced by the bulls,extenders, additives and periods. However, the interactions between these factors were not significant for enzyme leakage. Significantly greater sperm motility and lesser GOT-GPT leakage were recorded at all the steps of semen processing in TFYG diluent art compared to EYCG and LYG diluents. Although conception rates did not vary significantly between them. The freezability, post-thaw thermoresistance and fertility of semen were also enhanced significantly and the enzyme leakage was reduced with the inclusion of cysteine and/or EDTA in all diluents as compared to control or even raffinose added diluents. The correlations between pre-/post-freezing sperm motility and GOT-GPT leakage were significantly negative. Fertility rates showed significant positive correlations with sperm motility and negative correlations with enzyme leakage at various stages. These findings proved the superiority of TFYG diluent and the beneficial role of cysteine and EDTA as additives in improving the pst-thaw quality and fertility of bovine semen, and hence may be recommended for its routine use by all semen banks in tropics.",,,"DHAMI, AJ (corresponding author), GUJARAT COLL VET SCI & ANIM HUSB,DEPT OBSTET & GYNAECOL,ANAND 388001,GUJARAT,INDIA.",,,,,,,,0,4,4,0,0,INDIAN COUNC AGRICULTURAL RES,NEW DELHI,"ICAR BHAWAN PUSA, NEW DELHI 110 012, INDIA",0367-8318,,,INDIAN J ANIM SCI,Indian J.

Based on a large ensemble of state-of-the-art climate models, we show that a considerable intermodel spread exists in the spatiotemporal properties of the simulated AMV and teleconnections with European summer temperature. The greater the persistence, variance, and basin-scale spatial coherence, the stronger the teleconnection. We demonstrate that only a few members of a few models produce a teleconnection that is consistent with observational estimates over the instrumental period. This highlights the possible extreme nature of the last century teleconnection and/or a detrimental underestimation of ocean-land teleconnectivity in many climate models. Yet we emphasize the considerable uncertainties due to methods used to disentangle internal and externally forced variations in observations, and to sampling, which must be correctly accounted when analyses are performed on short temporal records.","[Qasmi, Said; Cassou, Christophe; Boe, Julien] Univ Toulouse, CECI, CNRS, CERFACS, Toulouse, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CERFACS; Universite de Toulouse,"Qasmi, S (corresponding author), Univ Toulouse, CECI, CNRS, CERFACS, Toulouse, France.",qasmi@cerfacs.fr,"CASSOU, Christophe/AAP-6409-2020; Qasmi, Saïd/AAE-2339-2019","Qasmi, Saïd/0000-0002-1825-3896; CASSOU, Christophe/0000-0002-5164-1612; Boe, Julien/0000-0003-2965-4721",Electricite de France (EDF); French National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-13-SENV-0002],Electricite de France (EDF)(Electricite de France (EDF)); French National Research Agency (ANR)(French National Research Agency (ANR)),"This work was supported by a grant from Electricite de France (EDF) and by the French National Research Agency (ANR) in the framework of the MORDICUS project (ANR-13-SENV-0002).

The model performance is evaluated based on a reforecast of 38 years from 1982 to 2019, with 20 ensemble members of 12-month integrations. The analysis is executed on ensemble mean data separately for boreal winter (December to February: DJF), spring (March to May: MAM), summer (June to August: JJA), and autumn (September to November: SON) seasons. It is found that the Saudi-KAU model mimics the observed climatological pattern and variability of the SST in the tropical Pacific region. A cold bias of about 0.5-1.0 degrees C is noted in the ENSO region during all seasons at 1-month lead times. A statistically significant positive correlation coefficient is observed for the predicted SST anomalies in the tropical Pacific Ocean that lasts out to 6 months. Across varying times of the year and lead times, the model shows higher skill for autumn and winter target seasons than for spring or summer ones. The skill of the Saudi-KAU model in predicting Nino 3.4 index is comparable to that of state-of-the-art models available in the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) and North American Multi-Model Ensemble (NMME) projects. The ENSO skill demonstrated in this study is potentially useful for regional climate services providing early warning for precipitation and temperature variations on sub-seasonal to seasonal time scales.","[Almazroui, Mansour; Tippett, Michael K.; Ismail, Muhammad; Islam, M.

These circumstances are of particular concern due to the impacts on food chains and the resulting disruptions in supply and price changes. The digital agricultural transition in Era 4.0 can play a decisive role in dealing with these new agendas, where drones and sensors, big data, the internet of things and machine learning all have their inputs. In this context, the main objective of this study is to highlight insights from the literature on the relationships between machine learning and food security and their contributions to agricultural planning in the context of Agriculture 4.0. For this, a systematic review was carried out based on information from text and bibliographic data. The proposed objectives and methodologies represent an innovative approach, namely, the consideration of bibliometric evaluation as a support for a focused literature review related to the topics addressed here. The results of this research show the importance of the digital transition in agriculture to support better policy and planning design and address imbalances in food chains and agricultural markets. New technologies in Era 4.0 and their application through Climate-Smart Agriculture approaches are crucial for sustainable businesses (economically, socially and environmentally) and the food supply. Furthermore, for the interrelationships between machine learning and food security, the literature highlights the relevance of platforms and methods, such as, for example, Google Earth Engine and Random Forest. These and other approaches have been considered to predict crop yield (wheat, barley, rice, maize and soybean), abiotic stress, field biomass and crop mapping with high accuracy (R2 approximate to 0.99 and RMSE approximate to 1%).","[Pereira Domingues Martinho, Vitor Joao; Pato, Maria Lucia] Polytech Inst Viseu IPV, Agr Sch ESAV, P-3504510 Viseu, Portugal; [Pereira Domingues Martinho, Vitor Joao; Pato, Maria Lucia] Polytech Inst Viseu IPV, CERNAS IPV Res Ctr, P-3504510 Viseu, Portugal; [da Silva Cunha, Carlos Augusto; Lourenco Costa, Paulo Jorge] Polytech Inst Viseu IPV, Sch Technol & Management ESTGV, P-3504510 Viseu, Portugal; [da Silva Cunha, Carlos Augusto] Polytech Inst Viseu IPV, CISeD, P-3504510 Viseu, Portugal; [Sanchez-Carreira, Maria Carmen] Univ Santiago de Compostela, Fac Econ & Business, CRETUS Inst, Dept Appl Econ,ICEDE Res Grp, Santiago De Compostela 15782, Spain; [Georgantzis, Nikolaos] Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, Burgundy Sch Business, CEREN EA 7477, F-21000 Dijon, France; [Rodrigues, Raimundo Nonato] Univ Fed Pernambuco, Ctr Appl Social Sci, Dept Accounting & Actuarial Sci, BR-50740580 Recife, PE, Brazil; [Coronado, Freddy] Univ Chile, Fac Econ & Negocios, Santiago 8320000, Chile",Universidade de Santiago de Compostela; Burgundy School of Business; Universidade Federal de Pernambuco; Universidad de Chile,"Martinho, VJPD (corresponding author), Polytech Inst Viseu IPV, Agr Sch ESAV, P-3504510 Viseu, Portugal.;Martinho, VJPD (corresponding author), Polytech Inst Viseu IPV, CERNAS IPV Res Ctr, P-3504510 Viseu, Portugal.",vdmartinho@esav.ipv.pt,,"Georgantzis, Nikolaos/0000-0002-9697-5368; Sanchez Carreira, Maria del Carmen/0000-0001-9265-2521",CERNAS Research Centre; Polytechnic Institute of Viseu,CERNAS Research Centre; Polytechnic Institute of Viseu,"Furthermore, we would like to thank the CERNAS Research Centre and the Polytechnic Institute of Viseu for their support.",,85,0,0,0,0,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3417,,APPL SCI-BASEL,Appl.

However, there is a lack of academic commentary on how attempts at various decarbonisation methods reported in research articles have developed over the 21st century, particularly in line with the relevant policy and regulatory developments. This paper analyses how the shipping industry has decarbonised by utilising 294 papers from 2000 to 2020. By analysing 20 years' worth of research, this paper delivers a comprehensive review of shipping decarbonisation research and analyses the evolution of its themes as a function of time. It therefore aids to develop a greater understanding and comparison of governmental, economic and academic perspectives (and their potential alignment) for the industry to decarbonise. For 2017-20 the key shipping decarbonisation technologies were summarised and their advantages, disadvantages and current academic literature applications are revealed. Furthermore, the analysis of the evolution of shipping decarbonisation research themes reveals clear research gaps in the current literature and guides the development of a future research agenda with the prediction of future opportunities and potential for shipping decarbonisation research developments for the shipping industry.","[Romano, A.; Yang, Z.] Liverpool John Moores Univ, Liverpool Logist Offshore & Marine Res Inst, Liverpool, Merseyside, England",Liverpool John Moores University,"Yang, Z (corresponding author), Liverpool John Moores Univ, Liverpool Logist Offshore & Marine Res Inst, Liverpool, Merseyside, England.",z.yang@ljmu.ac.uk,"zhao, yang/GXF-4424-2022; yang, zaili/A-6493-2013","yang, zaili/0000-0003-1385-493X; Romano, Abbie/0000-0001-6016-8882",European Union's Interreg Atlantic Area programme through the European Regional Development Fund [EAPA_842/2018]; EU H2020 ERC-COG-2019 project [TRUST - 864724],European Union's Interreg Atlantic Area programme through the European Regional Development Fund; EU H2020 ERC-COG-2019 project,This project has received funding from the European Union's Interreg Atlantic Area programme through the European Regional Development Fund with project code: EAPA_842/2018.

The MFCS footprint includes 50% landscaping. The water used for irrigation is from non-clinical/non-potable water, treated condensate water, a by-product of air conditioning. For 5 months per year, there is a predicted non-potable water deficit, so costly and non-sustainable desalinated potable water is required for irrigation. The findings include that there is a non-potable water deficit due to an excessive consumption for landscape irrigation (LI) and water features (WF), and that 177,288 m(3) of condensate and desalinated water was wasted (equivalent to 71 Olympic swimming pools). The contribution of this research is to demonstrate that water wastage, a contributor to GHG emissions, is due to inadequate field testing and verification, water tank storage problems and a lack of LI and WF water demand management. Strategies to address these issues are suggested and will be useful to building owners, operations and maintenance teams and facility managers to substantially decrease water consumption in any type of buildings with a non-potable water system, as well as helping AD to achieve its target of a 22% reduction in GHG emissions by 2030 (Environment Agency- Abu Dhabi (EAD 2017)).","[Seguela, G.; Littlewood, J.

Solar energy is one of the best available alternatives, for it is both abundant and clean. Solar cell is an effective device for converting solar energy into electricity. Indonesia is located on the equator where the sunlight is always available in abundance throughout the year; therefore solar cell would become the main source of electrical energy in Indonesia. However, the high cost of inorganic solar cells in spite of their high power conversion efficiency (PCE) has been a major constrain for their mass utilization in Indonesia. The only way to reduce the cost of production and installation is to find other materials which offer low-cost and easy processing into solar cells. Polymer solar cells have been intensively investigated for high performance and low-cost solar cells. Today, 9-11% power conversion efficiency (PCE) of small area polymer solar cells and 2-4% PCE of large area or module solar cells are already achieved. However, for practical application and mass production, 10% or higher PCE of module solar cells is highly required. The main strategic issue for improving the PCE is to use blend of conjugated polymer-metal oxide nanocrystals as active materials for hybrid solar cells, due to the good combination of the versatile solution processability of conjugated polymers and high charge carrier mobility of metal-oxide nanocrystals. In this paper, current development of hybrid solar cells worldwide and future research challenges in Indonesia will be discussed.","Padjadjaran State Univ, Dept Phys, Jatinangor Sumedang 45363, Indonesia",Universitas Padjadjaran,"Bahtiar, A (corresponding author), Padjadjaran State Univ, Dept Phys, Jl Raya Bandung Sumedang KM 21, Jatinangor Sumedang 45363, Indonesia.",ayi.bahtiar@phys.unpad.ac.id,"Bahtiar, Ayi/K-2729-2019","Bahtiar, Ayi/0000-0002-0275-7846",,,,,57,1,1,0,7,AMER INST PHYSICS,MELVILLE,"2 HUNTINGTON QUADRANGLE, STE 1NO1, MELVILLE, NY 11747-4501 USA",0094-243X,,978-0-7354-1180-7,AIP CONF PROC,,,2013,,,,,12,19,,10.1063/1.4820274,http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4820274,,,8,"Geochemistry & Geophysics; Physics, Applied; Physics, Multidisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Geochemistry & Geophysics; Physics,BA0KI,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000331605700003,View Full Record in Web of Science

The assessment was based on the published literature in the field of 'smart' facade retrofits for energy performance upgrades on existing buildings and the benefits and challenges therein. It also investigates the available technologies, which can increase energy performance efficiency. This can be used as a possible retrofit tool for implementation on existing office buildings, aiming at an increase of the building's energy performance. It was concluded that near 'Zero-Energy Building' status was not achievable solely through facade retrofits. Retrofit schemes can, however, succeed in the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, in correlation with environmental goals of many countries worldwide and the European Union. Furthermore, the climate in south-eastern Europe and in the Mediterranean region presents a set of challenges for all forms and types of passive facade technologies, especially during the summer.","[Panopoulos, K.] Int Hellen Univ, Sch Sci & Technol, Thessaloniki, Greece; [Papadopoulos, A.

This is especially true for forest trees which are a dominant life form on Earth and play a central role in supporting diverse communities and structuring a wide range of ecosystems. In Europe, it is expected that most forest tree species will not be able to migrate North fast enough to follow the estimated temperature isocline shift given current predictions for rapid climate warming. In this context, a topical question for forest genetics research is to quantify the ability for tree species to adapt locally to strongly altered environmental conditions (Kremer etal. ). Identifying environmental factors driving local adaptation is, however, a major challenge for evolutionary biology and ecology in general but is particularly difficult in trees given their large individual and population size and long generation time. Empirical evaluation of local adaptation in trees has traditionally relied on fastidious long-term common garden experiments (provenance trials) now supplemented by reference genome sequence analysis for a handful of economically valuable species. However, such resources have been lacking for most tree species despite their ecological importance in supporting whole ecosystems. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, De Kort etal. () provide original and convincing empirical evidence of local adaptation to temperature in black alder, Alnus glutinosa L. Gaertn, a surprisingly understudied keystone species supporting riparian ecosystems. Here, De Kort etal. () use an innovative empirical approach complementing state-of-the-art landscape genomics analysis of A.glutinosa populations sampled in natura across a regional climate gradient with phenotypic trait assessment in a common garden experiment (Fig. ). By combining the two methods, De Kort etal. () were able to detect unequivocal association between temperature and phenotypic traits such as leaf size as well as with genetic loci putatively under divergent selection for temperature. The research by De Kort etal. () provides valuable insight into adaptive response to temperature variation for an ecologically important species and demonstrates the usefulness of an integrated approach for empirical evaluation of local adaptation in nonmodel species (Sork etal. 2013 ).","[Lepais, Olivier] INRA, UMR Ecol Comportementale & Biol Populat Poissons, F-64310 St Pee Sur Nivelle, France; [Lepais, Olivier] Univ Pau & Pays Adour, UMR Ecol Comportementale & Biol Populat Poissons, UFR Sci & Tech Cote Basque, F-64600 Anglet, France; [Bacles, Cecile F.] Univ Pau & Pays Adour, UFR Sci & Tech, Dept Biol, F-64000 Pau, France",INRAE; Universite de Pau et des Pays de l'Adour; Universite de Pau et des Pays de l'Adour; Universite de Pau et des Pays de l'Adour,"Lepais, O (corresponding author), INRA, UMR Ecol Comportementale & Biol Populat Poissons, F-64310 St Pee Sur Nivelle, France.",olepais@st-pee.inra.fr,"Bacles, Cecile FE/D-3093-2010; Lepais, Olivier/D-1849-2009","Bacles, Cecile FE/0000-0002-1061-1898; Lepais, Olivier/0000-0002-6102-9478",,,,,10,17,18,2,130,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0962-1083,1365-294X,,MOL ECOL,Mol.

The magnitude of the data determined the visual and aural form of the virtual experience, creating environmentally responsive representations that enabled participants to readily see and interpret how the atmosphere was affecting the native forest in their neighborhood.","[Coulson, Guy; Olivares, Gustavo] Natl Inst Water & Atmospher Res, Private Bag 99940, Auckland 1149, New Zealand; [Jowsey, Susan] Auckland Univ Technol, Sch Art & Design, Private Bag 92006, Auckland 1142, New Zealand; [Williams, Marcus] Unitec Inst Technol, Private Bag 92025,Victoria St West, Auckland 1142, New Zealand",National Institute of Water & Atmospheric Research (NIWA) - New Zealand; Auckland University of Technology; Unitec NZ,"Coulson, G (corresponding author), Natl Inst Water & Atmospher Res, Private Bag 99940, Auckland 1149, New Zealand.",guy.coulson@niwa.co.nz; sue.jowsey@aut.ac.nz; mwilliams@unitec.ac.nz; gustavo.olivares@niwa.co.nz,"Olivares, Gustavo/H-2699-2019","Olivares, Gustavo/0000-0001-8045-216X; Jowsey, Susan/0000-0003-2657-1111",New Zealand Ministry of Business Innovation and Employment Unlocking Curious Minds contestable science fund; Te Uru Waitakere Contemporary Gallery Education Team,"New Zealand Ministry of Business Innovation and Employment Unlocking Curious Minds contestable science fund(New Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE)); Te Uru Waitakere Contemporary Gallery Education Team","We acknowledge Diane Blomfield, the curator of TEMP 2017, who brokered the Air relationship between F4 Collective and NIWA; Roy Davies at Imersia; the Te Uru Waitakere Contemporary Gallery Education Team; and the New Zealand Ministry of Business Innovation and Employment Unlocking Curious Minds contestable science fund for their support and contributions to this project.",,7,0,0,2,7,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",0024-094X,1530-9282,,LEONARDO,Leonardo,APR,2021,2,,,,215,219,,10.1162/leon_a_01789,http://dx.doi.org/10.1162/leon_a_01789,,,5,Art,Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;HCI),Art,SU9ED,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000663432000014,View Full Record in Web of Science

The observed trends show a significant increase in building energy use, especially in emerging economies. Counteracting these trends is absolutely essential, especially in the light of urbanisation, population growth and changing lifestyles. In terms of mitigating the climate impact of buildings, ensuring high levels of efficiency (i.e. very low energy needs, especially for heating and cooling) has the greatest potential for saving energy and emissions, and is at the same time the prerequisite for effective use of energy from renewable sources. Clearly defined targets and suitable metrics are essential to enable appropriate design decisions. Implemented projects clearly indicate that quality assured design and construction lead to reliable in-use energy performance. Effective policy packages to address opportunities and challenges are important drivers to support the uptake of state-of-the-art efficiency measures in the urban building sector.","[Grove-Smith, Jessica; Schnieders, Juergen] Passivhaus Inst, Rheinstr 44-46, D-64283 Darmstadt, Germany; [Aydin, Vera; Thomas, Stefan] Wuppertal Inst Climate Environm & Energy, Doppersberg 19, D-42103 Wuppertal, Germany; [Feist, Wolfgang] Univ Innsbruck, Inst Konstrukt & Mat Wissensch, Technikerstr 19a, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria",University of Innsbruck,"Grove-Smith, J (corresponding author), Passivhaus Inst, Rheinstr 44-46, D-64283 Darmstadt, Germany.",jessica.grovesmith@passiv.de,,,,,,,111,13,13,1,23,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1877-3435,1877-3443,,CURR OPIN ENV SUST,Curr.

In the scenario of a collective-risk social dilemma, a group of players have to collectively contribute to a public fund to prevent the tragedy of the commons, such as dangerous climate change, because everybody will lose all their remaining money when the damage happens with a certain probability if the group fails to reach a fixed fundraising target. Yet, it remains largely unclear how the group size affects the probability of reaching the collective target and the mechanism that drives different outcomes of the collective cooperation. Here, we contribute to the literature by exploring the role of group size in the collective-risk social dilemma and the potential underlying mechanism using both model simulations and human experiments. Through simulations we found that the rate of failure for collective cooperation increases for larger groups, along with the arising of bystander effect and a decrease in average contributions, which are confirmed by our experimental observations. We further analyze the patterns of investment behaviors in the experiment setting by categorizing players into cooperators, altruists, and free riders using both a clustering method and a golden standard. We found that altruists who tend to contribute more, rather than cooperators who prefer contributing a fair-share investment, play a crucial role in groups with success outcome in early and/or middle stages of the game. Our results indicate that bystanders are dynamic and their amount depends on the contribution of others. When others contribute less, bystanders also contribute less. If the collective goal is unlikely to achieve, more players choose to be bystanders who strategically contribute less, intriguing the failure of the collective goal. Our findings suggest a potentially effective way to solve the collective-risk social dilemma by reducing the bystander effect through the mechanism design of forming small groups.

Much of this article will consider three of the most pervasive of the current disruptions as disruptions of living and feeling: climate change, social change, and, in more detail, what I will call a 'third media revolution'. All three of these disruptions (and many others) are themselves multiple. They all fold through each other. Living and feeling thus find themselves in the midst of catastrophic multiplicity. This catastrophic multiplicity haunts much of what's going on. Questions concerning what can be felt within this folding of catastrophes into each other are important contemporary questions. Feeling itself - what it is, what it does, and what the future of feeling might be - has become both a field of struggle, and a complex and open-ended question. A secondary set of questions here will concern the future of studies in relation to these questions of living and feeling -of Cultural Studies, Media Studies, disciplinarity in general, and finally 'study', as discussed by Moten and Harney (2013.

The performance assessment of GCMs has received significant attention in recent years for reliable estimation of future climate. Even though many approaches have been trialled in the ranking of GCMs for the selection of an appropriate ensemble, there is still a need to explore the potential of the state-of-the-art ranking approaches for a more dependable selection of GCMs suitable for a given task, over a region of interest. The present study assessed the potential of a state-of-the-art feature selection method known as Symmetrical Uncertainty (SU) in ranking 20 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) GCMs based on their ability to simulate monthly precipitation and the monthly average of daily maximum and minimum temperature for annual, monsoon and winter seasons. The performance of GCMs was assessed using gridded climate data obtained from Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC), Climatic Research Unit (CRU) and Princeton Global Meteorological Forcing dataset (Prin) over the period 1961-2005 considering Pakistan as the study area. The ranks obtained with SU were compared with those obtained using two well-established ranking approaches; (1) Compromise Programming (CP) and (2) Wavelet-based Skill Score (WSS). According to the results of this study, for the simulation of all the three climate variables in all seasons; CESM1-CAM5, HadGEM2-AO, NorESIVM1-M and HadGEM2-ES were identified as the best GCMs by SU, whereas CESM1-CAM5, HadGEM2-AO, NorESM1-M and GFDL-CM3 were identified as the best GCMs by CP, and CCSM4, CESM1-CAM5, GFDL-ESM2G and HadGEM2-ES by WSS. The comparison of ranks of GCMs obtained using the same ranking approach but based on different gridded data products showed more or less similar ranks for a given GCM. However, the differences were noticeable when the ranking was conducted with the same gridded data but employing different ranking approaches. The approach presented in this study can be extended to any number of GCMs and can be applied over any region, for the identification of the best performing ensemble of GCMs for a set of climate variables.","[Ahmed, Kamal; Shahid, Shamsuddin] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Civil Engn, Johor Baharu 81310, Malaysia; [Ahmed, Kamal; Nawaz, Nadeem] Lasbela Univ Agr Water & Marine Sci, Fac Water Resource Management, Balochistan, Pakistan; [Sachindra, D.

In the first stage of the study, an inventory of the areas affected by floods was made in the study area, and a number of 205 flood points were identified. Further, 12 flood predictors were selected to be used for final susceptibility mapping. The six models' training was performed by using 70% of the total flood points that have been associated with the values of flood predictors. The highest accuracy (0.973) was obtained by the RF model, while J48 had the lowest performance (0.825). Besides, by classifying flood predictors' values in flood and non-flood pixels, the six flood susceptibility maps were made. High and very high flood susceptibility values cover between 17.71% (MLP) and 27.93% (ANFIS) of the study area. The validation of the results, performed using the ROC Curve, shows that the most accurate flood susceptibility values are also assigned to the RF model (AUC = 0.996).","[Costache, Romulus] Transilvania Univ Brasov, Dept Civil Engn, Brasov, Romania; [Arabameri, Alireza] Tarbiat Modares Univ, Dept Geomorphol, Tehran, Iran; [Elkhrachy, Ismail] Najran Univ, Coll Engn, Civil Engn Dept, Najran, Saudi Arabia; [Elkhrachy, Ismail] Al Azhar Univ, Fac Engn, Civil Engn Dept, Cairo, Egypt; [Ghorbanzadeh, Omid] Univ Salzburg, Dept Geoinformat Z GIS, Salzburg, Austria; [Quoc Bao Pham] Ton Duc Thang Univ, Environm Qual Atmospher Sci & Climate Change Res, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Quoc Bao Pham] Ton Duc Thang Univ, Fac Environm & Labour Safety, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam",Transylvania University of Brasov; Tarbiat Modares University; Najran University; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Al Azhar University; Salzburg University; Ton Duc Thang University; Ton Duc Thang University,"Ghorbanzadeh, O (corresponding author), Univ Salzburg, Dept Geoinformat Z GIS, Salzburg, Austria.",omid.ghorbanzadeh@stud.sbg.ac.at,"Pham, Quoc Bao/AAD-5611-2020; Elkhrachy, Ismail/J-1358-2019; Ghorbanzadeh, Omid/ACX-0397-2022; Costache, Romulus/O-2843-2019; Costache, Romulus/GVU-1762-2022","Pham, Quoc Bao/0000-0002-0468-5962; Elkhrachy, Ismail/0000-0001-9766-779X; Ghorbanzadeh, Omid/0000-0002-9664-8770; Costache, Romulus/0000-0002-6876-8572; ",Open Access Funding of Austrian Science Fund (FWF) through the GIScience Doctoral College [DK W 1237-N23],Open Access Funding of Austrian Science Fund (FWF) through the GIScience Doctoral College(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)),This research is partly funded by the Open Access Funding of Austrian Science Fund (FWF) through the GIScience Doctoral College (DK W 1237-N23).,,99,10,10,5,27,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1947-5705,1947-5713,,GEOMAT NAT HAZ RISK,Geomat.

The model specifies a computationally convenient covariance structure that depends on heterogeneous geography. Widely used statistical models on a spherical domain are non-stationary for different latitudes, but stationary at the same latitude (axial symmetry). This assumption has been acknowledged to be too restrictive for quantities such as surface temperature, whose statistical behaviour is influenced by large-scale geographical descriptors such as land and ocean. We propose an evolutionary spectrum approach that can account for different regimes across the Earth's geography and results in a more general and flexible class of models that vastly outperforms axially symmetric models and captures longitudinal patterns that would otherwise be assumed constant. The model can be estimated with a multistep conditional likelihood approximation that preserves the non-stationary features while allowing for easily distributed computations: we show how the model can be fitted to more than 20 million data points in less than 1 day on a state of the art workstation. The resulting estimates from the statistical model can be regarded as a synthetic description (i.e. a compression) of the space-time characteristics of an entire initial condition ensemble.","[Castruccio, Stefano] Newcastle Univ, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England; [Guinness, Joseph] North Carolina State Univ, Raleigh, NC USA",Newcastle University - UK; University of North Carolina; North Carolina State University,"Castruccio, S (corresponding author), Newcastle Univ, Sch Math & Stat, Herschel Bldg, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England.",stefano.castruccio@ncl.ac.uk,"Castruccio, Stefano/AAE-2788-2021",,"National Science Foundation, Division of Mathematical Sciences [1406016]","National Science Foundation, Division of Mathematical Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF))","We acknowledge the World Climate Research Programme's Working Group on Coupled Modelling, which is responsible for the Coupled model intercomparison project', and we thank the National Center for Atmospheric Research for producing and making available their model output.

These cores were analyzed and compared with meteorological data (air temperature, precipitation, and wind) from climate stations in the study area. Comparison of metrological data from four stations shows similar climate fluctuations. When the temperature was high, less precipitation occurred in general. The sedimentary features measured in this study were water content, organic matter, carbonate, amorphous silica contents, whole and mineral grain size, and grain density. Excess Pb-210 measurements were used to estimate sedimentary ages. According to principal component analysis (PCA), temperature correlates well to sediment characteristics in Olgoy Lake. Whole and mineral grain sizes are coarser when the temperature is high, while the amorphous-silica concentration is lower. A coarse grain size is interpreted to reflect low lake levels due to evaporation under high temperature with less precipitation. Amorphous silica may be from surrounding plants and reflects less vegetation when the temperature is high. However, in the recent 30 years, after the social system changed and overgrazing became a problem, the amount of amorphous silica has positively correlated with temperature on a short time scale. In the past 30 years, with less vegetation, amorphous silica has mainly come from weathered mineral particles. High temperature caused a thick, weathered mantle for each mineral particle, resulting in high amorphous-silica concentration. In Boontsagaan Lake, whole and mineral grain sizes are coarser when the wind speed is increased. Low precipitation correlates with a decrease in organic matter and an increase in carbonate and amorphous silica. In Orog Lake, it is difficult to establish an age model due to dried-up events. Some fluctuations in sedimentary characteristics may correspond to extreme events, such as earthquakes, and natural hazards, such as dzuds (harsh winters).","[Udaanjargal, Uyangaa; Gankhurel, Baasansuren] Kanazawa Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Kanazawa, Ishikawa 9201192, Japan; [Hasebe, Noriko; Fukushi, Keisuke; Ochiai, Shinya; Miyata, Yoshiki] Kanazawa Univ, Inst Nat & Environm Technol, Kanazawa, Ishikawa 9201192, Japan; [Davaasuren, Davaadorj; Gerelmaa, Tuvshin] Natl Univ Mongolia, Dept Geog, Sch Art & Sci, Ulaanbaatar 210646, Mongolia; [Tanaka, Yukiya] Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Geog, Coll Sci, 26 Kyunghee Daero, Seoul 02447, South Korea; [Katsuta, Nagayoshi] Gifu Univ, Fac Educ, Gifu 5011193, Japan; [Miyata, Yoshiki] Univ Tokyo, Univ Museum, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1130033, Japan",Kanazawa University; Kanazawa University; National University of Mongolia; Kyung Hee University; Gifu University; University of Tokyo,"Udaanjargal, U (corresponding author), Kanazawa Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Kanazawa, Ishikawa 9201192, Japan.;Hasebe, N (corresponding author), Kanazawa Univ, Inst Nat & Environm Technol, Kanazawa, Ishikawa 9201192, Japan.",uyangaa_2134@yahoo.com; hasebe@staff.kanazawa-u.ac.jp; davaadorj@num.edu.mn; fukushi@staff.kanazawa-u.ac.jp; ytanaka@khu.ac.kr; baaska_0310@yahoo.com; nkatsuta@gifu-u.ac.jp; sochiai@se.kanazawa-u.ac.jp; yoshikimiyata@se.kanazawa-u.ac.jp; tuvshincr7@yahoo.com,"Fukushi, Keisuke/C-4827-2015; Gankhurel, Baasansuren/D-6268-2016","Fukushi, Keisuke/0000-0003-0398-8950; Gankhurel, Baasansuren/0000-0002-9371-6168; Davaasuren, Davaadorj/0000-0001-9638-6793","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (KAKENHI) [16H05643]; Institute of Nature and Environmental Technology at Kanazawa University [7, 30]; Mongolian-Japanese Engineering Education Development Project [J11A15]","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (KAKENHI)(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Institute of Nature and Environmental Technology at Kanazawa University; Mongolian-Japanese Engineering Education Development Project","FundingThis study is supported by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (KAKENHI Grant 16H05643), a cooperative research program of the Institute of Nature and Environmental Technology at Kanazawa University (No. 7, 2015; No. 30, 2016) and the Mongolian-Japanese Engineering Education Development Project (No. J11A15).",,64,1,1,0,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3263,,GEOSCIENCES,Geosciences,JAN,2022,1,,,,,,7,10.3390/geosciences12010007,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/geosciences12010007,,,22,"Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Geology,ZD4NA,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000758175000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

A number of landscapes have undergone dramatic and unprecedented landscape changes over the past decade including, the Wright Lower Glacier (Wright Valley) ablated several tens of meters, the Garwood River (Garwood Valley) has incised >3 m into massive ice permafrost, smaller streams in Taylor Valley (Crescent, Lawson, and Lost Seal Streams) have experienced extensive down-cutting and/or bank undercutting, and Canada Glacier (Taylor Valley) has formed sheer, >4 meter deep canyons. The commonality between all these landscape changes appears to be sediment on ice acting as a catalyst for melting, including ice-cement permafrost thaw. We attribute these changes to increasing solar radiation over the past decade despite no significant trend in summer air temperature. To infer possible future landscape changes in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, due to anticipated climate warming, we map 'at risk' landscapes defined as those with buried massive ice in relative warm regions of the valleys. Results show that large regions of the valley bottoms are 'at risk'. Changes in surface topography will trigger important responses in hydrology, geochemistry, and biological community structure and function. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

A set of 14 models participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) is selected and two experiments are analysed, namely initialized decadal hindcasts and forced historical simulations. Considering the strong linkage of the atmospheric circulation signatures over West Africa with the rainfall variability, this study aims to investigate the potential of using wind fields for decadal predictions. Namely, a West African monsoon index (WAMI) is defined, based on the coherence of low (925 hPa) and high (200 hPa) troposphere wind fields, which accounts for the intensity of the monsoonal circulation. A combined empirical orthogonal functions analysis is applied to explore the wind fields' covariance modes, and a set of indices is defined on the basis of the identified patterns. The WAMI predictive skill is assessed by comparing WAMI from coupled models with WAMI from reanalysis products and with a standardized precipitation index (SPI) from observations. Results suggest that the predictive skill is highly model dependent and it is strongly related to the WAMI definition. In addition, hindcasts are more skilful than historical simulations in both deterministic and probability forecasts, which suggests an added value of initialization for decadal predictability. Moreover, coupled models are more skilful in predicting the observed SPI than the WAMI obtained from reanalysis. WAMI performance is also compared with decadal predictions from CMIP5 models based on a Sahelian precipitation index, and an improvement in predictive skill is observed in some models when WAMI is used. Therefore, we conclude that dynamics-based indices are potentially more effective for decadal prediction of precipitation in Sahel than precipitation-based indices for those models in which Sahel rainfall variability is not well simulated. We thus recommend a two-fold approach when testing the performance of models in predicting Sahel rainfall, based not only on rainfall but also on the dynamics of the West African monsoon.","[Otero, Noelia] Inst Adv Sustainabil Studies, Potsdam, Germany; [Mohino, Elsa] Univ Complutense Madrid, Dpto Fis Tierra Astron & Astrofis 1, Madrid, Spain; [Gaetani, Marco] UPMC, Sorbonne Univ, CNRS, LATMOS IPSL, Paris, France; [Gaetani, Marco] UVSQ, Paris, France",Complutense University of Madrid; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Universite Paris Cite; Universite Paris Saclay; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay,"Otero, N (corresponding author), Inst Adv Sustainabil Studies, Potsdam, Germany.",Noelia.OteroFelipe@iass-potsdam.de,"Mohino, Elsa/G-8620-2015; Gaetani, Marco/AAQ-7802-2020","Mohino, Elsa/0000-0002-4342-6349; Gaetani, Marco/0000-0003-2923-6773; Otero, Noelia/0000-0003-3217-3945",European Union [603521]; Spanish Project [CGL2012-38923-C02-01],European Union(European Commission); Spanish Project(Spanish Government),"We thank the two anonymous reviewers for the comments and suggestions, which helped us improve the manuscript.

Our findings provide independent empirical evidence about the anthropogenic influence on the observed warming trend in different regions of the world.

Recent government policy has focussed on increasing farm productivity. One of the challenges for achieving this, especially for rain-fed agriculture, is improving local-scale information on current and forecast future soil water status. Reliable soil water forecasts will allow users to better predict likely future water availability and make better informed farming decisions over timescales from days to seasons. This paper explores the state-of-the-art of the components that need to be brought together to transition our research knowledge into operational soil water forecasts, and the challenges that lie therein. Achieving operational agricultural soil water forecasts requires bringing together a diverse range of components, including: Long-term soil water monitoring - high quality profile soil water monitoring datasets extend to 10 years for some sites, while remote sensing data for surface (< 5cm) soil water extends to fifteen years and beyond. These provide fundamental data against which soil water simulation 'hindcasts' and forecasting methods can be developed and tested. Remote sensing and data assimilation - the resolution, frequency, quantity, and inter-product consistency of remote observations relevant to modelling of soil water is increasing. This includes dedicated satellites for soil water. Current technology, techniques, and infrastructure provide the capability to assimilate such data into soil water models on an ongoing operational basis. These datasets can improve both forecasting methods, by bounding hindcast predictions, and operational forecasts, by providing good initial conditions for predictions. Rainfall and temperature forecasts - multi-week to multi-season climate forecasts are a critical driver of soil water forecasts. These are currently produced weekly as daily ensemble (probabilistic) forecasts over a 250 km grid out to 270 days ahead, with significantly diminishing skill (accuracy) beyond about 3 months. Limited research to increase the resolution and skill of these forecasts is underway, with a focus on agricultural applications. Operational improvements, including increased spatial resolution, will occur in the near future. Soil water modelling - Operational earth system forecasting models and crop growth models are both capable of producing soil water as outputs. Each operates at extremes of the global spatial scale (landscape versus point-scale). Their skill to produce explicit probabilistic soil water forecasts as ensembles has yet to be fully evaluated. There is also a challenge to determine the best approaches to take advantage of, and integrate, rainfall forecasts, remote observations, and local scale soil and management information. Local scale inputs - The ability of soil to store water and make it available to plants varies widely. Local information on soil type and properties, soil water observations, and crop management increases the relevance of forecasts. They can also increase forecast accuracy by tuning the down-scaling of broad-scale forecasts to local conditions. Farm-scale monitoring and communication technologies have now matured to the point where they offer significant potential as a key input to the localisation of forecasts. Integrating and maturing these components in a structured and strategic manner is required for us to achieve the goal of useful operational seasonal forecasting of agricultural soil water in Australia.","[Argent, R.

Aiming to retrieve data of high spatial resolution, mobile monitoring techniques have been introduced and applied within various urban contexts around the globe. Mobile monitoring campaigns may indeed contribute toward a high-granularity evaluation of the intra-urban characteristics of each city. In addition, it can help exploit resiliency planning at different aggregation levels when implemented in conjunction with traditional monitoring systems, such as fixed stations and satellites. Under this scenario, this study presents for the first time a systematic and critical review of the recent and most comprehensive mobile monitoring systems, and the corresponding field campaigns and protocols followed. The reviewed monitoring systems are developed on either motorized (e.g. cars, vans) or non-motorized (e.g. bicycles, carts, humans) agents for measuring the main parameters regulating urban canopy layers with respect to the (i) hygrothermal environment, (ii) air quality, (iii) light pollution, (iv) noise pollution. Overall, 94 articles are analyzed for concluding to the current state of the art, the corresponding scientific gaps, and proposed future research paths. Most of the reported monitoring systems are developed to monitor only one environmental domain, while the lack of standardized monitoring protocols is found to be the biggest challenge that needs to be addressed for minimizing biases and rendering the outcomes of different studies comparable. Relevant technological advancements and human-centric frameworks are further discussed aiming to exploit mobile monitoring for establishing efficient decision-making and risk assessment within urban environments.","[Kousis, I.; Pisello, A.

There is a tendency in literature to avoid reporting model performance assessments in places, or on time horizons, where it is known that the models have low performance. Usual bias and spreading statistical indicators are useful tools but taking proper decision by managers of funding agencies and policy makers requires usage of additional error measures. Several classes of forecasting models have been compared: persistence, classical statistics, machine learning, cloud-motion tracking, numerical weather prediction and hybrid models (combining classical statistics with machine learning approach and/or exogenous inputs). Forecasting errors increase by increasing the time-horizon. Forecasting model performance depends on time-horizon and climate. Machine learning and hybrid models have the best performance for intra-hour performance in all climates. The best intra-hour forecasts are provided in all climates by machine learning and classical statistics models while the hybrid models perform well in tropical and snow climates. For day-ahead forecasts the hybrid models have very good performance in all climates. Generally, the hybrid models have the best performance. The accuracy of the forecasting models significantly increased in the last decade. The normalized MBE and RMSE have been reduced by two thirds and one third, respectively. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

A new machine learning tool for sea ice forecasting offers a substantial increase in accuracy over current physics-based dynamical model predictions. Anthropogenic warming has led to an unprecedented year-round reduction in Arctic sea ice extent. This has far-reaching consequences for indigenous and local communities, polar ecosystems, and global climate, motivating the need for accurate seasonal sea ice forecasts. While physics-based dynamical models can successfully forecast sea ice concentration several weeks ahead, they struggle to outperform simple statistical benchmarks at longer lead times. We present a probabilistic, deep learning sea ice forecasting system, IceNet. The system has been trained on climate simulations and observational data to forecast the next 6 months of monthly-averaged sea ice concentration maps. We show that IceNet advances the range of accurate sea ice forecasts, outperforming a state-of-the-art dynamical model in seasonal forecasts of summer sea ice, particularly for extreme sea ice events. This step-change in sea ice forecasting ability brings us closer to conservation tools that mitigate risks associated with rapid sea ice loss.","[Andersson, Tom R.; Hosking, J.

In this study, we explore the influence of weakening and strengthening of the polar vortex on regional Antarctic sea ice in observations and model simulations. We propose a two-stage mechanism that translates stratospheric harbingers to sea ice changes: (a) it starts with polar vortex variability that is highly correlated with the Amundsen Sea Low (ASL); through modulation of the ASL and thus surface winds, (b) weak polar vortex leads to statistically significant decrease of sea ice over the Ross Sea and increase of sea ice around the Antarctic Peninsula, and vice versa. The two-stage mechanism can be detected in observations and state-of-the-art model simulations, confirming a robust chain of response. This study underlines the importance of stratosphere-troposphere coupling on the Antarctic sea ice variability and its seasonal predictability.","[Wang, Shaoyin; Cheng, Xiao; Hui, Fengming] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Geospatial Engn & Sci, Zhuhai, Peoples R China; [Wang, Shaoyin; Cheng, Xiao; Hui, Fengming] Southern Marine Sci & Engn Guangdong Lab Zhuhai, Zhuhai, Peoples R China; [Wang, Shaoyin; Cheng, Xiao; Hui, Fengming] Univ Corp Polar Res, Zhuhai, Peoples R China; [Liu, Jiping] SUNY Albany, Dept Atmospher & Environm Sci, Albany, NY 12222 USA; [Kerzenmacher, Tobias; Braesicke, Peter] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Karlsruhe, Germany; [Hu, Yongyun] Peking Univ, Sch Phys, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China",Sun Yat Sen University; Southern Marine Science & Engineering Guangdong Laboratory; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Albany; Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; Peking University,"Wang, SY (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Geospatial Engn & Sci, Zhuhai, Peoples R China.;Wang, SY (corresponding author), Southern Marine Sci & Engn Guangdong Lab Zhuhai, Zhuhai, Peoples R China.;Wang, SY (corresponding author), Univ Corp Polar Res, Zhuhai, Peoples R China.",wangshy96@mail.sysu.edu.cn,"Kerzenmacher, Tobias/AGN-7243-2022; Braesicke, Peter/D-8330-2016; Hu, Yongyun/B-6786-2016","Kerzenmacher, Tobias/0000-0001-8413-0539; Braesicke, Peter/0000-0003-1423-0619; Hu, Yongyun/0000-0002-4003-4630; Wang, Shaoyin/0000-0003-4742-4719",National Key R&D Program of China [2018YFA0605901]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41830536],National Key R&D Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),We thank two anonymous reviewers for their valuable and constructive comments.

This has led to the recent explosion of future scenario analyses at multiple scales, further accelerated since the development of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) research community Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) and Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). While RCPs have been widely applied to climate models to produce dimate scenarios at multiple scales for investigating climate change impacts, adaptation and vulnerabilities (CCIAV), SSPs are only recently being scaled for different geographical and sectoral applications. This is seen in the UK where significant investment has produced the RCP-based UK Climate Projections (UKCP18), but no equivalent UK version of the SSPs exists. We address this need by developing a set of multi-driver qualitative and quantitative UK-SSPs, following a state-of-the-art scenario methodology that integrates national stakeholder knowledge on locally-relevant drivers and indicators with higher level information from European and global SSPs. This was achieved through an intensive participatory process that facilitated the combination of bottom-up and top-down approaches to develop a set of UK-specific SSPs that are locally comprehensive, yet consistent with the global and European SSPs. The resulting scenarios balance the importance of consistency and legitimacy, demonstrating that divergence is not necessarily the result of inconsistency, nor comes as a choice to contextualise narratives at the appropriate scale.

The DH18 event had severe impacts on ecosystems and likely affected vegetation activity in the subsequent year, for example through depletion of carbon reserves or damage from drought. Such legacies from drought and heat stress can further increase vegetation susceptibility to additional hazards. Temporally compound extremes such as DH18 and DH19 can, therefore, result in an amplification of impacts due to preconditioning effects of past disturbance legacies. Here, we evaluate how these two consecutive extreme summers impacted ecosystems in central Europe and how the vegetation responses to the first compound event (DH18) modulated the impacts of the second (DH19). To quantify changes in vegetation vulnerability to each compound event, we first train a set of statistical models for the period 2001-2017, which are then used to predict the impacts of DH18 and DH19 on enhanced vegetation index (EVI) anomalies from MODIS. These estimates correspond to expected EVI anomalies in DH18 and DH19 based on past sensitivity to climate. Large departures from the predicted values can indicate changes in vulnerability to dry and hot conditions and be used to identify modulating effects by vegetation activity and composition or other environmental factors on observed impacts. We find two regions in which the impacts of the two compound dry and hot (DH) events were significantly stronger than those expected based on previous climate-vegetation relationships. One region, largely dominated by grasslands and crops, showed much stronger impacts than expected in both DH events due to an amplification of their sensitivity to heat and drought, possibly linked to changing background CO2 and temperature conditions. A second region, dominated by forests and grasslands, showed browning from DH18 to DH19, even though dry and hot conditions were partly alleviated in 2019. This browning trajectory was mainly explained by the preconditioning role of DH18 on the impacts of DH19 due to interannual legacy effects and possibly by increased susceptibility to biotic disturbances, which are also promoted by warm conditions. Dry and hot summers are expected to become more frequent in the coming decades, posing a major threat to the stability of European forests. We show that state-of-the-art process-based models could not represent the decline in response to DH19 because they missed the interannual legacy effects from DH18 impacts. These gaps may result in an overestimation of the resilience and stability of temperate ecosystems in future model projections.","[Bastos, Ana; Orth, Rene; Reichstein, Markus; Zaehle, Sonke; Sungmin, O.] Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, Hans Knoll Str 10, D-07745 Jena, Germany; [Ciais, Philippe; Viovy, Nicolas] Lab Sci Climat & Environm, Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Anthoni, Peter; Arneth, Almut] KIT, Atmospher Environm Res, D-82467 Garmisch Partenkirchen, Germany; [Gentine, Pierre] Columbia Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Engn, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Gentine, Pierre] Columbia Univ, Earth Inst & Data Sci Inst, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Joetzjer, Emilie] Univ Toulouse, CNRS, CNRM, Meteo France, Toulouse, France; [Lienert, Sebastian; Pongratz, Julia] Univ Bern, Phys Inst, Climate & Environm Phys, Bern, Switzerland; [Lienert, Sebastian; Pongratz, Julia] Univ Bern, Oeschger Ctr Climate Change Res, Bern, Switzerland; [Loughran, Tammas] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Dept Geog, Luisenstr 37, D-80333 Munich, Germany; [McGuire, Patrick C.] Univ Reading, Dept Geog Environm Sci, Dept Meteorol, Reading RG6 6BB, Berks, England; [McGuire, Patrick C.] Univ Reading, Natl Ctr Atmospher Sci, Reading RG6 6BB, Berks, England; [Sitch, Stephen] Univ Exeter, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Exeter EX4 4RJ, Devon, England",Max Planck Society; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; CEA; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; Columbia University; Columbia University; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); University of Bern; University of Bern; University of Munich; University of Reading; UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); NERC National Centre for Atmospheric Science; University of Reading; University of Exeter,"Bastos, A (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, Hans Knoll Str 10, D-07745 Jena, Germany.",abastos@bgc-jena.mpg.de,"Bastos, Ana/G-2927-2013; Orth, Rene/AAF-9279-2022; Orth, Rene/AFK-1975-2022; Joetzjer, Emilie/AAE-9799-2022; Gentine, Pierre/C-1495-2013; Reichstein, Markus/A-7494-2011; Zaehle, Sönke/C-9528-2017; Sitch, Stephen A/F-8034-2015; Joetzjer, Emilie/AFF-1116-2022; viovy, nicolas/S-2631-2018","Bastos, Ana/0000-0002-7368-7806; Gentine, Pierre/0000-0002-0845-8345; Reichstein, Markus/0000-0001-5736-1112; Zaehle, Sönke/0000-0001-5602-7956; Sitch, Stephen A/0000-0003-1821-8561; viovy, nicolas/0000-0002-9197-6417; O, Sungmin/0000-0002-7364-2122; Orth, Rene/0000-0002-9853-921X","European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative ESA-CCI RECCAP2 project [ESRIN/4000123002/18/I-NB]; European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (project 4C, Climate-Carbon Interactions in the Coming Century) [821003]; SNSF [20020172476]; German Research Foundation [391059971]; GENCI-TGCC [2020A0070106328]","European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative ESA-CCI RECCAP2 project; European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (project 4C, Climate-Carbon Interactions in the Coming Century); SNSF(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); German Research Foundation(German Research Foundation (DFG)); GENCI-TGCC","Ana Bastos received funding by the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative ESA-CCI RECCAP2 project (ESRIN/4000123002/18/I-NB).

COLEOPTERA; SOCIAL MEDIA,"Simple Summary Studies of widely distributed species often are problematic as such research usually needs to engage a lot of time, a large team of field workers, and big financial support before good quality data will be collected. Citizen scientists allow to study different aspects of species biology and ecology with significantly reduced basic operational costs of such studies. Based on the data deposited in the iNaturalist database, we studied the ecology of the American flat bark beetle in the entire area of its species range. The results clearly show high value of citizen science, particularly in studies focused on habitat preferences and phenology in both recognized subspecies of this taxon. The American red flat bark beetle, Cucujus clavipes, is a wide distributed saproxylic species divided into two subspecies: ssp. clavipes restricted to eastern regions of North America and ssp. puniceus occurring only in western regions of this continent. Unique morphological features, including body shape and body coloration, make this species easy to recognize even for amateurs. Surprisingly, except some studies focused on physiological adaptations of the species, the ecology of C. clavipes was almost unstudied. Based on over 500 records collected by citizen scientists and deposited in the iNaturalist data base, we studied phenological activity of adult beetles, habitat preferences and impact of future climate change for both subspecies separately. The results clearly show that spp. clavipes and ssp. puniceus can be characterized by differences in phenology and macrohabitat preferences, and their ranges do not overlap at any point. Spp. clavipes is found as more opportunistic taxon occurring in different forests as well as in urban and agricultural areas with tree vegetation always in elevations below 500 m, while elevational distribution of ssp. puniceus covers areas up to 2300 m, and the beetle was observed mainly in forested areas. Moreover, we expect that climate warming will have negative influence on both subspecies with the possible loss of proper niches at level even up to 47-70% of their actual ranges during next few decades. As the species is actually recognized as unthreatened and always co-occurs with many other species, we suggest, because of its expected future habitat loss, to pay more attention to conservationists for possible negative changes in saproxylic insects and/or forest fauna in North America. In addition, as our results clearly show that both subspecies of C. clavipes differ ecologically, which strongly supports earlier significant morphological and physiological differences noted between them, we suggest that their taxonomical status should be verified by molecular data, because very probably they represent separate species.","[Jaskula, Radomir] Univ Lodz, Fac Biol & Environm Protect, Dept Invertebrate Zool & Hydrobiol, Banacha 12-16, PL-90237 Lodz, Poland; [Kolanowska, Marta] Univ Lodz, Fac Biol & Environm Protect, Dept Geobot & Plant Ecol, Banacha 12-16, PL-90237 Lodz, Poland; [Kolanowska, Marta] Global Change Res Inst AS CR, Dept Biodivers Res, Brno 60300, Czech Republic; [Michalski, Marek] Univ Lodz, Fac Biol & Environm Protect, Dept Expt Zool & Evolutionary Biol, Banacha 12-16, PL-90237 Lodz, Poland; [Schwerk, Axel] Warsaw Univ Life Sci SGGW, Inst Environm Engn, Dept Landscape Art, Nowoursynowska 166, PL-02787 Warsaw, Poland",University of Lodz; University of Lodz; Czech Academy of Sciences; Global Change Research Centre of the Czech Academy of Sciences; University of Lodz; Warsaw University of Life Sciences,"Jaskula, R (corresponding author), Univ Lodz, Fac Biol & Environm Protect, Dept Invertebrate Zool & Hydrobiol, Banacha 12-16, PL-90237 Lodz, Poland.",radomir.jaskula@biol.uni.lodz.pl; marta.kolanowska@biol.uni.lodz.pl; marek.michalski@biol.uni.lodz.pl; axel_schwerk@sggw.edu.pl,"; Kolanowska, Marta/F-2575-2014","Michalski, Marek/0000-0002-8001-4140; Schwerk, Axel/0000-0002-2284-3776; Jaskula, Radomir/0000-0001-8949-848X; Kolanowska, Marta/0000-0001-5347-5403","Faculty of Biology and Environmental Protection, University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland","Faculty of Biology and Environmental Protection, University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland","This research received no external funding.

The old church of Moster, situated on the west coast of Norway, is one of the best-preserved examples of mural decorations from around 1600. Researchers from the Norwegian Institute of Cultural Heritage Research (NIKU) examined the wall paintings and made comparative studies with the other Norwegian murals from the same period, in terms of materials, techniques and iconographic programme. The old Moster church contains murals with typical post-Reformation decorative elements. The walls are decorated with foliage and fruit ornamentations, painted frames, which initially contained inscriptions, and biblical scenes from the Old and the New Testament. Scenes from the Old Testament are scarce in preserved Norwegian murals. The post-Reformation murals in Moster must have been executed in different and subsequent stages. Closer examinations of the murals suggest that the decorations were more colourful and detailed than they appear today.","[Andersen, Elisabeth; Kaun, Susanne] Norwegian Inst Cultural Heritage Res, Storgata 2, N-0155 Oslo, Norway",,"Andersen, E (corresponding author), Norwegian Inst Cultural Heritage Res, Storgata 2, N-0155 Oslo, Norway.",ea@niku.no,,,Ministry of Climate and Environment through the Research Council of Norway,Ministry of Climate and Environment through the Research Council of Norway,This research work is part of NIKU's strategic institute programme funded by the Ministry of Climate and Environment through the Research Council of Norway.

The multimodel simulations show that strong positive winter North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) trends are connected with the underlying sea surface temperature (SST) and exhibit an SST tripole trend pattern and a northward shift of the storm-track tail. Strong negative winter trends of the Aleutian low are associated with SST changes in the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) region and a westward shift of the storm track in the North Pacific. The observed simultaneous appearance of strong positive NAO and negative Aleutian low trends is very unlikely to occur by chance in the unforced simulations and reconstructions. The positive winter NAO trend of the last 50 yr is not statistically different from the level of internal atmosphere-ocean variability. The unforced simulations also show a strong link between positive SST trends in the ENSO region and negative Aleutian low trends. With much larger observed SST trends in the ENSO region, this suggests that the observed negative Aleutian low trend is possibly influenced by external forcing, for example, global warming, volcanism, and/or solar activity change.","Univ Bern, Inst Phys, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; Univ Bern, Inst Geog, Bern, Switzerland",University of Bern; University of Bern,"Raible, CC (corresponding author), Univ Bern, Inst Phys, Sidlerstr 5, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland.",raible@climate.unibe.ch,"Stocker, Thomas/B-1273-2013; Raible, Christoph/M-8309-2016; Beyerle, Urs/M-9490-2017","Raible, Christoph/0000-0003-0176-0602; Yoshimori, Masakazu/0000-0003-0236-8442; Luterbacher, Juerg/0000-0002-8569-0973; Beyerle, Urs/0000-0002-6464-0838",,,,,74,41,42,1,12,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0894-8755,1520-0442,,J CLIMATE,J.

Recent advances in sequencing suggest the possibility of documenting genetic changes as they occur in populations, thus uncovering the genetic basis of evolution, particularly if samples are available from both before and after selection. Here, we had a unique opportunity to directly assess genetic changes in natural populations following an evolutionary response to a fluctuation in climate. We analysed genome-wide differences between ancestors and descendants of natural populations of Brassica rapa plants from two locations that rapidly evolved changes in multiple phenotypic traits, including flowering time, following a multiyear late-season drought in California. These ancestor-descendant comparisons revealed evolutionary shifts in allele frequencies in many genes. Some genes showing evolutionary shifts have functions related to drought stress and flowering time, consistent with an adaptive response to selection. Loci differentiated between ancestors and descendants (F-ST outliers) were generally different from those showing signatures of selection based on site frequency spectrum analysis (Tajima's D), indicating that the loci that evolved in response to the recent drought and those under historical selection were generally distinct. Very few genes showed similar evolutionary responses between two geographically distinct populations, suggesting independent genetic trajectories of evolution yielding parallel phenotypic changes. The results show that selection can result in rapid genome-wide evolutionary shifts in allele frequencies in natural populations, and highlight the usefulness of combining resurrection experiments in natural populations with genomics for studying the genetic basis of adaptive evolution. see also the Perspective by Hancock","[Franks, Steven J.; O'Hara, Niamh B.] Fordham Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 441 E Fordham Rd, Bronx, NY 10458 USA; [Kane, Nolan C.; Tittes, Silas] Univ Colorado, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Ramaley N122, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [O'Hara, Niamh B.; Rest, Joshua S.] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Life Sci 650, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA",Fordham University; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook,"Franks, SJ (corresponding author), Fordham Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 441 E Fordham Rd, Bronx, NY 10458 USA.",franks@fordham.edu,"KANE, NOLAN/B-7652-2016","KANE, NOLAN/0000-0001-9133-6543",National Science Foundation [NSF DEB-1142784]; National Institutes of Health [NIGMS R01 GM108904-02]; Division Of Environmental Biology [1142784] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES [R01GM108904] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Division Of Environmental Biology(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)); NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)),"We thank Art Weis and Emily Austen for providing seeds, Rachel Welt for growing plants and DNA extraction, and Garshaw Amidi-Abraham for laboratory assistance.

Accurate hourly forecasting of PM2.5 concentrations is thus of significant importance for public health, helping the citizens to plan the measures to alleviate the harmful effects of air pollution on health. This study analyses and discusses the temporal characteristics of PM2.5 at different locations in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), Vietnam -an economic center and a megacity in a developing country with a population of 8.99 million people. We developed several AI-based one-shot multi-step PM2.5 forecasting models, with both an hourly forecast granularity (1 h to 24 h) and a 24-h rolling mean. These Machine Learning algorithms include Stochastic Gradient Descent Regres-sor, hybrid 1D CNN-LSTM, eXtreme Gradient Boosting Regressor, and Prophet. We collected the data from six monitoring stations installed by the HealthyAir project partners at different loca-tions in HCMC, including traffic, residential and industrial areas in the city. In addition, we developed a suitable model training protocol using data from a short period to address the non-stationarity of PM2.5 time series. Our proposed PM2.5 forecasting models achieve state-of-the-art accuracy and will be deployed in our HealthyAir mobile app to warn HCMC citizens of air pollution issues in the city.","[Rakholia, Rajnish; Le, Quan; Carbajo, Ricardo Simon] Univ Coll Dublin, Irelands Natl Ctr Appl Artificial Intelligence CeA, Nexus UCD, Belfield Off Pk, Dublin, Ireland; [Vu, Khue; Ho, Bang Quoc] Inst Environm & Resources IER, Ho Chi Minh City 700000, Vietnam; [Ho, Bang Quoc] Vietnam Natl Univ, Dept Sci & Technol, Ho Chi Minh City 700000, Vietnam; [Ho, Bang Quoc] Inst Environm & Resources IER, 142 Hien Thanh St,Dist 10, Ho Chi Minh City 700000, Vietnam",University College Dublin; Vietnam National University Hochiminh City,"Ho, BQ (corresponding author), Inst Environm & Resources IER, 142 Hien Thanh St,Dist 10, Ho Chi Minh City 700000, Vietnam.",hqbang@vnuhcm.edu.vn,,,Irish Research Council; Department of Foreign Affairs in Ireland [COALESCE/2020/31],"Irish Research Council(Irish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology); Department of Foreign Affairs in Ireland","This work was supported and funded by the Irish Research Council and the Department of Foreign Affairs in Ireland through the COALESCE project (COALESCE/2020/31) for reducing humanitarian needs, climate action, and strengthening governance.",,25,0,0,4,4,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-0955,,,URBAN CLIM,Urban CLim.,DEC,2022,,,,,,,101315,10.1016/j.uclim.2022.101315,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.uclim.2022.101315,,,13,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,5R7CQ,,hybrid,,,12/21/22,WOS:000874664500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Climate change is causing pluvial flooding, according to the newest IPCC report. This mostly affects urban areas in cities due to: (1) limited capacity of existing drainage systems during heavy-intensity rainfall over a short period of time and (2) limited space for ditches in city areas. Permeable pavements are, therefore, sustainable drainage solutions which combine road infrastructure with water infrastructure. Are permeable pavements a preferable sustainable solution? To answer that question, 24 respondents were interviewed. The interview study was based on a semi-structured interview methodology. A lessons-learned experience was gathered, and the following conclusions were contrived: Firstly, official guidelines on how to construct, consult, and maintain permeable pavements are required. Secondly, more contractors should be able to offer the same product. Finally, official guidelines on the relationship between the contractors are required. These three indicators were extracted from the study.","[Muttuvelu, Dansani Vasanthan; Wyke, Simon; Vollertsen, Jes] Aalborg Univ, Div Civil & Environm Engn, Thomas Manns Vej 23, DK-9220 Aalborg, Denmark; [Muttuvelu, Dansani Vasanthan] WSP Denmark AS, Dept Traff Rd & Harbours, DK-8260 Viby, Denmark",Aalborg University,"Muttuvelu, DV (corresponding author), Aalborg Univ, Div Civil & Environm Engn, Thomas Manns Vej 23, DK-9220 Aalborg, Denmark.;Muttuvelu, DV (corresponding author), WSP Denmark AS, Dept Traff Rd & Harbours, DK-8260 Viby, Denmark.",dvm@build.aau.dk,,"Wyke, Simon/0000-0002-3592-7207; Vollertsen, Jes/0000-0003-0738-0547",Innovation Fund Denmark [1044-00063B]; WSP Denmark A/S,Innovation Fund Denmark; WSP Denmark A/S,"This research was funded by the Innovation Fund Denmark, grant number 1044-00063B, and by WSP Denmark A/S as part of an industrial PhD.",,37,0,0,2,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,OCT,2022,19,,,,,,12432,10.3390/su141912432,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su141912432,,,19,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,5G6YC,,"Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000867141100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The thermal adaptation engages the user's behavioural, physiological and psychological aspects. These aspects play critical roles in user's ability to assess the thermal environments. Previous studies have rarely addressed the effects of identified factors such as gender, age and locality on outdoor thermal comfort, particularly in hot, dry climate. This study investigated the thermal comfort of visitors at two city squares in Iran based on their demographics as well as the role of thermal environment. Assessing the thermal comfort required taking physical measurement and questionnaire survey. In this study, a non-linear model known as the neural network autoregressive with exogenous input (NN-ARX) was employed. Five indices of physiological equivalent temperature (PET), predicted mean vote (PMV), standard effective temperature (SET), thermal sensation votes (TSVs) and mean radiant temperature (T (mrt)) were trained and tested using the NN-ARX. Then, the results were compared to the artificial neural network (ANN) and the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). The findings showed the superiority of the NN-ARX over the ANN and the ANFIS. For the NN-ARX model, the statistical indicators of the root mean square error (RMSE) and the mean absolute error (MAE) were 0.53 and 0.36 for the PET, 1.28 and 0.71 for the PMV, 2.59 and 1.99 for the SET, 0.29 and 0.08 for the TSV and finally 0.19 and 0.04 for the T (mrt).","[Kariminia, Shahab] Islamic Azad Univ, Najafabad Branch, Fac Art Architecture & Urban Planning, Dept Architecture, Najafabad 8514143131, Isfahan, Iran; [Motamedi, Shervin; Hashim, Roslan; Roy, Chandrabhushan] Univ Malaya, Fac Engn, Dept Civil Engn, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia; [Motamedi, Shervin; Hashim, Roslan] Univ Malaya, Inst Ocean & Earth Sci, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia; [Shamshirband, Shahaboddin] Univ Malaya, Fac Comp Sci & Informat Technol, Dept Comp Syst & Technol, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia; [Piri, Jamshid] Univ Zabol, Soil & Water Coll, Dept Water Engn, Zabol, Iran; [Mohammadi, Kasra] Univ Kashan, Fac Mech Engn, Kashan, Iran; [Petkovic, Dalibor] Univ Nis, Dept Mechatron & Control, Fac Mech Engn, Aleksandra Medvedeva 14, Nish 18000, Serbia; [Bonakdari, Hossein] Razi Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Kermanshah, Iran",Islamic Azad University; Universiti Malaya; Universiti Malaya; Universiti Malaya; University Kashan; University of Nis; Razi University,"Motamedi, S (corresponding author), Univ Malaya, Fac Engn, Dept Civil Engn, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia.;Motamedi, S (corresponding author), Univ Malaya, Inst Ocean & Earth Sci, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia.;Shamshirband, S (corresponding author), Univ Malaya, Fac Comp Sci & Informat Technol, Dept Comp Syst & Technol, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia.",shervin.motamedi@gmail.com; shamshirband@um.edu.my,"S.Band, Shahab/ABI-7388-2020; S.Band, Shahab/AAD-3311-2021; Salim, Siti Mawarni/B-7940-2010; Piri, Jamshid/ABF-1802-2021; Bonakdari, Hossein/B-9305-2018; Bonakdari, Hossein/AAW-5398-2021","S.Band, Shahab/0000-0002-8963-731X; Salim, Siti Mawarni/0000-0001-5543-5384; Piri, Jamshid/0000-0002-3732-6288; Bonakdari, Hossein/0000-0001-6169-3654; Shamshirband, Shahaboddin/0000-0002-6605-498X",HIR-MOHE University of Malaya [UM.C/HIR/MOHE/ENG/34],HIR-MOHE University of Malaya(Universiti Malaya),We are thankful for the comments provided by the respected well-known editor of the journal and anonymous reviewers.

This study assessed the performance of land surface temperatures (LSTs), retrieved from the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aqua platform, over Egypt. Eight-day composites of daytime and nighttime LST data were aggregated and validated against near-surface seasonal and annual observational maximum and minimum air temperatures using data from 34 meteorological stations spanning the period from July 2002 to June 2015. A variety of accuracy metrics were employed to evaluate the performance of LST, including the bias, normalized root-mean-square error (nRMSE), Yule-Kendall (YK) skewness measure, and Spearman's rho coefficient. The ability of LST to reproduce the seasonal cycle, anomalies, temporal variability, and the distribution of warm and cold tails of observational temperatures was also evaluated. Overall, the results indicate better performance of the nighttime LSTs compared to the daytime LSTs. Specifically, while nighttime LST tended to underestimate the minimum air temperature during winter, spring, and autumn on the order of -1.3, -1.2, and -1.4 degrees C, respectively, daytime LST markedly overestimated the maximum air temperature in all seasons, with values mostly above 5 degrees C. Importantly, the results indicate that the performance of LST over Egypt varies considerably as a function of season, lithology, and land use. LST performs better during transitional seasons (i.e., spring and autumn) compared to solstices (i.e., winter and summer). The varying interactions and feedbacks between the land surface and the atmosphere, especially the differences between sensible and latent heat fluxes, contribute largely to these seasonal variations. Spatially, LST performs better in areas with sandstone formations and quaternary sediments and, conversely, shows lower accuracy in regions with limestone, igneous, and metamorphic rocks. This behavior can be expected in hybrid arid and semi-arid regions like Egypt, where bare rocks contribute to the majority of the Egyptian territory, with a lack of vegetation cover. The low surface albedo of igneous and limestone rocks may explain the remarkable overestimation of daytime temperature in these regions, compared to the bright formations of higher surface albedo (i.e., sandy deserts and quaternary rocks). Overall, recalling the limited coverage of meteorological stations in Egypt, this study demonstrates that LST obtained from the MODIS product can be trustworthily employed as a surrogate for or a supplementary source to near-surface measurements, particularly for minimum air temperature. On the other hand, some bias correction techniques should be applied to daytime LSTs. In general, the fine space-based climatic information provided by MODIS LST can be used for a detailed spatial assessment of climate variability in Egypt, with important applications in several disciplines such as water resource management, hydrological modeling, agricultural management and planning, urban climate, biodiversity, and energy consumption, amongst others. Also, this study can contribute to a better understanding of the applications of remote sensing technology in assessing climatic feedbacks and interactions in arid and semi-arid regions, opening new avenues for developing innovative algorithms and applications specifically addressing issues related to these regions.","[El Kenawy, Ahmed M.; Hereher, Mohamed E.] Sultan Qaboos Univ, Dept Geog, Muscat 123, Oman; [El Kenawy, Ahmed M.] Mansoura Univ, Dept Geog, Mansoura 35516, Egypt; [Hereher, Mohamed E.] Damietta Univ, Dept Environm Sci, New Damietta 34511, Egypt; [Robaa, Sayed M.] Cairo Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Astron Space Sci & Meteorol, Cairo 12613, Egypt",Sultan Qaboos University; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Mansoura University; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Damietta University; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Cairo University,"El Kenawy, AM (corresponding author), Sultan Qaboos Univ, Dept Geog, Muscat 123, Oman.;El Kenawy, AM (corresponding author), Mansoura Univ, Dept Geog, Mansoura 35516, Egypt.",kenawy@mans.edu.eg; mhereher@du.edu.eg; robaa@sci.cu.edu.eg,"Robaa, El-Sayed/J-5260-2013; Kenawy, Ahmed/Y-9137-2018; Hereher, Mohamed E./J-8287-2014","Kenawy, Ahmed/0000-0001-6639-6253; Hereher, Mohamed E./0000-0003-4875-8286","HM Trust Fund - Sultan Qaboos University, Oman [SR/ART/GEOG/17/01]","HM Trust Fund - Sultan Qaboos University, Oman","The research reported in this publication was supported by the HM Trust Fund (Strategic Project #SR/ART/GEOG/17/01) financed by Sultan Qaboos University, Oman.",,90,20,21,2,14,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2072-4292,,REMOTE SENS-BASEL,Remote Sens.,OCT,2019,20,,,,,,2369,10.3390/rs11202369,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs11202369,,,29,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,JP6TN,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000498395800037,View Full Record in Web of Science

This energy budget is constructed using state-of-the-art reanalysis products from ECMWF [the ECMWF Interim Re-Analysis (ERA-Interim)] and Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiative fluxes for the period 2001-10. The climatological mean Antarctic energy budget is characterized by an approximate balance between the TOA net outgoing radiation and the horizontal convergence of atmospheric energy transport, with the net surface energy flux and atmospheric energy storage generally being small in comparison. Variability in the energy budget on intraseasonal-to-interannual time scales bears a strong signature of the southern annular mode (SAM), with El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) having a smaller impact. The energy budget framework is shown to be a useful alternative to the SAM for interpreting surface climate variability in the Antarctic region.","[Previdi, Michael; Smith, Karen L.; Polvani, Lorenzo M.] Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY 10964 USA; [Polvani, Lorenzo M.] Columbia Univ, Dept Appl Phys & Appl Math, New York, NY USA; [Polvani, Lorenzo M.] Columbia Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, New York, NY USA",Columbia University; Columbia University; Columbia University,"Previdi, M (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, 61 Route 9W, Palisades, NY 10964 USA.",mprevidi@ldeo.columbia.edu,"Polvani, Lorenzo M/E-5949-2011; Keyes, Dennis/AAZ-9285-2021","Smith, Karen/0000-0002-4652-6310",NSF Antarctic Sciences program [ANT 09-44063],NSF Antarctic Sciences program,"We thank three anonymous reviewers whose comments helped strengthen the manuscript.

However, the magnitude, patterns and uncertainties of carbon stocks and the effect of land use on the stocks remain poorly quantified. Here we show, using state-of-the-art datasets, that vegetation currently stores around 450 petagrams of carbon. In the hypothetical absence of land use, potential vegetation would store around 916 petagrams of carbon, under current climate conditions. This difference highlights the massive effect of land use on biomass stocks. Deforestation and other land-cover changes are responsible for 53-58% of the difference between current and potential biomass stocks. Land management effects (the biomass stock changes induced by land use within the same land cover) contribute 42-47%, but have been underestimated in the literature. Therefore, avoiding deforestation is necessary but not sufficient for mitigation of climate change. Our results imply that trade-offs exist between conserving carbon stocks on managed land and raising the contribution of biomass to raw material and energy supply for the mitigation of climate change. Efforts to raise biomass stocks are currently verifiable only in temperate forests, where their potential is limited. By contrast, large uncertainties hinder verification in the tropical forest, where the largest potential is located, pointing to challenges for the upcoming stocktaking exercises under the Paris agreement.","[Erb, Karl-Heinz; Kastner, Thomas; Plutzar, Christoph; Bais, Anna Liza S.; Fetzel, Tamara; Gingrich, Simone; Haberl, Helmut; Lauk, Christian; Niedertscheider, Maria] Alpen Adria Univ Klagenfurt Vienna Graz, Inst Social Ecol Vienna, Schottenfeldgasse 29, A-1070 Vienna, Austria; [Kastner, Thomas] Senckenberg Biodivers & Climate Res Ctr SBiK F, Senckenberganlage 25, D-60325 Frankfurt, Germany; [Plutzar, Christoph] Univ Vienna, Div Conservat Biol Vegetat Ecol & Landscape Ecol, Rennweg 14, A-1030 Vienna, Austria; [Carvalhais, Nuno] Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, Hans Knoll Str 10, D-07745 Jena, Germany; [Carvalhais, Nuno] Univ Nova Lisboa, Fac Ciencias & Tecnol, Dept Ciencias & Engn Ambiente, CENSE, P-2829516 Caparica, Portugal; [Pongratz, Julia] Max Planck Inst Meteorol, Bundesstr 53, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany; [Thurner, Martin] Stockholm Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Analyt Chem ACES, Svante Arrhenius Vag 8, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Thurner, Martin] Stockholm Univ, Bolin Ctr Climate Res, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Luyssaert, Sebastiaan] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Ecol Sci, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands",Senckenberg Biodiversitat & Klima- Forschungszentrum (BiK-F); Senckenberg Gesellschaft fur Naturforschung (SGN); University of Vienna; Max Planck Society; Universidade Nova de Lisboa; Max Planck Society; Stockholm University; Stockholm University; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Erb, KH (corresponding author), Alpen Adria Univ Klagenfurt Vienna Graz, Inst Social Ecol Vienna, Schottenfeldgasse 29, A-1070 Vienna, Austria.",karlheinz.erb@aau.at,"Haberl, Helmut/G-3679-2013; Luyssaert, Sebastiaan/F-6684-2011; Lauk, Christian/S-3969-2019; Thurner, Martin/K-4854-2017; Kastner, Thomas/C-6346-2012; Erb, Karlheinz/F-1282-2016; Pongratz, Julia/AAG-3274-2019; Gingrich, Simone/L-4862-2016","Haberl, Helmut/0000-0003-2104-5446; Luyssaert, Sebastiaan/0000-0003-1121-1869; Thurner, Martin/0000-0003-2362-5161; Kastner, Thomas/0000-0002-8155-136X; Erb, Karlheinz/0000-0002-8335-4159; Pongratz, Julia/0000-0003-0372-3960; Lauk, Christian/0000-0002-4173-1753; Carvalhais, Nuno/0000-0003-0465-1436; Gingrich, Simone/0000-0001-7891-8688",European Research Council [ERC-2010-stg-263522]; European Commission [H2020-EO-2014-640176]; German Research Foundation's Emmy Noether Program [PO 1751/1-1]; GlobBiomass project of the European Space Agency [4000113100/14/I-NB]; NOVA [UID/AMB/04085/2013]; Amsterdam Academic Alliance (AAA); Vetenskapsradet of the Swedish Research Council [621-2014-4266],European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)European Commission); European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre); German Research Foundation's Emmy Noether Program(German Research Foundation (DFG)); GlobBiomass project of the European Space Agency; NOVA; Amsterdam Academic Alliance (AAA); Vetenskapsradet of the Swedish Research Council,"Funding from the European Research Council (ERC-2010-stg-263522 'LUISE'), the European Commission (H2020-EO-2014-640176 'BACI'), the German Research Foundation's Emmy Noether Program (PO 1751/1-1), GlobBiomass project of the European Space Agency (4000113100/14/I-NB), the NOVA grant UID/AMB/04085/2013, the Amsterdam Academic Alliance (AAA) and the Vetenskapsradet grant 621-2014-4266 of the Swedish Research Council are acknowledged.

Though the literature advocates for the use of hemp-based building materials, there is no evidence of studies to explore its potential use in Ghana. Therefore, this study explores the potential factors that limit the adoption of hemp as an alternative sustainable material for green building delivery in Ghana. Design/methodology/approach A structured questionnaire was used to solicit the views of built environment professionals operating in construction, consulting and developer firms. The questions were developed through a comparative review of the related literature and complemented with a pilot review. Data were analysed via descriptive and inferential statistics. Findings On the average, the majority of the respondents showed a moderate level of awareness of hemp and its related uses in the construction industry. Also, certain key factors like the perceived association of hemp with marijuana, lack of expertise in the production of hemp-related building materials, farmers not getting the needed clearance for the cultivation of hemp, lack of legislation by the government in the legalisation of hemp and the inadequate knowledge of consumers on the benefits of hemp-based building materials were identified as potential limitations to the adoption of hemp as an alternative sustainable material for green building delivery. Originality/value The findings from this study provide insights into a less investigated area in sub-Saharan Africa and further provide new and additional information to the current state-of-the-art on the potential for the use of hemp in the building construction sector.","[Agyekum, Kofi; Adinyira, Emmanuel] Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Construct Technol & Management, Kumasi, Ghana; [Oppon, James Anthony] Cape Coast Tech Univ, Dept Bldg Technol, Cape Coast, Ghana",Kwame Nkrumah University Science & Technology,"Agyekum, K (corresponding author), Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Construct Technol & Management, Kumasi, Ghana.",agyekum.kofil@gmail.com,"Agyekum, Kofi/AAP-6023-2021; Oppon, James Anthony/AAG-4399-2021; Agyekum, Kofi/R-1479-2018","Oppon, James Anthony/0000-0002-4869-4414; Agyekum, Kofi/0000-0002-7903-5390; Adinyira, Emmanuel/0000-0001-7381-6105",,,,,60,4,4,1,9,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",2398-4708,,,INT J BUILD PATHOL,Int.

Observational studies have suggested that the strong SST variations in this region influence the atmospheric evolution around the basin, while its impact could extend far into the Pacific and the extra-tropics. Here we study the adjustments of the coupled atmosphere-ocean system to a winter shallow doming event using dedicated ensemble simulations with the state-of-the-art EC-Earth climate model. The doming creates an equatorial Kelvin wave and a pair of westward moving Rossby waves, leading to higher SST 1-2 months later in the Western equatorial Indian Ocean. Atmospheric convection is strengthened and the Walker circulation responds with reduced convection over Indonesia and cooling of the SST in that region. The Pacific warm pool convection shifts eastward and an oceanic Kelvin wave is triggered at thermocline depth. The wave leads to an SST warming in the East Equatorial Pacific 5-6 months after the initiation of the Seychelles Dome event. The atmosphere responds to this warming with weak anomalous atmospheric convection. The changes in the upper tropospheric divergence in this sequence of events create large-scale Rossby waves that propagate away from the tropics along the atmospheric waveguides. We suggest to repeat these types of experiments with other models to test the robustness of the results. We also suggest to create the doming event in June so that the East-Pacific warming occurs in November when the atmosphere is most sensitive to SST anomalies and El Nino could possibly be triggered by the doming event under suitable conditions.","[Manola, Iris; Selten, F.

Projecting its future change is critical for the mitigation and adaptation of billions of people living in the region. There are two important components within the ASM: South Asian summer monsoon (SASM) and East Asian summer monsoon (EASM). Although current state-of-the-art climate models projected increased precipitation in both SASM and EASM due to the increase of atmospheric moisture, their circulation changes differ markedlyA robust strengthening (weakening) of EASM (SASM) circulation was projected. By separating fast and slow processes in response to increased CO2 radiative forcing, we demonstrate that EASM circulation strengthening is attributed to the fast land warming and associated Tibetan Plateau thermal forcing. In contrast, SASM circulation weakening is primarily attributed to an El Nino-like oceanic warming pattern in the tropical Pacific and associated suppressed precipitation over the Maritime Continent.

However, current state-of-the-art Earth system models do not represent dynamic human societies and their feedback interactions with the biogeophysical Earth system and macroeconomic integrated assessment models typically do so only with limited scope. This paper (i) proposes design principles for constructing world-Earth models (WEMs) for Earth system analysis of the Anthropocene, i.e., models of social (world)-ecological (Earth) coevolution on up to planetary scales, and (ii) presents the copan:CORE open simulation modeling framework for developing, composing and analyzing such WEMs based on the proposed principles. The framework provides a modular structure to flexibly construct and study WEMs. These can contain biophysical (e.g., carbon cycle dynamics), socio-metabolic or economic (e.g., economic growth or energy system changes), and sociocultural processes (e.g., voting on climate policies or changing social norms) and their feedback interactions, and they are based on elementary entity types, e.g., grid cells and social systems. Thereby, copan:CORE enables the epistemic flexibility needed for contributions towards Earth system analysis of the Anthropocene given the large diversity of competing theories and methodologies used for describing socio-metabolic or economic and sociocultural processes in the Earth system by various fields and schools of thought. To illustrate the capabilities of the framework, we present an exemplary and highly stylized WEM implemented in copan:CORE that illustrates how endogenizing sociocultural processes and feedbacks such as voting on climate policies based on socially learned environmental awareness could fundamentally change macroscopic model outcomes.","[Donges, Jonathan F.; Heitzig, Jobst; Barfuss, Wolfram; Wiedermann, Marc; Kassel, Johannes A.; Kolb, Jakob J.; Kolster, Till; Mueller-Hansen, Finn; Otto, Ilona M.; Zimmerer, Kilian B.; Lucht, Wolfgang] Leibniz Assoc, Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Earth Syst Anal & Complex Sci, Telegrafenberg A31, Potsdam 14473, Germany; [Donges, Jonathan F.] Stockholm Univ, Stockholm Resilience Ctr, Kraftriket 2B, Stockholm 11419, Sweden; [Barfuss, Wolfram; Kittel, Tim; Kolb, Jakob J.; Kolster, Till] Humboldt Univ, Dept Phys, Newtonstr 15, Berlin 12489, Germany; [Kassel, Johannes A.] Max Planck Inst Phys Komplexer Syst, Nothnitzer Str 38, Dresden 01187, Germany; [Mueller-Hansen, Finn] Mercator Res Inst Global Commons & Climate Change, EUREF Campus 19,Torgauer Str 12-15, Berlin 10829, Germany; [Zimmerer, Kilian B.] Heidelberg Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Neuenheimer Feld 226, Heidelberg 69120, Germany; [Lucht, Wolfgang] Humboldt Univ, Dept Geog, Unter Linden 6, Berlin 10099, Germany; [Lucht, Wolfgang] Humboldt Univ, Integrat Res Inst Transformat Human Environm Syst, Unter Linden 6, Berlin 10099, Germany",Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; Stockholm University; Humboldt University of Berlin; Max Planck Society; Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg; Humboldt University of Berlin; Humboldt University of Berlin,"Donges, JF; Heitzig, J (corresponding author), Leibniz Assoc, Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Earth Syst Anal & Complex Sci, Telegrafenberg A31, Potsdam 14473, Germany.;Donges, JF (corresponding author), Stockholm Univ, Stockholm Resilience Ctr, Kraftriket 2B, Stockholm 11419, Sweden.",donges@pik-potsdam.de; heitzig@pik-potsdam.de,"Donges, Jonathan F./HCI-2311-2022; Otto, Ilona Magdalena/GNP-4425-2022; Lucht, Wolfgang/G-2180-2011; Heitzig, Jobst/E-8271-2011","Lucht, Wolfgang/0000-0002-3398-8575; Muller-Hansen, Finn/0000-0002-0425-1996; Kolster, Till/0000-0002-6409-8882; Heitzig, Jobst/0000-0002-0442-8077; Barfuss, Wolfram/0000-0002-9077-5242; Donges, Jonathan/0000-0001-5233-7703; Kassel, Johannes Adrian/0000-0002-9608-0089","Stordalen Foundation via the Planetary Boundary Research Network (PB.net); Earth League's EarthDoc program; Leibniz Association; European Research Council (ERC advanced grant project ERA); German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF, project CoNDyNet); Heinrich Boll Foundation; Foundation of German Business; Episcopal Scholarship Foundation Cusanuswerk; DFG/FAPESP [IRTG 1740/TRP 2015/50122-0]; European Regional Development Fund; BMBF; Land Brandenburg","Stordalen Foundation via the Planetary Boundary Research Network (PB.net); Earth League's EarthDoc program; Leibniz Association; European Research Council (ERC advanced grant project ERA)(European Research Council (ERC)); German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF, project CoNDyNet)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); Heinrich Boll Foundation; Foundation of German Business; Episcopal Scholarship Foundation Cusanuswerk; DFG/FAPESP; European Regional Development Fund(European Commission); BMBF(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); Land Brandenburg","This work has been carried out within the framework of PIK's flagship project on Coevolutionary Pathways in the Earth system (copan, https://www.pik-potsdam.de/research/projects/activities/copan/copan-introduction, last access: 1 April 2020).

Reliable projections of snowfall changes are therefore critical to anticipate the timeline of change. However, producing such projections is challenging, as most state-of-the-art climate models are limited in sufficiently resolving influential topography. Here we leverage atmospheric freezing level to estimate precipitation phase and project twenty-first-century snowfall frequency change at Snowpack Telemetry Network stations across the Northwest. Under moderate and business-as-usual emission pathways in Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 models, snowfall frequency is projected to decline at all stations. Business-as-usual declines accelerate after midcentury at most locations, whereas moderate declines decelerate. A critical year analysis identifies when decadal-mean snowfall frequency is projected to fall below 50%, 25%, and 10% of cold-season wet days. Results highlight regions particularly vulnerable to relatively near-term change, such as the Cascade Range. Considerable station-to-station spatial variability emphasizes the value of this site-specific approach. Plain Language Summary In the Northwest United States, warming temperatures threaten mountain snow resources, which supply freshwater in watersheds throughout the region. Reliable estimates of future snowfall changes are therefore crucial to determine the timeline over which these changes may occur. However, the tools generally used to estimate future snowfall, climate models, have difficulty calculating local changes across mountainous landscapes. Towards addressing this challenge, we use the height where temperature equals freezing to estimate snowfall versus rainfall occurrence over this century, from which snowfall frequency changes in climate models are calculated at point locations across the Northwest. Under business-as-usual and moderate greenhouse gas emissions, average snowfall frequency is estimated to decline at all sites by 2100. The rate of decline under business-as-usual emissions increases in the latter half of this century at most locations, whereas moderate rates decrease. A critical year identifies when the number of snow days averaged over 10 years falls below 50%, 25%, and 10% of all days receiving rain or snow. Results highlight regions that may experience critical snowfall frequency declines sooner, such as the Cascade Range. Differences among locations are considerable, emphasizing the value of this site-specific approach.","[Catalano, A. J.; Loikith, P.

In this study, we examine AA, and its seasonal cycle, in a sequence of abrupt CO2 forcing experiments, spanning from 1 to 8 times pre-industrial CO2 levels, using a state-of-the-art global climate model. We find that increasing CO2 concentrations give rise to stronger Arctic warming but weaker AA, owing to relatively weaker warming of the Arctic in comparison with the rest of the globe due to weaker sea-ice loss and atmosphere-ocean heat fluxes at higher CO2 levels. We further find that the seasonal peak in AA shifts gradually from November to January as CO2 increases. Finally, we show that this seasonal shift in AA emerges in the 21st century in high-CO2 emission scenario simulations. During the early-to-middle 21st century AA peaks in November-December but the peak shifts to December-January at the end of the century. Our findings highlight the role of CO2 forcing in affecting the seasonal evolution of amplified Arctic warming, which carries important ecological and socio-economic implications.","[Liang, Yu-Chiao; Polvani, Lorenzo M.] Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY 10964 USA; [Liang, Yu-Chiao] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, Taipei, Taiwan; [Polvani, Lorenzo M.] Columbia Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, New York, NY USA; [Polvani, Lorenzo M.; Mitevski, Ivan] Columbia Univ, Dept Appl Phys & Appl Math, New York, NY USA",Columbia University; National Taiwan University; Columbia University; Columbia University,"Liang, YC (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY 10964 USA.;Liang, YC (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, Taipei, Taiwan.",yuchiaoliang@ntu.edu.tw,,"Liang, Yu-Chiao/0000-0002-9347-2466","National Science Foundation [1603350, 1914569]; NASA [80NSSC20K1657]; Ministry of Science and Technology [MOST 110-2111-M-002-019-MY2]; U.S. NSF [1852977]","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); Ministry of Science and Technology(Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning, Republic of Korea); U.S. NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF))","Y.-C.L. and L.M.P. are supported by grants from the National Science Foundation to Columbia University (award numbers 1603350 and 1914569).

As surface parameterizations include more processes, they have moved from being subroutines of GCMs to independent schemes which can also be applied for other purposes. This evolution has raised the problem within climate modeling groups of coupling these schemes to GCMs in a simple and flexible way. As LSS reaches a larger independence, a general interface is needed to enable exchange within the community. This paper discusses the tasks LSS have to fulfill when coupled to a GCM after a review of the current state of the art and the likely future evolutions of both components. The numerical schemes used for the processes which couple the land surfaces to the atmosphere are reviewed to ensure that the interface can be applied to all LSS and GCMs after only minor changes.

On top of that, refrigeration, air-conditioning, and heat pump equipment account for 25-30% of the global electricity consumption and will increase dramatically in the next decades. However, some waste cold energy sources have not been fully used. These challenges triggered an interest in developing the concept of cold thermal energy storage, which can be used to recover the waste cold energy, enhance the performance of refrigeration systems, and improve renewable energy integration. This paper comprehensively reviews the research activities about cold thermal energy storage technologies at sub-zero temperatures (from around -270 degrees C to below 0 degrees C). A wide range of existing and potential storage materials are tabulated with their properties. Numerical and experimental work conducted for different storage types is systematically summarized. Current and potential applications of cold thermal energy storage are analyzed with their suitable materials and compatible storage types. Selection criteria of materials and storage types are also presented. This review aims to provide a quick reference for researchers and industry experts in designing cold thermal energy systems. Moreover, by identifying the research gaps where further efforts are needed, the review also outlines the progress and potential development directions of cold thermal energy storage technologies.","[Yang, Lizhong; Villalobos, Uver; Akhmetov, Bakytzhan; Gil, Antoni; Khor, Jun Onn] Nanyang Technol Univ, Corp Lab, Surbana Jurong, 61 Nanyang Dr, Singapore 637355, Singapore; [Yang, Lizhong; Cabeza, Luisa F.] Univ Lleida, GREiA Res Grp, Pere Cabrera S-N, Lleida 25001, Spain; [Palacios, Anabel; Li, Yongliang; Ding, Yulong] Univ Birmingham, Sch Chem Engn, Birmingham Ctr Energy Storage BCES, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England; [Tan, Wooi Leong] Surbana Jurong, Energy & Ind Div, 168 Jalan Bukit Merah, Singapore 150168, Singapore; [Romagnoli, Alessandro] Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Mech & Aerosp Engn, 50 Nanyang Ave, Singapore 639798, Singapore",Nanyang Technological University & National Institute of Education (NIE) Singapore; Nanyang Technological University; Universitat de Lleida; University of Birmingham; Nanyang Technological University & National Institute of Education (NIE) Singapore; Nanyang Technological University,"Romagnoli, A (corresponding author), Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Mech & Aerosp Engn, 50 Nanyang Ave, Singapore 639798, Singapore.",a.romagnoli@ntu.edu.sg,"Yang, Lizhong/GPK-6609-2022","Yang, Lizhong/0000-0003-4301-8211; /0000-0002-4900-1317; Palacios Trujillo, Anabel/0000-0002-8372-9862; Ding, Yulong/0000-0001-8490-5349; Villalobos Cardozo, Uver Dario/0000-0001-5472-9794","SJNTU Corporate Lab; Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovacion y Universidades de Espana (MCIU/AEI/FEDER, UE) [RTI2018-093849-B-C31]; Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovacion y Universidades - Agencia Estatal de Investigacion (AEI) [RED2018102431-T]; ICREA under the ICREA Academia program; EPSRC [EP/N000714/1, EP/N021142/1] Funding Source: UKRI","SJNTU Corporate Lab; Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovacion y Universidades de Espana (MCIU/AEI/FEDER, UE)(Spanish Government); Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovacion y Universidades - Agencia Estatal de Investigacion (AEI)(Spanish Government); ICREA under the ICREA Academia program; EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC))","The authors would like to acknowledge the funding support from SJNTU Corporate Lab.; This work was partically funded by the Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovacion y Universidades de Espana (RTI2018-093849-B-C31 MCIU/AEI/FEDER, UE), and the Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovacion y Universidades - Agencia Estatal de Investigacion (AEI) (RED2018102431-T).

These changes can also impact the essential ecosystem goods and services derived from these ecosystems. Following disturbances, remote-sensing datasets have been used to monitor the disturbance and describe antecedent conditions as a means of understanding vulnerability to change. To a lesser extent, they have also been used to predict when desired ecosystems are vulnerable to degradation or loss. In this paper, we review studies that have applied remote sensing imagery to characterize vegetation vulnerability in both retrospective and prospective modes. We first review vulnerability research in natural terrestrial ecosystems including temperate forests, tropical forests, boreal forests, semi-arid lands, coastal areas, and the arctic. We then evaluate whether remote sensing can evaluate vulnerability sufficiently in advance of future events in order to allow the implementation of mitigation strategies, or whether it can only describe antecedent conditions a posteriori. The majority of existing research has evaluated vulnerability retrospectively, but key studies highlight the considerable potential for the development of early warnings of future vulnerability. We conclude that future research needs to focus on the development of a greater number of remotely sensed metrics to be used in a prospective mode in assessing vulnerability of terrestrial vegetation under change.

Based on a comprehensive review of the literature (n = 686 studies), we present the current state of knowledge on: 1) the exposure and vulnerability of IPs to pollution; 2) the environmental, health, and cultural impacts of pollution upon IPs; and 3) IPs' contributions to prevent, control, limit, and abate pollution from local to global scales. Indigenous peoples experience large burdens of environmental pollution linked to the expansion of commodity frontiers and industrial development, including agricultural, mining, and extractive industries, as well as urban growth, waste dumping, and infrastructure and energy development. Nevertheless, IPs are contributing to limit pollution in different ways, including through environmental monitoring and global policy advocacy, as well as through local resistance toward polluting activities. This work adds to growing evidence of the breadth and depth of environmental injustices faced by IPs worldwide, and we conclude by highlighting the need to increase IPs' engagement in environmental decision-making regarding pollution control.

J,"Jungbluth, N; Meili, C",,,,"Jungbluth, Niels; Meili, Christoph",,,Recommendations for calculation of the global warming potential of aviation including the radiative forcing index,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT,,,English,Editorial Material,,,,,,Aircraft; Aviation; Climate change; Global warming potential; Radiative forcing index; Transport services,IMPACTS,"PurposeThere are specific effects of emissions in high altitude, which lead to a higher contribution of aviation to the problem of climate change than just the emission of CO2 from burning fuels. The exact relevance is subject to scientific debate, but there is a consensus that aircrafts have an impact that is higher than just their contribution due to the direct CO2 emissions. The gap between this scientific knowledge on the one side and the missing of applicable GWP (global warming potential) factors for relevant emissions on the other side are an important shortcoming for life cycle assessment (LCA) or carbon footprint (CF) studies which aim to cover all relevant environmental impacts of the transport services investigated.MethodsIn this paper, the state of the art concerning the accounting for the specific effects of aircraft emissions in LCA and CF studies is discussed. Therefore, the relevant literature was evaluated, and practitioners were asked for the approaches used by them.Results and discussionFive major approaches are identified ranging from an RFI (radiative forcing index) factor of 1 (no factor at all) to a factor 2.7 for the total aircraft CO2 emissions. If only emissions in the higher atmosphere are considered, RFI factors between 1 and 8.5 are used or proposed in practice.ConclusionsFor the time being, an RFI of 2 on total aircraft CO2 (or 5.2 for the CO2 emissions in the higher atmosphere if using present models in ecoinvent) is recommended to be used in LCA and CF studies because it is based on the latest scientific publications; this basic literature cannot be misinterpreted. Furthermore, it is also recommended by some political institutions. These factors can be multiplied by the direct CO2 emissions of the aircraft to estimate the total global warming potential.","[Jungbluth, Niels; Meili, Christoph] ESU Serv Ltd, Vorstadt 14, CH-8200 Schaffhausen, Switzerland",,"Jungbluth, N (corresponding author), ESU Serv Ltd, Vorstadt 14, CH-8200 Schaffhausen, Switzerland.",jungbluth@esu-services.ch,"Jungbluth, Niels/U-7162-2019; Jungbluth, Niels/X-4740-2019","Jungbluth, Niels/0000-0003-1798-9479; Jungbluth, Niels/0000-0003-1798-9479",,,,,44,20,20,3,24,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0948-3349,1614-7502,,INT J LIFE CYCLE ASS,Int.

In this work, we have analyzed the effects of extensive irrigation over the Gangetic Plains on the seasonal mean and intra-seasonal variability of the Indian summer monsoon, using a general circulation model and a very high-resolution soil moisture dataset created using extensive field observations in a state-of-the-art hydrological model. We find that the winter-time (November-March) irrigation has a positive feedback on the Indian summer monsoon through large scale circulation changes. These changes are analogous to a positive North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) phase during winter months. The effects of the positive NAO phase persist from winter to spring through widespread changes in surface conditions over western and central Asia, which makes the pre-monsoon conditions suitable for a subsequent good monsoon over India. Winter-time irrigation also resulted in a reduction of low frequency intra-seasonal variability over the Indian region during the monsoon season. However, when irrigation is practiced throughout the year, a decrease in June-September precipitation over the Gangetic Plains, significant at 95% level, is noted as compared to the no-irrigation scenario. This decrease is attributed to the increase in local soil moisture due to irrigation, which results in a southward shift of the moisture convergence zone during the active phase of monsoon, decreasing its mean and intraseasonal variability. Interestingly, these changes show a remarkable similarity to the long-term trend in observed rainfall spatial pattern and low-frequency variability. Our results suggest that with a decline in the mean summer precipitation and stressed groundwater resources in the Gangetic Plains, the water crisis could exacerbate, with irrigation having a weakening effect on the regional monsoon.","[Agrawal, Shubhi; Chakraborty, Arindam] Indian Inst Sci, Ctr Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Bangalore, Karnataka, India; [Agrawal, Shubhi; Chakraborty, Arindam] Indian Inst Sci, Divecha Ctr Climate Change, Bangalore, Karnataka, India; [Agrawal, Shubhi] SUNY Albany, Atmospher Sci Res Ctr, Albany, NY 12222 USA; [Karmakar, Nirupam] Florida State Univ, Earth Ocean & Atmospher Sci Dept, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Moulds, Simon] Univ Exeter, Ctr Water Syst, Exeter, Devon, England; [Mijic, Ana; Buytaert, Wouter] Imperial Coll London, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, London, England",Indian Institute of Science (IISC) - Bangalore; Indian Institute of Science (IISC) - Bangalore; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Albany; State University System of Florida; Florida State University; University of Exeter; Imperial College London,"Agrawal, S (corresponding author), Indian Inst Sci, Ctr Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Bangalore, Karnataka, India.;Agrawal, S (corresponding author), Indian Inst Sci, Divecha Ctr Climate Change, Bangalore, Karnataka, India.;Agrawal, S (corresponding author), SUNY Albany, Atmospher Sci Res Ctr, Albany, NY 12222 USA.",sagrawal2@albany.edu,"Karmakar, Nirupam/E-8008-2018; Buytaert, Wouter/AFU-2595-2022","Karmakar, Nirupam/0000-0002-0877-396X; Buytaert, Wouter/0000-0001-6994-4454; Mijic, Ana/0000-0001-7096-9405","Divecha Centre for Climate Change, Indian Institute of Science; MoES, India; UK Natural Environment Research Council","Divecha Centre for Climate Change, Indian Institute of Science; MoES, India; UK Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC))","SA acknowledges the Grantham Fellowship received from Divecha Centre for Climate Change, Indian Institute of Science.

The study is focused on characteristics of temperature and precipitation over the portion of the continent to the south of 20 degrees S at both sides of the Andes Cordillera. Results demonstrate that model outputs coincide with glacial conditions inferred from the very few paleorecords available in the region. Consequently, these models are a valuable tool for inferring additional conditions in areas where there is a lack of proxy information allowing the reconstruction of the past climate at regional scales. The analyzed PMIP3 models expose an LGM cooling of similar to 2-5 degrees C throughout the year over almost all southern South America but differences are even more pronounced in areas around the southern Andes. Models also suggest that LGM precipitation was substantially lower than present over the portion of southern South America to the east of the Andes inferring reductions of similar to 20-30% with respect to present-day values in subtropical areas and similar to 40-50% in the southern tip of the continent.

Knowing what factors dominate the uncertainties is critical to constraining the local climate changes. Analyzing state-of-the-art climatemodel simulations under the RCP8.5 scenario, we find that uncertainties in the circulation primarily result from the divergent global mean warming across models. In contrast, the compensation between dynamic and thermodynamic effects makes the spread in monsoon rainfall independent of the global temperature change. Via a suite of sensitivity experiments, we identify that the uncertainties in the SASM rainfall are dominated by the Indo-Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) warming pattern, especially around the western central Pacific. The SST warming pattern plays its role by changing the zonal temperature gradient over the SASM region and modulating the interhemispheric moisture transport. We highlight that the SST warming patterns require more attention in constraining the projected regional rainfall changes.","[Chen, Xiaolong; Zhou, Tianjun] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, LASG, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Chen, Xiaolong] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Earth Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Zhou, TJ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, LASG, Beijing, Peoples R China.",zhoutj@lasg.iap.ac.cn,"Chen, Xiaolong/AAO-7147-2020; ZHOU, Tianjun/C-3195-2012","ZHOU, Tianjun/0000-0002-5829-7279","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41330423, 41125017]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"We would like to thank two anonymous reviewers for their constructive suggestions and comments, which helped in improving the paper.

Understanding polar bear evolutionary history may provide insights into apex carnivore responses and prospects during periods of extreme environmental perturbations. In recent years, genomic studies have examined bear speciation and population history, including evidence for ancient admixture between polar bears and brown bears (Ursus arctos). Here, we extend our earlier studies of a 130,000- to 115,000-y-old polar bear from the Svalbard Archipelago using a 10x coverage genome sequence and 10 new genomes of polar and brown bears from contemporary zones of overlap in northern Alaska. We demonstrate a dramatic decline in effective population size for this ancient polar bear's lineage, followed by a modest increase just before its demise. A slightly higher genetic diversity in the ancient polar bear suggests a severe genetic erosion over a prolonged bottleneck in modern polar bears. Statistical fitting of data to alternative admixture graph scenarios favors at least one ancient introgression event from brown bears into the ancestor of polar bears, possibly dating back over 150,000 y. Gene flow was likely bidirectional, but allelic transfer from brown into polar bear is the strongest detected signal, which contrasts with other published work. These findings may have implications for our understanding of climate change impacts: Polar bears, a specialist Arctic lineage, may not only have undergone severe genetic bottlenecks but also been the recipient of generalist, boreal genetic variants from brown bears during critical phases of Northern Hemisphere glacial oscillations.","[Lan, Tianying; Tomlin, Crystal; Albert, Victor A.; Lindqvist, Charlotte] Univ Buffalo, Dept Biol Sci, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA; [Lan, Tianying] Daicel Arbor Biosci, Ann Arbor, MI 48103 USA; [Leppala, Kalle] Univ Oulu, Dept Math Sci, Oulu 90014, Finland; [Talbot, Sandra L.; Sage, George K.] Far Northwestern Inst Art & Sci, Anchorage, AK 99501 USA; [Farley, Sean D.] Alaska Dept Fish & Game, Anchorage, AK 99518 USA; [Shideler, Richard T.] Alaska Dept Fish & Game, Fairbanks, AK 99701 USA; [Bachmann, Lutz; Wiig, Oystein] Univ Oslo, Nat Hist Museum, N-0318 Oslo, Norway; [Salojarvi, Jarkko] Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Singapore 637551, Singapore; [Salojarvi, Jarkko] Univ Helsinki, Organismal & Evolutionary Biol Res Programme, Helsinki 00014, Finland; [Mailund, Thomas] Aarhus Univ, Bioinformat Res Ctr, DK-8000 Aarhus, Denmark; [Drautz-Moses, Daniela, I; Schuster, Stephan C.] Nanyang Technol Univ, Singapore Ctr Environm Life Sci Engn, Singapore 637551, Singapore; [Herrera-Estrella, Luis] Inst Politecn Nacl, Lab Nacl Genom Biodiversidad, Unidad Genom Avanzada, Ctr Invest & Estudios Avanzados, Irapuato 36500, Mexico; [Herrera-Estrella, Luis] Texas Tech Univ, Inst Genom Crop Abiot Stress Tolerance, Dept Plant & Soil Sci, Lubbock, TX 79430 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Buffalo; University of Oulu; Alaska Department of Fish & Game; Alaska Department of Fish & Game; University of Oslo; Nanyang Technological University & National Institute of Education (NIE) Singapore; Nanyang Technological University; University of Helsinki; Aarhus University; Nanyang Technological University & National Institute of Education (NIE) Singapore; Nanyang Technological University; CINVESTAV - Centro de Investigacion y de Estudios Avanzados del Instituto Politecnico Nacional; Instituto Politecnico Nacional - Mexico; Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University,"Lindqvist, C (corresponding author), Univ Buffalo, Dept Biol Sci, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA.;Leppala, K (corresponding author), Univ Oulu, Dept Math Sci, Oulu 90014, Finland.;Herrera-Estrella, L (corresponding author), Inst Politecn Nacl, Lab Nacl Genom Biodiversidad, Unidad Genom Avanzada, Ctr Invest & Estudios Avanzados, Irapuato 36500, Mexico.;Herrera-Estrella, L (corresponding author), Texas Tech Univ, Inst Genom Crop Abiot Stress Tolerance, Dept Plant & Soil Sci, Lubbock, TX 79430 USA.",kalle.m.leppala@gmail.com; luis.herrera-estrella@ttu.edu; cl243@buffalo.edu,,,"National Fish and Wildlife Foundation; NSF [1556565, 1854550]; Alaska Department of Fish and Game; US Geological Survey's Changing Arctic Ecosystems - Wildlife Program of the US Geological Survey Ecosystem Mission Area",National Fish and Wildlife Foundation; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Alaska Department of Fish and Game; US Geological Survey's Changing Arctic Ecosystems - Wildlife Program of the US Geological Survey Ecosystem Mission Area,"We thank Todd Attwood and Karyn Rode (US Geological Survey, Alaska Science Center) for providing polar bear tissue samples.

Combining information from archeological and paleoclimatic studies, these patterns can be reconstructed. The nature and frequency of extreme events is of special significance in affecting human history, and water supply plays a crucial role. In Central Europe, sedimentary sequences with alternating fresh-water deposits and buried soil horizons testify to change in availability of water. Archeologic objects are quite common within the buried soils and can be used for age assignment. Soil formation and lake expansion correlate over large areas, emphasizing the climatic origin. During times of drought, settlements moved closer to water sources with shifts both toward lake shores and to higher altitudes. A prominent record of human response to drought cycles in central Europe is represented in the so-called Burgenhorizonte (fort horizons) representing times of construction of fortifications against sporadic immigration from drought-stricken regions, e.g. during the Bronze Age. At the end of the regional Bronze Age the climate became more continental with significant consequences for human settlement, culture, and history.","Univ Halle Wittenberg, Dept Art Oriental & Antiquarian Sci, D-06120 Halle Saale, Germany",Martin Luther University Halle Wittenberg,"Jager, KD (corresponding author), Univ Halle Wittenberg, Dept Art Oriental & Antiquarian Sci, Brandbergweg 23c, D-06120 Halle Saale, Germany.",,"Gerold, Wefer/S-2291-2016","Gerold, Wefer/0000-0002-6803-2020",,,,,28,3,3,0,0,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",,,3-540-43201-9,,,,2002,,,,,369,375,,,,,,7,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,BU89K,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000177315300023,View Full Record in Web of Science

Downward transport of stratospheric ozone-rich air masses through tropopause folds has been shown to significantly contribute to these high tropospheric ozone levels. The summer circulation over the Eastern Mediterranean is dominated by large-scale subsidence and persistent northerly winds, the Etesians, as well as tropopause fold activity affecting tropospheric ozone levels and variability. This is the first study that directly investigates the connections of the Etesians with tropopause folds and tropospheric ozone over the Eastern Mediterranean region using the state-of-the-art ECHAM5/MESSy Atmospheric Chemistry (EMAC) climate model and a tropopause fold identification algorithm for the period June-August 1979 to 2013. Model validation against reanalysis and observational measurements indicates that EMAC simulates well the sea level pressure gradient over the Aegean Sea reproducing the occurrence frequency of the Etesians. The shared variance between the simulated and the observed year-to-year frequency of the Etesian winds is higher than 80%. The year-to-year variability of summertime tropopause folds frequency is significantly correlated with the Etesian winds with a correlation coefficient close to 0.7. In addition, a significant increase of the fold activity and the ozone concentrations are observed during intense Etesians. Our findings may have implications for air quality studies and could support human health policy, as the Etesians coincide with favorable conditions for the formation of tropopause folds and stratosphere-to-troposphere transport and therefore, with enhanced ozone levels over the Eastern Mediterranean.","[Dafka, Stella; Xoplaki, Elena; Luterbacher, Juerg] Justus Liebig Univ Giessen, Dept Geog, Climatol Climate Dynam & Climate Change, Giessen, Germany; [Akritidis, Dimitris; Zanis, Prodromos] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Sch Geol, Dept Meteorol & Climatol, Thessaloniki, Greece; [Pozzer, Andrea] Max Planck Inst Chem, Mainz, Germany; [Pozzer, Andrea] Abdus Salaam Int Ctr Theoret Phys, Trieste, Italy; [Xoplaki, Elena; Luterbacher, Juerg] Justus Liebig Univ Giessen, Ctr Int Dev & Environm Res, Giessen, Germany; [Luterbacher, Juerg] World Meteorol Org WMO, Sci & Innovat Dept, Geneva, Switzerland; [Zerefos, Christos] Acad Athens, Res Ctr Atmospher Phys & Climatol, Athens, Greece; [Zerefos, Christos] Acad Athens, Biomed Res Fdn, Athens, Greece; [Zerefos, Christos] Navarino Environm Observ, Costa Navarino, Messinia, Greece",Justus Liebig University Giessen; Aristotle University of Thessaloniki; Max Planck Society; Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP); Justus Liebig University Giessen; Academy of Athens; Academy of Athens,"Dafka, S (corresponding author), Justus Liebig Univ Giessen, Dept Geog, Climatol Climate Dynam & Climate Change, Giessen, Germany.",styliani.dafka@geogr.uni-giessen.de,"Xoplaki, Elena/AAF-1901-2020; Pozzer, Andrea/L-4872-2013; Zanis, Prodromos/B-5598-2015","Xoplaki, Elena/0000-0002-2745-2467; Pozzer, Andrea/0000-0003-2440-6104; Zanis, Prodromos/0000-0002-3496-2692; Akritidis, Dimitris/0000-0003-3104-5271",Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung (BMBF); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (German Research Foundation) [LU1608/7-1],Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (German Research Foundation)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"The model simulations were performed at the German Climate Computing Center (DKRZ) with support from the Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung (BMBF).

Last decades' research has immensely focussed on river basin water quality (WQ) prediction, risk assessment and pollutant classification techniques to design more potent management policies and advanced early warning system. The next challenge is dealing with water-related data as they are problematic to handle owing to their nonlinearity, nonstationary feature and vague properties due to the unpredictable natural changes, interdependent relationship, human interference and complexity. Artificial intelligence (AI) models have shown remarkable success and superiority to handle such data owing to their higher accuracy to deal with non-linear data, robustness, reliability, cost-effectiveness, problem-solving capability, decision-making capability, efficiency and effectiveness. AI models are the perfect tools for river WQ monitoring, management, sustainability and policymaking. This research reports the state of the art of various AI models implemented for river WQ simulation over the past two decades (2000-2020). Correspondingly, over 200 research articles are reviewed from the Web of Science journals. The survey covers the model structure, input variability, performance metrics, regional generalisation investigation and comprehensive assessments of AI models progress in river water quality research. The increasing contaminants, the lack of funding and the deficiency in data, numerous variables and unique data time series pattern based on the geological area have increased the need for river WQ monitoring and control even more. Hence, this is highly emphasising the involvement of AI models development which can deal with missing data, able to integrate the features of a black-box model and white-box models, benchmarked model and automated early warning system are few of many points need more research. Despite extensive research on WQ simulation using AI models, shortcomings remain according to the current survey, and several possible future research directions are proposed. Overall, this survey provides a new milestone in water resource engineering on the AI model implementation, innovation and transformation in surface WQ modelling with many formidable problems in different blossoming area and objectives to be achieved in the future.","[Tiyasha; Tran Minh Tung; Yaseen, Zaher Mundher] Ton Duc Thang Univ, Fac Civil Engn, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam",Ton Duc Thang University,"Tiyasha; Yaseen, ZM (corresponding author), Ton Duc Thang Univ, Fac Civil Engn, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.",tiyasha.st@tdtu.edu.vn; yaseen@tdtu.edu.vn,"Tiyasha, Tiyasha/AAF-4836-2021; Tung, Tran Minh/AAI-1743-2019; Yaseen, Zaher Mundher/G-7029-2018","Tiyasha, Tiyasha/0000-0003-2138-2100; Tung, Tran Minh/0000-0001-5110-3702; Yaseen, Zaher Mundher/0000-0003-3647-7137",Ton Duc Thang University,Ton Duc Thang University,"The authors acknowledge the funding support by the Ton Duc Thang University.

Currently, the model grid horizontal resolution of state-of-the art regional climate models (RCMs) is about 11-25 km, which may still be too coarse to represent local extremes realistically. In this study we use dynamically downscaled ERA-40 reanalysis data of the RCM COSMO-CLM at 18 km resolution, downscale it dynamically further to 4.5 km and finally to 1.3 km to investigate the impact of the horizontal resolution on extremes. Extremes are estimated as return levels for the 2, 5 and 10-year return periods using 'peaks-over-threshold' (POT) models. Daily return levels are calculated for precipitation and maximum 2m temperature in summer as well as precipitation and 2m minimum temperature in winter. The results show that CCLM is able to capture the spatial and temporal structure of the observed extremes, except for summer precipitation extremes. Furthermore, the spatial variability of the return levels increases with resolution. This effect is more distinct in case of temperature extremes due to a higher correlation with the better resolved orography. This dependency increases with increasing horizontal resolution. In comparison to observations, the spatial variability of temperature extremes is better simulated at a resolution of 1.3 km, but the return levels are cold-biased in summer and warm-biased in winter. Regarding precipitation, the spatial variability improves as well, although the return levels were slightly overestimated in summer by all CCLM simulations. In summary, the results indicate that an increase of the horizontal resolution of CCLM does have a significant effect on the simulation of extremes and that impact models and assessment studies may benefit from such high-resolution model output.","[Gutjahr, Oliver; Schefczyk, Lukas; Heinemann, Gunther] Univ Trier, Dept Environm Meteorol, Behringstr 21, D-54286 Trier, Germany; [Reiter, Philipp] Rhineland Palatinate Ctr Excellence Climate Chang, Trippstadt, Germany; [Reiter, Philipp] Univ Trier, Dept Phys Geog, Trier, Germany",Universitat Trier; Universitat Trier,"Gutjahr, O (corresponding author), Univ Trier, Dept Environm Meteorol, Behringstr 21, D-54286 Trier, Germany.",gutjahr@uni-trier.de,,,State of Rhineland-Palatinate (Research Initiative Rhineland-Palatinate),State of Rhineland-Palatinate (Research Initiative Rhineland-Palatinate),"The authors thank the CLM-Community, in particular BURKHARDT ROCKEL (HZG Geesthacht), ANDREAS WILL (BTU Cottbus) and HANS-JURGEN PANITZ (KIT Karlsruhe), for giving advices on the model configuration and KLAUS KEULER and KAI RADTKE (BTU Cottbus) for providing the CCLM18 data, MERJA TOLLE (University of Giessen) for the REGNIE data set and OLIVER GRONZ (University of Trier) for preparing the InterMet data set.

Laser heating and vaporization of the PMMA sample and the mechanisms of ablation have been investigated for the particular experimental conditions. The theoretical description of laser-induced target heating and ablation is based on the widely used thermal model [2] which allows one to describe mass removal over a fairly wide range of laser fluences from ablation threshold up to transition to phase explosion. It has been shown that, in contrast to metal ablation, PMMA ablation continues up to several milliseconds after laser pulse termination. Phase explosion aspects are analyzed on the basis of the target superheating data obtained by modeling. It has been demonstrated that, in the case of PMMA ablation, the pulsed regime of FEL can be modeled by continuous irradiation with the equivalent power. A methodology has been proposed to evaluate the absorption coefficients of PMMA for wavelengths of FEL, which are unknown at present, basing on the vaporization rate.","Novosibirsk State Univ, Novosibirsk 630090, Russia",Novosibirsk State University,"Zakharov, LA (corresponding author), Novosibirsk State Univ, Pirogova St 2, Novosibirsk 630090, Russia.",,"Bulgakova, Nadezhda M/N-7677-2013; Bulgakova, Nadezhda M./AAG-2338-2019","Bulgakova, Nadezhda M/0000-0003-1449-8535; Bulgakova, Nadezhda M./0000-0003-1449-8535",,,,,5,0,0,0,3,SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING,BELLINGHAM,"1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010 USA",0277-786X,,0-8194-6328-0,P SOC PHOTO-OPT INS,,,2005,,,,,S2630,S2630,62630S,10.1117/12.677446,http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.677446,,,10,Optics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Optics,BEQ94,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000238988600028,View Full Record in Web of Science

Both historical simulations and future projections based on the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 scenario are used to evaluate model performance and to identify potential changes at the CPT focusing on the 100hPa and zero-lapse-rate (ZLR) temperatures. It is found that historical simulations successfully reproduce the large-scale spatial structure and seasonality of observed temperature and reasonably capture variability associated with El Nino-Southern Oscillation and equatorial waves near the CPT. However, the models show nonnegligible biases in several aspects: (1) most models have a warm bias around the CPT, (2) large intermodel differences occur in the amplitude of the seasonal cycle in 100hPa temperature, (3) several models overestimate lower stratospheric warming in response to volcanic aerosols, (4) temperature variability associated with the quasi-biennial oscillation and Madden-Julian oscillation is absent in most models, and (5) equatorial waves near the CPT exhibit a wide range of variations among the models. In the RCP 8.5 scenario, the models predict robust warming both at the 100hPa and ZLR levels, but cooling at the 70hPa level. A weakened seasonal cycle in the temperature is also predicted in most models at both the 100 and 70hPa levels. These findings may have important implications for cross-tropopause water vapor transport and related global climate change and variability.","[Kim, Joowan] McGill Univ, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Grise, Kevin M.] Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY USA; [Son, Seok-Woo] Seoul Natl Univ, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Seoul 151742, South Korea",McGill University; Columbia University; Seoul National University (SNU),"Son, SW (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, 1 Gwanak Ro, Seoul 151742, South Korea.",seokwooson@snu.ac.kr,"Son, Seok-Woo/A-8797-2013; Grise, Kevin/B-6939-2013","Grise, Kevin/0000-0003-0934-8129; Kim, Joowan/0000-0002-8609-3425",Korea Meteorological Administration Research and Development Program [CATER 2012-3065],Korea Meteorological Administration Research and Development Program(Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA)),"We acknowledge the World Climate Research Programme's Working Group on Coupled Modelling, which is responsible for CMIP, and thank the climate modeling groups listed in Table 1 for producing their model output.

Ultrafine (< 100 nm) particles often dominate aerosol numbers, and nucleation of atmospheric vapors is an important source of these particles. To have climatic relevance, however, the freshly nucleated particles need to grow in size. We combine observations from two continental sites (Egbert, Canada and Hyytiala, Finland) to show that condensation of organic vapors is a crucial factor governing the lifetimes and climatic importance of the smallest atmospheric particles. We model the observed ultrafine aerosol growth with a simplified scheme approximating the condensing species as a mixture of effectively non-volatile and semi-volatile species, demonstrate that state-of-the-art organic gas-particle partitioning models fail to reproduce the observations, and propose a modeling approach that is consistent with the measurements. We find that roughly half of the mass of the condensing mass needs to be distributed proportional to the aerosol surface area (thus implying that the condensation is governed by gas-phase concentration rather than the equilibrium vapour pressure) to explain the observed aerosol growth. We demonstrate the large sensitivity of predicted number concentrations of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) to these interactions between organic vapors and the smallest atmospheric nanoparticles highlighting the need for representing this process in global climate models.","[Riipinen, I.; Pandis, S.

To promote and maintain forest multifunctionality and species persistence in the landscape, it is critical that the interactions between these factors and forest biodiversity are disentangled. Still, the relationships between disturbances and forest management are poorly understood and may hinder an adequate planning of management and conservation actions in these forests. Here we address this issue via a coupled ecological-economic modeling system under different climate change scenarios. We employed data from a large-scale field-based research in southwestern Germany, in combination with a climate-sensitive forest growth model. Thereby, we quantified changes in multiple biodiversity indicators (including richness of birds, bats and flying insect orders) and tree microhabitats (TreMs) in the face of disturbance and management interventions. Our results show that windstorms may cause economic damage in managed forests, but at the same time improve biodiversity indicators in these areas. Salvage logging, however, may dampen these positive impacts for the majority of indicators considered. Moreover, management solutions targeting at wind risk mitigation may be detrimental to some taxa (e.g. forest birds) but still performed better than the business-as-usual management, in terms of the biodiversity indicators applied. We conclude that considering disturbance impacts on forest dynamics will be key to maintain the sustainability in the use of forest resources and support species persistence in temperate forest landscapes.","[Augustynczik, Andrey L.

Many state-of-the-art methods for fruit detection use convolutional neural networks (CNNs). This paper presents the results for peach detection by applying a faster R-CNN framework in images captured from an outdoor orchard. Although this method has been used in other studies to detect fruits, there is no research on peaches. Since the fruit colors, sizes, shapes, tree branches, fruit bunches, and distributions in trees are particular, the development of a fruit detection procedure is specific. The results show great potential in using this method to detect this type of fruit. A detection accuracy of 0.90 using the metric average precision (AP) was achieved for fruit detection. Precision agriculture applications, such as deep neural networks (DNNs), as proposed in this paper, can help to mitigate climate change, due to horticultural activities by accurate product prediction, leading to improved resource management (e.g., irrigation water, nutrients, herbicides, pesticides), and helping to reduce food loss and waste via improved agricultural activity scheduling.","[Assuncao, Eduardo T.; Gaspar, Pedro D.; Mesquita, Ricardo J.

We projected future hydrologic changes based on phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project global climate model simulations using the Variable Infiltration Capacity hydrologic model and a multivariate bias correction/downscaling method for the Liard basin in subarctic northwestern Canada. Subsequently, the variable importance of key climatic controls on a set of hydrologic indicators was analyzed using the random forests statistical model. Results indicate that enhanced warming and wetness by the end of century would lead to pronounced declines in annual and monthly snow water equivalent (SWE) and earlier maximum SWE. Prominent changes in the streamflow regime include increased annual mean and minimum flows, earlier maximum flows, and either increased or decreased maximum flows depending on interactions between temperature, precipitation, and snow. Using the variable importance analysis, we find that precipitation exerts the primary control on maximum SWE and annual mean and maximum flows, and temperature has the main influence on timings of maximum SWE and flow, and minimum flow. Given these climatic controls, the changes in the hydrologic indicators become progressively larger under the scenarios of 1.5 degrees, 2.0 degrees, and 3.0 degrees C global mean temperature increases above the preindustrial period. Hence, the framework presented in this study provides a detailed diagnosis of the hydrologic changes as well as controls and interactions of the climatic variables, which could be generalized for understanding regional scale changes in subarctic/nival basins.","[Shrestha, Rajesh R.; Alford, Hunter] Univ Victoria, Watershed Hydrol & Ecol Res Div, Environm & Climate Change Canada, Victoria, BC, Canada; [Cannon, Alex J.; Alford, Hunter] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Climate Res Div, Victoria, BC, Canada; [Schnorbus, Markus A.] Univ Victoria, Pacific Climate Impacts Consortium, Victoria, BC, Canada",Environment & Climate Change Canada; University of Victoria; Environment & Climate Change Canada; University of Victoria,"Shrestha, RR (corresponding author), Univ Victoria, Watershed Hydrol & Ecol Res Div, Environm & Climate Change Canada, Victoria, BC, Canada.",rajesh.shrestha@canada.ca,"Cannon, Alex/AAA-4637-2020; Shrestha, Rajesh/ABE-1459-2021","Cannon, Alex/0000-0002-8025-3790; Shrestha, Rajesh/0000-0001-7781-6495",,,,,98,15,15,0,19,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693, UNITED STATES",1525-755X,1525-7541,,J HYDROMETEOROL,J.

Recent progress, challenges and future directions regarding stochastic representations of model uncertainties at ECMWF are described in this article. The coming years are likely to see a further increase in the use of ensemble methods in forecasts and assimilation. This will put increasing demands on the methods used to perturb the forecast model. An area that is receiving greater attention than 5-10 years ago is the physical consistency of the perturbations.

An ensemble of WACCM runs from 2006 to 2065 forced with a standard future scenario is compared to a second ensemble in which ozone-depleting substances (ODS) are not regulated (the so-called World Avoided). It is found that by the year 2065, changes in the potential intensity of tropical cyclones in the World Avoided are nearly 3 times as large as for the standard scenario. The Montreal Protocol thus provides a strong mitigation of the adverse effects of intensifying tropical cyclones. The relative importance of warmer sea surface temperatures (ozone-depleting substances are important greenhouse gases) and cooler lower-stratospheric temperatures (accompanying the massive destruction of the ozone layer) is carefully examined. It is found that the former are largely responsible for the increase in potential intensity in the World Avoided, whereas temperatures above the 70-hPa level-which plunge by nearly 15K in 2065 in the World Avoided-have no discernible effect on potential intensity. This finding suggests that the modest (compared to the World Avoided) tropical ozone depletion of recent decades has not been a major player in determining the intensity of tropical cyclones, and neither will ozone recovery be in the coming half century.","[Polvani, Lorenzo M.] Columbia Univ, Dept Appl Phys & Appl Math, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Polvani, Lorenzo M.] Columbia Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Camargo, Suzana J.] Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY USA; [Garcia, Rolando R.] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA",Columbia University; Columbia University; Columbia University; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA,"Polvani, LM (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, SW Mudd Room 216,Mail Code 4701, New York, NY 10027 USA.",lmp@columbia.edu,"Camargo, Suzana J./C-6106-2009; Polvani, Lorenzo M/E-5949-2011","Camargo, Suzana J./0000-0002-0802-5160; ",U.S. National Science Foundation; NSF [AGS 1143959]; NOAA [NA110AR4310093]; National Science Foundation; Div Atmospheric & Geospace Sciences [1143959] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,U.S. National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Div Atmospheric & Geospace Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)),"The authors are most grateful to Kerry Emanuel for showing keen interest in their work, for many useful suggestions, and for his kind help in detecting a small bug in the computation of PI in earlier drafts of the paper.

The demand for cement is synonymous with the growth in infrastructure demand and per-capita gross domestic product in the world, calling the need for mitigation measures within the industry in order to contribute to the global climate change efforts. System dynamics (SD) is a simulation approach that is used for studying the nonlinear behaviours in complex systems over time, often used in industrial domains for emission forecasts as well as policy experimentation. With the adoption rates of mitigation strategies in the cement industry being inadequate, there is a need for improvisation in policymaking through better decision-support tools.

One way to combine these symmetries is through a hierarchy. However, this approach does not adequately model the interplay between the two levels of symmetry transformations. We show how to model this interplay using ideas from group theory, identify the equivariant linear maps, and introduce equivariant padding that respects these symmetries.

In particular, the paper presents a systematic and easy to implement approach to model the energy performance of shallow and helical ground heat exchangers and assess their energy efficiency benefits to heat and cool buildings. The modeling approach is based on the implementation of G-functions, generated using a validated numerical model, in a state-of-art whole building energy simulation tool. Both the numerical model and the simulation tool are applied to assess the energy performance of various shallow geothermal systems designed to meet heating and cooling needs for detached single-family homes in California. Specifically, a series of sensitivity analyses is conducted to determine the energy performance of the shallow geothermal systems in 16 locations representing all California climate zones. It is found that the suitability and the efficiency of the shallow geothermal systems vary widely and depend on several factors including their design specifications as well as the climate conditions. Compared with conventional air-to-air heat pumps, the shallow ground source heat pumps can be more energy efficient in most climate zones in California except those locations with extreme weather conditions resulting in either heating or cooling only operation. Moreover, configurations of shallow ground source heat pumps with 16 boreholes with 6.7 m (22 ft) depth are found to be cost-effective in several California climate zones.","[Shah, Archan; Krarti, Moncef] Univ Colorado Boulder, Dept Civil Environm & Architectural Engn, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Huang, Joe] White Box Technol, Moraga, CA 94556 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Krarti, M (corresponding author), Univ Colorado Boulder, Dept Civil Environm & Architectural Engn, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",archan.shah@colorado.edu; krarti@colorado.edu; yjhuang@whiteboxtechnologies.com,,"Krarti, Moncef/0000-0002-8758-9123","University of California at Davis, WCEC [EPC-15-019];  [CEC EPC-15-019]","University of California at Davis, WCEC; ","This research was funded by University of California at Davis, WCEC, as a subcontract to grant EPC-15-019.",,58,0,0,14,18,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1996-1073,,ENERGIES,Energies,FEB,2022,3,,,,,,1025,10.3390/en15031025,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en15031025,,,25,Energy & Fuels,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Energy & Fuels,ZA6VC,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000756298000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, he went a step further, interpreting the myth with regard to his time and symbolism in painting, and transforming it into a new symbol whose meaning was revealed only within the community and the climate in which it was created. The triumph of men over mythological creatures, monsters and dangers, represents for Moreau the heroism of the whole human race. There can be recognized three types of heroes in his work a hero rebel who opposes the higher powers, for which he is punished, exiled hero, who can not reconcile with society so he is rejected or he goes away, and the hero faced with his arch-enemy, in the moment of the greatest temptation. In constant conflict with the hero is the anti-hero, which Moreau created on the base of female characters in ancient mythology. In this way, he confronted the magical powers and sensuality with the determination of mind and spirit. A typical anti-hero in his paintings was the beauty who seduces, tempts and leads to danger. This made the painter close to the phenomenon of the evil woman, popular in the arts and culture of the 19th century. The juxtaposition of heroes and anti-heroes in the same painting, thus highlighting their differences, is also characteristic of Moreau's art. Using the myth, the painter speaks of the contrast between two types of personalities, as well as the conflicts within each individual the struggle of reason against emotion, spirit against instinct. The dualism of human nature, heroic humanity and monstrous animality, was presented as a struggle between spirit and matter, in which the artist sometimes left the questions open to interpretation, but a belief in justice and truth can be seen in his entire work.","[Nikolic, J.

Robust and detailed comparison of well-dated and annually laminated sediment records is crucial for reconstructing abrupt and regionally time-transgressive changes as well as validation of spatial and temporal trajectories of past climatic changes. The VARved sediments DAtabase (VARDA) presented here is the first data compilation for varve chronologies and associated palaeoclimatic proxy records. The current version 1.0 allows detailed comparison of published varve records from 95 lakes. VARDA is freely accessible and was created to assess outputs from climate models with high-resolution terrestrial palaeoclimatic proxies. VARDA additionally provides a technical environment that enables us to explore the database of varved lake sediments using a connected data model and can generate a state-of-the-art graphic representation of a multisite comparison. This allows the reassessment of existing chronologies and tephra events to synchronize and compare even distant varved lake records. Furthermore, the present version of VARDA permits the exploration of varve thickness data. In this paper, we report in detail on the data-mining and compilation strategies for the identification of varved lakes and assimilation of high-resolution chronologies, as well as the technical infrastructure of the database. Additional palaeoclimatic proxy data will be provided in forthcoming updates.","[Ramisch, Arne; Brauser, Alexander; Dorn, Mario; Blanchet, Cecile; Brademann, Brian; Koeppl, Matthias; Mingram, Jens; Neugebauer, Ina; Nowaczyk, Norbert; Ott, Florian; Pinkerneil, Sylvia; Plessen, Birgit; Schwab, Markus J.; Tjallingii, Rik; Brauer, Achim] GFZ German Res Ctr Geosci, Sect Climate Dynam & Landscape Evolut, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Center Potsdam GFZ German Research Center for Geosciences,"Ramisch, A (corresponding author), GFZ German Res Ctr Geosci, Sect Climate Dynam & Landscape Evolut, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany.",arne.ramisch@gfz-potsdam.de,"Blanchet, Cecile/C-6370-2013; Blanchet, Cecile/AAK-2270-2021","Blanchet, Cecile/0000-0002-7146-705X; Blanchet, Cecile/0000-0002-7146-705X; Dorn, Mario/0000-0002-4761-1648; Ramisch, Arne/0000-0002-0173-4829; Brauer, Achim/0000-0002-6655-9451; Neugebauer, Ina/0000-0002-8612-6573; Brauser, Alexander/0000-0002-4411-3205",Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung [01LP1510A],Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),This research has been supported by the Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung (grant no. 01LP1510A).,,157,6,6,1,5,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1866-3508,1866-3516,,EARTH SYST SCI DATA,Earth Syst.

In addition to a substantial warming over much of the North Atlantic, caused by increasing greenhouse gases over the 21st century, climate projections show a surprising region of considerable future cooling at midlatitudes, referred to as the North Atlantic warming hole. A similar pattern of surface temperature trends has been observed in recent decades, but it remains unclear whether this pattern is of anthropogenic origin or a simple manifestation of internal climate variability. Here, analyzing state-of-the-art climate models and observations, we show that the recent North Atlantic warming hole is of anthropogenic origin. Our analysis reveals that the anthropogenic signal has only recently emerged from the internal climate variability, and can be attributed to greenhouse gas emissions. We further show that a declining northward oceanic heat flux in recent decades, which is linked to this surface temperature pattern, is also of anthropogenic origin.","[Chemke, Rei; Polvani, Lorenzo M.] Columbia Univ, Dept Appl Phys & Appl Math, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Zanna, Laure] Univ Oxford, Dept Phys, Atmospher Ocean & Planetary Phys, Oxford, England; [Zanna, Laure] NYU, Courant Inst Math Sci, New York, NY USA; [Polvani, Lorenzo M.] Columbia Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Palisades, NY USA; [Polvani, Lorenzo M.] Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY USA",Columbia University; University of Oxford; New York University; Columbia University; Columbia University,"Chemke, R (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Dept Appl Phys & Appl Math, New York, NY 10027 USA.",rc3101@columbia.edu,"Polvani, Lorenzo M/E-5949-2011; Zanna, Laure/L-3169-2019","Zanna, Laure/0000-0002-8472-4828",National Science Foundation,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"We are grateful to Ben Santer for his encouragement.

However, the response of the hydrological cycle during the early Eocene is poorly constrained, especially in regions with sparse data coverage (e.g., Africa). Here, we present a study of African hydroclimate during the early Eocene, as simulated by an ensemble of state-of-the-art climate models in the Deep-time Model Intercomparison Project (DeepMIP). A comparison between the DeepMIP pre-industrial simulations and modern observations suggests that model biases are model- and geographically dependent, however, these biases are reduced in the model ensemble mean. A comparison between the Eocene simulations and the pre-industrial suggests that there is no obvious wetting or drying trend as the CO2 increases. The results suggest that changes to the land sea mask (relative to modern) in the models may be responsible for the simulated increases in precipitation to the north of Eocene Africa. There is an increase in precipitation over equatorial and West Africa and associated drying over northern Africa as CO2 rises. There are also important dynamical changes, with evidence that anticyclonic low-level circulation is replaced by increased south-westerly flow at high CO2 levels. Lastly, a model-data comparison using newly compiled quantitative climate estimates from paleobotanical proxy data suggests a marginally better fit with the reconstructions at lower levels of CO2.","[Williams, Charles J.

The modeling system is built around a state-of-the-art numerical weather prediction model, properly modified to allow for the better representation of the urban climate. The model performance in terms of simulating the near-surface air temperature and thermal comfort conditions over the complex urban area of Athens, Greece, is evaluated during a 1.5-month operational implementation in the summer of 2010. Results from this case study reveal an overall satisfactory performance of the modeling system. The discussion of the results highlights the important role that, given the necessary modifications, a meteorological model can play as a supporting tool for developing successful heat island mitigation strategies.

Together with the establishment of operational services, the community has coordinated with universities, research centers, research infrastructures and private companies to implement advanced multi-platform and integrated observing and forecasting systems that facilitate the advancement of operational services, scientific achievements and mission-oriented innovation. Thus, the community can respond to societal challenges and stakeholders needs, developing a variety of fit-for-purpose services such as the Copernicus Marine Service. The combination of state-of-the-art observations and forecasting provides new opportunities for downstream services in response to the needs of the heavily populated Mediterranean coastal areas and to climate change. The challenge over the next decade is to sustain ocean observations within the research community, to monitor the variability at small scales, e.g., the mesoscale/submesoscale, to resolve the sub-basin/seasonal and inter-annual variability in the circulation, and thus establish the decadal variability, understand and correct the model-associated biases and to enhance model-data integration and ensemble forecasting for uncertainty estimation. Better knowledge and understanding of the level of Mediterranean variability will enable a subsequent evaluation of the impacts and mitigation of the effect of human activities and climate change on the biodiversity and the ecosystem, which will support environmental assessments and decisions. Further challenges include extending the science-based added-value products into societal relevant downstream services and engaging with communities to build initiatives that will contribute to the 2030 Agenda and more specifically to SDG14 and the UN's Decade of Ocean Science for sustainable development, by this contributing to bridge the science-policy gap. The Mediterranean observing and forecasting capacity was built on the basis of community best practices in monitoring and modeling, and can serve as a basis for the development of an integrated global ocean observing system.","[Tintore, Joaquin] CSIC UIB, SOCIB, Palma De Mallorca, Spain;

Among the components of lignocellulosic biomass, cellulosic/hemicellulosic components have mainly been utilized to obtain fermentable sugars in biorefineries, whereas lignin has commonly been treated as a byproduct thus far. Nonetheless, lignin is the most widely available macromolecule in nature; thus, recent biorefineries have paid special attention to lignin as an attractive source for renewable energy. Given that natural lignin is highly recalcitrant to breakdown, lignin degradation is the most significant issue for further valorization. Accordingly, biological approaches involving enzymes and microorganisms for lignin degradation are comprehensively reviewed in this study. Additionally, this review intensively addresses the recent progress in biotechnological lignin valorization including not only metabolic engineering for producing useful fuels and chemicals but also the use of lignin-based hybrid materials for biosensor and biomedical applications. Furthermore, future studies on challenging issues are suggested as an aid to developing feasible lignin-based biorefineries.

In the past, the two disciplines have addressed this question mainly with correlative approaches, despite frequent calls for more mechanistic explanations. Recent advances in computational power, theoretical understanding, and statistical tools are, however, currently facilitating the development of more system-oriented, mechanistic models. We review these models, identify different model types and theoretical frameworks, compare their processes and properties, and summarize emergent findings. We show that ecological (physiology, demographics, dispersal, biotic interactions) and evolutionary processes, as well as environmental and human-induced drivers, are increasingly modelled mechanistically; and that new insights into biodiversity dynamics emerge from these models. Yet, substantial challenges still lie ahead for this young research field. Among these, we identify scaling, calibration, validation, and balancing complexity as pressing issues. Moreover, particular process combinations are still understudied, and so far models tend to be developed for specific applications. Future work should aim at developing more flexible and modular models that not only allow different ecological theories to be expressed and contrasted, but which are also built for tight integration with all macroecological data sources. Moving the field towards such a systems macroecology' will test and improve our understanding of the causal pathways through which eco-evolutionary processes create diversity patterns across spatial and temporal scales.","[Cabral, Juliano Sarmento] Synth Ctr, German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Leipzig, Germany; [Cabral, Juliano Sarmento] Univ Warzburg, Ctr Computat & Theoret Biol CCTB, Ecosystem Modeling, Warzburg, Germany; [Valente, Luis] Univ Potsdam, Unit Evolutionary Biol Systemat Zool, Potsdam, Germany; [Valente, Luis] Leibniz inst fur Evolut & Biodiversitatsforschung, Museum Naturkunde, Berlin, Germany; [Hartig, Florian] Univ Freiburg, Biometry & Environm Syst Anal, Freiburg, Germany; [Hartig, Florian] Univ Regensburg, Theoret Ecol, Regensburg, Germany",University of Potsdam; Leibniz Institut fur Evolutions und Biodiversitatsforschung; University of Freiburg; University of Regensburg,"Cabral, JS (corresponding author), Synth Ctr, German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Leipzig, Germany.;Cabral, JS (corresponding author), Univ Warzburg, Ctr Computat & Theoret Biol CCTB, Ecosystem Modeling, Warzburg, Germany.",juliano.sarmento_cabral@uni-wuerzburg.de,"Hartig, Florian/G-4510-2010; Valente, Luis/AAB-4278-2020; Sarmento Cabral, Juliano/K-3973-2012","Hartig, Florian/0000-0002-6255-9059; Valente, Luis/0000-0003-4247-8785; Sarmento Cabral, Juliano/0000-0002-0116-220X","sDiv, the Synthesis Centre of iDiv [DFG FZT 118]; Alexander von Humboldt Foundation; Brandenburg Ministry for Science, Research and Culture; DFG [VA 1102/1-1]","sDiv, the Synthesis Centre of iDiv; Alexander von Humboldt Foundation(Alexander von Humboldt Foundation); Brandenburg Ministry for Science, Research and Culture; DFG(German Research Foundation (DFG))","We thank Alexander Kubisch, Catherine Graham, and two anonymous reviewers for comments on earlier manuscript version.

Traditional local materials (stone and adobe) were used for the construction of the thermal storage wall. A new local bio-based material made from date palm trunks was used for the insulation of the passive house prototype. For a better understanding of passive house heating and for a comparative study, a numerical simulation, using Fluent, was carried out. The aim of this study was to supply recommendations for improving the passive systems and to participate to the energy consumption control in the building sector. The results show that the experimental and numerical simulation results are in good agreement. The optimal orientation of the solar passive house has been determined, which is at 160 degrees southeast. The use of local and bio-based materials has proven its effectiveness in the construction of the passive house. The thermal behavior of date palm wood has been found to be close to those of insulation materials commonly used in buildings. That means it has the same thermal insulation ability (thermal conductivity). On the other hand, the results show that the thermal efficiency of the passive solar heating system, with an adobe wall is significantly higher (50%) than that with a stone wall (30.7%).","[Boulebbina, Cherif; Mebarki, Ghazali; Rahal, Samir] Univ Batna 2, Fac Technol, Mech Engn Dept, LESEI Lab, Ave Chahid Boukhlouf Mohammed Elhadi, Batna 05001, Algeria",,"Mebarki, G (corresponding author), Univ Batna 2, Fac Technol, Mech Engn Dept, LESEI Lab, Ave Chahid Boukhlouf Mohammed Elhadi, Batna 05001, Algeria.",g.mebarki@univ-batna2.dz,,,,,,,41,0,0,4,4,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",2194-1459,2194-1467,,MATER RENEW SUSTAIN,Mater.

However, the underlying mechanisms of such a teleconnection relationship remains unclear. Here we use the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM) to investigate dynamic processes leading to atmospheric circulation and air stagnation responses to Arctic sea ice changes. We conduct four climate sensitivity experiments by perturbing sea ice concentrations (SIC) and corresponding sea surface temperature (SST) in autumn and early winter over the whole Arctic and three subregions in the climate model. The results indicate distinct responses in circulation patterns and regional ventilation to the region-specific Arctic changes, with the largest increase of both the probability (by 132 %) and the intensity (by 30 %) of monthly air stagnation extremes being found in the experiment driven by SIC and SST changes over the Pacific sector of the Arctic (the East Siberian and Chukchi seas). The increased air stagnation extremes are mainly driven by an amplified planetary-scale atmospheric teleconnection pattern that resembles the negative phase of the Eurasian (EU) pattern. Dynamical diagnostics suggest that convergence of transient eddy forcing in the vicinity of Scandinavia in winter is largely responsible for the amplification of the teleconnection pattern. Transient eddy vorticity fluxes dominate the transient eddy forcing and produce a barotropic anticyclonic anomaly near Scandinavia and wave train propagation across Eurasia to the downstream regions in East Asia. The piecewise potential vorticity inversion analysis reveals that this long-range atmospheric teleconnection of Arctic origin takes place primarily via the middle and upper troposphere. The anomalous ridge over East Asia in the middle and upper troposphere worsens regional ventilation conditions by weakening monsoon northwesterlies and enhancing temperature inversions near the surface, leading to more and stronger air stagnation and pollution extremes over eastern China in winter. Ensemble projections based on state-of-the-art climate models in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) corroborate this teleconnection relationship between high-latitude environmental changes and midlatitude weather extremes, though the tendency and magnitude vary considerably among each participating model.","[Zou, Yufei; Wang, Hailong; Rasch, Philip J.] Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Atmospher Sci & Global Change Div, Richland, WA 99354 USA; [Wang, Yuhang] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Earth & Atmospher Sci, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Xie, Zuowei] Chinese Acad Sci, Int Ctr Climate & Environm Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China","United States Department of Energy (DOE); Pacific Northwest National Laboratory; University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS","Zou, YF (corresponding author), Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Atmospher Sci & Global Change Div, Richland, WA 99354 USA.;Wang, YH (corresponding author), Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Earth & Atmospher Sci, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.",yufei.zou@pnnl.gov; yuhang.wang@eas.gatech.edu,"Xie, Zuowei/W-4590-2018; Wang, Hailong/AAM-1464-2021; Wang, Yuhang/B-5578-2014; Wang, Hailong/B-8061-2010; Zou, Yufei/L-9814-2019","Xie, Zuowei/0000-0001-5982-5056; Wang, Hailong/0000-0002-1994-4402; Wang, Yuhang/0000-0002-7290-2551; Wang, Hailong/0000-0002-1994-4402; Zou, Yufei/0000-0003-2667-0697","National Science Foundation Atmospheric Chemistry Program; HiLAT-RASM project through the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Science Regional and Global Model Analysis (RGMA) Program; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41875078]; DOE, Battelle Memorial Institute [DE-AC05-76RL01830]","National Science Foundation Atmospheric Chemistry Program(National Science Foundation (NSF)); HiLAT-RASM project through the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Science Regional and Global Model Analysis (RGMA) Program(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); DOE, Battelle Memorial Institute(United States Department of Energy (DOE))","This research has been supported by the National Science Foundation Atmospheric Chemistry Program (YuhangWang and Yufei Zou) and the HiLAT-RASM project (Yufei Zou, Hailong Wang, and Philip J.

This study evaluated the capability of 30 state-of-the-art climate models among the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) in reproducing the weakening of ENSO-EAWM relationship around the mid-1970s and discussed further the ENSO-EAWM relationship in the 21st century under the RCP4.5 scenario. Evaluation of climate models based on the CMIP5 simulations of the 20th century indicates that 10 out of 30 climate models are capable to reproduce the overall interdecadal shift of the ENSO-EAWM relationship during 1950-2003. However, the temporal evolution of the ENSO-EAWM relationship is difficult to be captured by most models. There are three CMIP5 models (CCSM4, GFDL-CM3, and MPI-ESM-LR) that can well capture the continuous weakening of the ENSO-EAWM relationship around 1976. Based on the three CMIP5 models' simulations, the ENSO-EAWM connection tends to be enhanced in the near term (2016-2046), then weakened, and barely significant during 2047-2067. Finally, the ENSO-EAWM connection appears to largely recover during 2068-2099 but be weaker than that during 2016-2046. We also analyzed the associated processes in the Pacific-Asia-Arctic areas based on the model simulations. It is indicated that there seems to be a seesaw relationship between the ENSO's impact and the influence of the Arctic Oscillation on the EAWM during the 21st century.","[Wang, Huijun; He, Shengping] Chinese Acad Sci, Nansen Zhu Int Res Ctr, Inst Atmospher Phys, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Wang, Huijun; He, Shengping] Chinese Acad Sci, Climate Change Res Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China; [He, Shengping] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Earth Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Liu, Jiping] SUNY Albany, Dept Atmospher & Environm Sci, Albany, NY 12222 USA","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Albany","Wang, HJ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Nansen Zhu Int Res Ctr, Inst Atmospher Phys, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.",wanghj@mail.iap.ac.cn,"HE, Shengping/AAD-5213-2022; He, Shengping/A-4084-2017; LIU, JIPING/N-6696-2016","HE, Shengping/0000-0003-4245-357X; He, Shengping/0000-0003-4245-357X; ","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41130103, 41210007]; CAS-CSIRO Cooperative Research Program [GJHZ1223]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); CAS-CSIRO Cooperative Research Program,"This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under grants 41130103 and 41210007, and CAS-CSIRO Cooperative Research Program (grant GJHZ1223).",,59,46,46,1,51,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",2169-9275,2169-9291,,J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS,J.

In the absence of long homogeneous wind records, the authors present a novel, independent, and homogeneous storm surge record based on water level observations in the North Sea since 1843. Storm surges are characterized by considerable interannual-to-decadal variability linked to large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns. Time periods of increased storm surge levels prevailed in the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries without any evidence for significant long-term trends. This contradicts with recent findings based on reanalysis data, which suggest increasing storminess in the region since the late nineteenth century. The authors compare the wind and pressure fields from the Twentieth-Century Reanalysis (20CRv2) with the storm surge record by applying state-of-the-art empirical wind surge formulas. The comparison reveals that the reanalysis is a valuable tool that leads to good results over the past 100 yr; previously the statistical relationship fails, leaving significantly lower values in the upper percentiles of the predicted surge time series. These low values lead to significant upward trends over the entire investigation period, which are in turn supported by neither the storm surge record nor an independent circulation index based on homogeneous pressure readings. The authors therefore suggest that these differences are related to higher uncertainties in the earlier years of the 20CRv2 over the North Sea region.","[Dangendorf, Soenke; Jensen, Juergen] Univ Siegen, Res Inst Water & Environm, D-57076 Siegen, Germany; [Mueller-Navarra, Sylvin] German Maritime & Hydrog Agcy BSH, Hamburg, Germany; [Schenk, Frederik] Helmholtz Zentrum Geesthacht, Inst Coastal Res, Geesthacht, Germany; [Schenk, Frederik] Royal Inst Technol, Dept Mech, Linne Flow Ctr, S-10044 Stockholm, Sweden; [Wahl, Thomas] Univ S Florida, Coll Marine Sci, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA; [Wahl, Thomas] Univ Siegen, Res Ctr Siegen FoKoS, D-57068 Siegen, Germany; [Weisse, Ralf] Helmholtz Zentrum Geesthacht, Inst Coastal Res, Geesthacht, Germany",Universitat Siegen; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Zentrum Geesthacht - Zentrum fur Material- und Kustenforschung; Royal Institute of Technology; State University System of Florida; University of South Florida; Universitat Siegen; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Zentrum Geesthacht - Zentrum fur Material- und Kustenforschung,"Dangendorf, S (corresponding author), Univ Siegen, Res Inst Water & Environm, Paul Bonatz Str 9-11, D-57076 Siegen, Germany.",soenke.dangendorf@uni-siegen.de,"Dangendorf, Sönke/K-7988-2012; Wahl, Thomas/ABE-6405-2020; Schenk, Frederik/AAI-7824-2020; Weisse, Ralf/E-7550-2013","Dangendorf, Sönke/0000-0002-3679-5234; Schenk, Frederik/0000-0002-4768-9832; Weisse, Ralf/0000-0001-7449-6166",,,,,64,50,50,0,29,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0894-8755,1520-0442,,J CLIMATE,J.

This paper investigates the performances of existing state-of-the-art rule induction and tree algorithms, namely single conjunctive rule learner, decision table, M5 model tree, and REPTree, and explores the impact of climate change on maximum and minimum temperatures (i.e., predictands) of 14 meteorological stations in the Upper Thames River Basin, Ontario, Canada. The data used for evaluation were large-scale predictor variables, extracted from National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research reanalysis dataset and the simulations from third generation Canadian coupled global climate model. Data for four grid points covering the study region were used for developing the downscaling model. M5 model tree algorithm was found to yield better performance among all other learning techniques explored in the present study. Hence, this technique was applied to project predictands generated from GCM using three scenarios (A1B, A2, and B1) for the periods (2046-2065 and 2081-2100). A simple multiplicative shift was used for correcting predictand values. The potential of the downscaling models in simulating predictands was evaluated, and downscaling results reveal that the proposed downscaling model can reproduce local daily predictands from large-scale weather variables. Trend of projected maximum and minimum temperatures was studied for historical as well as downscaled values using GCM and scenario uncertainty. There is likely an increasing trend for T (max) and T (min) for A1B, A2, and B1 scenarios while decreasing trend has been observed for B1 scenarios during 2081-2100.","[Goyal, Manish Kumar; Ojha, C.

Achieving measurement stability at this level is not only very demanding of the design of the instrument, it is also pushes the state of art of measuring on orbit what stability is actually achieved. We discuss this using Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) L1B data collected between 2002 and 2011. We compare the L1B brightness temperature observed in cloud filtered night tropical ocean spectra (obs) to the brightness temperature calculated based on the known surface emissivity, temperature and water vapor profiles from the ECMWF ReAnalysis (ERA) and the growth rates of CO2, N2O and Ozone. The trend in (obs-calc) is a powerful tool for the evaluation of the stability of the 2378 AIRS channels. We divided the channels into seven classes: All channels which sound in the stratosphere (at pressure levels below 150 hPa), 14 um CO2 sounding, 4 um CO2 P-branch sounding, 4um CO2 R-branch sounding, water vapor sounding, shortwave surface sounding and longwave surface sounding. The peak in the weighting function at 1050 hPa separates sounding and surface channels. The boundary between shortwave and longwave is 5 mu m. Except for the stratosphere sounding channels, the remaining six groups have (obs-calc) trends of less than 20 mK/yr. The longwave surface channels have trends of 2 mK/yr, significantly less than the 8 mK/yr trend seem in the shortwave window channels. Based on the design of the instrument, trends within a group of channels should be the same. While the longwave and shortwave trends are less than the canonical 10 mK/yr, the larger trend in the shortwave channels could be an artifact of using the pre-launch determined calibration coefficients. This is currently under evaluation. The trend in (obs-calc) for the non-surface sounding channels, in particular for stratosphere sounding and upper tropospheric water channels, is dominated by artifacts created in calc, most likely due to changes in the ERA Ozone and water vapor. Based on this argument the best estimate of the trend for the channels within a channel group is given by the surface sensitive channels within the group. Based on this consideration we estimated the trend of all AIRS longwave channels as 2 mK/yr, while the shortwave channels have a trend of 8 mK/yr.","[Aumann, H.

However, a certain degree of uncertainty still exists in current studies of long-term SSR changes due to the lack of a state-of-the-art benchmark observational dataset. To understand this issue, we present a systematic comparison of SSR from in-situ observations, the Fifth generation European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) reanalysis (ERA5), and the The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project-Phase 6 (CMIP6) in this paper. Our results show that: (1) The reverse interpolated station SSR series based on the ERA5 and the CMIP6 multi-models ensemble (MME) reflects the observed SSR values at the local/station scale to a certain degree. Although the underestimation/overestimation varies slightly in different regions/stations, the overall Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) are about 15% and 21%, respectively of the observations. (2) Both the ERA5 SSR and the CMIP6 MME roughly reflect the seasonal variability and the spatial distributions of the SSR's climatological means (1971-2000) from gridded in-situ observations. (3) The SSR from the ERA5 is more consistent with observations than the CMIP6 MME in the temporal variations, long-term trend, and the uncertainties at global and continental scales. The latter has insignificant fluctuations in interannual variability, consistent with the trend in-situ observations only from 1950 to 1990, but fails the significant test (at 5% level) after that except for some regions. Therefore, developing a higher quality global long-term SSR benchmark climatic dataset with more complete coverage is still of great significance for optimizing surface energy balance estimates and studies of the impact of human activities on climate change.","[Jiao, Boyang; Li, Qingxiang; Sun, Wenbin] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Atmospher Sci, Minist Educ, Zhuhai 519082, Peoples R China; [Jiao, Boyang; Li, Qingxiang; Sun, Wenbin] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Key Lab Trop Atmosphere Ocean Syst, Minist Educ, Zhuhai 519082, Peoples R China; [Martin, Wild] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, Zurich, Switzerland; [Jiao, Boyang; Li, Qingxiang; Sun, Wenbin] Southern Lab Ocean Sci & Engn Guangdong Zhuhai, Zhuhai 519082, Peoples R China",Sun Yat Sen University; Sun Yat Sen University; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Li, QX (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Atmospher Sci, Minist Educ, Zhuhai 519082, Peoples R China.;Li, QX (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Key Lab Trop Atmosphere Ocean Syst, Minist Educ, Zhuhai 519082, Peoples R China.;Li, QX (corresponding author), Southern Lab Ocean Sci & Engn Guangdong Zhuhai, Zhuhai 519082, Peoples R China.",liqingx5@mail.sysu.edu.cn,"Li, Qingxiang/G-3834-2013","Li, Qingxiang/0000-0002-1424-4108","Natural Science Foundation of China [41975105]; National Key R&D Program of China [2018YFC1507705, 2017YFC1502301]; Federal Office of Meteorology and Climatology MeteoSwiss; Swiss National Science Foundation [200020 188601]",Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key R&D Program of China; Federal Office of Meteorology and Climatology MeteoSwiss; Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission),This study is supported by the Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant: 41975105) and the National Key R&D Program of China (Grant: 2018YFC1507705; 2017YFC1502301).

Numerical experiments with the state-of-the-art land surface models, such as variable infiltration capacity (VIC), without incorporating region-specific practices, could be misleading. Here, we coupled VIC with 2D GW model AMBHAS, incorporating India-specific irrigation practices and crop practices, including submerged paddy fields. We performed numerical experiments to understand the causal factors of GW depletion in the northwest Indo-Gangetic plain (IGP). We identify widespread flood irrigation and cultivation of water-intensive paddy as critical drivers of the declining GW scenario. Our numerical experiments suggest that the introduction of drip irrigation reduces GW depletion in the northwest, but does not change the sign of GW level trends. The GW levels in the non-paddy fields of the middle IGP are less sensitive to irrigation practices due to the high return flow to GW for flood irrigation.","[Joseph, Jisha; Barik, Beas; Ghosh, Subimal] Indian Inst Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India; [Scheidegger, Johanna M.; Jackson, Christopher R.] British Geol Survey, Nottingham, England; [Ghosh, Subimal] Indian Inst Technol, Interdisciplinary Program Climate Studies, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Bombay; UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); NERC British Geological Survey; Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Bombay,"Ghosh, S (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.;Ghosh, S (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol, Interdisciplinary Program Climate Studies, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.",subimal@civil.iitb.ac.in,"Scheidegger, Johanna/HCI-1389-2022","Ghosh, Subimal/0000-0002-5722-1440; Jackson, Christopher/0000-0003-2373-2098","Department of Science and Technology Swarnajayanti Fellowship Scheme [DST/SJF/EASA-01/2018-19, SB/SJF/2019-20/11]; Strategic Program, Large Initiatives and Coordinated Action Enabler (SPLICE); Strategic Program, Climate Change Program [DST/CCP/CoE/140/2018]","Department of Science and Technology Swarnajayanti Fellowship Scheme; Strategic Program, Large Initiatives and Coordinated Action Enabler (SPLICE); Strategic Program, Climate Change Program","The work is financially supported by Department of Science and Technology Swarnajayanti Fellowship Scheme, through Project Nos.

The greatest SEP storm known for the last 11 millennia (the Holocene) occurred in 774-775 AD, serving as a likely worst-case scenario being 40-50 times stronger than any directly observed one. Here we present a systematic analysis of the impact such an extreme event can have on the Earth's atmosphere. Using state-of-the-art cosmic ray cascade and chemistry-climate models, we successfully reproduce the observed variability of cosmogenic isotope Be-10, around 775 AD, in four ice cores from Greenland and Antarctica, thereby validating the models in the assessment of this event. We add to prior conclusions that any nitrate deposition signal from SEP events remains too weak to be detected in ice cores by showing that, even for such an extreme solar storm and sub-annual data resolution, the nitrate deposition signal is indistinguishable from the seasonal cycle. We show that such a severe event is able to perturb the polar stratosphere for at least one year, leading to regional changes in the surface temperature during northern hemisphere winters.","[Sukhodolov, Timofei; Rozanov, Eugene; Ball, William T.; Schmutz, Werner] Phys Meteorol Observ Davos World Radiat Ctr, Davos, Switzerland; [Sukhodolov, Timofei; Rozanov, Eugene; Ball, William T.; Peter, Thomas] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, Zurich, Switzerland; [Usoskin, Ilya; Asvestari, Eleanna] Univ Oulu, Space Climate Res Grp, Oulu, Finland; [Usoskin, Ilya] Univ Oulu, Sodankyla Geophys Observ, Oulu, Finland; [Curran, Mark A.

In the highlands of New Guinea, climatic and environmental changes across this period have been highlighted as potential drivers of one of the earliest domestication processes in the world. We present a terminal Pleistocene/Holocene palaeoenvironmental record (12-0 thousand years ago) of carbon and oxygen isotopes in small mammal tooth enamel from the site of Kiowa. The results show that tropical highland forest and open mosaics, and the human subsistence focused on these environments, remained stable throughout the period in which agriculture emerged at nearby Kuk Swamp. This suggests the persistence of tropical forest foraging among highland New Guinea groups and highlights that agriculture in the region was not adopted as a unilinear or dramatic, forced event but was locally and historically contingent.","[Roberts, Patrick] Max Planck Inst Sci Human Hist, D-07745 Jena, Thuringia, Germany; [Roberts, Patrick; Lee-Thorp, Julia] Univ Oxford, Sch Archaeol, Res Lab Archaeol & Hist Art, Oxford OX1 3QY, Oxon, England; [Gaffney, Dylan; Summerhayes, Glenn] Univ Otago, Dept Anthropol & Archaeol, Dunedin 9054, Otago, New Zealand",University of Oxford; University of Otago,"Roberts, P (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Sci Human Hist, D-07745 Jena, Thuringia, Germany.;Roberts, P (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Sch Archaeol, Res Lab Archaeol & Hist Art, Oxford OX1 3QY, Oxon, England.",roberts@shh.mpg.de,,"Roberts, Patrick/0000-0002-4403-7548; Gaffney, Dylan/0000-0003-4869-9730; summerhayes, glenn/0000-0002-0654-1305","Natural Environmental Research Council; Boise Fund, University of Oxford; National Museum and Art Gallery of Papua New Guinea","Natural Environmental Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Boise Fund, University of Oxford; National Museum and Art Gallery of Papua New Guinea","This project was funded by grants from the Natural Environmental Research Council and the Boise Fund, University of Oxford (to P.R.).

Biofuels are arguably a potential renewable energy source in the transportation industry as they can be used within current infrastructures and require less technological advances than other renewable alternatives, such as electric vehicles and nuclear power. The literature suggests biofuels can negatively impact food security and production; however, this is dependent on the type of feedstock used in biofuel production. Advanced biofuels, derived from inedible biomass, are heavily favoured but require further research and development to reach their full commercial potential. Replacing fossil fuels by biofuels can substantially reduce particulate matter (PM), carbon monoxide (CO) emissions, but simultaneously increase emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx), acetaldehyde (CH3CHO) and peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN), resulting in debates concerning the way biofuels should be implemented. The potential biofuel blends (FT-SPK, HEFA-SPK, ATJ-SPK and HFS-SIP) and their use as an alternative to kerosene-type fuels in the aviation industry have also been assessed. Although these fuels are currently more costly than conventional aviation fuels, possible reduction in production costs has been reported as a potential solution. A preliminary study shows that i-butanol emissions (1.8 Tg/year) as a biofuel can increase ozone levels by up to 6% in the upper troposphere, highlighting a potential climate impact. However, a larger number of studies will be needed to assess the practicalities and associated cost of using the biofuel in existing vehicles, particularly in terms of identifying any modifications to existing engine infrastructure, the impact of biofuel emissions, and their chemistry on the climate and human health, to fully determine their suitability as a potential renewable energy source.</p>","[Khan, M.

However, how to devise an EWA estimator to track quantiles of data stream distributions is not obvious. In this paper, we present a lightweight quantile estimator using a generalized form of the EWA. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first reported quantile estimator of this form in the literature. An appealing property of the estimator is that the update step size is adjusted online proportionally to the difference between current observation and the current quantile estimate. Thus, if the estimator is off-track compared to the data stream, large steps will be taken to promptly get the estimator back on-track. The convergence of the estimator to the true quantile is proven using the theory of stochastic learning. Extensive experimental results using both synthetic and real-life data show that our estimator clearly outperforms legacy state-of-the-art quantile tracking estimators and achieves faster adaptivity in dynamic environments. The quantile estimator was further tested on real-life data where the objective is efficient in online control of indoor climate. We show that the estimator can be incorporated into a concept drift detector to efficiently decide when a machine learning model used to predict future indoor temperature should be retrained/updated.","[Hammer, Hugo Lewi; Yazidi, Anis] OsloMet Oslo Metropolitan Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Pilestredet 35, N-0166 Oslo, Norway; [Rue, Havard] King Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol, Stat Comp Elect & Math Sci & Engn Div, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia",Oslo Metropolitan University (OsloMet); King Abdullah University of Science & Technology,"Hammer, HL (corresponding author), OsloMet Oslo Metropolitan Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Pilestredet 35, N-0166 Oslo, Norway.",hugo.hammer@oslomet.no,"Rue, Håvard/ABG-3397-2021","Rue, Håvard/0000-0002-0222-1881; Hammer, Hugo Lewi/0000-0001-9429-7148",,,,,41,7,7,0,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-669X,1573-7497,,APPL INTELL,Appl.

Technologies which must be developed for this research are those which measure and evaluate the soundness and safety of structures based on the measurements of an attached sensor. During the research period, optical fiber sensor patches and wireless sensor capsule implants along with various sensor technologies, stress sensing and structure condition evaluation technologies, high durability sensors and low-power compact smart structure sensors will be developed effectively for network hardware technologies. Similarly high precision image processing for automatic crack extraction will be developed along with radiation sensor application technologies, combined management/control technologies for development systems, and practical technologies for building/large structure development systems. Through the results, we hope to acquire higher sensor system performance with a measurement scope (for precision, etc.) goal at least 200% better than conventional sensor systems.

Evidence suggests that early springtime Arctic stratospheric ozone acts as a proxy for extreme events in the winter polar vortex. Here, using a state-of-the-art chemistry-climate model, reanalysis and observations, we extend the forecast potential of ozone on surface temperatures to aspects of the Northern Hemisphere cryosphere. Sea ice fraction and sea ice extent differences between years of March high and low Arctic stratospheric ozone extremes show excellent agreement between an ensemble of chemistry-climate model simulations and observations, with differences occurring not just in April but extending through to the following winter season in some locations. Large snow depth differences are also obtained in regional locations in Russia and along the southeast coast of Alaska. These differences remain elevated until early summer, when snow cover diminishes. Using a conditional empirical model in a leave-three-out cross validation method, March total column ozone is able to accurately predict the sign of the observed sea ice extent and snow depth anomalies over 70% of the time during an ozone extreme year, especially in the region of the Bering strait and the Greenland Sea, which could be useful for shipping routes and for testing climate models.","[Stone, Kane A.; Solomon, Susan] MIT, Dept Earth Atmospher & Planetary Sci, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Kinnison, Douglas E.] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Atmospher Chem Observat & Modeling Lab, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA,"Stone, KA (corresponding author), MIT, Dept Earth Atmospher & Planetary Sci, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",stonek@mit.edu,,"Kinnison, Douglas/0000-0002-3418-0834","National Science Foundation [1419667, 1338814, 1848863]; National Science Foundation; New Zealand Deep South National Science Challenge",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); New Zealand Deep South National Science Challenge,"K.

A Requirement for Top-Down and Bottom-up Decision-Making Processes,HANDBOOK OF CLIMATE SERVICES,Climate Change Management,,English,Article; Book Chapter,,,,,,,EMISSIONS,"For the first time, a global pact has been reached to set a common global limit on emissions which is quantifiable and therefore provides thresholds upon which to establish nation's emission reductions pathways. This pact is the Paris Agreement (2015), by which its signatories agreed according to Art. 2.1 lit. a to make efforts to halt the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 degrees C above pre-industrial levels (in the following well below 2 degrees C limit or <2 degrees C limit) and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees C above preindustrial levels. This decision came from the recognition that these actions would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change. The well below 2 degrees C limit is based on the recommendations of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)'s Fifth Assessment Report. Regional and national policies have been enacted as a response to this limit, but evidence between these national targets' actual contribution to keeping global temperatures below 2 degrees C is weak. This weakness is presumably associated with the fact that climate targets are often decided without properly taking climate science into consideration. If scientific information by which the alignment of policy strategies and plans with the <2 degrees C limit is missing, how can we claim that regions, countries and states' targets are in line with the Paris Agreement? Another weakness in established targets has to do with how economic players such as sectors and companies are incorporated into the equation. It seems to be a reasonable approach to set climate targets at different levels, from a top-down and a bottom-up approach in order to increase the likelihood of maintaining temperatures well below the 2 degrees C limit. The targets established at a top-down level need to bear relation to the targets established at lower levels. The manner in which they correlate can be provided by the well below 2 degrees C limit defined by the Paris Agreement. By targets at higher levels and at lower levels been set with one same reference point, the 2 degrees C limit, the likelihood of an appropriate correspondence between targets is highly incremented. The research question that will be explored in this article is if using science-based information can assist in making the meeting point represented by the 2 degrees C limit, workable from two directions: top-down and bottom-up.","[Mueller, Sebastian; Scarpellini, Marcela] Based Sci, Frankfurt, Germany",,"Muller, S; Scarpellini, M (corresponding author), Based Sci, Frankfurt, Germany.",s.mueller@right-basedonscience.de; m.scarpellini@right-basedonscience.de,,,,,,,29,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1610-2010,,978-3-030-36875-3; 978-3-030-36874-6,CLIM CHANG MANAG,,,2020,,,,,203,222,,10.1007/978-3-030-36875-3_11,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-36875-3_11,10.1007/978-3-030-36875-3,,20,Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies; Public Administration,Book Citation Index – Social Sciences & Humanities (BKCI-SSH); Book Citation Index – Science (BKCI-S),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public Administration,BR8WF,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000674456500012,View Full Record in Web of Science

Using a state-of-the-art transient climate simulation, we confirm this proxy-inferred phenomenon, and estimate the sensitivity of EASM circulation to summer temperature over adjacent region (defined as S-MT here) is about five times over the Holocene of that over the last deglaciation. This varying S-MT attributed to the diverse S-MT under the solo forcing of orbital insolation and CO2 (eight times of the former vs. the latter), and their varying confounding effect along time. The results presented here should improve our understanding of the past change of EASM, and help project its variation magnitude under ongoing CO2-forced global warming. Plain Language Summary The East Asia summer monsoon (EASM) dominates the eco-environment of a region where nearly 1.6 billion people live. Its past change pushed the evolution of ancient Chinese culture, and its future change under global warming will force 1/5 of the world population to adapt. Paleoclimate records reveal a robust phenomenon of stronger EASM under a warmer world and vice versa, but the sensitivity of EASM to temperature seemed varying since the last ice age. Climate simulation confirms this phenomenon and illustrates the dominance of forcing (changes in orbital parameter and CO2 concentration) in terms of response magnitude of EASM.

We developed a 735-year-long Pinus heldreichii chronology from the southern distribution limit of the species, expanding the available database of long Bosnian pine chronologies. Tree-ring growth was mainly positively correlated with growing degree days (GDD: r(1950-2018) = 0.476) while higher temperatures during both winter and growing season also enhanced growth (T-WT: r(1950-2018) = 0.361 and T-GS: 0.289, respectively). Annual precipitation, during both calendar and water years, had a negative but weaker impact on annual tree growth. The newly developed chronology correlates well with chronologies developed from the neighboring mountains. The years with ring width index (RWI) lower than the average were found to correspond to cool years with dry summers. Still, the newly developed chronology was able to capture severe drought events, such as those in 1660, 1687, and 1725. Several old living trees had internal scars presumably caused by fires. Therefore, old mature trees could be used for fire history reconstruction in addition to climate reconstruction. Although the presence of lightning scars indicates an important natural agent of fire ignition, human activities associated with animal grazing could also be an underlying reason for fires in the region.","[Christopoulou, Anastasia; Gminska-Nowak, Barbara; Wazny, Tomasz] Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Fac Fine Arts, Ctr Res & Conservat Cultural Heritage, PL-87100 Torun, Poland; [Christopoulou, Anastasia; Arianoutsou, Margarita] Natl & Kapodistrian Univ Athens, Fac Biol, Dept Ecol & Systemat, Athens 15784, Greece; [Fyllas, Nikolaos M.] Univ Aegean, Dept Environm, Biodivers Conservat Lab, Mitilini 81100, Greece; [Ozarslan, Yasemin] Koc Univ, Dept Archaeol & Hist Art, TR-34450 Istanbul, Turkey; [Brandes, Robert] Geuschmidstr 8, D-90480 Nurnberg, Germany",Nicolaus Copernicus University; National & Kapodistrian University of Athens; University of Aegean; Koc University,"Christopoulou, A (corresponding author), Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Fac Fine Arts, Ctr Res & Conservat Cultural Heritage, PL-87100 Torun, Poland.;Christopoulou, A (corresponding author), Natl & Kapodistrian Univ Athens, Fac Biol, Dept Ecol & Systemat, Athens 15784, Greece.",anchristo@umk.pl,"Arianoutsou, Margarita/ABA-1614-2021; Christopoulou, Anastasia/ABF-6681-2021","Christopoulou, Anastasia/0000-0003-1603-1402; Fyllas, Nikolaos/0000-0002-5651-5578","National Science Center, Poland [2016/22/A/HS3/00285]","National Science Center, Poland(National Science Centre, Poland)","This research was funded by the National Science Center, Poland, project nr 2016/22/A/HS3/00285.",,76,2,2,0,5,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0931-1890,1432-2285,,TREES-STRUCT FUNCT,Trees-Struct.

An increasing number of Western consumers would replace, at least partially, meat with alternative protein sources. This review aims at: (i) depicting nutritional, functional, sensory traits, and critical issues of single-cell proteins (SCP), filamentous fungi, microalgae, vegetables (alone or mixed with milk), and insects and (ii) displaying how fermentation could improve their quality, to facilitate their use as food items/ingredients/supplements. Production of SCP (yeasts, filamentous fungi, microalgae) does not need arable land and potable water and can run continuously, also using wastes and byproducts. Some filamentous fungi are also consumed as edible mushrooms, and others are involved in the fermentation of traditional vegetable-based foods. Cereals, pseudocereals, and legumes may be combined to offer an almost complete amino acid profile. Fermentation of such vegetables, even in combination with milk-based products (e.g., tarhana), could increase nutrient concentrations, including essential amino acids, and improve sensory traits. Different insects could be used, as such or, to increase their acceptability, as ingredient of foods (e.g., pasta). However, insects as a protein source face with safety concerns, cultural constraints, and a lack of international regulatory framework.","[Molfetta, Mariagrazia; Bruno, Giovanni Luigi; Porcelli, Francesco; Minervini, Fabio] Univ Bari Aldo Moro, Dipartimento Sci Suolo Pianta & Alimenti, Via Amendola 165-A, I-70126 Bari, Italy; [Morais, Etiele G.; Barreira, Luisa] Univ Algarve, Ctr Ciencias Mar CCMAR, P-8005139 Faro, Portugal; [Dugat-Bony, Eric; Bonnarme, Pascal] Univ Paris Saclay, AgroParisTech, INRAE, UMR SayFood, Ave Lucien Bretignieres, F-78850 Thiverval Grignon, France",Universita degli Studi di Bari Aldo Moro; Universidade do Algarve; AgroParisTech; INRAE; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay,"Minervini, F (corresponding author), Univ Bari Aldo Moro, Dipartimento Sci Suolo Pianta & Alimenti, Via Amendola 165-A, I-70126 Bari, Italy.",mariagrazia.molfetta@gmail.com; etiele@gmail.com; lbarreir@ualg.pt; giovanniluigi.bruno@uniba.it; francesco.porcelli@uniba.it; eric.dugat-bony@inrae.fr; pascal.bonnarme@inrae.fr; fabio.minervini@uniba.it,"Dugat-Bony, Eric/K-2455-2014; Morais, Etiele/W-1934-2018; Barreira, Luisa/M-4164-2013","Dugat-Bony, Eric/0000-0002-5182-0063; Minervini, Fabio/0000-0003-1062-9374; Morais, Etiele/0000-0003-2993-8572; Francesco, Porcelli/0000-0001-5620-7826; Barreira, Luisa/0000-0002-4077-855X; Bonnarme, Pascal/0000-0001-7185-8723; Bruno, Giovanni Luigi/0000-0003-0207-2713",project SYSTEMIC; Belgium (FWO); France (INRAE); Germany (BLE); Italy (MIPAAF); Latvia (IZM); Norway (RCN); Portugal (FCT); Spain (AEI),project SYSTEMIC; Belgium (FWO)(FWO); France (INRAE); Germany (BLE); Italy (MIPAAF); Latvia (IZM)(Latvian Ministry of Education and Science); Norway (RCN); Portugal (FCT)(Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology); Spain (AEI),"This research was funded by the project SYSTEMIC.

For the purpose of reaching to a right decision one has to add up a plus value to the past experiences. Traditional settlement areas in the mid Mesarya region of Cyprus are natural laboratories which scientifically will provide guidance to such plus values. In this study, by application of an Observation Method, construction systems, building materials and natural ventilation of rural houses built during a period beginning from the 19th century through the first half of the 20th century; under the Mediterranean semi-arid climate in the Mesarya region has been investigated. For the verification the findings obtained by such an Observation method, three houses in the village of Gonendere (Konetra) in the Mesarya region were chosen. The building systems of the first and the second houses were by the method of stacking up and the construction materials of the walls were by mud-bricks. The third house was built by a concrete frame and the walls were built by ordinary bricks. In order to be able to record the temperature and humidity values at every one hour intervals, appropriate instruments (Ebro Electronic Gmb H& Co, Model (EBL 20-TH) have been placed both indoors and outdoors under shade of each of the three houses during a one week period between the 23rd and 30th of August 2009. The same recordings have been continued during the months of December 2009 and January, February and March 2010. All data collected from these instruments has been also compared with data collected by the local meteorological stations. This study showed that the climatic conditions constitute a primary effect on the selection of the building site in the first place and furthermore the planning and formation of the functional relationship between volumes, the construction systems and finally the selection of the building materials.","[Salihoglu, Turgay] YDU Mimarl Fak, Lefkosa, Turkey",,"Salihoglu, T (corresponding author), YDU Mimarl Fak, Lefkosa, Turkey.",turgay.salihoglu@neu.edu.tr,,,,,,,16,1,1,0,3,ISTANBUL KULTUR UNIV,ISTANBUL,"ATAKOY CAMPUS, BAKIRKOY, ISTANBUL, 34156, TURKEY",2146-5193,,,TURK ONLINE J DES AR,Turk.

With social sci-entific research on CCS having increased considerably over the last decade, this paper offers a first compre-hensive review and evaluation of studies that investigate the way CCS projects are communicated to (local) stakeholders and the general public. We conduct a systematic review of 115 papers for a state-of-the-art assessment of research on communication practices in CCS projects. Based on this review we compile an extensive list of the recommendations provided for CCS outreach activities and scrutinize it for limitations. This enables us to show that best practices in communication need to be applied in context sensitive approaches and to highlight factors in communication (such as social media) which have been underutilized up to now. Furthermore, we identify two conceptual shortcomings that limit the scope of CCS communication research: first, the majority of the literature refers to CCS as applied to the fossil fuel-based energy sector and thereby narrows the debate. Second, while the social scientific debate has moved on from the mere study of acceptance of CCS to practices of communication, we find that the theoretical lens applied to communication is still largely focused on convincing people to accept CCS. We argue that future research should tackle these shortcomings by paying more attention to CCS projects that go beyond coal or natural gas power plants. Additionally, it is advised to theo-retically reframe communication efforts by emphasizing long-term alliance building through participation and joint goals instead of focussing on short-term persuasion and simple strategies of raising acceptance.","[Otto, Danny; Gross, Matthias] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Urban & Environm Sociol, Permoserstr 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany; [Gross, Matthias] Univ Jena, Inst Sociol, Bachstr 18k, D-07743 Jena, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ); Friedrich Schiller University of Jena,"Otto, D (corresponding author), UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Urban & Environm Sociol, Permoserstr 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany.",danny.otto@ufz.de,"Gross, Matthias/A-4634-2012","Gross, Matthias/0000-0002-3716-7512; Otto, Danny/0000-0001-6045-5531","research project: DigiMon -Digital Monitoring of CO2 Storage Projects, Research Council of Norway, ACT [299622]","research project: DigiMon -Digital Monitoring of CO2 Storage Projects, Research Council of Norway, ACT","This work is partly funded by the research project: DigiMon -Digital Monitoring of CO2 Storage Projects, Research Council of Norway, ACT.

The objective of this article is to discuss aspects inherent to the state of the art on dendroclimatic methods and their application in the tropical forests of the Amazon region for analysis of the formation of growth rings in woody plants. The review on the subject was carried out in several bibliographic bases, both classic and more recent, and it was found that, although it is an ancient science, there are still few dendroclimatic studies conducted in the Amazon basin.

We used a spatial food web (Ecospace) model, forced by a physical-biogeochemical model. The scenarios are built on consistent storylines that describe plausible developments of climatic and socioeconomic factors in the Baltic Sea region. Modelled species diversity and fish catches are driven by climate- and nutrient load-related changes in habitat quality and by fisheries management strategies. Our results suggest that a scenario including low greenhouse gas concentrations and nutrient pollution and ecologically focused fisheries management results in high biodiversity and catch value. On the other hand, scenarios envisioning increasing societal inequality or economic growth based on fossil fuels, high greenhouse gas emissions and high nutrient loads result in decreased habitat quality and diminished biodiversity. Under the latter scenarios catches are high but they predominantly consist of lower-valued fish.","[Bauer, Barbara; Gustafsson, Bo G.; Mueller-Karulis, Baerbel; Tomczak, Maciej T.] Stockholm Univ, Balt Sea Ctr, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Bauer, Barbara] Friedrich Schiller Univ Jena, Inst Ecol, Jena, Germany; [Bauer, Barbara] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Deutsch Pl 5e, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Gustafsson, Bo G.] Univ Helsinki, Tvarminne Zool Stn, JA Palmenin Tie 260, Hango, Finland; [Hyytiainen, Kari] Univ Helsinki, Dept Econ & Management, POB 27, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Meier, H.

However, intercomparison studies show that the mapping methods used to interpolate sparse ocean temperature profile data are a key source of uncertainty. We present a new approach to assessing OHC mapping methods using 'synthetic profiles' generated from a state-of-the-art global climate model simulation. Synthetic profiles have the same sampling characteristics as the historical ocean temperature profile data but are based on model simulation data. Mapping methods ingest these data in the same way as they would real observations, but the resultant mapped fields can be compared to a model simulation 'truth'. We use this approach to assess two mapping methods that are used routinely for climate monitoring and initialisation of decadal forecasts. The introduction of the Argo network of autonomous profiling floats during the 2000s drives clear improvements in the ability of these methods to reconstruct the variability and spatial structure of OHC changes. At depths below 2000 m, both methods underestimate the magnitude of the simulated ocean warming signal. Temporal variability and trends in OHC are better captured in the better-observed northern hemisphere than in the southern hemisphere. At all depths, the sampling characteristics of the historical data introduces some spurious variability in the estimates of global OHC on sub-annual to multi-annual timescales. However, many of the large scale spatial anomalies, especially in the upper ocean, are successfully reconstructed even with sparse observations from the 1960s, demonstrating the potential to construct historical ocean analyses for assessing decadal predictions. The value of using accurate global covariances for data-poor periods is clearly seen. The results of this 'proof-of-concept' study are encouraging for gaining further insights into the capabilities and limitations of different mapping methods and for quantifying uncertainty in global OHC estimates.","[Allison, L.

In addition to these data, there is information that can serve as independent tests of the calibration curve. For example, information from ice core radionuclide data cannot be directly incorporated into the calibration curve construction as it delivers less direct information on the C-14 age-calendar age relationship but it can provide tests of the quality of the calibration curve. Furthermore, ice core ages on C-14-dated volcanic eruptions provide key information on the agreement of ice core and radiocarbon time scales. Due to their scarcity such data would have little impact if directly incorporated into the calibration curve. However, these serve as important anchor points in time for independently testing the calibration curve and/or ice-core time scales. Here we will show that such information largely supports the new IntCal20 calibration record. Furthermore, we discuss how floating tree-ring sequences on ice-core time scales agree with the new calibration curve. For the period around 40,000 years ago we discuss unresolved differences between ice core Be-10 and C-14 records that are possibly related to our limited understanding of carbon cycle influences on the atmospheric C-14 concentration during the last glacial period. Finally, we review the results on the time scale comparison between the Greenland ice-core time scale (GICC05) and IntCal20 that effectively allow a direct comparison of C-14-dated records with the Greenland ice core data.","[Muscheler, Raimund; Adolphi, Florian] Lund Univ, Dept Geol, Quaternary Sci, Lund, Sweden; [Adolphi, Florian] Univ Bern, Climate & Environm Phys & Oeschger Ctr Climate Ch, Phys Inst, Bern, Switzerland; [Heaton, Timothy J.] Univ Sheffield, Sch Math & Stat, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Ramsey, Christopher Bronk] Univ Oxford, Res Lab Archaeol & Hist Art, Oxford, England; [Svensson, Anders] Ice and Climate Res Univ Copenhagen, Niels Bohr Inst, Copenhagen, Denmark; [van der Plicht, Johannes] Univ Groningen, Ctr Isotopen Onderzoek, Nijenborgh, Netherlands; [Reimer, Paula J.] Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Nat & Built Environm, 14CHRONO Ctr Climate Environm & Chronol, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland",Lund University; University of Bern; University of Sheffield; University of Oxford; University of Copenhagen; Niels Bohr Institute; University of Groningen; Queens University Belfast,"Muscheler, R (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Dept Geol, Quaternary Sci, Lund, Sweden.",raimund.muscheler@geol.lu.se,"Heaton, Timothy J/AFJ-8295-2022; Ramsey, Christopher Bronk/AAQ-2227-2021; Heaton, Tim/AAF-5132-2022; Svensson, Anders/A-2643-2010","Heaton, Timothy J/0000-0002-9994-142X; Ramsey, Christopher Bronk/0000-0002-8641-9309; Svensson, Anders/0000-0002-4364-6085; Reimer, Paula/0000-0001-9238-2146; Muscheler, Raimund/0000-0003-2772-3631","Swedish Research Council [DNR2013-8421]; Swedish Research Council (Vetenskapsradet) [2016-00218]; Leverhulme Trust [RF-2019-140\9]; UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NRCF010002]; NERC [NRCF010002, NE/H007865/1] Funding Source: UKRI",Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research CouncilEuropean Commission); Swedish Research Council (Vetenskapsradet)(Swedish Research Council); Leverhulme Trust(Leverhulme Trust); UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),This work was supported by the Swedish Research Council (grant DNR2013-8421 to RM).

The validation focuses on the predominant process connecting the spring AO with the East Asian summer monsoon: the formation and persistence of the spring AO-associated cyclonic anomaly over western North Pacific (WPCA) from spring to summer. The results indicate that 8 of 16 models can reproduce both the formation and persistence of the WPCA. Because the formation of the WPCA is directly related to the existence of the spring upper-level North Pacific atmospheric dipole (NPAD), the analyses suggest that a given model can reproduce the spring AO-associated NPAD if the model is capable of simulating the spring AO-associated deceleration of the subtropical westerly jet and the transient eddy activities around the westerly jet exit. Furthermore, the westerly jet anomalies are closely related to the simulated mean state of the westerly jet and the AO Pacific component, which could be further attributed to the simulated sea surface temperature biases over the equatorial Western Pacific.","[Gao, Miaoni; Yang, Jing; Gong, Daoyi; He, Haozhe] Beijing Normal Univ, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, 19 Xinjiekouwai St, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Kim, Seong-Joong] Korea Polar Res Inst, Div Climate Change, Inchon, South Korea",Beijing Normal University; Korea Institute of Ocean Science & Technology (KIOST); Korea Polar Research Institute (KOPRI),"Yang, J (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, 19 Xinjiekouwai St, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",yangjing@bnu.edu.cn,"Yang, Jing/C-6597-2013","Yang, Jing/0000-0001-7063-6264","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41321001, 41375003]; Beijing Higher Education Young Elite Teacher Project; Korea Polar Research Institute [PE15010]",National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Beijing Higher Education Young Elite Teacher Project; Korea Polar Research Institute(Korea Polar Research Institute of Marine Research Placement (KOPRI)),"This study was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC, grant nos. 41321001 and 41375003), the Beijing Higher Education Young Elite Teacher Project and the project 'Investigation of Climate Change Mechanism by Observation and Simulation of the Polar Climate, Past and Present' (PE15010) of the Korea Polar Research Institute.

The limited range and long charging times of electric vehicles compared to fuel stops are major problems for widespread use. The energy required to heat a battery powered electric vehicle during cold weather conditions has a significant impact on the achievable driving range. The driving range in winter is reduced by almost 50 % compared to the manufacturer specification based on the New European Driving Cycle. The negative impact of a heating or airconditioning unit on the driving range of battery powered electric vehicles is estimated at about 20 % to 30 %. This paper's contribution to the current state of the art is an objective evaluation and quantification of the range extension of an electric vehicle that can be achieved using a separate powered heating unit. This heating unit allows the vehicle's standard heating unit to be completely switched off and thus saves energy for supplying the electric powertrain. Furthermore, test drives with our university's modified electric research vehicle are performed under real driving conditions during German winter months of early 2018. Based on the findings of this work, the conclusion is that the usage of a separate heating unit in a battery powered electric vehicle is a good way to extend the available range during winter. The achievable range extension in battery powered electric vehicles up to 21.6 % could pushelectro mobility.","[Riess, Christian; Walter, Michael S.

This is still the subject of controversy, and has been the focus of modeling work from low-dimensional models up to state-of-the-art general circulation models. In our present global climate, the ocean plays a large role in redistributing heat from the equatorial regions to high latitudes, and as an important part of the global heat budget, its role in the initiation a Snowball Earth, and the subsequent climate, is of great interest. To better understand the role of oceanic heat transport in the initiation of Snowball Earth, and the resulting global ice covered climate state, the goal of this inquiry is twofold: we wish to propose the least complex model that can capture the Snowball Earth scenario as well as the present-day climate with partial ice cover, and we want to determine the relative importance of oceanic heat transport. To do this, we develop a simple model, incorporating thermohaline dynamics from traditional box ocean models, a radiative balance from energy balance models, and the more contemporary sea glacier model to account for viscous flow effects of extremely thick sea ice. The resulting model, consisting of dynamic ocean and ice components, is able to reproduce both Snowball Earth and present-day conditions through reasonable changes in forcing parameters. We find that including or neglecting oceanic heat transport may lead to vastly different global climate states, and also that the parameterization of under-ice heat transfer in the ice-ocean coupling plays a key role in the resulting global climate state, demonstrating the regulatory effect of dynamic ocean heat transport.","[Comeau, Darin] NYU, Courant Inst Math Sci, Ctr Atmosphere Ocean Sci, New York, NY USA; [Kurtze, Douglas A.] St Josephs Univ, Dept Phys, Philadelphia, PA 19131 USA; [Restrepo, Juan M.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Math, Coll Earth Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA",New York University; Saint Joseph's University; Oregon State University,"Comeau, D (corresponding author), Los Alamos Natl Lab, Computat Phys & Methods Grp, Los Alamos, NM 87544 USA.",comeau@cims.nyu.edu,"Restrepo, Juan M./O-3400-2019","Restrepo, Juan M./0000-0003-2609-2882; Comeau, Darin/0000-0003-4758-4253","GoMRI/BP and from NSF DMS [0304890]; American Institute of Mathematics, an NSF","GoMRI/BP and from NSF DMS; American Institute of Mathematics, an NSF","Funding for this work was received from GoMRI/BP and from NSF DMS grant 0304890.

As this increase is most pronounced in winter, temperature seasonality (S-T)-conventionally defined as the difference between summer and winter temperatures-is diminishing over time(2), a phenomenon that is analogous to its equatorward decline at an annual scale. The initiation, termination and performance of vegetation photosynthetic activity are tied to threshold temperatures(3). Trends in the timing of these thresholds and cumulative temperatures above them may alter vegetation productivity, or modify vegetation seasonality (S-V), over time. The relationship between S-T and S-V is critically examined here with newly improved ground and satellite data sets. The observed diminishment of S-T and S-V, is equivalent to 4 degrees and 7 degrees (5 degrees and 6 degrees) latitudinal shift equatorward during the past 30 years in the Arctic. (boreal) region. Analysis of simulations from 17 state-of-the-art climate models(4) indicates an additional S-T diminishment equivalent to a 20 equatorward shift could occur this century. How S-V will change in response to such large projected S-T declines and the impact this will have on ecosystem services(5) are not well understood. Hence the need for continued monitoring(6) of northern lands as their seasonal temperature profiles evolve to resemble those further south.","[Xu, L.; Myneni, R. B.; Zhu, Z.; Bi, J.; Anderson, B.

The soil properties in the model are initialized with field measurements and are driven by half-hourly observed atmospheric variables (temperature, humidity, wind speed, surface pressure and downward radiation (solar and infrared). The observation (or direct measurements) of the soil properties and atmospheric fields are collected through the Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX) Asian Monsoon Experiment (GAME)-Tibet project. Results indicate the CLM is able to capture general characteristics of soil in Tibetan Plateau. The model shows sensitivity to initial soil properties, particularly soil moisture. The initial error in the soil moisture contributes largely the simulated bias in soil moisture.","CMA, Key Lab Radiometr Calibrat & Validat Environm Sat, LRCVES, Beijing, Peoples R China",China Meteorological Administration,"Lu, QF (corresponding author), CMA, Key Lab Radiometr Calibrat & Validat Environm Sat, LRCVES, Beijing, Peoples R China.",,"Gao, Wei/GXH-0380-2022",,,,,,40,0,0,0,4,SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING,BELLINGHAM,"1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010 USA",0277-786X,,0-8194-6377-9,P SOC PHOTO-OPT INS,,,2006,,,,,H2981,H2981,62981H,10.1117/12.676199,http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.676199,,,7,Ecology; Remote Sensing,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Remote Sensing,BFM14,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000243026400040,View Full Record in Web of Science

It examines the amount, origin, extent, and content of research and peer-reviewed documentation over the last decades. The findings allow new insights regarding the preferred models and the evaluation tools that have been used to date and that are recommended to use in the future.

We analyze 20th Century simulations using nine state-of-the-art climate models and show that all models estimate a global annual mean reduction in downward surface solar radiation of 1-4 W/m(2) at the same time that the globe warms by 0.4-0.7 degrees C. In single forcing simulations using the GISS-ER model, this global dimming signal is shown to be predominantly related to aerosol effects. In the global mean sense the surface adjusts to changes in downward solar flux instantaneously by reducing the upward fluxes of longwave, latent and sensible heat. Adding increased greenhouse gas forcing traps outgoing longwave radiation in the atmosphere and surface which results in net heating ( although reduced) that is consistent with global warming over the 20th Century. Over the 1984-2000 period, individual model simulations show widely disparate results, mostly related to cloud changes associated with tropical Pacific variations, similar to the changes inferred from the satellite data analysis. This suggests that this time period is not sufficient to determine longer term trends.","Columbia Univ, Dept Appl Math & Phys, New York, NY 10025 USA; Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY 10964 USA; NASA, Goddard Inst Space Studies, New York, NY 10025 USA; Sigma Space Partners, New York, NY 10025 USA",Columbia University; Columbia University; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center,"Romanou, A (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Dept Appl Math & Phys, Armstrong Hall, New York, NY 10025 USA.",ar2235@columbia.edu,"Rossow, William B/F-3138-2015; Schmidt, Gavin/D-4427-2012","Schmidt, Gavin/0000-0002-2258-0486; Ruedy, Reto/0000-0002-1270-1088",,,,,17,65,68,0,15,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",0094-8276,1944-8007,,GEOPHYS RES LETT,Geophys.

A central goal is to establish the performance of state-of-the-art boundary-layer schemes for weather and climate models for this cloud regime, using large-eddy simulations of the same scenes as a reference. A novelty is that the comparison covers four different cases instead of one, in order to broaden the covered parameter space. Three cases are situated in the North-Eastern Pacific, while one reflects conditions in the North-Eastern Atlantic. A set of variables is considered that reflects key aspects of the transition process, making use of simple metrics to establish the model performance. Using this method, some longstanding problems in low-level cloud representation are identified. Considerable spread exists among models concerning the cloud amount, its vertical structure, and the associated impact on radiative transfer. The sign and amplitude of these biases differ somewhat per case, depending on how far the transition has progressed. After cloud breakup the ensemble median exhibits the well-known too few too bright'' problem. The boundary-layer deepening rate and its state of decoupling are both underestimated, while the representation of the thin capping cloud layer appears complicated by a lack of vertical resolution. Encouragingly, some models are successful in representing the full set of variables, in particular, the vertical structure and diurnal cycle of the cloud layer in transition. An intriguing result is that the median of the model ensemble performs best, inspiring a new approach in subgrid parameterization.","[Neggers, R. A.

Any observed trend can result from natural variability or anthropogenic influences or both. In the present study, we evaluated the performance of 18 climate models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 on simulating the Asian diurnal temperature range (DTR) and explored the potential causes of the long-term trend in the DTR by examining the response of the DTR to natural forcing (volcanic aerosols and solar variability) and anthropogenic forcing (anthropogenic greenhouse gases (GHG) and aerosols) in the historical period of 1961-2005. For the climatology, the multimodel ensemble mean reproduced the geographical distribution and amplitude of the DTR over eastern China and India but underestimated the magnitudes of the DTR over the Tibetan Plateau and the high-latitude regions of the Asian continent. These negative biases in the DTR over frigid zones existed in most models. Seasonal biases in the DTR pattern from models were similar to the bias in the annual mean DTR pattern. Based on three selected state-of-the-art models, the observed decreasing trend in the DTR over Asia was reasonably reproduced in the all-forcing run. A comparison of separate forcing experiments revealed that anthropogenic forcing plays the dominant role in the declining trend in the DTR. Observations and model simulations showed that GHG forcing is mainly responsible for the negative trends in the DTR over Asia but that anthropogenic aerosol forcing was also behind the decreasing trend in the DTR over China and especially over eastern China.","[Liu, Lin; Li, Zhanqing; Yang, Xin] Beijing Normal Univ, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Liu, Lin; Li, Zhanqing; Yang, Xin] Beijing Normal Univ, Coll Global Change & Earth Syst Sci, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Li, Zhanqing] Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Li, Zhanqing; Gong, Hainan] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Ctr Monsoon Syst Res, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Li, Chao] Max Planck Inst Meteorol, Bundesstr 55, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany; [Xiong, Anyuan] Chinese Meteorol Adm, Natl Meteorol Informat Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China","Beijing Normal University; Beijing Normal University; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; Max Planck Society; China Meteorological Administration","Li, ZQ (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.;Li, ZQ (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, Coll Global Change & Earth Syst Sci, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.;Li, ZQ (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.;Li, ZQ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Ctr Monsoon Syst Res, Beijing, Peoples R China.",zli@atmos.umd.edu,"Li, Zhanqing/F-4424-2010; Li, Chao/L-1915-2015; Gong, Hainan/R-2934-2019; huang, gang/D-6427-2012","Li, Zhanqing/0000-0001-6737-382X; Li, Chao/0000-0003-2556-0891; Gong, Hainan/0000-0002-6501-162X; huang, gang/0000-0002-8692-7856",Ministry of Science and Technology [2013CB955804]; NSFC [91544217]; NSF [AGS1534670]; Humboldt Research Award,"Ministry of Science and Technology(Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning, Republic of Korea); NSFC(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Humboldt Research Award(Alexander von Humboldt Foundation)","We thank the anonymous reviewers for their careful review and insightful comments.

Special attention is devoted to the connection between the stratospheric polar vortex (SPV) and lower-stratosphere wave activity (LSWA). We find that in winter (December to February) dynamical forecasts initialised on the first of November are considerably more skilful than empirical forecasts based on October anomalies. Moreover, the coupling of the SPV with mid-latitude LSWA (i.e., meridional eddy heat flux) is generally well reproduced by the forecast systems, allowing for the identification of a robust link between the predictability of wave activity above the tropopause and the SPV skill. Our results highlight the importance of November-to-February LSWA, in particular in the Eurasian sector, for forecasts of the winter stratosphere. Finally, the role of potential sources of seasonal stratospheric predictability is considered: we find that the C3S multi-model overestimates the stratospheric response to El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and underestimates the influence of the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO).","[Portal, Alice] Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Milan, Italy; [Portal, Alice] Sorbonne Univ, PSL Res Univ, Ecole Normale Super,CNRS, Lab Meteorol Dynam IPSL,Ecole Polytech,IP Paris, Paris, France; [Ruggieri, Paolo] Univ Bologna, Dept Phys & Astron, Bologna, Italy; [Ruggieri, Paolo; Gualdi, Silvio] Fdn Ctr Euromediterraneo Cambiamenti Climat CMCC, Bologna, Italy; [Palmeiro, Froila M.; Garcia-Serrano, Javier] Univ Barcelona UB, Grp Meteorol, Barcelona, Spain; [Domeisen, Daniela I.

The Surface Urban Energy and Water balance Scheme (SUEWS) is a state-of-the-art widely used urban land surface model (ULSM) which simulates urban-atmospheric interactions by quantifying the energy, water and mass fluxes. Using SUEWS as the computation kernel, SuPy (SUEWS in Python) uses a Python-based data stack to streamline the pre-processing, computation and post-processing that are involved in the common modelling-centred urban climate studies. This paper documents the development of SuPy, including the SUEWS interface modification, F2PY (Fortran to Python) configuration and Python front-end implementation. In addition, the deployment of SuPy via PyPI (Python Package Index) is introduced along with the automated workflow for cross-platform compilation. This makes SuPy available for all mainstream operating systems (Windows, Linux and macOS). Three online tutorials in Jupyter Notebook are provided to users of different levels to become familiar with SuPy urban climate modelling. The SuPy package represents a significant enhancement that supports existing and new model applications, reproducibility and enhanced functionality.","[Sun, Ting; Grimmond, Sue] Univ Reading, Dept Meteorol, Reading RG6 6BB, Berks, England",University of Reading,"Sun, T; Grimmond, S (corresponding author), Univ Reading, Dept Meteorol, Reading RG6 6BB, Berks, England.",ting.sun@reading.ac.uk; c.s.grimmond@reading.ac.uk,"Sun, Ting/X-1488-2019; Grimmond, Sue/M-9782-2019","Sun, Ting/0000-0002-2486-6146; Grimmond, Sue/0000-0002-3166-9415","NERC Independent Research Fellowship [NE/P018637/1]; Newton Fund/Met Office CSSP China; RS Newton Mobility fund; EPSRC LoHCool [EP/N009797/1]; NERC [NE/H003231/1]; European Commission, FP7 [211345]; European Commission, H2020-EO-2014 [637519]; EPSRC [EP/I00159X/1, EP/I00159X/2]; KCL; Belmont Forum [TRUC NE/L008971/1, G8MUREFU3FP-2201-075]; Newton Fund; Met Office (CSSP grant); NERC [NE/P018637/1] Funding Source: UKRI","NERC Independent Research Fellowship(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Newton Fund/Met Office CSSP China; RS Newton Mobility fund; EPSRC LoHCool(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); European Commission, FP7(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre); European Commission, H2020-EO-2014(European Commission); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); KCL; Belmont Forum; Newton Fund; Met Office (CSSP grant); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC))","This research has been supported by NERC Independent Research Fellowship (grant no.

This paper is an illustration of how these measurements can be used to investigate whether 'state-of-the-art' atmospheric models are capable of adequately representing clouds. Here, we focus on shallow low-level clouds with a substantial amount of liquid water. In situ, ground-based and satellite remote sensing measurements were compared with the output of three non-hydrostatic regional models (Lokal-Modell, LM.- M&so-NH: fifth-generation Mesoscale Model, MM5) and two hydrostatic regional climate models (Regional Atmospheric Climate Model version 2, RACMO2; Rossby Centre Atmospheric Model, RCA). For the two selected days, Meso-NH and MM5 reproduce the measured vertical extent of the shallow clouds, but the liquid water content of the clouds is generally overestimated. In LM and the climate models the inversion is too weak and located at a level too close to the surface resulting in an overestimation of the vertical extent of the clouds. A sensitivity integration with RACM02 shows that the correspondence between model output and measurements can be improved by a doubling of the vertical resolution; this induces an increase in the modelled inversion strenath and cloud top pressure. LM and Meso-NH underestimate the lifetime of clouds. A comparison between model output and cloud cover derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) indicates that this deficiency is not due to advection of too small cloud systems,- it is rather due to an overestimation of the variability in the vertical velocity. All models overestimate the specific humidity near the surface and underestimate it at higher atmospheric levels, indicating that the models underestimate the mixing of moisture in the boundary layer. This deficiency is slightly reduced by inclusion of parameterised shallow convection in the non-hydrostatic models, which enhances the mixing of heat and moisture in the boundary layer. Consequently, the explicitly resolved updrafts weaken resulting in reduced condensation rates and lower liquid water path. The temporal variability of cloud occurrence is hardly affected by inclusion of parameterised shallow convection. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

To better understand and predict climate effects and feedbacks on the cycling of elements within and between ecosystems in northern latitude landscapes, a thorough understanding of the processes related to transport and cycling of elements is required. A fundamental requirement to reach a better process understanding is to have access to high-quality empirical data on chemical concentrations and biotic properties for a wide range of ecosystem domains and functional units (abiotic and biotic pools). The aim of this study is therefore to make one of the most extensive field data sets from a periglacial catchment readily available that can be used both to describe present-day periglacial processes and to improve predictions of the future.

Cycle times, CT, get shorter when one series in a pair is an increasingly stronger leading series to the other, CT approximate to-(minus) LL-strength. This may explain the frequent finding that many global warming time series, e.g., the Southern oscillation index and the Pacific decadal oscillation, show distinct cycle times (Power spectral analysis: 3-5, 7-8, 13-15, 22-24, and 29-30 years).

The late Pleistocene (20,000-12,000 C-14 years BP) was cold and dry, with (1) low lake levels in the Rift Valley, (2) large debris fans on the flanks of Lake Abhe basin, and (3) the Blue Nile transporting coarse bedload. Then, a period with abundant and less seasonal rains existed between 11,500 and 4800 C-14 years BP, as suggested by increased arboreal pollen, high river and lake levels, low river turbidities and soil formation. Around 5000-4800 C-14 years BP, there was a shift to more and conditions and more soil erosion. Many phenomena that were previously interpreted as climate-driven might, however, well be of anthropic origin. Thick sediment deposits on pediments as well as an increase of secondary forest, scrub and ruderal species in pollen diagrams are witnesses of this human impact. One important aspect of the late Quaternary palaeoenvironment is unclear: changes in Nile flow discharges and Rift Valley lake levels have been linked to changes in precipitation depth. Most authors do not take into account changes in land use in the highlands, nor changes in the seasonality of rain, both of which can lead to a change in runoff coefficients. Tufa and speleothem deposition around 14,000 years ago tend to indicate that at the end of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), conditions might have been wetter than generally accepted. The most important present-day geomorphic processes are sheet and rill erosion throughout the country, gullying in the highlands, and wind erosion in the Rift Valley and the peripheral lowlands. Based on existing sediment yield data for catchments draining the central and northern Ethiopian highlands, an equation was developed allowing to assess area-specific sediment yields: SY = 2595A(-0.29) (n = 20; r(2) = 0.59) where SY = area-specific sediment yield (t km(-2) year(-1)), and A = drainage area (km(2)). With respect to recent environmental changes, temporal rain patterns, apart from the catastrophic impact of dry years on the degraded environment, cannot explain the current desertification in the driest parts of the country and the accompanying land degradation elsewhere. Causes are changing land use and land cover, which are expressions of human impact on the environment. Deforestation over the last 2000-3000 years was probably not a linear process in Ethiopia. Studies on land use and land cover change show, however, a tendency over the last decades of increasing removal of remnant vegetation, which is slowed down or reversed in northern Ethiopia by a set-aside policy. Ongoing land degradation requires urgent action at different levels of society. Soil and water conservation (SWC) structures are now widely implemented. Local knowledge and farmer's initiatives are integrated with introduced SWC techniques at various degrees. Impact assessments show clear benefits of the soil conservation measures in controlling runoff and soil erosion. In high rain areas, runoff management requires greater emphasis during the design of soil conservation structures. In such areas, investment in SWC might not be profitable at farm level, although benefits for society are positive. This pleads in favour of public support. The present land degradation in the Ethiopian highlands has a particular origin, which includes poverty and lack of agricultural intensification. Causes of these are to be found in the nature of past and present regional social relations as well as in international unequal development. This review strengthens our belief that, under improved socio-economic conditions, land husbandry can be made sustainable, leading to a reversal of the present desertification and land degradation of the Ethiopian highlands.

Characteristics of oceanic cycles and their sources are important for climate predictability. We here compare cycles generated in a simple model with observed oceanic cycles in the great oceans: The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), El Nino, the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI), and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). In the model, we let a stochastic movement in one oceanic oscillation cause a similar but lagging movement in another oceanic oscillation. The two interacting oscillations show distinct cycle lengths depending upon how strongly one oscillation creates lagging cycles in the other. The model and observations both show cycles around two to six, 13 to 16, 22 to 23, and 31 to 32 years. The ultimate cause for the distinct cycles is atmospheric and oceanic bridges that connect the ocean basins, but the distinct pattern in cycle lengths is determined by properties of statistical distributions. We found no differences in the leading or lagging strength between well separated basins (the North Atlantic and the Pacific) and overlapping ocean basins (both in the Pacific). The cyclic pattern before 1950 appears to be different from the cyclic pattern after 1950.","[Seip, Knut L.; Gron, Oyvind] Oslo Metropolitan Univ, OsloMet, Dept Technol Art & Design, N-0130 Oslo, Norway",Oslo Metropolitan University (OsloMet),"Seip, KL (corresponding author), Oslo Metropolitan Univ, OsloMet, Dept Technol Art & Design, N-0130 Oslo, Norway.",knut.lehre.seip@oslomet.no; oyvind.gron.no@gmail.com,,,Oslo Metropolitan University,Oslo Metropolitan University,This research was funded by Oslo Metropolitan University.,,42,2,2,0,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2225-1154,,CLIMATE,Climate,JUN,2019,6,,,,,,77,10.3390/cli7060077,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/cli7060077,,,16,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,II6RT,,"Green Published, gold, Green Submitted",,,12/21/22,WOS:000475321700005,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the high computational power required by high-resolution (sub-kilometre) fully coupled land-atmosphere simulations using urban canopy parameterisations is a severe limitation. Here we present a study on the performance of UrbClim, an urban boundary layer model designed to be several orders of magnitude faster than a full-fledged mesoscale model. The simulations are evaluated with station data and land surface temperature observations from satellites, focusing on the urban heat island (UHI). To explore the advantages of using a simple model like UrbClim, the results are compared with a simulation carried out with a state-of-the-art mesoscale model, the Weather Research and Forecasting Model, which includes an urban canopy model. This comparison is performed with driving data from ERA-Interim reanalysis (70 km). In addition, the effect of using driving data from a higher-resolution forecast model (15 km) is explored in the case of UrbClim. The results show that the performance of reproducing the average UHI in the simple model is generally comparable to the one in the mesoscale model when driven with reanalysis data (70 km). However, the simple model needs higher-resolution data from the forecast model (15 km) to correctly reproduce the variability of the UHI at a daily scale, which is related to the wind speed. This lack of accuracy in reproducing the wind speed, especially the sea-breeze daily cycle, which is strong in Barcelona, also causes a warm bias in the reanalysis driven UrbClim run. We conclude that medium-complexity models as UrbClim are a suitable tool to simulate the urban climate, but that they are sensitive to the ability of the input data to represent the local wind regime. UrbClim is a well suited model for impact and adaptation studies at city scale without high computing requirements, but does not replace the need for mesoscale atmospheric models when the focus is on the two-way interactions between the city and the atmosphere","[Garcia-Diez, Markel; Ballester, Joan; Rodo, Xavier] Inst Catala Ciencies Clima, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain; [Lauwaet, Dirk; Hooyberghs, Hans; De Ridder, Koen] VITO, Antwerp, Belgium; [Rodo, Xavier] ICREA, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain; [Ballester, Joan; Rodo, Xavier] Barcelona Inst Global Hlth, ISGlobal, Climate & Hlth Program, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain",Institut Catala de Ciencies del Clima (IC3); VITO; ICREA; ISGlobal,"Garcia-Diez, M (corresponding author), Inst Catala Ciencies Clima, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.",markel.garcia@ic3.cat,"Garcia-Diez, Markel/N-5917-2014; Ballester, Joan/E-6627-2017; Rodó, Xavier/F-7663-2017","Garcia-Diez, Markel/0000-0002-4760-0527; Ballester, Joan/0000-0003-0009-437X; Rodó, Xavier/0000-0003-4843-6180; Hooyberghs, Hans/0000-0002-6166-341X; Lauwaet, Dirk/0000-0002-9958-5066; De Ridder, Koen/0000-0003-1167-5591","European Community [308299, 308291]; European Commission through a Marie Curie International Outgoing Fellowship (MEMENTO from FP7-PEOPLE-IOF); European Commission; Catalan Government through Marie Curie-Beatriu de Pinos Fellowship (BP-DGR-B) [00068]; ICREA Funding Source: Custom",European Community(European Commission); European Commission through a Marie Curie International Outgoing Fellowship (MEMENTO from FP7-PEOPLE-IOF); European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre); Catalan Government through Marie Curie-Beatriu de Pinos Fellowship (BP-DGR-B); ICREA(ICREA),"The work described in this paper has received funding from the European Community's 7th Framework Programme under Grant Agreements No. 308299 (NACLIM) and 308291 (EUPORIAS).

The project covers models and tools, which facilitate the assessment of existing building stocks and the recognition of state of the art energetic reliance and renovation concepts. These concepts are then automatically adapted to different structural, technical and usage dependent parameters. The tools will help to analyse building physics and building services but also to empower strategic planning and energy distribution schemes. Therefore, an intuitive dataflow was needed that streamlines the process from data acquisition (building inspection), evaluation of buildings and renovation measures to the elaboration of specific building energy reports; all resulting in master plans for building complexes as well as systematic renovation strategies for larger properties. Particular emphasis was put on the determination of joint influences of building construction and building services on potential energy savings. Accompanying this quantification process, uncertainty and sensitivity analyses have been performed via Bayesian Network theory and statistical analytics. Different renovation concepts have been analysed, modelled and evaluated regarding their energy saving potential, usability as well as ecologic features. A ranking system was developed to assess specific energy demands of different building usages and to identify the most effective renovation measures. The result is a fully transparent, interactive and easy to understand decision-making methodology. The holistic approach contributes to create climate neutral building stocks and consequently to reach the energy saving and environmental goals defined by national and international governmental institutions (e.g. EED).

Design/ methodology/approcach The method of this study is Agraph that is one of the tools of space syntax method. Agraph tool represent spatial relation between the spaces with graph and calculation included. During the research, all the space such as close, semi-open and open spaces analyzed with space syntax method. Findings The finding of this investigation demonstrated that although traditional houses have different topological issue, from different level of economy but the concern of organizing spaces under context and social hierarchy were same between all of them. Furthermore, inhabitants in different level of economy attempt to organize space by concerning privacy and public issue. Designing of traditional building in temperate humid climate is in a way to respond to the harsh climatic condition and to their cultural behavior. Research Limitations/Implications Four different types of Iranian traditional buildings where are located in the temperate-humid climatic region of Iran analyzed for discovering the social relation of the spaces in Gilan province. These four different categories included of one bedroom to more than five bedroom buildings. Hence, this research just considered the analysis for the houses with less than five bedrooms. Practical Implications Applying Agraph tool for understanding privacy and public degree of spaces. Social Implications Applying Agraph tool on Iranian traduational architecture for estimating the degree of privacy in each spaces. Since in Iranian culture spaces organized based on the public and privacy factor. Originality/Value The original of this research is to finding the degrre of privacy in each building with different level of economy based on Agraph tool. However, the result was different from the previuse studies.

In addition, a brief synopsis of the state of the science of these impacts is included. Issues considered include future changes in climate and patterns of land use for societal needs, Models dis cussed relate to vegetation (e.g, crop), soil, bio-geochemistry, water, and wildlife responses to conventional, forecasted changes in temperature and precipitation. Also described are models of these responses, alone and interactively, to increased CO2, other air pollutants and UV-B radiation, as the state of the science allows. Further, models of land-use change are included. Additionally, global multiple sector models of environment, natural resources, human population dynamics, economics, energy, and political relations are reviewed for integrated impact assessment. To the extent available, information on computer software and hardware requirements is presented for the various models. The paper concludes with comments about using these technologies as they relate to ecological risk assessment for policy decision analysis. Such an effort is hampered by considerable uncertainties with the output of existing models, because of the uncertainties associated with input data and the definitions of their dose-response relationships. The concluding suggestions point the direction for new developments in modeling and analyses that are needed for the 21st century. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Yet, existing reviews remain limited due to the piecemeal insights offered through a sub-set rather than the entire corpus of sustainable finance. To address this gap, this study aims to conduct a large-scale review that would provide a state-of-the-art overview of the performance and intellectual structure of sustainable finance. To do so, this study engages in a review of sustainable finance research using big data analytics through machine learning of scholarly research. In doing so, this study unpacks the most influential articles and top contributing journals, authors, institutions, and countries, as well as the methodological choices and research contexts for sustainable finance research. In addition, this study reveals insights into seven major themes of sustainable finance research, namely socially responsible investing, climate financing, green financing, impact investing, carbon financing, energy financing, and governance of sustainable financing and investing. To drive the field forward, this study proposes several suggestions for future sustainable finance research, which include developing and diffusing innovative sustainable financing instruments, magnifying and managing the profitability and returns of sustainable financing, making sustainable finance more sustainable, devising and unifying policies and frameworks for sustainable finance, tackling greenwashing of corporate sustainability reporting in sustainable finance, shining behavioral finance on sustainable finance, and leveraging the power of new-age technologies such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, internet of things, and machine learning for sustainable finance.","[Kumar, Satish] Malaviya Natl Inst Technol Jaipur, Dept Management Studies, Jaipur 302017, Rajasthan, India; [Kumar, Satish; Lim, Weng Marc] Swinburne Univ Technol, Sch Business, Jalan Simpang Tiga, Sarawak 93350, Malaysia; [Sharma, Dipasha] Symbiosis Int, Symbiosis Ctr Management & Human Resource Dev, Pune, Maharashtra, India; [Rao, Sandeep] Dublin City Univ, DCU Business Sch, Dublin 09, Ireland; [Lim, Weng Marc] Swinburne Univ Technol, Swinburne Business Sch, John St, Hawthorn, Vic 3122, Australia; [Mangla, Sachin Kumar] OP Jindal Global Univ, Jindal Global Business Sch, Sonipat, Haryana, India",National Institute of Technology (NIT System); Malaviya National Institute of Technology Jaipur; Swinburne University of Technology; Swinburne University of Technology Sarawak; Symbiosis International University; Symbiosis Centre for Management & Human Resource Development (SCMHRD); Dublin City University; Swinburne University of Technology; O.P.

We give an overview of the state of the art of our understanding on eustatic (global) versus relative (regional) sea level, as well as long-term versus short-term fluctuations and their drivers. In the context of the focus of UNESCO-IUGS/IGCP project 609 on Cretaceous eustatic, short-term sea-level and climate changes, we evaluate the possible evidence for glacio-eustasy versus alternative or additional mechanisms for continental water storage and release for the Cretaceous greenhouse and hothouse phases during which the presence of larger continental ice shields is considered unlikely. Increasing evidence in the literature suggests a correlation between long-period orbital cycles and depositional cycles that reflect sea-level fluctuations, implying a globally synchronized forcing of (eustatic) sea level. Fourth-order depositional sequences seem to be related to a similar to 405 ka periodicity, which most likely represents long-period orbital eccentricity control on sea level and depositional cycles. Third-order cyclidty, expressed as time-synchronous sea level falls of similar to 20 to 110 m on similar to 0.5 to 3.0 Ma timescales in the Cretaceous, are increasingly recognized as connected to climate cycles triggered by long-term astronomical cycles that have periodicity ranging from similar to 1.0 to 2.4 Ma. Future perspectives of research on greenhouse sea-level changes comprise a high-precision time-scale for sequence stratigraphy and eustatic sea-level changes and high-resolution marine to non-marine stratigraphic correlation.

This study aimed to analyze sweat rate, water percentage alteration, and temperature variation during kendo practice in order to relate the thermal stress induced by such sports and draw recommendations for its secure practice. Methods. Participants were 12 male individuals. The studied variables were: age, weight, stature, body mass index, fat percentage, water loss percentage, tympanic temperature, and sweat rate. Measures were obtained in one day of 120 min practice (T: 24.1+/-2.5 degrees C; RH: 73+/-8.5%) using obligatory training equipment. Results. The age of participants was on average 26+/-6.2 years, stature 1.8+/-0.03 m, weight 78+/-13.7 kg, BMI 24.12+/-4.03 kg/m(2) and fat percentage 15.7+/-5.1%. Weight and temperature final values were significantly different from the initial ones (P<0.01). Estimated sweat rate was 0.35 L.h(-1) (95% CI = [0.299; 0.400]) and estimated percentage of water loss was 0.946% (95% CI = [0.694; 1.174]). Conclusion. Kendo practice using obligatory equipment significantly increases temperature, even when sweat rate and water loss percentage are low. The almost complete obstruction of the evaporative surface leads to heat accumulation, which may result in risks comparable to those of American football players. Thus, preventive measures must be established to minimize the risks of the combination among environment (tropical climate), equipment (bogu) and the high physiological demand of this sport in order to prevent greater damages to the health of practitioners.","[Rossi, L.; Schaefer Cardoso, M.; Torres, H.; Ragasso Casalenovo, V.] Ctr Univ Sao Camilo, BR-05025010 Sao Paulo, Brazil",Centro Universitario Sao Camilo,"Rossi, L (corresponding author), Ctr Univ Sao Camilo, Rua Raul Pompeia,144 Pompeia, BR-05025010 Sao Paulo, Brazil.",lrossi@scamilo.edu.br,"Rossi, Luciana/C-6616-2014",,,,,,37,2,2,1,14,EDIZIONI MINERVA MEDICA,TURIN,"CORSO BRAMANTE 83-85 INT JOURNALS DEPT., 10126 TURIN, ITALY",0022-4707,1827-1928,,J SPORT MED PHYS FIT,J.

The lake underwent a catastrophic flooding event similar to 18,300 yr B.P. resulting in the incision of streams entering the lake along its eastern border. Incision patterns of twelve streams and rivers suggest that they were influenced by the prevailing circulation in the lake at the time. In order to match patterns of river incisions, simulations of lake circulation were performed with a state-of-the-art numerical model for the maximum transgressive (Bonneville) lake elevation. Simulations were conducted using the forcing of westerly and easterly prevailing winds. Simulated circulation can be described in terms of simple geostrophic balances in which the currents are generally cyclonic (counter clockwise) for westerly winds and anti-cyclonic (clockwise) for easterly winds. Irregularities in lake shorelines and bathymetry cause localized variation of this general pattern. Comparison of model output with the deflected stream incision patterns suggest that prevailing winds during the Pleistocene in the Great Basin of North America were westerly and that, unlike the interior of North America, the continental ice sheet did not exert significant influence on the climatological wind patterns of the Great Basin.

This paper validates the MATCH/DLR model originating in the climate community against AERONET ground measurements. Hourly or daily mean AOD model output is evaluated individually for all stations in Europe, Africa and the Middle East - an area highly interesting for solar energy applications being partly dominated by high aerosol loads. Overall, a bias of 0.02 and a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.23 are found for daily mean AOD values, while the RMSE increases to 0.28 for hourly mean AOD values. Large differences between various regions and stations are found providing a feedback loop for the aerosol modelling community. The difference in using daily means versus hourly resolved modelling with respect to hourly resolved observations is evaluated. Nowadays state-of-the-art in solar resource assessment relies on monthly turbidity or AOD climatologies while at least hourly resolved irradiance time series are needed by the solar sector. Therefore, the contribution of higher temporally modelled AOD is evaluated.","[Schroedter-Homscheidt, M.; Oumbe, A.] German Aerosp Ctr DLR, Earth Observat Ctr, D-82234 Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany; [Oumbe, A.] Total New Energies, R&D Concentrated Solar Technol, F-92400 Courbevoie, France",Helmholtz Association; German Aerospace Centre (DLR); Total SA,"Schroedter-Homscheidt, M (corresponding author), German Aerosp Ctr DLR, Earth Observat Ctr, D-82234 Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany.",marion.schroedter-homscheidt@dlr.de,,"Schroedter-Homscheidt, Marion/0000-0002-1854-903X","national projects SESK (Standardisation of energy yield assessments for solar thermal power plants); Solar-Med-Atlas; Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety in Germany [032 50 84 A, 10 1 130]; EU Seventh Research Framework Programme's project MACC (Monitoring Atmospheric Composition and Climate) [218793]","national projects SESK (Standardisation of energy yield assessments for solar thermal power plants); Solar-Med-Atlas; Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety in Germany; EU Seventh Research Framework Programme's project MACC (Monitoring Atmospheric Composition and Climate)","Our thanks for the provision of ground measurements go to Ana Maria Silva, Anatoli Chaikovsky, Andrew Clive Banks, Arnon Karnieli, Bertil Hakansson, Brent Holben, Christoph Kleefeld, Christophe Francois, Didier Tanre, Gian Paolo Gobbi, Gilbert Sappe, Giuseppe Zibordi, Hammad Ben-Chekroun, Jean-Francois Leon, Jens Boesenberg, Kevin Ruddick, Luigi Alberotanza, Maria Rita Perrone, Natalia Chubarova, Olavi Karner, Paulo Artaxo, Peter Koepke, Philippe Goloub, Rachel T.

Using 13 state-of-the-art coupled global atmosphere-ocean models and 13 yr of seasonal forecasts, the performance of individual models, the ensemble mean, the bias-removed ensemble mean, and the Florida State University (FSU) superensemble are compared. A total of 23 400 seasonal forecasts based on 1-month lead times were available for this study. Evaluation metrics include both deterministic and probabilistic skill measures, such as verification of anomalies based on model and observed climatology, time series of specific climate indices, standard deterministic ensemble mean scores including anomaly correlations, root-mean-square (RMS) errors, and probabilistic skill measures such as equitable threat scores for seasonal SST forecasts. This study also illustrates the Nino-3.4 SST forecast skill for the equatorial Pacific Ocean and for the dipole index for the Indian Ocean. The relative skills of total SST fields and of the SST anomalies from the 13 coupled atmosphere-ocean models are presented. Comparisons of superensemble-based seasonal forecasts with recent studies on SST anomaly forecasts are also shown. Overall it is found that the multimodel superensemble forecasts are characterized by considerable RMS error reductions and increased accuracy in the spatial distribution of SST. Superensemble SST skill also persists for El Nino and La Nina forecasts since the large comparative skill of the superensemble is retained across such years. Real-time forecasts of seasonal sea surface temperature anomalies appear to be possible.","Florida State Univ, Dept Meteorol, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; Florida State Univ, Dept Oceanog, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; Florida State Univ, Inst Geophys Fluid Dynam, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA",State University System of Florida; Florida State University; State University System of Florida; Florida State University; State University System of Florida; Florida State University,"Krishnamurti, TN (corresponding author), Florida State Univ, Dept Meteorol, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.",tnk@io.met.fsu.edu,"Chakraborty, Arindam/M-9044-2014; Clayson, Carol Anne/M-6579-2019","Chakraborty, Arindam/0000-0002-4288-0216; ",,,,,38,35,38,0,7,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0894-8755,1520-0442,,J CLIMATE,J.

It is the primary source of energy for all life on Earth; hence it is important to understand how this process responds to climate change and human impact. However, model-based estimates of gross primary production (GPP, output from photosynthesis) are highly uncertain, in particular over heavily managed agricultural areas. Recent advances in spectroscopy enable the space-based monitoring of sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) from terrestrial plants. Here we demonstrate that spaceborne SIF retrievals provide a direct measure of the GPP of cropland and grassland ecosystems. Such a strong link with crop photosynthesis is not evident for traditional remotely sensed vegetation indices, nor for more complex carbon cycle models. We use SIF observations to provide a global perspective on agricultural productivity. Our SIF-based crop GPP estimates are 50-75% higher than results from state-of-the-art carbon cycle models over, for example, the US Corn Belt and the Indo-Gangetic Plain, implying that current models severely underestimate the role of management. Our results indicate that SIF data can help us improve our global models for more accurate projections of agricultural productivity and climate impact on crop yields. Extension of our approach to other ecosystems, along with increased observational capabilities for SIF in the near future, holds the prospect of reducing uncertainties in the modeling of the current and future carbon cycle.","[Guanter, Luis; Zhang, Yongguang; Voigt, Maximilian] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Space Sci, D-12165 Berlin, Germany; [Jung, Martin] Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, Dept Biogeochem Syst, D-07745 Jena, Germany; [Joiner, Joanna] NASA, Lab Atmospher Chem & Dynam Code 614, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; [Berry, Joseph A.] Carnegie Inst Sci, Dept Global Ecol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Frankenberg, Christian] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA 91109 USA; [Huete, Alfredo R.] Univ Technol Sydney, Plant Funct Biol & Climate Change Cluster, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia; [Zarco-Tejada, Pablo] CSIC, Inst Agr Sostenible, Cordoba 14004, Spain; [Lee, Jung-Eun] Brown Univ, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Moran, M.

Miocene atmospheric CO2 concentrations are typically reconstructed between 300 and 600 ppm and were potentially higher during the Miocene Climatic Optimum (16.75-14.5 Ma). With surface temperature reconstructions pointing to substantial midlatitude and polar warmth, it is unclear what processes maintained the much weaker-than-modern equator-to-pole temperature difference. Here, we synthesize several Miocene climate modeling efforts together with available terrestrial and ocean surface temperature reconstructions. We evaluate the range of model-data agreement, highlight robust mechanisms operating across Miocene modeling efforts and regions where differences across experiments result in a large spread in warming responses. Prescribed CO2 is the primary factor controlling global warming across the ensemble. On average, elements other than CO2, such as Miocene paleogeography and ice sheets, raise global mean temperature by similar to 2 degrees C, with the spread in warming under a given CO2 concentration (due to a combination of the spread in imposed boundary conditions and climate feedback strengths) equivalent to similar to 1.2 times a CO2 doubling. This study uses an ensemble of opportunity: models, boundary conditions, and reference data sets represent the state-of-art for the Miocene, but are inhomogeneous and not ideal for a formal intermodel comparison effort. Acknowledging this caveat, this study is nevertheless the first Miocene multi-model, multi-proxy comparison attempted so far. This study serves to take stock of the current progress toward simulating Miocene warmth while isolating remaining challenges that may be well served by community-led efforts to coordinate modeling and data activities within a common analytical framework.","[Burls, N.

These phenomena, because of their intensity, may generate risks for territories. This paper provides a synthesis of the knowledge about the current status of the mountain permafrost in the French Alps and its recent evolution. This state-of-the-art overview is based on research conducted over the past 10 years and the measurements collected within PermaFRANCE, the French network for long-term observation of the mountain permafrost. The analysis of the available data shows that for a rock wall located at 3800 m asl., the temperature is between -4.5 and -1.5 degrees C at a depth of 10 m, according to the aspect, whereas it is close to the melting point in surficial deposits at 2800 m asl. on a northern slope. Since the beginning of these measurements at depth in 2010, a trend of increasing temperature has been discernible, as found in other alpine boreholes. As clearly shown by the surface measurements conducted since 2003, the thermal regime is influenced by snow, particularly in surficial deposits and to a much lesser extent in rock walls. This inter-annual variability is combined with longer-term trends, which probably induce the observed changes in geomorphological dynamics associated with alpine permafrost: an increased frequency of gravitational processes such as rockfalls and fluctuation in rock glacier velocities. The possible increase in extreme events, such as rock avalanches or the destabilisation of rock glaciers, in the coming decades could create new or increased risks, to which territories must thus adapt.","[Bodin, Xavier; Deline, Philip; Ravanel, Ludovic; Magnin, Florence] Univ Savoie Mt Blanc, CNRS, Lab EDYTEM, UMR 5204, Le Bourget Du Lac, France; [Schoeneich, Philippe; Echelard, Thomas] Univ Grenoble 1, CNRS, Lab PACTE, UMR 5194, Grenoble, France; [Krysiecki, Jean-Michel] Bur Etud SAGE Ingn, Gieres, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); Universite de Savoie; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA),"Bodin, X (corresponding author), Univ Savoie Mt Blanc, CNRS, Lab EDYTEM, UMR 5204, Le Bourget Du Lac, France.",,"Deline, Philip/AFR-6521-2022; Bodin, Xavier/H-2677-2018","Bodin, Xavier/0000-0001-6245-4030",MAIF; INTERREG; Alpine Space programmes; LabEx OSUG; ZA Alps; Rhone-Alpes region,MAIF; INTERREG; Alpine Space programmes; LabEx OSUG; ZA Alps; Rhone-Alpes region(Region Auvergne-Rhone-Alpes),"This work is a synthesis of over 10 years of research on the mountain permafrost issue in the French Alps.

While the Paris Agreement has set the ambitious target to limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees C compared to preindustrial levels, scientists are urged to explore scenarios for different warming thresholds and quantify ranges of socioeconomic impact. In this work, we present a framework to estimate the economic damage and population affected by river floods at global scale. It is based on a modeling cascade involving hydrological, hydraulic and socioeconomic impact simulations, and makes use of state-of-the-art global layers of hazard, exposure and vulnerability at 1-km grid resolution. An ensemble of seven high-resolution global climate projections based on Representative Concentration Pathways 8.5 is used to derive streamflow simulations in the present and in the future climate. Those were analyzed to assess the frequency and magnitude of river floods and their impacts under scenarios corresponding to 1.5 degrees C, 2 degrees C, and 4 degrees C global warming. Results indicate a clear positive correlation between atmospheric warming and future flood risk at global scale. At 4 degrees C global warming, countries representing more than 70% of the global population and global gross domestic product will face increases in flood risk in excess of 500%. Changes in flood risk are unevenly distributed, with the largest increases in Asia, U.S., and Europe. In contrast, changes are statistically not significant in most countries in Africa and Oceania for all considered warming levels.","[Alfieri, Lorenzo; Bisselink, Berny; Dottori, Francesco; Naumann, Gustavo; de Roo, Ad; Salamon, Peter; Feyen, Luc] European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Ispra, Italy; [Wyser, Klaus] Swedish Meteorol & Hydrol Inst, Rossby Ctr, Norrkoping, Sweden",European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site; Swedish Meteorological & Hydrological Institute,"Alfieri, L (corresponding author), European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Ispra, Italy.",lorenzo.alfieri@jrc.ec.europa.eu,"Feyen, Luc/ABD-6195-2021; Naumann, Gustavo/L-6758-2017; Alfieri, Lorenzo/AAJ-6668-2021","Naumann, Gustavo/0000-0002-8767-5099; Salamon, Peter/0000-0002-5419-5398; Alfieri, Lorenzo/0000-0002-3616-386X; Dottori, Francesco/0000-0002-1388-3303",European Union Seventh Framework Programme FP7 [603864],European Union Seventh Framework Programme FP7,The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Union Seventh Framework Programme FP7/2007-2013 under grant agreement no 603864 (HELIX: High-End cLimate Impacts and eXtremes; www.helixclimate.eu).

Mobile air-conditioning (MAC) units play a significant role in direct and indirect CO2 emissions from vehicles. Refrigerant and component efficiency are the major factors that determine CO2 emissions from air-conditioning units. Therefore, it is essential to enhance the performance of MAC systems using environmentally friendly refrigerants that satisfy environmental requirements. In this study, we demonstrated the measures taken to minimize CO2 emissions by replacing high global warming potential HFC-134a, charge optimization methods, and performance enhancement strategies. HFO-1234yf could be better alternative for retrofitting HFC-134a, although it exhibited a slightly poor performance with mid-flammability. Mixtures of hydrocarbon-based refrigerants are suitable for secondary loop applications, and R-744 is the best option in cold climates. During charge optimization, the subcooling and superheating plateau methods were mostly adopted. To enhance system performance, most researchers have used variable displacement compressors, efficient microchannel evaporators, integrated received drier condensers, and suction line heat exchangers. Recently, Nano-seeded lubricants have been used in some MAC applications; however, further research is required on the condensation and evaporation aspects. The present review could be very helpful for researchers and manufacturers in developing MAC systems with lower CO2 emissions.","[Prabakaran, Rajendran; Kim, Sung Chul] Yeungnam Univ, Sch Mech Engn, 280 Daehak Ro, Gyongsan 712749, Gyeongbuk, South Korea; [Prabakaran, Rajendran] Kongu Engn Coll, Dept Automobile Engn, Perundurai 638060, Erode, India; [Lal, Dhasan Mohan] Anna Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Refrigerat & Air Conditioning Div, Chennai 600025, Tamil Nadu, India",Yeungnam University; Kongu Engineering College; Anna University; Anna University Chennai,"Kim, SC (corresponding author), Yeungnam Univ, Sch Mech Engn, 280 Daehak Ro, Gyongsan 712749, Gyeongbuk, South Korea.;Lal, DM (corresponding author), Anna Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Refrigerat & Air Conditioning Div, Chennai 600025, Tamil Nadu, India.",dr.mohanlal29@gmail.com; sungkim@ynu.ac.kr,,,"Center for Research at Anna University [CFR/ACRF/2015/4]; Korea Evaluation Institute of Industrial Technology (Keit) Grant - Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy [20011653]","Center for Research at Anna University; Korea Evaluation Institute of Industrial Technology (Keit) Grant - Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy","R.

Here we show that the state-of-the-art atmospheric general circulation models (AGCMs), when forced by observed sea surface temperature (SST), are unable to simulate properly Asian-Pacific summer monsoon rainfall. All models yield positive SST-rainfall correlations in the summer monsoon that are at odds with observations. The observed lag correlations between SST and rainfall suggest that treating monsoon as a slave possibly results in the models' failure. We demonstrate that an AGCM, coupled with an ocean model, simulates realistic SST-rainfall relationships; however, the same AGCM fails when forced by the same SSTs that are generated in its coupled run, suggesting that the coupled ocean-atmosphere processes are crucial in the monsoon regions where atmospheric feedback on SST is critical. The present finding calls for reshaping of current strategies for monsoon seasonal prediction. The notion that climate can be modeled and predicted by prescribing the lower boundary conditions is inadequate for validating models and predicting summer monsoon rainfall.","Univ Hawaii, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci & Technol, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; Seoul Natl Univ, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Seoul 151742, South Korea; George Mason Univ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; European Ctr Medium Range Weather Forecasts, Reading RG2 9AX, Berks, England",University of Hawaii System; Seoul National University (SNU); George Mason University; European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF),"Wang, B (corresponding author), Univ Hawaii, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci & Technol, 1680 East West Rd, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",wangbin@hawaii.edu,"ding, qinghua/G-1186-2011; Doblas-Reyes, Francisco J./C-1228-2016","Doblas-Reyes, Francisco J./0000-0002-6622-4280; Jin, Emilia/0000-0002-5257-3340",,,,,17,506,552,6,63,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",0094-8276,1944-8007,,GEOPHYS RES LETT,Geophys.

According to the model, the partial pressure of atmospheric CH4 (pCH(4)) increased up to approximately 10 ppmv during the Carboniferous coal swamp era. This implies a maximum radiative forcing of about 3.5 W m(-2) via CH4. Through its radiative forcing, CH4 heated the average global surface temperature by up to 1 degrees C. The elevated pCH(4) values during the Permian-Carboniferous cold period may have moderated the temperature decline caused by the coeval drawdown of atmospheric CO2. Additional runs with a global carbon model indicate that the heating induced by elevated pCH(4) favored the drawdown of atmospheric pCO(2) via enhanced rates of silicate weathering. Simulations with a state-of-the-art climate model reveal that the effects of atmospheric CH4 on average global surface temperature also depend on the partial pressures of CO2. The CH4 climate effect is amplified by high background levels of atmospheric CO2 such that a coeval increase in the partial pressure of both greenhouse gases has a much stronger climate effect than previously anticipated.","[Bartdorff, Oliver; Wallmann, Klaus] Univ Kiel, Collaborat Res Ctr 574, Kiel, Germany; [Wallmann, Klaus; Latif, Mojib] Univ Kiel, Leibniz Inst Marine Sci, Kiel, Germany; [Latif, Mojib; Semenov, Vladimir] Univ Kiel, Collaborat Res Ctr 460, Kiel, Germany",University of Kiel; Helmholtz Association; GEOMAR Helmholtz Center for Ocean Research Kiel; University of Kiel; University of Kiel,"Bartdorff, O (corresponding author), Univ Kiel, Collaborat Res Ctr 574, Kiel, Germany.",,"Latif, Mojib/C-2428-2016; Semenov, Vladimir/U-9488-2019; Wallmann, Klaus/D-4380-2017","Latif, Mojib/0000-0003-1079-5604; Semenov, Vladimir/0000-0001-7632-7921; Wallmann, Klaus/0000-0002-1795-376X",,,,,54,9,9,1,6,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",0886-6236,1944-9224,,GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEM CY,Glob.

Active interactions include the creeping flow of ice and its effects on polar geomorphology, global sea level, ocean and atmospheric circulation, and so on. Passive interactions are mainly established by the formation of climate records within the ice, in form of air bubbles, dust particles, salt microinclusions and other derivatives of airborne impurities buried by recurrent snowfalls. For a half-century scientists have been drilling deep ice cores in Antarctica and Greenland for studying such records, which can go back to around a million years. Experience shows, however, that the ice-sheet flow generally disrupts the stratigraphy of the bottom part of deep ice cores, destroying the integrity of the oldest records. For all these reasons glaciologists have been studying the microstructure of polar ice cores for decades, in order to understand the genesis and fate of ice-core climate records, as well as to learn more about the physical properties of polar ice, aiming at better climate-record interpretations and ever more precise models of ice-sheet dynamics. In this Part I we review the main difficulties and advances in deep ice core drilling in Antarctica and Greenland, together with the major contributions of deep ice coring to the research on natural ice microstructures. In particular, we discuss in detail the microstructural findings from Camp Century, Byrd, Dye 3, GRIP, GISP2, NorthGRIP, Vostok, Dome C, EDML, and Dome Fuji, besides commenting also on the earlier results of some pioneering ventures, like the Jung-fraujoch Expedition and the Norwegian British Swedish Antarctic Expedition, among others. In the companion Part II of this work (Faria et al., 2014), the review proceeds with a survey of the state-of-the-art understanding of natural ice microstructures and some exciting prospects in this field of research.

This analysis considers two starting dates, May 1st and November 1st and the forecasts at lead times up to 6 months for each year in the period 1993-2014. Both deterministic and probabilistic metrics are employed to derive comprehensive information on the forecast quality in terms of association, reliability/resolution, discrimination, accuracy and sharpness. We find that temperature anomalies are better reproduced than precipitation anomalies with varying spatial patterns across different forecast systems. The Multi-Model Ensemble (MME) shows the best agreement in terms of anomaly correlation with ERA5 precipitation, while PERS provides the best results in terms of anomaly correlation with ERA5 temperature. Individual forecast systems and MME outperform CTRL in terms of accuracy of tercile-based forecasts up to lead time 5 months and in terms of discrimination up to lead time 2 months. All seasonal forecast systems also outperform elementary forecasts based on persistence in terms of accuracy and sharpness.","[Quaglia, Filippo Cali] Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Dept Environm Sci Informat & Stat, Via Torino 155, I-30172 Venice, Italy; [Terzago, Silvia; von Hardenberg, Jost] Natl Res Council Italy CNR ISAC, Inst Atmospher Sci & Climate, Corso Fiume 4, I-10133 Turin, Italy; [von Hardenberg, Jost] Politecn Torino, Dept Environm Land & Infrastruct Engn, Corso Duca Abruzzi 24, I-10129 Turin, Italy",Universita Ca Foscari Venezia; Polytechnic University of Turin,"Terzago, S (corresponding author), Natl Res Council Italy CNR ISAC, Inst Atmospher Sci & Climate, Corso Fiume 4, I-10133 Turin, Italy.",s.terzago@isac.cnr.it,"Calì Quaglia, Filippo/AAI-8073-2021; Terzago, Silvia/F-3801-2018","Calì Quaglia, Filippo/0000-0001-5557-1626; Terzago, Silvia/0000-0001-7867-0440",European Union [690462],European Union(European Commission),This work was performed in the framework of the MEDSCOPE (MEDiterranean Services Chain based On climate PrEdictions) ERA4CS project (Grant Agreement No. 690462) funded by the European Union.,,72,4,4,1,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0930-7575,1432-0894,,CLIM DYNAM,Clim.

Analysis of urban warming based on remote sensing method reveals that the urban bias on minimum temperature is rising at a higher rate, 2.5 times (2.85 ground-based observed) more, than on maximum temperature, with a linear trend of 0.15 degrees C (0.19 degrees C ground-based observed) and 0.06 degrees C (0.06 degrees C ground-based observed) per decade respectively. The results based on remote sensing imagery are compatible with estimates of urban warming based on weather stations.

Reducing the development efforts for ADAS functions and eventually enabling AD functions demands the extension of conventional physical test drives with simulations in virtual test environments. In such a virtual test environment, the physical radar unit is replaced by a virtual radar model. Driving datasets, such as the nuScenes dataset, containing large amounts of annotated sensor measurements, help understand sensor capabilities and play an important role in sensor modeling. This article includes a thorough analysis of the radar data available in the nuScenes dataset. Radar properties, such as detection thresholds, and detection probabilities depending on object, environment, and radar parameters, as well as object properties, such as reflection behavior depending on object type, are investigated quantitatively. The overall detection probability of the considered radar (Continental ARS-408-21) was found to be 27.81%. Four radar models on object level with different complexity levels and different parametrisation requirements are presented: a simple RCS-based radar model with an accuracy of 51%, a linear SVC model with an accuracy of 70%, a Random Forest model with an accuracy of 83%, and a Gradient Boost model with an accuracy of 86%. The feature importance analysis of the machine learning algorithms revealed that object class, object size, and object visibility are the most important parameters for the presented radar models. In contrast, daytime and weather conditions seem to have only minor influence on the modeling results.","[Muckenhuber, Stefan] Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Dept Geog & Reg Sci, Heinrichstr 36, A-8010 Graz, Austria; [Muckenhuber, Stefan; Museljic, Eniz; Stettinger, Georg] Virtual Vehicle Res GmbH, Dept E, Graz, Austria",University of Graz,"Muckenhuber, S (corresponding author), Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Dept Geog & Reg Sci, Heinrichstr 36, A-8010 Graz, Austria.",stefan.muckenhuber@uni-graz.at,,,COMET K2 Competence Centers for Excellent Technologies from the Austrian Federal Ministry for Climate Action (BMK); Austrian Federal Ministry for Digital and Economic Affairs (BMDW); Province of Styria; Styrian Business Promotion Agency (SFG),COMET K2 Competence Centers for Excellent Technologies from the Austrian Federal Ministry for Climate Action (BMK); Austrian Federal Ministry for Digital and Economic Affairs (BMDW); Province of Styria; Styrian Business Promotion Agency (SFG),"This research received financial support within the COMET K2 Competence Centers for Excellent Technologies from the Austrian Federal Ministry for Climate Action (BMK), the Austrian Federal Ministry for Digital and Economic Affairs (BMDW), the Province of Styria (Dept. 12) and the Styrian Business Promotion Agency (SFG).",,64,3,3,3,16,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1547-2450,1547-2442,,J INTELL TRANSPORT S,J.

The study site is the transnational Abbotsford-Sumas aquifer in coastal British Columbia, Canada and Washington State, USA, and is representative of a wet coastal climate. Sixty-four recharge zones were defined based on combinations of classed soil permeability, vadose zone permeability, and unsaturated zone depth (or depth to water table) mapped in the study area. One-dimensional recharge simulations were conducted for each recharge zone using the HELP hydrologic model, which simulates percolation through a vertical column. The HELP model is driven by mean daily temperature, daily precipitation, and daily solar radiation. For the historical recharge simulations, the climate data series was generated using the LARS-WG stochastic weather generator. Historical recharge was compared to recharge simulated using climate data series derived from the TreeGen downscaling model for three future time periods: 2020s (2010-2039), 2050s (2040-2069), and 2080s (2070-2099) for each of four GCMs (CGCM3.1, ECHAM5, PCM1, and CM2.1). Recharge results are compared on an annual basis for the entire aquifer area. Both increases and decreases relative to historical recharge are simulated depending on time period and model. By the 2080s, the range of model predictions spans -10.5% to +23.2% relative to historical recharge. This variability in recharge predictions suggests that the seasonal performance of the downscaling tool is important and that a range of GCMs should be considered for water management planning.","[Allen, D.

Infertility clinic policies are grounded on both the views of the country's powerful Islamic coalition and those of the worldwide Islamic community. Indonesian government officials, physicians, and Islamic scholars have expressed concern over who can use ART and which procedures can be performed. Indonesia has also faced economic challenges related to ART, including inadequate health insurance coverage, inequitable access to ART, and maintenance of expensive ART infrastructure. The prohibitive price of infertility treatment and regional differences in the provision of health care prohibit most Indonesians from obtaining ART. In the absence of a shift in religious mores and a rapid reduction in poverty and inequality, Indonesia will need to adopt creative means to make ART both more available and less necessary as a solution to infertility. This paper suggests policy reforms to promote more affordable treatment methods and support preventative health programmes to reduce infertility rates. This country-specific analysis of the laws and customs surrounding ART in Indonesia reveals that strategies to reduce infertility must be tailored to a country's unique religious and economic climate.

The presence of valley networks, dendritic channels and deltas on ancient terrains points towards running water and fluvial erosion on early Mars(1), but climate modelling indicates that long-term warm conditions were not sustainable(2). Widespread phyllosilicates and other aqueous minerals on the Martian surface(3-6) provide additional evidence that an early wet Martian climate resulted in surface weathering. Some of these phyllosilicates formed in subsurface crustal environments(5), with no association with the Martian climate, while other phyllosilicate-rich outcrops exhibit layered morphologies and broad stratigraphies(7) consistent with surface formation. Here, we develop a new geochemical model for early Mars to explain the formation of these clay-bearing rocks in warm and wet surface locations. We propose that sporadic, short-term warm and wet environments during a generally cold early Mars enabled phyllosilicate formation without requiring long-term warm and wet conditions. We conclude that Mg-rich clay-bearing rocks with lateral variations in mixed Fe/Mg smectite, chlorite, talc, serpentine and zeolite occurrences formed in subsurface hydrothermal environments, whereas dioctahedral (Al/Fe3+-rich) smectite and widespread vertical horizonation of Fe/Mg smectites, clay assemblages and sulphates formed in variable aqueous environments on the surface of Mars. Our model for aluminosilicate formation on Mars is consistent with the observed geological features, diversity of aqueous mineralogies in ancient surface rocks and state-of-the-art palaeoclimate scenarios.","[Bishop, Janice L.] SETI Inst, Mountain View, CA 94043 USA; [Bishop, Janice L.] NASA, Ames Res Ctr, Moffett Field, CA 94035 USA; [Fairen, Alberto G.] CSIC, Inst Nacl Tecn Aeroesp, Ctr Astrobiol, Madrid, Spain; [Fairen, Alberto G.] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY USA; [Michalski, Joseph R.] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Earth Sci, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Michalski, Joseph R.] Univ Hong Kong, Lab Space Res, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Gago-Duport, Luis] Univ Vigo, Vigo, Spain; [Baker, Leslie L.] Univ Idaho, Moscow, ID 83843 USA; [Velbel, Michael A.] Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Velbel, Michael A.] Smithsonian Inst, Washington, DC 20560 USA; [Gross, Christoph] Free Univ Berlin, Berlin, Germany; [Rampe, Elizabeth B.] NASA, Johnson Space Ctr, Houston, TX USA",National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Ames Research Center; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Centro de Astrobiologia (INTA); Cornell University; University of Hong Kong; University of Hong Kong; Universidade de Vigo; Idaho; University of Idaho; Michigan State University; Smithsonian Institution; Free University of Berlin; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA),"Bishop, JL (corresponding author), SETI Inst, Mountain View, CA 94043 USA.;Bishop, JL (corresponding author), NASA, Ames Res Ctr, Moffett Field, CA 94035 USA.",jbishop@seti.org,"Michalski, Joseph/AAU-5631-2020; Baker, Leslie L/A-3953-2011; Gago-Duport, Luis/ABG-3623-2020; Fairen, Alberto/T-9374-2017","Gago-Duport, Luis/0000-0002-5536-2565; Bishop, Janice/0000-0002-6681-9954; Fairen, Alberto/0000-0002-2938-6010; Michalski, Joseph/0000-0002-4543-6452; Gross, Christoph/0000-0003-3256-1868",National Aeronautics and Space Administration Astrobiology Institute [NNX15BB01]; Mars Data Analysis Program [NNX12AJ33G]; project 'icyMARS'; European Research Council [307496]; Smithsonian Senior Fellowship; Deutsches Zentrum fur Luft- und Raumfahrt [50QM1702],National Aeronautics and Space Administration Astrobiology Institute; Mars Data Analysis Program; project 'icyMARS'; European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)European Commission); Smithsonian Senior Fellowship; Deutsches Zentrum fur Luft- und Raumfahrt(Helmholtz AssociationGerman Aerospace Centre (DLR)),"The authors are grateful for support from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Astrobiology Institute (grant NNX15BB01 to J.L.B.) and Mars Data Analysis Program (grant NNX12AJ33G to J.L.B.), as well as the project 'icyMARS', European Research Council Starting Grant 307496 (to A.G.F.), a Smithsonian Senior Fellowship (to M.A.V.) and Deutsches Zentrum fur Luft- und Raumfahrt grant 50QM1702 'HRSC on Mars Express' on behalf of the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (to C.G.).

In order to reuse such data, especially data fragments as well as their data services in a collaborative and reproducible manner by citing the origin source, data analysts, e.g., researchers or impact modelers, need a possibility to identify the exact version, precise time information, parameter, and names of the dataset used. A manual process would make the citation of data fragments as a subset of an entire dataset rather complex and imprecise to obtain. Data in climate research are in most cases multidimensional, structured grid data that can change partially over time. The citation of such evolving content requires the approach of dynamic data citation. The applied approach is based on associating queries with persistent identifiers. These queries contain the subsetting parameters, e.g., the spatial coordinates of the desired study area or the time frame with a start and end date, which are automatically included in the metadata of the newly generated subset and thus represent the information about the data history, the data provenance, which has to be established in data repository ecosystems. The Research Data Alliance Data Citation Working Group (RDA Data Citation WG) summarized the scientific status quo as well as the state of the art from existing citation and data management concepts and developed the scalable dynamic data citation methodology of evolving data. The Data Centre at the Climate Change Centre Austria (CCCA) has implemented the given recommendations and offers since 2017 an operational service on dynamic data citation on climate scenario data. With the consciousness that the objective of this topic brings a lot of dependencies on bibliographic citation research which is still under discussion, the CCCA service on Dynamic Data Citation focused on the climate domain specific issues, like characteristics of data, formats, software environment, and usage behavior.

We used Landsat satellite imagery to observe temporal and spatial changes in open-water habitats in Zhengzhou, a rapidly growing city in central China. We classified open water into six categories: perennial rivers, seasonal rivers and streams, canals, lakes, ponds, and reservoirs. From 1990 to 2020, in 5-year intervals, we identified, counted, and measured the area of each kind of waterbody, and we used a model selection approach with linear regressions to ask which climate and anthropogenic drivers were associated with these changes. We also used Conefor software to examine how these changes affected the landscape connectivity for waterfowl. Over the study period, lakes and canals were the only waterbody types to show statistically significant changes in surface area, increasing by 712% and 236%, respectively. Changes in lakes and canals were positively correlated with the length of water pipeline in the city. The connectivity of waterbodies fluctuated over the same period, mirroring fluctuations in the perennial Yellow River. Ponds contributed very little to landscape connectivity, and the importance of reservoirs decreased over time. Conversely, canals played an increasingly important role in landscape connectivity over time. Counterintuitively, the connectivity of waterbodies increased in the built-up part of the city. Our results show that urbanization can have unexpected effects-both positive and negative-on the connectivity and area of open-water habitats. These effects are likely to be important for waterfowl and other aquatic organisms.","[Liu, Chang; Tian, Guohang] Henan Agr Univ, Coll Landscape Architecture & Art, Zhengzhou 450002, Peoples R China; [Liu, Chang; Minor, Emily S.; Garfinkel, Megan B.] Univ Illinois, Dept Biol Sci, Chicago, IL 60607 USA; [Mu, Bo] Henan Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, Zhengzhou 450002, Peoples R China",Henan Agricultural University; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital; Henan Agricultural University,"Tian, GH (corresponding author), Henan Agr Univ, Coll Landscape Architecture & Art, Zhengzhou 450002, Peoples R China.",bomu@henau.edu.cn,,"Mu, Bo/0000-0003-1482-5815; Garfinkel, Megan/0000-0002-9040-0555; Minor, Emily/0000-0003-3906-3044",Urban-Rural Green Space Resources Control and Landscape Ecological Design Disciplinary Innovation and Talents Introduction Centre Program [GXJD006]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [51808198],Urban-Rural Green Space Resources Control and Landscape Ecological Design Disciplinary Innovation and Talents Introduction Centre Program; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This research was funded by Urban-Rural Green Space Resources Control and Landscape Ecological Design Disciplinary Innovation and Talents Introduction Centre Program (GXJD006), National Natural Science Foundation of China (51808198).",,97,3,3,8,28,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-445X,,LAND-BASEL,Land,OCT,2021,10,,,,,,1070,10.3390/land10101070,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land10101070,,,23,Environmental Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WS7ZE,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000715396200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Thus there exists a large gap between the available data sets and the demands of climate impact studies. The presented approach aims to generate spatially high resolution precipitation fields for a target area in central Asia, covering the Tibetan Plateau and the adjacent mountain ranges and lowlands. Based on the assumption that observed local-scale precipitation amounts are triggered by varying large-scale atmospheric situations and modified by local-scale topographic characteristics, the statistical downscaling approach estimates local-scale precipitation rates as a function of large-scale atmospheric conditions, derived from the ERA-Interim reanalysis and high-resolution terrain parameters. Since the relationships of the predictor variables with local-scale observations are rather unknown and highly nonlinear, an artificial neural network (ANN) was utilized for the development of adequate transfer functions. Different ANN architectures were evaluated with regard to their predictive performance. The final downscaling model was used for the cellwise estimation of monthly precipitation sums, the number of rainy days and the maximum daily precipitation amount with a spatial resolution of 1 km(2). The model was found to sufficiently capture the temporal and spatial variations in precipitation rates in the highly structured target area and allows for a detailed analysis of the precipitation distribution. A concluding sensitivity analysis of the ANN model reveals the effect of the atmospheric and topographic predictor variables on the precipitation estimations in the climatically diverse subregions.","[Gerlitz, L.; Conrad, O.; Boehner, J.] Univ Hamburg, Inst Geog, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany",University of Hamburg,"Gerlitz, L (corresponding author), Univ Hamburg, Inst Geog, Bundesstr 55, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany.",lars.gerlitz@uni-hamburg.de,"Boehner, Juergen/I-9844-2014","Boehner, Juergen/0000-0002-0842-0152","Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Berlin, Germany)","Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Berlin, Germany)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF))","The ERA-Interim reanalysis fields were freely provided by the ECMWF.

Studying the response of the GIS to past climatic change may help to advance our understanding of GIS dynamics. The previous interpretation of evidence from stable isotopes (delta O-18) in water from GIS ice cores was that Holocene climate variability on the GIS differed spatially(3) and that a consistent Holocene climate optimum-the unusually warm period from about 9,000 to 6,000 years ago found in many northern-latitude palaeoclimate records(4)-did not exist. Here we extract both the Greenland Holocene temperature history and the evolution of GIS surface elevation at four GIS locations. We achieve this by comparing delta O-18 from GIS ice cores(3,5) with delta O-18 from ice cores from small marginal icecaps. Contrary to the earlier interpretation of delta O-18 evidence from ice cores(3,6), our new temperature history reveals a pronounced Holocene climatic optimum in Greenland coinciding with maximum thinning near the GIS margins. Our delta O-18-based results are corroborated by the air content of ice cores, a proxy for surface elevation(7). State-of-the-art ice sheet models are generally found to be underestimating the extent and changes in GIS elevation and area; our findings may help to improve the ability of models to reproduce the GIS response to Holocene climate.","[Vinther, B.

In this study, the terrestrial near-surface wind speed (NSWS) in the 40 year global reanalysis dataset released by China Meteorological Administration (CRA-40) was employed and compared with four state-of-the-art global reanalysis products, namely the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts reanalysis version 5 (ERA5), National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research reanalysis (NCEP1), National Centers for Environmental Prediction-Department of Energy reanalysis (NCEP2), and the Japanese 55 year reanalysis (JRA55). Large discrepancies were revealed among the reanalysis products in NSWSs across China. CRA-40 captures the climatology, seasonal, interannual, and monthly changes, as well as the terrestrial stilling compared with the recent observed increase. In contrast, NCEP1 and NCEP2 fail to reproduce the climatology and monthly changes in the observed NSWSs. Although JRA55 captures the terrestrial stilling in observations, it underestimates the mean value of NSWS. Therefore, CRA-40 provides the best agreement with stronger and more significant correlations against the observations when compared to other reanalysis products, and reproduces the observed multi-decadal variability. Thus, CRA-40 is the optimal choice to investigate NSWS with high spatial and temporal resolution across China, with a wide array of socioeconomic and environmental impacts.","[Shen, Cheng] Gaochun Meteorol Bur, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Zha, Jinlin; Zhao, Deming] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, CAS Key Lab Reg Climate & Environm Temperate East, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zha, Jinlin; Wu, Jian; Fan, Wenxuan] Yunnan Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, Key Lab Atmospher Environm & Proc Boundary Layer L, Kunming, Peoples R China; [Azorin-Molina, Cesar] CSIC, Ctr Invest Desertificac CIDE, Moncada, Valencia, Spain; [Azorin-Molina, Cesar] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Earth Sci, Reg Climate Grp, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Yu, Yue] Nanjing Meteorol Bur, Nanjing, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; Yunnan University; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); University of Valencia; CSIC-GV-UV - Centro de Investigaciones sobre Desertificacion (CIDE); University of Gothenburg","Zha, JL (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, CAS Key Lab Reg Climate & Environm Temperate East, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Zha, JL (corresponding author), Yunnan Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, Key Lab Atmospher Environm & Proc Boundary Layer L, Kunming, Peoples R China.",zhajl@tea.ac.cn,"Azorin-Molina, Cesar/ABB-5381-2021; shen, cheng/AAJ-8625-2021","shen, cheng/0000-0003-1727-2638; fan, wenxuan/0000-0003-2457-5821","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2018YFA0606004]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [42005023, 41875178, 41775087]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2019M660761]; Nanjing Meteorological Bureau Scientific Project [NJ202103]; Program for Special Research Assistant Project of Chinese Academy of Sciences; Program for Key Laboratory in University of Yunnan Province; Chinese Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center for Climate Change; Ramon y Cajal fellowship [RYC-2017-22830, VR-2017-03780, RTI2018-095749-A-I00]",National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); Nanjing Meteorological Bureau Scientific Project; Program for Special Research Assistant Project of Chinese Academy of Sciences; Program for Key Laboratory in University of Yunnan Province; Chinese Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center for Climate Change; Ramon y Cajal fellowship(Spanish Government),"The authors cordially thank the anonymous reviewers for their thoughtful comments and constructive suggestions, which significantly improve the quality of this paper.

The article will respond to the question of how performance can contribute to post-anthropocentric notions of performativity by emphasizing that the more-than-human relationality in the performance results from the multiple entanglements of human bodily activities with nonhuman environmental and metabolic processes. As I will indicate, referring to a new materialist theoretical framework, even though on the verge of ecological disaster, Burton Nitta's project - which investigates humans' future in the context of the climate crisis, natural resource scarcity and biodiversity loss in the Anthropocene-does not look at the tragic position of the human but instead redesigns the human body with materials -discursive, natural and cultural elements -to prove that any artistic practice can be produced 'with and for', rather than 'of or about', other species.

There is a strong societal interest in understanding the current response of all types of glacier systems to climate change and how they will continue to evolve in the context of the whole glacierized landscape. In particular, understanding the current and future behaviour of debris-covered glaciers is a 'hot topic' in glaciological research because of concerns for water resources and glacier-related hazards. The state of these glaciers is closely related to various hazardous geomorphological processes which are relatively poorly understood. Understanding the implications of debris-covered glacier evolution requires a systems approach. This includes the interplay of various factors such as local geomorphology, ice ablation patterns, debris characteristics and glacier lake growth and development. Such a broader, contextualized understanding is prerequisite to identifying and monitoring the geohazards and hydrologic implications associated with changes in the debris-covered glacier system under future climate scenarios. This paper presents a comprehensive review of current knowledge of the debris-covered glacier landsystem. Specifically, we review state-of-the-art field-based and the remote sensing-based methods for monitoring debris-covered glacier characteristics and lakes and their evolution under future climate change. We advocate a holistic process-based framework for assessing hazards associated with moraine-dammed glacio-terminal lakes that are a projected end-member state for many debris-covered glaciers under a warming climate.","[Racoviteanu, A.

We examined yearly numbers and distribution of 22 769 winter nests of the collared lemming Dicrostonyx groenlandicus (Traill, 1823) from an ongoing long-term research on Traill Island, Northeast Greenland, collected between 1989 and 2019, and correlated this information with data on dominant vegetation types, elevation, and slope. We found that the number of lemming nests was highest in areas with a high proportion of Dryas heath, but was also correlated with other vegetation types, suggesting some flexibility in resource use of wintering lemmings. Furthermore, lemmings showed a higher use for sloped terrain, probably as it enhances the formation of deep snow drifts, which increases the insulative characteristics of the snowpack and protection from predators. With global warming, prime lemming winter habitats may become scarce through alteration of snow physical properties, potentially resulting in negative consequence for the whole community of terrestrial vertebrates.","[von Beckerath, Xaver; Sittler, Benoit; Klein, Alexandra-Maria; Eitzinger, Bernhard] Univ Freiburg, Chair Nat Conservat & Landscape Ecol, Freiburg, Baden Wurttembe, Germany; [Benadi, Gita] Univ Freiburg, Biometry & Environm Syst Anal, Freiburg, Baden Wurttembe, Germany; [Gilg, Olivier] Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, UMR Chronoenvironm 6249, Besancon, Bourgogne, France; [Yannic, Glenn] Univ Grenoble Alpes, Univ Savoie Mt Blanc, LECA, CNRS, F-38000 Grenoble, France",University of Freiburg; University of Freiburg; Universite de Franche-Comte; UDICE-French Research Universities; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Savoie,"von Beckerath, X (corresponding author), Univ Freiburg, Chair Nat Conservat & Landscape Ecol, Freiburg, Baden Wurttembe, Germany.",xaver.vonbeckerath@posteo.net,"Eitzinger, Bernhard/M-5104-2015; YANNIC, Glenn/HDO-0551-2022; Klein, Alexandra-Maria/J-5871-2016","Eitzinger, Bernhard/0000-0001-5903-4887; YANNIC, Glenn/0000-0002-6477-2312; Klein, Alexandra-Maria/0000-0003-2139-8575","foundation Menschen fur Eisbaren; Karupelv Valley Project; Baden-Wuerttemberg Ministry of Science, Research and Art; University of Freiburg","foundation Menschen fur Eisbaren; Karupelv Valley Project; Baden-Wuerttemberg Ministry of Science, Research and Art; University of Freiburg","This study was funded by the foundation Menschen fur Eisbaren along with private donors and sponsors of the Karupelv Valley Project.

Using only daily temperature, liquid precipitation, snowfall, and snow cover, this new model allows the simulation of maximum seasonal frost depths at several thousand U.S. stations. Comparison of the model-derived maximum frost depths with observed and soil temperature-inferred soil freezing maxima at 32 arid and semiarid locations indicates excellent agreement.

This paper deals with an experimental analysis of an extensive green roof, installed on a building of the University of Calabria (Italy, Lat. 39.3 degrees N). The thermal performances of different layering solutions are analysed under typical Mediterranean climate conditions with reference to a traditional roof system. The analysis showed that the green roof is able to reduce the temperature at the interface with the structural roof, on average, by 12 degrees C with respect to a black bituminous roof in summer and to maintain, on average, a value that is 4 degrees C higher in winter. The measured temperatures allowed to calculate the transferred heat through the building roof, showing negative heat fluxes for the whole period and a reduction of the thermal energy entering the indoor environment of 100% in summer, proving the passive cooling effect of the green roof, and a reduction between 30% and 37% of the thermal energy exiting the indoor environment in winter. The experimental data have been employed also to conduct a dynamic characterization of the different vegetated solutions, showing that the different green roofs solutions are able to generate values of decrement factor varying between 0.135 and 0.193 and a time lag between 3.1 h and 4.8 h, which can substantially improve the dynamic properties of traditional roof structures, especially in the case of roofs with limited dynamic performances.

However, with resolution in the order of ten kilometres, RCMs do not explicitly represent cities and their influence on local climate (e.g. Urban Heat Island; UHI). Downscaling methods are required to bridge the gap between RCMs and city scale. A statistical-dynamical downscaling methodology is developed to quantify the UHI of the city of Paris (France), based on a Local Weather Types (LWTs) classification combined with short-term high-resolution (1-km) urban climate simulations. The daily near-surface temperature amplitude, specific humidity, precipitation, wind speed and direction simulated by the RCMs are used for the LWTs attribution. The LWTs time series is associated to randomly selected days simulated with the mesoscale atmospheric model Meso-NH coupled to the urban canopy model Town Energy Balance to calculate the UHI corresponding to the successive LWTs. The downscaling methodology is applied to the EURO-CORDEX ensemble driven by the ERA-Interim reanalysis, and evaluated for the 2000-2008 period against station observations and a 2.5-km reanalysis. The short-term dynamical simulations slightly underestimate and overestimate near-surface minimum and maximum air temperature respectively, but capture the UHI intensity with biases in the order of a tenth of a degree. RCMs show significant differences in the variables used for the LWTs attribution, but the seasonal LWT frequencies are captured. Consequently, the reconstructed temperature fields maintain the small biases of the Meso-NH simulations and the statistical-dynamical downscaling greatly improves the UHI compared to the raw data of RCMs.","[Le Roy, Benjamin; Lemonsu, Aude; Schoetter, Robert] Univ Toulouse, Ctr Natl Rech Meteorol, Meteo France, CNRS, 42 Ave Gaspard Coriolis, F-31057 Toulouse, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Meteo France; Universite de Toulouse,"Le Roy, B (corresponding author), Univ Toulouse, Ctr Natl Rech Meteorol, Meteo France, CNRS, 42 Ave Gaspard Coriolis, F-31057 Toulouse, France.",benjamin.leroy@meteo.fr,"Le Roy, Benjamin/ABA-3284-2021","Le Roy, Benjamin/0000-0002-5496-2462",,,,,106,5,5,5,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0930-7575,1432-0894,,CLIM DYNAM,Clim.

The suggested discretization is derived from the evenly heat-content discretization with the optimal effective thickness for layer-temperature simulation. For the same level number, the suggested discretization is more accurate in skin temperature as well as surface ground heat flux simulations than those used in some state-of-the-art models. A proposed scheme (op(3,2,0)) can reduce the normalized root-mean-square error (or RMSE/STD ratio) of the calculated surface ground heat flux of a cropland site significantly to 2% (or 0.9 W m(-2)), from 11% (or 5 W m(-2)) by a 5-layer scheme used in ECMWF, from 19% (or 8 W m(-2)) by a 5-layer scheme used in ECHAM, and from 74% (or 32 W m(-2)) by a single-layer scheme used in the UCLA GCM. Better accuracy can be achieved by including more layers to the vertical discretization. Similar improvements are expected for other locations with different land types since the numerical error is inherited into the models for all the land types.

Ocean dynamics produce a distinct sea surface temperature warming maximum in the eastern equatorial Pacific, accompanied by an equatorward intensification of the Intertropical Convergence Zone and Hadley Circulation. These tropical responses are established within 25 years of ice loss and contrast markedly with the quasi-steady antisymmetric coupled response in the slab-ocean configuration. A heat budget analysis reveals the importance of anomalous vertical advection tied to a monotonic temperature increase below 200 m for the equatorial sea surface temperature warming maximum in the fully coupled model. Ocean dynamics also rapidly modify the midlatitude atmospheric response to sea ice loss. Plain Language Summary The effect of projected Arctic sea ice loss on the global climate system is investigated using a state-of-the-art coupled climate model. This study shows that the tropics respond to the ice loss within two to three decades via dynamical ocean processes and air-sea interaction. This tropical response in turn modifies the atmospheric circulation and precipitation responses over the North Pacific. This fast response indicates that ocean dynamics needs to be represented for an accurate picture of the global impact of Arctic sea ice loss.","[Wang, Kun; Deser, Clara; Tomas, Robert A.] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [Wang, Kun] Peking Univ, Sch Phys, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Lab Climate & Ocean Atmosphere Studies, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Kun] Civil Aviat Univ China, Dept Aviat Meteorol, Coll Air Traff Management, Tianjin, Peoples R China; [Sun, Lantao] Univ Colorado, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Sun, Lantao] NOAA, Earth Syst Res Lab, Boulder, CO USA",National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; Peking University; Civil Aviation University of China; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Deser, C (corresponding author), Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA.",cdeser@ucar.edu,"Sun, Lantao/O-5028-2019; Wang, Kun/AAE-8410-2022","Sun, Lantao/0000-0001-8578-9175; Wang, Kun/0000-0003-1980-9697","Chinese National Science Foundation (NSF) [41376007, 91337106]; U.S. NSF",Chinese National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); U.S. NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),The first author was supported by the Chinese National Science Foundation (NSF) (grants 41376007 and 91337106).

A wide range of statistical models have been applied to downscaling GCMs but recent advances in machine learning have not been explored compared to traditional approaches. In this paper, we compare five Perfect Prognosis (PP) approaches, Ordinary Least Squares, Elastic-Net, and Support Vector Machine along with two machine learning methods Multi-task Sparse Structure Learning (MSSL) and Autoencoder Neural Networks. In addition, we introduce a hybrid Model Output Statistics and PP approach by modeling the residuals of Bias Correction Spatial Disaggregation (BCSD) with MSSL. Metrics to evaluate each method's ability to capture daily anomalies, large-scale climate shifts, and extremes are analyzed. Generally, we find inconsistent performance between PP methods in their ability to predict daily anomalies and extremes as well as monthly and annual precipitation. However, results suggest that L-1 sparsity constraints aid in reducing error through internal feature selection. The MSSL+BCSD coupling, when compared with BCSD, improved daily, monthly, and annual predictability but decreased performance at the extremes. Hence, these results suggest that the direct application of state-of-the-art machine learning methods to statistical downscaling does not provide direct improvements over simpler, longstanding approaches.","[Vandal, Thomas; Ganguly, Auroop R.] Northeastern Univ, 360 Huntington Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Kodra, Evan] RisQ Inc, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Northeastern University,"Vandal, T (corresponding author), Northeastern Univ, 360 Huntington Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",vandal.t@husky.neu.edu; evan.kodra@risq.io; auroop@coe.neu.edu,"Ganguly, Auroop/AAJ-5591-2020",,NSF CISE Expeditions in Computing award [1029711]; NSF CyberSEES award [1442728]; NSF BIGDATA award [1447587],NSF CISE Expeditions in Computing award; NSF CyberSEES award; NSF BIGDATA award,"This work was funded by NSF CISE Expeditions in Computing award 1029711, NSF CyberSEES award 1442728, and NSF BIGDATA award 1447587.",,71,41,41,11,57,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0177-798X,1434-4483,,THEOR APPL CLIMATOL,Theor.

GFDL-ESM2M is an exception among the state-of-the-art global climate models in that the equatorial Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) in the west warms faster than in the east, and the Walker circulation strengthens in response to warming. This study shows that this ''La Nina-like'' trend simulated by GFDL-ESM2M could be a physically consistent response to warming, and that the forced response could have been detectable since the late twentieth century. Two additional models are examined: GFDL-ESM2G, which differs from GFDL-ESM2M only in the oceanic components, warms without a clear zonal SST gradient; and HadGEM2-CC exhibits a warming pattern that resembles the multimodel mean. Afundamental observed constraint between the amplitude of El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the mean-state zonal SST gradient is reproduced well by GFDL-ESM2M but not by the other two models, which display substantially weaker ENSO nonlinearity than is observed. Under this constraint, the weakening nonlinear ENSO amplitude in GFDLESM2M rectifies the mean state to be La Nina-like. GFDL-ESM2M exhibits more realistic equatorial thermal stratification than GFDL-ESM2G, which appears to be the most important difference for the ENSO nonlinearity. On longer time scales, the weaker polar amplification in GFDL-ESM2M may also explain the origin of the colder equatorial upwelling water, which could in turn weaken the ENSO amplitude.","[Kohyama, Tsubasa; Hartmann, Dennis L.; Battisti, David S.] Univ Washington, Dept Atmospher Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Kohyama, T (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Dept Atmospher Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",kohyama@uw.edu,"Battisti, David S/A-3340-2013; Kohyama, Tsubasa/Q-6214-2017","Battisti, David S/0000-0003-4871-1293; Kohyama, Tsubasa/0000-0002-5606-2062",National Science Foundation (NSF) [AGS1549579]; Takenaka Scholarship Foundation; Div Atmospheric & Geospace Sciences [1549579] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Takenaka Scholarship Foundation; Div Atmospheric & Geospace Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)),"The work was supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) under Grant AGS1549579, and Takenaka Scholarship Foundation.

Floods events, recognized as one of the most threatening water-related disasters, can affect people's lives as well as their properties. In recent years, the number of flood events is growing as a consequence of many factors, both climatic, such as the dramatic intensification of the pattern of precipitations, and non-climatic, such as the change in land use, the increase of population, the presence of relevant human activities in hazard-prone areas and, more general, the uncontrolled urban development. Recent river flooding events in Europe urge the design and implementation of proper flood risk prevention strategies in order to protect society and the environment, and mitigate the impact of these events. The European Flood Directive (FD) 2007/60/EC represents a specific and innovative legislative framework to support the development of these management strategies, in order to reduce the adverse consequences imposed by floods to selected targets. In this context, the recent KULTURisk-FP7 Project developed a state-of-the-art Regional Risk Assessment (RRA) methodology to assess the risk related to flood events. The KULTURisk-RRA methodology, comprehensively presented in Ronco et al. (2014) and based on the concept of risk being a function of hazard, exposure and vulnerability, has been applied to the Sihl River valley in Switzerland through a tuning process considering the site-specific context and features (Ronco et al. 2015). Flood related risks have been assessed for different targets (namely people, economic activities, natural and semi-natural systems and cultural heritage) lying on the Sihl river valley, including the city of Zurich, which represents a typical case of river flooding in urban areas. The main outputs of the RRA methodology application are GIS-based risk maps that allow for the identification and prioritization of relative hotspots and targets at risk. By means of Multi Criteria Deci sion Analysis tools, the so-called total risk maps have been produced to visualize the spatial distribution of flood risk within the study area through a tailored participative approach by eliciting feedbacks from expert and local stakeholders. In particular, the total risk map produced for a 300 year return period scenario (selected as reference) demonstrates that the Sihl river valley is generally affected by a relatively low risk, where higher relative risks are concentrated in the deeply urbanized area around the Zurich city centre. Finally, results of the testing of the KR-RRA methodology in a real case study have confirmed its overall consistency, appropriateness and relevance to the specific needs of the region and the objectives posed by the EU Flood directive.","[Ronco, Paolo; Bullo, Martina; Gallina, Valentina; Critto, Andrea; Zabeo, Alex; Semenzin, Elena; Marcomini, Antonio] Univ Ca Foscari Venice, Dept Environm Sci Informat & Stat, Venice, Italy; [Ronco, Paolo; Torresan, Silvia; Critto, Andrea; Marcomini, Antonio] Ctr Euromediterraneo Cambiamenti Climatici CMCC, Impacts Soil & Coast Div, Lecce, Italy; [Olschewski, Roland] Swiss Fed Res Inst WSL Econ & Social Sci, Birmensdorf, Switzerland",Universita Ca Foscari Venezia; Centro Euro-Mediterraneo sui Cambiamenti Climatici (CMCC),"Marcomini, A (corresponding author), Univ Ca Foscari Venice, Dept Environm Sci Informat & Stat, Venice, Italy.;Marcomini, A (corresponding author), Ctr Euromediterraneo Cambiamenti Climatici CMCC, Impacts Soil & Coast Div, Lecce, Italy.",marcom@unive.it,,,European Commission [265280],European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre),"This work was found by the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) of the European Commission within the collaborative project Knowledge-based approach to develop a culture of risk prevention (KULTURisk), FP7-ENV-2010, Project 265280; www.kulturisk.eu.

It allows detailed studies of atmospheric flow features such as blocks or cyclones. We investigate characteristics of blocks and cyclones in ERA5 using different algorithms, compare the results to ERA5's predecessor, ERA-interim, and investigate how these characteristics depend on spatial resolution. Generally, ERA5 and ERA-interim characterize blocks and cyclones similarly. For Lagrangian detection and tracking methods, blocks are more robust than cyclones to changes in resolution and reanalysis choice. Eulerian methods are robust to changes in resolution. Thus, ERA5 provides a state-of-the-art reanalysis for the synoptic-scale extratropical circulation. We find that Lagrangian cyclone characteristics are strongly dependent on spatial resolution and therefore recommend that model and reanalysis data should be mapped to a common resolution for verification. Plain Language Summary Reanalyses are among the most widely used data sets in the geosciences as they provide a state of the atmosphere that is complete in both space and time by combining a state-of-the-art weather prediction model with historical observations. Their applications range from climatological studies to the closer examination of extreme events. Reanalyses are often the primary tool to assess the performance of climate models. Recently, the ERA5 reanalysis was published, and thus, many users may consider using this new product. However, due to its novelty, ERA5 is not yet investigated extensively. We examine midlatitudinal atmospheric flow features such as blocks and cyclones and their dependence on input resolution and choice of reanalysis. We find that blocks and cyclones characteristics are very similar in ERA5 and its predecessor ERA-interim. Input resolution often plays a more important role on block and cyclone characteristics than the choice between ERA5 and ERA-interim, particularly in case of cyclone characteristics. For many applications, the full resolution of ERA5 may not be necessary, easing the computational requirement to use this high-resolution data set. In case of modeling studies where reanalysis data is compared to modeled data, we recommend using the same resolution.","[Rohrer, M.; Martius, O.; Raible, C.

Previous studies have demonstrated that LUCC significantly impacts both mean and extreme temperatures. In this study, we explored the multimodel performance of simulating LUCC-induced asymmetric effects on the different percentiles of maximum temperatures (T-max) as well as the possible reasons for these effects using results from the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). Four state-of-art Earth system models (which provide the necessary data) are selected for investigating this issue. In general, all the cases of the model from the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory show robust asymmetric responses between the 90th (TX90P) and 10th percentiles (TX10P) of T-max, mainly due to cropland expansions, especially over India, the Sahel, and some parts of North America. However, weak and insignificant responses are shown for both the TX90P and TX10P in other models. The different changes in the T-max variability among the models are primarily responsible for the occurrence of asymmetric features. Furthermore, by decomposing the T-max changes over three typical regions, we analyze the potential causes for the inconsistencies among these models' results and find two crucial processes, that is, the repartitioning of the turbulent heat fluxes and the changes of the diurnal cycle variability due to LUCC. Whether these processes are pronounced determines the occurrence of the asymmetric T-max responses. Overall, this study provides a critical clue for reducing the uncertainties of the LUCC effects on temperature extremes, which should be evaluated against observations.","[Li, Xing; Chen, Haishan; Wei, Jiangfeng; Hua, Wenjian; Sun, Shanlei; Ma, Hedi; Li, Xiao] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteoro, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster, Minist Educ, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Li, Xing; Chen, Haishan; Wei, Jiangfeng; Hua, Wenjian; Sun, Shanlei; Ma, Hedi; Li, Xiao] NUIST, Int Joint Res Lab Climate & Environm Change, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Li, Jingping] Heilongjiang Meteorol Bur, Weather Modificat Off, Harbin, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China",Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology,"Chen, HS (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteoro, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster, Minist Educ, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.;Chen, HS (corresponding author), NUIST, Int Joint Res Lab Climate & Environm Change, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",haishan@nuist.edu.cn,"Li, Xing/ABB-3536-2020; Chen, Haishan/W-3747-2018; Wei, Jiangfeng/T-4090-2019; Sun, Shanlei/U-1923-2019; Hua, Wenjian/Y-2834-2018","Li, Xing/0000-0002-6870-7016; Chen, Haishan/0000-0002-2403-3187; Wei, Jiangfeng/0000-0001-8981-8674; Hua, Wenjian/0000-0002-9705-3234","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41475083, 41625019, 41605034]; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province, China [BK20160948]; Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD); Innovation Research Program for College Graduates of Jiangsu Province [KYZZ15_0243]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province, China(Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province); Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD); Innovation Research Program for College Graduates of Jiangsu Province","This study was jointly supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grants 41475083, 41625019, and 41605034), the Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province, China (grant BK20160948), Project Funded by the Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD), and the Innovation Research Program for College Graduates of Jiangsu Province (grant KYZZ15_0243).

For the first time, a scheme for regionalization of model parameters at the global scale was developed. We used data from a diverse set of 1787 small-to-medium sized catchments ( 10-10,000 km(2)) and the simple conceptual HBV model to set up and test the scheme. Each catchment was calibrated against observed daily Q, after which 674 catchments with high calibration and validation scores, and thus presumably good-quality observed Q and forcing data, were selected to serve as donor catchments. The calibrated parameter sets for the donors were subsequently transferred to 0.5 degrees grid cells with similar climatic and physiographic characteristics, resulting in parameter maps for HBV with global coverage. For each grid cell, we used the 10 most similar donor catchments, rather than the single most similar donor, and averaged the resulting simulated Q, which enhanced model performance. The 1113 catchments not used as donors were used to independently evaluate the scheme. The regionalized parameters outperformed spatially uniform (i.e., averaged calibrated) parameters for 79% of the evaluation catchments. Substantial improvements were evident for all major Koppen-Geiger climate types and even for evaluation catchments>5000 km distant from the donors. The median improvement was about half of the performance increase achieved through calibration. HBV with regionalized parameters outperformed nine state-of-the-art macroscale models, suggesting these might also benefit from the new regionalization scheme.

In comparison with near-global satellite observations from the MOPITT instrument and local surface measurements, the models show large underestimates of Northern Hemisphere (NH) extratropical CO, while typically performing reasonably well elsewhere. The results suggest that year-round emissions, probably from fossil fuel burning in east Asia and seasonal biomass burning emissions in south-central Africa, are greatly underestimated in current inventories such as IIASA and EDGAR3.2. Variability among models is large, likely resulting primarily from intermodel differences in representations and emissions of nonmethane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) and in hydrologic cycles, which affect OH and soluble hydrocarbon intermediates. Global mean projections of the 2030 CO response to emissions changes are quite robust. Global mean midtropospheric (500 hPa) CO increases by 12.6 +/- 3.5 ppbv (16%) for the high-emissions (A2) scenario, by 1.7 +/- 1.8 ppbv (2%) for the midrange (CLE) scenario, and decreases by 8.1 +/- 2.3 ppbv (11%) for the low-emissions (MFR) scenario. Projected 2030 climate changes decrease global 500 hPa CO by 1.4 +/- 1.4 ppbv. Local changes can be much larger. In response to climate change, substantial effects are seen in the tropics, but intermodel variability is quite large. The regional CO responses to emissions changes are robust across models, however. These range from decreases of 10-20 ppbv over much of the industrialized NH for the CLE scenario to CO increases worldwide and year-round under A2, with the largest changes over central Africa (20-30 ppbv), southern Brazil (20-35 ppbv) and south and east Asia (30-70 ppbv). The trajectory of future emissions thus has the potential to profoundly affect air quality over most of the world's populated areas.","Columbia Univ, NASA, Goddard Inst Space Studies, New York, NY 10025 USA; Univ Edinburgh, Sch Geosci, Edinburgh EH8 9YL, Midlothian, Scotland; SRON, NL-3584 CA Utrecht, Netherlands; Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, Wageningen, Netherlands; Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Div Atmospher Chem, Boulder, CO 80305 USA; NOAA, Global Monitoring Div, Earth Syst Res Lab, Boulder, CO 80305 USA; Commiss European Communities, Joint Res Ctr, Inst Environm & Sustainabil, I-21020 Ispra, Italy; Univ Oslo, Dept Geosci, N-0317 Oslo, Norway; Max Planck Inst Meteorol, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany; Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, Frontier Res Ctr Global Change, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2360001, Japan; Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria; Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, Div Atmospher Sci, Livermore, CA 94550 USA; Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; Max Planck Inst Chem, D-55128 Mainz, Germany; Met Off, Exeter EX1 3PB, Devon, England; Rdscientific, Newbury RG14 6LH, Berks, England; Royal Netherlands Meteorol Inst, NL-3730 AE De Bilt, Netherlands; NOAA, Geophys Fluid Dynam Lab, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA; Lab Sci Climat & Environm, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; Univ Aquila, Dipartimento Fis, I-67010 Coppito, Italy; Inst Aeron Spatiale Belgique, B-1180 Brussels, Belgium; Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; Univ Cambridge, Ctr Atmospher Sci, Cambridge CB2 1EW, England; Goddard Earth Sci & Technol Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 21228 USA",Columbia University; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; University of Edinburgh; Wageningen University & Research; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site; University of Oslo; Max Planck Society; Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science & Technology (JAMSTEC); International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne; Max Planck Society; Met Office - UK; Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; CEA; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); University of L'Aquila; University of California System; University of California Irvine; University of Cambridge; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center,"Shindell, DT (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, NASA, Goddard Inst Space Studies, New York, NY 10025 USA.",dshindell@giss.nasa.gov,"Collins, William/A-5895-2010; Strahan, Susan E/H-1965-2012; SZOPA, Sophie/F-8984-2010; Lamarque, Jean-Francois/L-2313-2014; Rodriguez, Jose/G-3751-2013; Savage, Nicholas Henry/AAA-4015-2020; Hauglustaine, Didier/A-4154-2012; Krol, Maarten/B-3597-2010; Pitari, Giovanni/O-7458-2016; Unger, Nadine/M-9360-2015; Wild, Oliver/A-4909-2009; Krol, Maarten C./E-3414-2013; Sudo, Kengo/I-6394-2014; Pfister, Gabriele/A-9349-2008; Butler, Tim/G-1139-2011; Petron, Gabrielle/AAN-5133-2020; Stevenson, David S/C-8089-2012; Schultz, Martin G/I-9512-2012; Magaña, Felipe/B-6966-2013; Shindell, Drew/D-4636-2012; Horowitz, Larry/D-8048-2014; Unger, Nadine/AAI-4462-2021; Ellingsen, Kjerstin/AAV-5047-2021; Bergmann, Daniel J/F-9801-2011; Emmons, Louisa K/R-8922-2016","Collins, William/0000-0002-7419-0850; Strahan, Susan E/0000-0002-7511-4577; SZOPA, Sophie/0000-0002-8641-1737; Lamarque, Jean-Francois/0000-0002-4225-5074; Rodriguez, Jose/0000-0002-1902-4649; Savage, Nicholas Henry/0000-0001-9391-5100; Hauglustaine, Didier/0000-0002-4826-5118; Pitari, Giovanni/0000-0001-7051-9578; Wild, Oliver/0000-0002-6227-7035; Krol, Maarten C./0000-0002-3506-2477; Sudo, Kengo/0000-0002-5013-4168; Petron, Gabrielle/0000-0002-7458-5852; Stevenson, David S/0000-0002-4745-5673; Schultz, Martin G/0000-0003-3455-774X; Shindell, Drew/0000-0003-1552-4715; Horowitz, Larry/0000-0002-5886-3314; Unger, Nadine/0000-0001-7739-2290; Bergmann, Daniel J/0000-0003-4357-6301; Emmons, Louisa K/0000-0003-2325-6212; Lawrence, Mark/0000-0002-2178-4903; Zeng, Guang/0000-0002-9356-5021; Butler, Timothy/0000-0002-2219-4657; Fiore, Arlene/0000-0003-0221-2122; Faluvegi, Gregory/0000-0001-9011-3663; Derwent, Richard/0000-0003-4498-645X",Natural Environment Research Council [NER/J/S/2000/00840] Funding Source: researchfish,Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),,,74,167,167,0,34,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",2169-897X,2169-8996,,J GEOPHYS RES-ATMOS,J.

The aim of our study was to investigate (i) differences in soil microbial communities across an elevation gradient of (sub)alpine grassland soils in the Swiss Alps, and (ii) the long-term effect of translocation of soil cores from a higher to a lower elevation site. The translocation of undisturbed soil cores from a high alpine site (2525 m asl) to a subalpine site near the timberline (1895 m asl) induced an effective artificial warming of 3.3 degrees C. We hypothesized that after longer than a decade, soil microbial community in translocated cores would differ from that at the original site but resemble the community at the new site. Results from soil phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis confirm significant differences in microbial communities between sites and a shift in total microbial biomass (TMB) and proportional distribution of structural groups in the translocated cores towards the lower elevation community. Patterns related to translocation were also observed as shifts in the fractional biomass of ectomycorrhizal and arbuscular fungi, and in relative contents of several structural groups. Hence, soil microbial community activity and diversity indicate a moderate shift towards new site conditions after 11 years and therefore, our data suggest slow responses of microbial communities to environmental changes in alpine soils.

The structure of hydroclimate variability is analyzed to provide insights into the functioning of the climate system and climate models. The consistency of hydroclimate representation in two global [40-yr ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA-40) and NCEP] and one regional [North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR)] reanalysis is examined first, from analysis of precipitation, evaporation, surface air temperature (SAT), and moisture flux distributions. The intercomparisons benchmark the recently released NARR data and provide context for evaluation of the simulation potential of two state-of-the-art atmospheric models [NCAR's Community Atmospheric Model (CAM3.0) and NASA's Seasonal-to-Interannual Prediction Project (NSIPP) atmospheric model]. Intercomparisons paint a gloomy picture: great divergence in global reanalysis representations of precipitation, with the eastern United States being drier in ERA-40 and wetter in NCEP in the annual mean by up to a third in each case; model averages are like ERA-40. The annual means, in fact, mask even larger but offsetting seasonal departures. Analysis of moisture transport shows winter fluxes to be more consistently represented. Summer flux convergence over the Gulf Coast and Great Plains, however, differs considerably between global and regional reanalyses. Flux distributions help in understanding the choice of rainy season, especially the winter one in the Pacific Northwest; stationary fluxes are key. Land-ocean competition for convection is too intense in the models-so much so that the oceanic ITCZ in July is southward of its winter position in the both simulations! The overresponsiveness of land is also manifest in SAT; the winter-to-summer change over the Great Plains is 5-9 K larger than in observations. with implications for modeling of climate sensitivity. The nature of atmospheric water balance over the Great Plains is probed, despite unbalanced moisture budgets in reanalyses and model simulations. The imbalance is smaller in NARR but still unacceptably large, resulting from excessive evaporation in spring and summer. Adjusting evaporation during precipitation assimilation Could lead to a more balanced budget. Global and regional reanalysis will remain of limited use for hydroclimate studies until they comply with the operative water and energy balance constraints.","Univ Maryland, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; Univ Maryland, Earth Syst Sci Interdisciplinary Ctr, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Nigam, S (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, 3419 Comp & Space Sci Bldg, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",nigam@atmos.umd.edu,"Nigam, Sumant/A-8338-2009; Ruiz-Barradas, Alfredo/F-4499-2010","Ruiz-Barradas, Alfredo/0000-0003-3633-3950",,,,,27,75,76,1,9,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0894-8755,1520-0442,,J CLIMATE,J.

Ozone depletion due to emission of chlorinated or brominated halocarbons leads to cooling of the climate system in the opposite direction to the direct warming contribution by halocarbons as GHGs. This cooling is a key indirect effect of the halocarbons on climatic radiative forcing, which is accounted for by indirect GWPs. With respect to climate, it is critical to understand net influences considering direct warming and indirect cooling effects especially for Halons due to the greater ozone-depleting efficiency of bromine over chlorine. Until now, the indirect GWPs have been calculated using a parameterized approach based on the concept of Equivalent Effective Stratospheric Chlorine (EESC) and the observed ozone depletion over the last few decades. As a step towards obtaining indirect GWPs through a more robust approach, we use atmospheric models to explicitly calculate the indirect GWPs of Halon-1211 and Halon-1301 for a 100-year time horizon. State-of-the-art global chemistry-transport models (CTMs) were used as the computational tools to derive more realistic ozone depletion changes caused by an added pulse emission of the two major Halons at the surface. The radiative forcings on climate from the ozone changes have been calculated for indirect GWPs using an atmospheric radiative transfer model (RTM). The simulated temporal variations of global average total column Halons after a pulse perturbation follow an exponential decay with an e-folding time which is consistent with the expected chemical lifetimes of the Halons. Our calculated indirect GWPs for the two Halons are much smaller than those from past studies but are within a single standard deviation of WMO (2007) values and the direct GWP values derived agree with the published values. Our model-based assessment of the Halon indirect GWPs thus confirms the significant importance of indirect effects on climate.","[Youn, D.; Patten, K. O.; Wuebbles, D.

Through this, the earth's surface affects regional energetics, which via scale-interaction influences weather and climate systems. The land surface feedbacks are dominant over the Indian Monsoon Region (IMR) and exert impact on the atmospheric responses such as convection and precipitation through boundary layer coupling. As a result, the land surface processes associated with Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) need to be understood and realistically represented in Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) and regional/global climate models. The ISM is a multiscale system influenced by the boundary forcing from both the continent and tropical oceans, as well as from various boundary layer feedback mechanism. The ISM and associated rainfall is a complex system owing to non-linear interaction between large-scale fields and small-scale convective activities. The ISM is notably influenced by the local and regional scale land surface interactions. This paper reviews the recent developments related to land surface processes and their application to ISM process studies. The evolution of land surface models, state-of-art Land Data Assimilation Systems (LDAS) and their applications in NWP models are discussed.","[Mohanty, U. C.; Nayak, H.

The TC anomalies are obtained from the database for Policy Decision making for Future climate change (d4PDF). This dataset is based on 100-member ensemble simulations for the period of 1951-2010 using the state-of-the-art atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) forced with the observed SST as well as the historical radiative forcing. The AGCM utilized in the d4PDF is the Meteorological Research Institute Atmospheric General Circulation Model (MRI-AGCM) with about 60 km horizontal resolution. Our analysis revealed a prolonged decrease in TC frequency (TCF) over the tropical Western Pacific during the post-El Nino years until the boreal fall. Dominance of anomalous anticyclone (AAC) over the Western Pacific induced by the delayed warming in the tropical IO is the main factor for the suppressed TC activity rather than the local SST change. In contrast, the TC number over the South China Sea tends to increase during the post-El Nino fall (September to November). The physical reason can be ascribed to the weakening of the AAC associated with the termination of IO warming. Thus, we demonstrate that the effect of the IO warming should be taken into account when the ENSO is considered as an environmental factor for predicting TC activity.","[Ueda, Hiroaki; Kamae, Youichi] Univ Tsukuba, Fac Life & Environm Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Miwa, Kana] Univ Tsukuba, Grad Sch Life & Environm Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan",University of Tsukuba; University of Tsukuba,"Ueda, H (corresponding author), Univ Tsukuba, Life & Environm Sci, 1-1-1 Tennnoudai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058572, Japan.",ueda.hiroaki.gm@u.tsukuba.ac.jp,"Kamae, Youichi/L-6694-2013; Ueda, Hiroaki/D-8019-2014","Kamae, Youichi/0000-0003-0461-5718; ","MEXT; JSPS KAKENHI [17K01223]; Integrated Research Program for Advancing Climate Models (TOUGOU program) from the MEXT, Japan; industry-academia collaboration project of University of Tsukuba","MEXT(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Integrated Research Program for Advancing Climate Models (TOUGOU program) from the MEXT, Japan; industry-academia collaboration project of University of Tsukuba","This study utilized the database for Policy Decision making for Future climate change (d4PDF), which was produced under the SOUSEI program and maintained by the DIAS server funded by the MEXT.

These regions nevertheless experienced extended Medieval-era droughts that were more persistent than any historical event, providing crucial targets in the paleoclimate record for benchmarking the severity of future drought risks. We use an empirical drought reconstruction and three soil moisture metrics from 17 state-of-the-art general circulation models to show that these models project significantly drier conditions in the later half of the 21st century compared to the 20th century and earlier paleoclimatic intervals. This desiccation is consistent across most of the models and moisture balance variables, indicating a coherent and robust drying response to warming despite the diversity of models and metrics analyzed. Notably, future drought risk will likely exceed even the driest centuries of the Medieval Climate Anomaly (1100-1300 CE) in both moderate (RCP 4.5) and high (RCP 8.5) future emissions scenarios, leading to unprecedented drought conditions during the last millennium.","[Cook, Benjamin I.] NASA, Goddard Inst Space Studies, 2880 Broadway, New York, NY 10025 USA; [Cook, Benjamin I.; Smerdon, Jason E.] Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Ocean & Climate Phys, 61 Route 9W, Palisades, NY 10964 USA; [Ault, Toby R.] Cornell Univ, Earth & Atmospher Sci, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; Columbia University; Cornell University,"Cook, BI (corresponding author), NASA, Goddard Inst Space Studies, 2880 Broadway, New York, NY 10025 USA.",benjamin.i.cook@nasa.gov,"Smerdon, Jason E/F-9952-2011; Cook, Benjamin I/H-2265-2012",,"NASA Modeling, Analysis, and Prediction Program; NASA Strategic Science; NSF [AGS-1243204, AGS-1401400]; NOAA Award [NAOR4310137]; Cornell University's College of Agriculture and Life Sciences (CALS); Div Atmospheric & Geospace Sciences [1401400] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","NASA Modeling, Analysis, and Prediction Program(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); NASA Strategic Science; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NOAA Award; Cornell University's College of Agriculture and Life Sciences (CALS); Div Atmospheric & Geospace Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO))","Funding for B.I.C. for this work was provided by the NASA Modeling, Analysis, and Prediction Program and NASA Strategic Science.

Nemo-Nordic is intended to be a tool for both short-term and long-term simulations and to be used for ocean forecasting as well as process and climatic studies. Here, the scientific and technical choices within Nemo-Nordic are introduced, and the reasons behind the design of the model and its domain and the inclusion of the two seas are explained. The model's ability to represent barotropic and baroclinic dynamics, as well as the vertical structure of the water column, is presented. Biases are shown and discussed. The short-term capabilities of the model are presented, especially its capabilities to represent sea level on an hourly timescale with a high degree of accuracy.

This work focuses on the comparison of records covering Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 2-1 and MIS 12-11, in order to investigate the behaviour and circulation regime of the MOWu over two climatic cycles of similar astronomical configurations and their associated deglaciation. The analysis of facies established on the basis of grain size, XRF core-scanning, and carbonate content revealed contourite beds formed by the MOWu during MIS 11 and MIS 1 and deglaciations (deglaciation V and I). Contourite sequences show that MOWu velocity at the seabed was higher during MIS 2-1 than during MIS 12-11, and that sediment supply was different between these two climatic cycles. While overall low during MIS 12-11, MOWu intensity increased during deglaciation V and MIS 11 and preceded large ice rafted events and cooling in the North Atlantic Ocean. As a major element of the MOW, MOWu strengthening during deglaciation V likely contributed to higher heat and moisture transport towards the high latitudes inducing a slight increase of calving and size of boreal ice sheets. The MOW-derived injection of heat and salt in the North Atlantic Ocean during deglaciation V might have contributed, through reactivation of the upper AMOC, to the switch of the Atlantic thermohaline circulation from a glacial to an interglacial mode.","[Moal-Darrigade, Paul; Ducassou, Emmanuelle; Giraudeau, Jacques; Hanquiez, Vincent; Perello, Marie-Claire] Univ Bordeaux, UMR CNRS EPOC 5805, Allee Geoffroy St Hilaire, F-33615 Pessac, France; [Bahr, Andre] Heidelberg Univ, Inst Earth Sci, Neuenheimer Feld 234, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Kaboth-Bahr, Stefanie] Univ Potsdam, Inst Geosci, Karl Liebknecht Str 24-26, D-14476 Potsdam, Germany",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Earth Sciences & Astronomy (INSU); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite de Bordeaux; Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg; University of Potsdam,"Moal-Darrigade, P (corresponding author), Univ Bordeaux, UMR CNRS EPOC 5805, Allee Geoffroy St Hilaire, F-33615 Pessac, France.",paul.moal@u-bordeaux.fr,,"Hanquiez, Vincent/0000-0002-4571-6892",French ministry of research; French programmes INSU LEFE (IMAGO),"French ministry of research(Ministry of Research, FranceEuropean Commission); French programmes INSU LEFE (IMAGO)","P.

Using the spectrum analyzer the spectrum of the TEACO(2) laser in which (CO2)-C-13-O-16 is used as working gas is obtained. The used laser is a rapidly tuning miniature TEA CO2 laser. The cavity of the TEA CO2 laser is 200 mm in diameter and 400 mm in length. The main electrodes are a pair of Chang's aluminum electrodes. Tuning mechanism consists of diffraction grating, trigger controller and high frequency stepping motor. The experimental wavelengths are in good agreement with the calculated data. Compared with common CO2, the emission line range of (CO2)-C-13-O-16 is expanded toward the longer wavelength, the longest wavelength of the TEA (CO2)-C-13-O-16 laser is 11.347 mu m.","Harbin Inst Technol, Inst Opoelect, Harbin 150001, Peoples R China",Harbin Institute of Technology,"Zhang, LL (corresponding author), Harbin Inst Technol, Inst Opoelect, Harbin 150001, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,1,SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING,BELLINGHAM,"1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010 USA",0277-786X,,0-8194-6328-0,P SOC PHOTO-OPT INS,,,2005,,,,,U2630,U2630,62630U,10.1117/12.677448,http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.677448,,,5,Optics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Optics,BEQ94,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000238988600030,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, representing this diversity at the global scale is challenging. Typically, in Earth system models, characterization of plant diversity has been limited to grouping related species into plant functional types (PFTs), with all trait variation in a PFT collapsed into a single mean value that is applied globally. Using the largest global plant trait database and state of the art Bayesian modeling, we created fine-grained global maps of plant trait distributions that can be applied to Earth system models. Focusing on a set of plant traits closely coupled to photosynthesis and foliar respiration-specific leaf area (SLA) and dry mass-based concentrations of leaf nitrogen (N-m) and phosphorus (P-m), we characterize how traits vary within and among over 50,000 similar to 50 x 50-km cells across the entire vegetated land surface. We do this in several ways-without defining the PFT of each grid cell and using 4 or 14 PFTs; each model's predictions are evaluated against out-of-sample data. This endeavor advances prior trait mapping by generating global maps that preserve variability across scales by using modern Bayesian spatial statistical modeling in combination with a database over three times larger than that in previous analyses. Our maps reveal that the most diverse grid cells possess trait variability close to the range of global PFT means.","[Butler, Ethan E.; Flores-Moreno, Habacuc; Chen, Ming; Wythers, Kirk R.; Reich, Peter B.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Forest Resources, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Datta, Abhirup] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Biostat, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Flores-Moreno, Habacuc] Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Fazayeli, Farideh; Banerjee, Arindam] Univ Minnesota, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Atkin, Owen K.] Australian Natl Univ, Australian Res Council Ctr Excellence Plant Energ, Res Sch Biol, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Atkin, Owen K.; Meir, Patrick] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Biol, Div Plant Sci, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Kattge, Jens; Wirth, Christian] Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, D-07745 Jena, Germany; [Kattge, Jens; Boenisch, Gerhard; Craven, Dylan; Wirth, Christian] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res Halle Jena Leip, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Amiaud, Bernard] Univ Lorraine, UMR Ecol & Ecophysiol Forestieres 1137, INRA, F-54506 Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France; [Blonder, Benjamin] Univ Oxford, Environm Change Inst, Oxford OX1 3BJ, England; [Bond-Lamberty, Ben] Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Joint Global Change Res Inst, Dept Energy, College Pk, MD 20740 USA; [Brown, Kerry A.] Kingston Univ London, Dept Geog & Geol, Kingston Upon Thames KT1 2EE, Surrey, England; [Byun, Chaeho] Seoul Natl Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Seoul 08826, South Korea; [Campetella, Giandiego] Univ Camerino, Plant Divers & Ecosyst Management Unit, Sch Biosci & Vet Med, I-62032 Camerino, Italy; [Cerabolini, Bruno E.

In this study, we demonstrated how the responsiveness of E-p to soil moisture deficiency affects outcomes from a conventional Budyko equation. We combined a two-parameter Budyko equation with the state-of-the-art complementary relationship (CR) of evaporation (E), and analytically showed that the two-parameter Budyko equation corrects E-p to the wet environment E (E-w) of the CR. Using the Budyko equation combined with the CR, we assessed runoff sensitivity to climatic and land surface changes. Results showed that the CR could become a constraint for calibrating the implicit parameter of the Budyko equation. When compared to the Turc-Mezentsev equation with E-p, the shape parameters of the two-parameter Budyko equation increased to regenerate an ensemble of global E data sets. Correcting E-p to E-w via the Budyko equation with CR reduced runoff elasticities to land property changes, suggesting that climatic changes are more important to changes in runoff than a prior sensitivity assessment would suggest. This study also suggests that the two-parameter Budyko equation isolates the effect of the E-p adjustment from the shape parameter, allowing it to more properly account for surface energy availability.","[Kim, Daeha] Jeonbuk Natl Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Jeollabuk Do, South Korea; [Chun, Jong Ahn] APEC Climate Ctr, Predict Res Dept, Busan, South Korea",Jeonbuk National University; Jeonbuk National University Hospital,"Chun, JA (corresponding author), APEC Climate Ctr, Predict Res Dept, Busan, South Korea.",jachum@apcc21.org,,"Chun, Jong Ahn/0000-0001-8047-1811",National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korean Government (MSIT) [2021R1C1C1003592],National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korean Government (MSIT),This study was supported by a grant from the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Korean Government (MSIT) (No. 2021R1C1C1003592).,,71,2,2,9,34,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",0043-1397,1944-7973,,WATER RESOUR RES,Water Resour.

However, biodiversity and ecosystem processes are commonly monitored independently and on spatiotemporal scales inadequate to inform decision-making. The high Andean ecosystems of Colombia, extending from high Andean forests and paramos to glacier ice caps, form dynamic landscapes because of the interaction of climate and land use change in a complex socioeconomic and political context, including new demographic dynamics and policies associated with the peace process and strict regulations for economic activities in the paramos. Moreover, they are part of a global biodiversity hotspot and provide key ecosystem services, including substantial carbon accumulation and water regulation and provision for large rural and urban populations. There is substantial experience in environmental monitoring of Colombia's high mountain ecosystems, including programs addressing biodiversity, carbon stocks, hydrology, glaciers, and land use dynamics. However, a conceptual and institutional framework for integrating these diverse initiatives is required. Here, we present a proposal to promote integrated monitoring of biodiversity and ecosystem services in high mountain ecosystems in Colombia as a contribution to consolidating a national ecosystem monitoring program. We describe the methodology used to design this integrated strategy based on an extensive process of consultation with monitoring experts in the region. Then, we review the state of the art of environmental monitoring in the Colombian High Andes. Based on the experience accumulated, we propose a multiscale conceptual framework for analyzing drivers of change and response variables from the local to the national scale, emphasizing the importance of monitoring along attitudinal, land use, and ecosystem restoration gradients. Finally, we describe the expected outcomes and possible institutional arrangements for the strategy, as well as some key next steps for promoting its implementation.","[Llambi, Luis D.] Univ Los Andes, Fac Ciencias, Inst Ciencias Ambientales & Ecol, Av Alberto Carnevali, Merida 5101, Venezuela; [Becerra, Maria Teresa] Calle 23 5-35,Apto 1204, Bogota 110311, DC, Colombia; [Peralvo, Manuel] Consorcio Pare Desarrollo Sostenible Ecoreg Andin, German Aleman E12-123, Quito 170504, Ecuador; [Avella, Andres; Baruffol, Martin] Inst Invest Biol Alexander von Humboldt, Sede El Venado de Oro, Av Circunvalar 16-20, Bogota 110311, DC, Colombia; [Baruffol, Martin] Royal Bot Garden, London TW9 3AE, England; [Flores, Liz J.] Inst Hidrol Meteorol & Estudios Ambiental IDEAM, Subdirecc Ecosistemas & Informac Ambiental, Calle 25 D 96 B-70, Bogota 110911, DC, Colombia",University of Los Andes Venezuela,"Llambi, LD (corresponding author), Univ Los Andes, Fac Ciencias, Inst Ciencias Ambientales & Ecol, Av Alberto Carnevali, Merida 5101, Venezuela.",ldllambi@gmail.com,,"Avella Munoz, Edgar Andres/0000-0002-1595-1154",Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC),Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC),"We thank the Andean Forests Program, financed by the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC). for their financial support in the development of the proposal.

Design: Content analysis of issues, priorities and adaptive strategies raised in semistructured community forums. Setting: Rural centres across NSW. Participants: Aboriginal people, service providers and other stakeholders. Voluntary participation by invitation with consent to record discussions. Results: Three themes (containing six issues) emerged: (i) impacts on culture (harm to traditional family structure, culture and place; bringing shame to culture); (ii) sociodemographic and economic impacts (skewing of the population profile; loss of livelihood and participation; aggravation of existing socioeconomic disadvantage); and (iii) loss. In addition to continuing well-being programs that were already successful, proposed adaptive strategies were: capturing the spirit of Aboriginal knowledge and traditions; knowing your land; and Aboriginal arts. Conclusion: Prolonged drought presented substantial and unique adversity for rural NSW Aboriginal communities, compounding existing, underlying disadvantage. Drought-induced degradation of and, sometimes, the necessity to leave traditional land drove people apart and disrupted Caring for Country activities. Some people reported despair at not being able to discharge cultural obligations. At the same time, the drought prompted increased love of and concern for land and a renewed enthusiasm for expressing connectedness to land through all forms of art. Modern Aboriginal and wider community well-being programs helped frame a response to drought alongside traditional Aboriginal dreaming and cultural approaches to emotional health and well-being.","[Rigby, Colin Wayne; Rosen, Alan; Berry, Helen Louise; Hart, Craig Richard] Univ Newcastle, Ctr Rural & Remote Mental Hlth, Sch Med & Publ Hlth, Newcastle, NSW 2300, Australia; [Rigby, Colin Wayne] Charles Sturt Univ, Sch Nursing Midwifery & Indigenous Hlth, Bathurst, NSW 2795, Australia; [Rosen, Alan] Univ Sydney, Brain & Mind Res Inst, Fac Med, Sydney Med Sch, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Rosen, Alan] Univ Wollongong, Sch Publ Hlth, Fac Hlth & Behav Sci, Wollongong, NSW, Australia; [Berry, Helen Louise] Univ Canberra, Ctr Res & Act Publ Hlth, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia",University of Newcastle; Charles Sturt University; University of Sydney; University of Wollongong; University of Canberra,"Berry, HL (corresponding author), Univ Canberra, Ctr Res & Act Publ Hlth, Univ Dr, Bruce, ACT 2617, Australia.",helen.berry@canberra.edu.au,,"Newman, Gregory/0000-0003-0503-5782",,,,,27,85,85,0,33,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1038-5282,1440-1584,,AUST J RURAL HEALTH,Aust.

Links among satellite-derived rainfall (Climate Hazards group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data, CHIRPS), sea surface temperature (Hadley Centre Sea ice and Sea Surface Temperature, HadISST1-SST), soil moisture (Climate Change Initiative, CCI-SM), and dynamical variables (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Re-Analysis, ERA-Interim) are investigated to disentangle their specific role in shaping the rainfall variability over the region. In general, interannual rainfall variability is highest in the area during OND. Empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis is applied to the rainfall dataset to extract the dominant spatial and temporal patterns of variability. Results show that the rainfall variability is directly influenced by the SST variability in the Indian Ocean (Indian Ocean Dipole, IOD) and in the Pacific Ocean (El Nino-Southern Oscillation, ENSO), and by the local SM. The strong positive correlation (0.78) between EA short rain index and the IOD index indicates that the positive-phase IOD (IOD+) plays a dominant role in driving OND rainfall. Moreover, IOD+ usually coincides with El Nino events and becomes stronger as the intensity of El Nino increases for years of joint events, and the Walker circulation is shifted accordingly. Furthermore, El Nino alone brings a reduction of rainfall over EA. The physical mechanism explaining the IOD+ link to EA rainfall consists of a Gill-type response to warm western Indian Ocean SST anomalies that induces anomalous low-level easterlies over the IO and leads to moisture convergence over EA. In general, the response of rainfall is opposite during the negative phase of the events (IOD- and La Nina).","[Ndomeni, C.

Here we report a bidecadally-resolved New Zealand kauri (Agathis australis) tree-ring sequence spanning two millennia that preserves a record of atmospheric radiocarbon (C-14) during ice-rafted debris event Heinrich Event 3 (HE3) in the North Atlantic and Antarctic Isotope Maximum 4 (AIM4) in the Southern Hemisphere. Using C-14 in the marine Cariaco Basin and Be-10 preserved in Greenland ice, the kauri C-14 sequence allows us to precisely align sequences across this period. We observe no significant difference between atmospheric and marine C-14 records during HE3, suggesting no stratification of surface waters and collapse in Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). Instead our results support recent evidence for a weakened AMOC across at least two millennia of the glacial period. Our work adds to a growing body of literature confirming that Heinrich events are not the cause of stadial cooling and suggests changes in the AMOC were not the primary driver of antiphase temperature trends between the hemispheres. Decadally-resolved C-14 in ancient kauri offers a powerful new (and complementary) approach to polar ice core CH4 alignment for testing hypotheses of abrupt and extreme climate change.

The main purpose of HVAC, maintaining appropriate thermal comfort, is crucial for the best energy usage. Additionally, thermal comfort is also important for well-being, health, and work productivity. Recently, data-driven thermal comfort models have achieved better performance than traditional knowledge-based methods (e.g. the predicted mean vote model). An accurate thermal comfort model requires a large amount of self-reported thermal comfort data from indoor occupants which undoubtedly remains a challenge for researchers. In this research, we aim to address this data-shortage problem and boost the performance of thermal comfort prediction. We utilize sensor data from multiple cities in the same climate zone to learn thermal comfort patterns. We present a transfer learning-based multilayer perceptron model from the same climate zone (TL-MLP-C*) for accurate thermal comfort prediction. Extensive experimental results on the ASHRAE RP-884, Scales Project and Medium US Office datasets show that the performance of the proposed TL-MLP-C* exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and F1-score.","[Gao, Nan; Shao, Wei; Rahaman, Mohammad Saiedur; Zhai, Jun; Salim, Flora D.] RMIT Univ, Sch Comp Technol, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia; [David, Klaus] Univ Kassel, D-34131 Kassel, Germany",Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT); Universitat Kassel,"Salim, FD (corresponding author), RMIT Univ, Sch Comp Technol, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia.",nan.gao@rmit.edu.au; wei.shao@rmit.edu.au; saiedur.rahaman@rmit.edu.au; jun.zhai@rmit.edn.au; david@uni-kassel.de; flora.salim@rmit.edu.au,,"Saiedur Rahaman, Mohammad/0000-0003-2320-0112; Salim, Flora/0000-0002-1237-1664; Gao, Nan/0000-0002-9694-2689",Australian Government through the Australian Research Council [LP150100246],Australian Government through the Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),This research was supported by the Australian Government through the Australian Research Council's Linkage Projects funding scheme (project LP150100246).

Today, many bioenergy cropping systems (BCS) are suboptimal due to either social-ecological threats or technical limitations. In addition, the competition for land between bioenergy-crop cultivation, food-crop cultivation, and biodiversity conservation is expected to increase as a result of both continuous world population growth and expected severe climate change effects. This study investigates how BCS can become more social-ecologically sustainable in future. It brings together expert opinions from the fields of agronomy, economics, meteorology, and geography. Potential solutions to the following five main requirements for a more holistically sustainable supply of biomass are summarized: (i) bioenergy-crop cultivation should provide a beneficial social-ecological contribution, such as an increase in both biodiversity and landscape aesthetics, (ii) bioenergy crops should be cultivated on marginal agricultural land so as not to compete with food-crop production, (iii) BCS need to be resilient in the face of projected severe climate change effects, (iv) BCS should foster rural development and support the vast number of small-scale family farmers, managing about 80% of agricultural land and natural resources globally, and (v) bioenergy-crop cultivation must be planned and implemented systematically, using holistic approaches. Further research activities and policy incentives should not only consider the economic potential of bioenergy-crop cultivation, but also aspects of biodiversity, soil fertility, and climate change adaptation specific to site conditions and the given social context. This will help to adapt existing agricultural systems in a changing world and foster the development of a more social-ecologically sustainable bioeconomy.","[Von Cossel, Moritz; Wagner, Moritz; Lask, Jan; Magenau, Elena; Bauerle, Andrea; Lewandowski, Iris; Winkler, Bastian] Univ Hohenheim, Inst Crop Sci, Biobased Prod & Energy Crops 340b, Fruwirthstr 23, D-70599 Stuttgart, Germany; [Von Cossel, Viktoria; Warrach-Sagi, Kirsten; Wulfmeyer, Volker] Univ Hohenheim, Inst Phys & Meteorol 120, Garbenstr 30, D-70599 Stuttgart, Germany; [Elbersen, Berien; Staritsky, Igor; Van Eupen, Michiel] Wageningen Univ & Res Ctr, Earth Informat, POB 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; [Iqbal, Yasir] Hunan Agr Univ, Coll Biosci & Biotechnol, Changsha 410128, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Jablonowski, Nicolai David] Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Bio & Geosci, IBG Plant Sci 2, D-52425 Julich, Germany; [Jablonowski, Nicolai David] Forschungszentrum Julich, Bioecon Sci Ctr BioSC, D-52425 Julich, Germany; [Happe, Stefan] Univ Kiel, Inst Anim Breeding & Husb, Olshausenstr 40, D-24098 Kiel, Germany; [Fernando, Ana Luisa] Univ Nova Lisboa, Fac Ciencias & Tecnol, Dept Ciencias & Tecnol Biomassa, MEtRICs, Campus Caparica, P-2829516 Caparica, Portugal; [Scordia, Danilo; Cosentino, Salvatore Luciano] Univ Catania, Dipartimento Agricoltura Alimentaz & Ambiente Di3, I-95123 Catania, Italy",University Hohenheim; University Hohenheim; Wageningen University & Research; Hunan Agricultural University; Helmholtz Association; Research Center Julich; Helmholtz Association; Research Center Julich; University of Kiel; Universidade Nova de Lisboa; University of Catania,"Von Cossel, M (corresponding author), Univ Hohenheim, Inst Crop Sci, Biobased Prod & Energy Crops 340b, Fruwirthstr 23, D-70599 Stuttgart, Germany.",moritz.cossel@uni-hohenheim.de; mowagner@uni-hohenheim.de; jan.lask@uni-hohenheim.de; elena.magenau@uni-hohenheim.de; a.bauerle@uni-hohenheim.de; vikoca@web.de; kirsten.warrach-sagi@uni-hohenheim.de; berien.elbersen@wur.nl; igor.staritsky@wur.nl; michiel.vaneupen@wur.nl; yasir.iqbal1986@gmail.com; n.d.jablonowski@fz-juelich.de; stefanhappe78@gmail.com; ala@fct.unl.pt; dscordia@unict.it; sl.cosentino@unict.it; volker.wulfmeyer@uni-hohenheim.de; iris_lewandowski@uni-hohenheim.de; b.winkler@uni-hohenheim.de,"Cosentino, Salvatore L/F-7318-2011; Iqbal, Yasir/I-2855-2019; Jablonowski, Nicolai David/AAA-8672-2022; Fernando, Ana Luisa/I-2796-2012; Von Cossel, Moritz/I-6596-2019","Cosentino, Salvatore L/0000-0001-7076-8777; Iqbal, Yasir/0000-0003-1253-204X; Jablonowski, Nicolai David/0000-0002-5298-5521; Fernando, Ana Luisa/0000-0001-9270-3982; Von Cossel, Moritz/0000-0002-1132-3281; Lewandowski, Iris/0000-0002-0388-4521; Warrach-Sagi, Kirsten/0000-0003-2572-8527; Winkler, Bastian/0000-0003-1496-3740; Bauerle, Andrea/0000-0003-2777-4092; Lask, Jan/0000-0002-9356-8505","European Union [727698]; University of Hohenheim; Bioeconomy Science Center (BioSC); Ministry of Innovation, Science and Research within the framework of the NRWStrategieprojekt BioSC [313/323-400-002 13]","European Union(European Commission); University of Hohenheim; Bioeconomy Science Center (BioSC); Ministry of Innovation, Science and Research within the framework of the NRWStrategieprojekt BioSC","This research received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 727698 and the University of Hohenheim.

The 4 courses target in the first semester of 2012 academic year were students in Art Education Program and Teaching Japanese Program; Aesthetic Education, Art for Special-Needs Children, Introduction to Educational Philosophy and Ethics for Profession Teaching. The study was involving qualitative method, contemplative education approaches were used through mindfulness, deep listening, storytelling, sharing experiences together with dialogue, world cafe technique, drawing and reflection journaling. The results from reflective papers, observation and focus group were analyzed by content analysis. The research findings found that the contemplative teaching can support the development of attention, insight, emotional self-regulation, empathy, compassion for self and others and action in order to encourage and transform self-learning, deepens learning and builds inner strengths and skills. Through these approaches they were learning to reduce stress, enhance and improve classroom climates, and were helping students to calm their bodies and minds, focus their attention, and even open their hearts by exchange of learning ideas. The contemplative education approach is enabled students to recognize and properly tend to behavioural patterns and enabled students to process facts which led to contemplation and ultimately to wisdom.

In this study, we show that the increasing nonlinear trend of ISMR and global sea surface temperatures (SST) associated with the trend of the global warming mode leads to a 'long-term' component to the ENSO-ISMR relationship together with a 'short-range' component associated with the ENSO mode. Using historical and projected simulations by some state-of-the-art CMIP5 models, we separate the global warming mode from other oscillatory modes including the ENSO mode through a combined empirical orthogonal function (CEOF) analysis, supported by a signal-to-noise maximizing EOF analysis. We find that the 'short-term' ENSO-ISMR relationship, represented by significant negative correlation between JJAS NINO3.4 SST and ISMR does not change appreciably with increase in green-house gas (GHG) forcing while the 'long-term' relationship changes from weak to significantly positive. We demonstrate that in a warming environment, the global warming mode must be taken into account together with the 'natural' ENSO mode in order to predict ISMR with confidence and emphasize that predictability of ISMR at any given time must be reassessed taking into account contributions from both short and long-term ENSO-ISMR relationships.","[Pandey, Pushpa; Dwivedi, Suneet] Univ Allahabad, K Banerjee Ctr Atmospher & Ocean Studies, Allahabad 211002, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Pandey, Pushpa; Dwivedi, Suneet] Univ Allahabad, MN Saha Ctr Space Studies, Allahabad 211002, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Goswami, B.

Several cross-validated prediction models using various numbers and differently constructed predictors were developed, compared, and evaluated via bootstrapping. As our approach needs a small set of meteorological observations per phenological station, it allows for reliable parameter estimation and an easy transfer to other regions. The most robust and successful model comprises predictors based on mean temperature, precipitation, wind velocity, and snow depth. Its average coefficient of determination and root mean square error (RMSE) per station are 60% and +/- 8.6 days, respectively. However, the prediction error strongly differs among stations. When transferred to other indicator plants, this method achieves a comparable level of predictive accuracy. Its application to two climate change scenarios reveals distinct changes for various plants and regions. The flowering date is simulated to occur between 5 and 25 days earlier at the end of the twenty-first century compared to the phenology of the reference period (1961-1990).","[Ziegler, Katrin; Pollinger, Felix; Paeth, Heiko] Univ Wuerzhurg, Inst Geog & Geol, Wurzhurg 97070, Germany; [Boell, Susanne] Bavarian State Inst Viticulture & Hort, Dept Landscape Architecture, Steige 15, Veitshochheim 97209, Germany",,"Ziegler, K (corresponding author), Univ Wuerzhurg, Inst Geog & Geol, Wurzhurg 97070, Germany.",katrin.ziegler@uni-wuerzburg.de,,,,,,,58,2,2,1,4,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0177-798X,1434-4483,,THEOR APPL CLIMATOL,Theor.

Recently published requirements urge the need for homogenised access to long historical records at a global scale, together with the standardised characterisation of the accuracy of observations. While satellite altimeters offer world coverage measurements, existing initiatives and online platforms provide derived water level data. However, these are sparse, particularly in complex topographies. This study introduces a new methodology in two steps (1) teroVIR, a virtual station extractor for a more comprehensive global and automatic monitoring of water bodies, and (2) teroWAT, a multimission, interoperable water level processor, for handling all terrain types. L2 and L1 altimetry products are used, with state-of-the-art retracker algorithms in the methodology. The work presents a benchmark between teroVIR and current platforms in West Africa, Kazakhastan and the Arctic: teroVIR shows an unprecedented increase from 55% to 99% in spatial coverage. A large-scale validation of teroWAT results in an average of unbiased root mean square error ubRMSE of 0.638 m on average for 36 locations in West Africa. Traditional metrics (ubRMSE, median, absolute deviation, Pearson coefficient) disclose significantly better values for teroWAT when compared with existing platforms, of the order of 8 cm and 5% improved respectively in error and correlation. teroWAT shows unprecedented excellent results in the Arctic, using an L1 products-based algorithm instead of L2, reducing the error by almost 4 m on average. To further compare teroWAT with existing methods, a new scoring option, teroSCO, is presented, measuring the quality of the validation of time series transversally and objectively across different strategies. Finally, teroVIR and teroWAT are implemented as platform-agnostic modules and used by flood forecasting and river discharge methods as relevant examples. A review of various applications for miscellaneous end-users is given, tackling the educational challenge raised by the community.","[Machefer, Melissande; Perpinya-Valles, Marti; Romero, Laia] Lobelia Earth SL, Marie Curie 8-14,A226, Barcelona 08042, Spain; [Escorihuela, Maria Jose] isardSAT, Marie Curie 8-14,A219, Barcelona 08042, Spain; [Gustafsson, David] Sveriges Meteorol & HydrolInst SMHI, Folkborgsvagen 17, SE-60176 Norrkoping, Sweden",,"Machefer, M (corresponding author), Lobelia Earth SL, Marie Curie 8-14,A226, Barcelona 08042, Spain.",melissande@lobelia.earth; marti@lobelia.earth; mj.escorihuela@isardsat.cat; david.gustafsson@smhi.se; laia@lobelia.earth,,"Perpinya-Valles, Marti/0000-0002-9886-9331; Escorihuela, Maria Jose/0000-0002-7780-7334; Machefer, Melissande/0000-0002-9359-3946; Romero, Laia/0000-0001-6476-0875",,,,,38,0,0,2,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2072-4292,,REMOTE SENS-BASEL,Remote Sens.,AUG,2022,15,,,,,,3513,10.3390/rs14153513,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs14153513,,,16,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,3S6WV,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000839735400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here, the authors show that vegetation sensitivity to soil moisture has been increasing in the last 36 years, especially in (semi)arid areas, and that state-of-the-art land surface models fail to capture this trend. Global vegetation and associated ecosystem services critically depend on soil moisture availability which has decreased in many regions during the last three decades. While spatial patterns of vegetation sensitivity to global soil water have been recently investigated, long-term changes in vegetation sensitivity to soil water availability are still unclear. Here we assess global vegetation sensitivity to soil moisture during 1982-2017 by applying explainable machine learning with observation-based leaf area index (LAI) and hydro-climate anomaly data. We show that LAI sensitivity to soil moisture significantly increases in many semi-arid and arid regions. LAI sensitivity trends are associated with multiple hydro-climate and ecological variables, and strongest increasing trends occur in the most water-sensitive regions which additionally experience declining precipitation. State-of-the-art land surface models do not reproduce this increasing sensitivity as they misrepresent water-sensitive regions and sensitivity strength. Our sensitivity results imply an increasing ecosystem vulnerability to water availability which can lead to exacerbated reductions in vegetation carbon uptake under future intensified drought, consequently amplifying climate change.","[Li, Wantong; Migliavacca, Mirco; Denissen, Jasper M.

To answer this question, I propose to analyse Ted Hughes's narrative The Iron Woman (1993) which, despite being written almost thirty years ago as a sequel to The Iron Man (1968), reads as both a story of hope and a wake-up call in our current crisis where children act as agents of change. Drawing on Lucy, the female protagonist, and the Iron Woman as symbols of hope, I will look at the impact that Rachel Carson's seminal work Silent Spring (1962) had for Hughes and place his environmentalism in the context of more recent ecocritical theory, using ecofeminism as a critical framework to analyse the novel. By raising awareness and engaging directly with our environmental crisis, The Iron Woman puts forward Hughes's own social and political concerns and could be read as a potential healer of broken bonds between humanity and nature, not only as a discourse of hope, but perhaps also as a way to contribute towards much-needed change.","[Kerslake, Lorraine] Univ Alicante, Alicante, Spain",Universitat d'Alacant,"Kerslake, L (corresponding author), Univ Alicante, Alicante, Spain.",kerslake@ua.es,,"Kerslake, Lorraine/0000-0002-8104-2418",project Angels of the ecosystem?

A set of multidecadal integrations of the Hadley Centre GCM model, HadAM1, is considered and the focus is on the variability of the winter 500-mb heights over the North Pacific and North Atlantic basins. The method is based on optimally filtering the signal out given an estimate of the covariance matrices of the ensemble mean and the internal noise, respectively, and requires that the ensemble mean be split into clusters according to the phase of the Southern Oscillation and then the signal in each cluster found. Over the North Pacific, La Nina appears to trigger the negative Pacific-North American (PNA) oscillation while during El Nino the response is degenerate, that is, with more than one response pattern, where the first one has a zonally stretched PNA-like structure with a north-south seesaw signature and the second one is similar to the tropical Northern Hemisphere pattern. None of them is precisely the reverse of the response corresponding to La Nina (-PNA). A similar behavior is observed over the North Atlantic where a tripole pattern emerges during La Nina, whereas the first pattern obtained during El Nino shows a (tilted) dipole structure with a north-south seesaw.","Univ Oxford, Clarendon Lab, Oxford OX1 3PU, England",University of Oxford,"Hannachi, A (corresponding author), Univ Reading, Dept Meteorol, 2 Earley Gate,POB 243, Reading RG6 6BB, Berks, England.",,,,,,,,45,23,27,0,7,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0894-8755,,,J CLIMATE,J.

On decadal time scales, a high degree of compensation between the energy transport in the atmosphere (AHT) and ocean (OHT) is found in the North Atlantic. The variability of the total or planetary heat transport (PHT) is much smaller than the variability in either AHT or OHT alone, a feature referred to as Bjerknes compensation. Natural decadal variability stems from the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC), which leads OHT variability. The PHT is positively correlated with the OHT, implying that the atmosphere is compensating, but imperfectly, for variations in ocean transport. Because of the fundamental role of the AMOC in generating the decadal OHT anomalies, Bjerknes compensation is expected to be active only in coupled models with a low-frequency AMOC spectral peak. The AHT and the transport in the oceanic gyres are positively correlated because the gyre transport responds to the atmospheric winds, thereby militating against long-term variability involving the wind-driven flow. Moisture and sensible heat transports in the atmosphere are also positively correlated at decadal time scales. The authors further explore the mechanisms and degree of compensation with a simple, diffusive, two-layer energy balance model. Taken together, these results suggest that compensation can be interpreted as arising from the highly efficient nature of the meridional energy transport in the atmosphere responding to ocean variability rather than any a priori need for the top-of-atmosphere radiation budget to be fixed.","[Farneti, Riccardo] Abdus Salaam Int Ctr Theoret Phys, Earth Syst Phys Sect, Trieste, Italy; [Vallis, Geoffrey K.] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP); Princeton University,"Farneti, R (corresponding author), Abdus Salam Int Ctr Theoret Phys, Str Costiera 11, I-34014 Trieste, Italy.",rfarneti@ictp.it,"Farneti, Riccardo/B-5183-2011","Farneti, Riccardo/0000-0001-7781-6436",NSF [AGS-1144302]; DOE [DE-971 SC0005189]; Division Of Ocean Sciences [1027603] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); DOE(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Division Of Ocean Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)),The work was funded by the NSF under Grant AGS-1144302 and by the DOE under award DE-971 SC0005189.

The two sub-seasonal shifts in boreal summer are analyzed, one from June to July (J-J) and another from July to August (J-A). In observation, the WNPSH consistently retreats eastward and jumps northward (weakens) from June to August. Driven by observed sea surface temperature (SST), the multi-models ensemble (MME) of atmospheric general circulation models (AGCMs) that participated in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) can reproduce the weakening of WNPSH from June to July, but fail to simulate the weakening from July to August. This may be due to the sub-seasonal variation of local SST increasing from June to July but decreasing from July to August. Compared with AGCMs simulation, CMIP5 coupled models MME largely improve the sub-seasonal variation of the WNPSH and associated precipitation change. Thus, it is argued that coupled models should be adopted in studies of the WNPSH on sub-seasonal timescales.","[Lin, Renping; Dong, Xiao; Fan, Fangxing] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Int Ctr Climate & Environm Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS","Dong, X (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, ICCES, Huayan Li 40, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.",dongxiao@mail.iap.ac.cn,"Dong, Xiao/B-8426-2017; Lin, Renping/AAT-5204-2020","Dong, Xiao/0000-0003-2634-2132; Lin, Renping/0000-0003-2050-9413","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41706028, 41606027, 41405058]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 41706028, 41606027, 41405058",,29,3,3,2,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1530-261X,,,ATMOS SCI LETT,Atmos.

By evaluating the state-of-the-art in government and scientific monitoring this paper shows that enhancements and new standards are needed for three key monitoring roles - measurement, reporting and verification - for governments at national scale and scientists at global scale. It outlines a new knowledge exchange matrix framework that can match different organizations to monitoring roles. Conversion of data into useful knowledge is represented by a knowledge exchange chain comprising a series of cycles, each divided into data collection, information production, reporting, verification and synthesis stages. Each stage potentially involves operational, facilitating and coordinating functions at local to global scales. Combining stages, functions and scales forms the knowledge exchange matrix. Organizations are matched to cells in the matrix by their competence and rules governing their operation. Applying the matrix to global forest monitoring shows that existing organizations can contribute complementary facilitating and coordinating functions to support REDD+. Yet none can harness satellite data operationally to produce information at the required spatial and temporal resolution. Two empty national and global operational niches could be filled by new national measurement, reporting and verification systems, operated by governments and facilitated by the Group on Earth Observations and other bodies; and an autonomous science-based World Forest Observatory whose information base could advance global change science and help to verify national REDD+ reports.

The increased frequency and scale of landslides in this area are one of the manifestations of extreme climate change. Studying the trigger of landslides is of great value to the research, protection, and management of engineering geology and climatic environmental changes. However, to our knowledge, there is no efficient, convenient and intelligent method to recognize the trigger of landslides in the Tibetan Plateau. Therefore, a new high-efficiency and high-precision deep learning algorithm has been proposed in this study to analyze the landslides triggers. Specifically, this paper proposes a novel lightweight neural network landslide classification method (MNTL) based on MobileNet-V2 and transfer learning. Mobilenet-V2 requires few parameters and few floating-point operations per second. Furthermore, it is integrated with transfer learning to improve the representation learning ability of the model. The proposed method was applied to classify landslides induced by rainfall and thawing effect. The method required only 30 samples of each class, and it converged quickly in just 3 min and achieved a 94% forecast accuracy. Compared with six state-of-the-art deep learning classification methods-specifically, VGG-16, VGG-19, ResNet-50, ResNet-101, Inception, and MobileNet-V2, the proposed method exhibited competitive advantages in terms of convergence speed and generalization capability. MNTL can be embedded into the mobile terminal, which is conducive to the rapid application of landslide-related research results at a small cost. More importantly, the work in this paper could serve as a potential basis for advancing research on the correlation between landslide hazards and climate change in southeast Tibet.","[Liu, Defang; Li, Junjie] Dalian Univ Technol, Fac Infrastruct Engn, Sch Hydraul Engn, Dalian 116024, Peoples R China; [Fan, Fenglei] South China Normal Univ, Sch Geog, Guangzhou 510631, Peoples R China; [Li, Junjie; Fan, Fenglei] Tibet Univ, Joint Lab Plateau Surface Remote Sensing, Lhasa 850000, Peoples R China",Dalian University of Technology; South China Normal University; Tibet University,"Fan, FL (corresponding author), South China Normal Univ, Sch Geog, Guangzhou 510631, Peoples R China.;Fan, FL (corresponding author), Tibet Univ, Joint Lab Plateau Surface Remote Sensing, Lhasa 850000, Peoples R China.",fanfenglei@gig.ac.cn,"Li, Junjie/HDM-4664-2022",,"National Key R&D program of China [2016YFC0401600, 2017YFC0404900]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [51769033, 51979027, 51779035]",National Key R&D program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"The research is supported by the National Key R&D program of China (2016YFC0401600 and 2017YFC0404900), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51769033, 51979027 and 51779035).",,46,0,0,15,19,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1866-6280,1866-6299,,ENVIRON EARTH SCI,Environ.

But the sensitivity of AC-ENSO relationship to background SST and ENSO properties is still unknown. Using 17 climate models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5, we investigated the sensitivity of the AC-ENSO relationship to the background SST and three ENSO properties. Most of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 models capture the spatial structure of the AC and reproduce the AC-ENSO relationship, but the AC-ENSO relationship has large intermodel spread. The AC-ENSO relationship is mostly sensitive to ENSO zonal extent. ENSO amplitude can also influence the AC-ENSO relationship by affecting the zonal extent. However, ENSO meridional extent and background SSTabove a certain thresholdhave little influence on the AC-ENSO relationship. Plain Language Summary El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) has robust impacts on Hadley circulation (HC). The HC is one of the most important large-scale atmospheric circulations that can affect precipitation and drought in the tropics and subtropics. It is reported that the background sea surface temperature (SST) over the South Pacific Convergence Zone can modulate the relationship between the HC and ENSO. We know that both the background SST and ENSO pattern may change in response to global warming. Therefore, it is necessary to determine how the relationship between HC and ENSO depends on the background SST and ENSO patterns. In this study, we estimated the sensitivity of the HC-ENSO relationship to the background SST and ENSO properties in the state-of-the-art coupled climate models, which promotes our understanding about how the simulation biases of the climatological SST and ENSO properties in these climate models influence the HC-ENSO relationship and to what degree ENSO events may impact the HC in a warming world.","[Guo, Yi-Peng; Tan, Zhe-Min] Nanjing Univ, Key Lab Mesoscale Severe Weather, Minist Educ, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Guo, Yi-Peng; Tan, Zhe-Min] Nanjing Univ, Sch Atmospher Sci, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Nanjing University; Nanjing University,"Tan, ZM (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ, Key Lab Mesoscale Severe Weather, Minist Educ, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.;Tan, ZM (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ, Sch Atmospher Sci, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",zmtan@nju.edu.cn,"Guo, Yi-Peng/AGZ-2335-2022; NJU, SAS/F-2585-2015","Tan, Zhe-Min/0000-0002-2227-6900","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFC1501601]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41461164008, 41705057]; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province [BK20170637]; National Key Project for Basic Research [2015CB425803]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2018M632282]",National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province); National Key Project for Basic Research(National Basic Research Program of China); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation),"We acknowledge the World Climate Research Programme's Working Group on Coupled Modeling and the climate modeling groups for producing and making their model output available.

As a climate-sensitive disease, environmental conditions and past patterns of dengue can be used to make predictions about future outbreak risk. These predictions improve public health planning and decision-making to ultimately reduce the burden of disease. Past approaches to dengue forecasting have used seasonal climate forecasts, but the predictive ability of a system using different lead times in a year-round prediction system has been seldom explored. Moreover, the transition from theoretical to operational systems integrated with disease control activities is rare. Methods and findings We introduce an operational seasonal dengue forecasting system for Vietnam where Earth observations, seasonal climate forecasts, and lagged dengue cases are used to drive a superensemble of probabilistic dengue models to predict dengue risk up to 6 months ahead. Bayesian spatiotemporal models were fit to 19 years (2002-2020) of dengue data at the province level across Vietnam. A superensemble of these models then makes probabilistic predictions of dengue incidence at various future time points aligned with key Vietnamese decision and planning deadlines. We demonstrate that the superensemble generates more accurate predictions of dengue incidence than the individual models it incorporates across a suite of time horizons and transmission settings. Using historical data, the superensemble made slightly more accurate predictions (continuous rank probability score [CRPS] = 66.8, 95% CI 60.6-148.0) than a baseline model which forecasts the same incidence rate every month (CRPS = 79.4, 95% CI 78.5-80.5) at lead times of 1 to 3 months, albeit with larger uncertainty. The outbreak detection capability of the superensemble was considerably larger (69%) than that of the baseline model (54.5%). Predictions were most accurate in southern Vietnam, an area that experiences semi-regular seasonal dengue transmission. The system also demonstrated added value across multiple areas compared to previous practice of not using a forecast. We use the system to make a prospective prediction for dengue incidence in Vietnam for the period May to October 2020. Prospective predictions made with the superensemble were slightly more accurate (CRPS = 110, 95% CI 102-575) than those made with the baseline model (CRPS = 125, 95% CI 120-168) but had larger uncertainty. Finally, we propose a framework for the evaluation of probabilistic predictions. Despite the demonstrated value of our forecasting system, the approach is limited by the consistency of the dengue case data, as well as the lack of publicly available, continuous, and long-term data sets on mosquito control efforts and serotype-specific case data. Conclusions This study shows that by combining detailed Earth observation data, seasonal climate forecasts, and state-of-the-art models, dengue outbreaks can be predicted across a broad range of settings, with enough lead time to meaningfully inform dengue control. While our system omits some important variables not currently available at a subnational scale, the majority of past outbreaks could be predicted up to 3 months ahead. Over the next 2 years, the system will be prospectively evaluated and, if successful, potentially extended to other areas and other climate-sensitive disease systems. Author summary Why was this study done? A climate-driven dengue early warning system would allow public health decision-makers to design, implement, and target timely interventions to the most at-risk places. Dengue is sensitive to changes in temperature, rainfall, humidity, and wind speed. Therefore, a dengue prediction model driven by seasonal climate forecasts offers a valuable tool for predicting dengue risk in advance. What did the researchers do and find? We developed a superensemble of probabilistic models to predict dengue incidence across Vietnam up to 6 months ahead. The predictive ability of the superensemble was assessed using multiple verification metrics and compared to a baseline model at multiple lead times, seasons, and locations. We found that the model superensemble generated more accurate predictions than the baseline model 1 to 3 months ahead but not 4 to 6 months ahead. The model superensemble, however, was better able to predict outbreaks than the baseline model across all lead times. The predictive ability of the model varied with geographic location, forecast horizon, and time of the year and performed best in the peak season in areas experiencing a high level of transmission. What do these findings mean? While outbreaks of infectious diseases are difficult to predict, particularly several months ahead, model superensembles, which combine multiple climatic drivers with dengue surveillance data at the time of forecast issue date, provide a useful decision-support tool. Early warning systems driven by seasonal climate forecasts could shift dengue control towards a more preventative approach, guiding bespoke and targeted public health interventions and a more efficient allocation of scarce resources.","[Colon-Gonzalez, Felipe J.; Soares Bastos, Leonardo; Brady, Oliver J.; Lowe, Rachel] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Ctr Math Modelling Infect Dis, London, England; [Colon-Gonzalez, Felipe J.; Brady, Oliver J.; Lowe, Rachel] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Fac Epidemiol & Populat Hlth, Dept Infect Dis Epidemiol, London, England; [Colon-Gonzalez, Felipe J.; Soares Bastos, Leonardo; Lowe, Rachel] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Ctr Climate Change & Planetary Hlth, London, England; [Colon-Gonzalez, Felipe J.] Univ East Anglia, Tyndall Ctr Climate Change Res, Norwich, Norfolk, England; [Soares Bastos, Leonardo] Oswaldo Cruz Fdn Fiocruz, Sci Comp Programme, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Hofmann, Barbar; Hopkin, Alison; Harpham, Quillon; Ferrario, Iacopo; Moschini, Francesca; James, Samuel; Malde, Sajni; Ainscoe, Eleanor; Tsarouchi, Gina; Lumbroso, Darren] HR Wallingford, Wallingford, Oxon, England; [Crocker, Tom; Amato, Rosanna; Harrison, Mark] Met Off, Exeter, Devon, England; [Sinh Nam, Vu] Natl Inst Hyg & Epidemiol, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Quang Tan, Dang; Duc Khoa, Nguyen] Gen Dept Prevent Med, Hanoi, Vietnam",University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine; University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine; University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine; University of East Anglia; Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz; HR Wallingford Limited; Met Office - UK; National Institute of Hygiene & Epidemiology (NIHE),"Colon-Gonzalez, FJ (corresponding author), London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Ctr Math Modelling Infect Dis, London, England.;Colon-Gonzalez, FJ (corresponding author), London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Fac Epidemiol & Populat Hlth, Dept Infect Dis Epidemiol, London, England.;Colon-Gonzalez, FJ (corresponding author), London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Ctr Climate Change & Planetary Hlth, London, England.;Colon-Gonzalez, FJ (corresponding author), Univ East Anglia, Tyndall Ctr Climate Change Res, Norwich, Norfolk, England.",Felipe.Colon@lshtm.ac.uk,"Brady, Oliver/P-9421-2019; Lowe, Rachel/GXN-3278-2022; Lowe, Rachel/H-1658-2015","Brady, Oliver/0000-0002-3235-2129; Lowe, Rachel/0000-0003-3939-7343; Crocker, Thomas/0000-0001-7761-5546; Bastos, Leonardo/0000-0002-1406-0122; Amato, Rosanna/0000-0001-9338-4258; Harpham, Quillon/0000-0003-4252-8244; Colon-Gonzalez, Felipe de Jesus/0000-0002-9671-3405; Moschini, Francesca/0000-0001-5068-8497",UK Space Agency Dengue forecasting MOdel Satellite-based System (DMOSS); Wellcome Trust Sir Henry Wellcome Fellowship [206471/Z/17/Z]; Royal Society Dorothy Hodgkin Fellowship; Pasteur Institute Ho Chi Minh City; Pasteur Institute Nha Trang; Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology Tay Nguyen (TIHE); National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology (NIHE); D-MOSS grant,UK Space Agency Dengue forecasting MOdel Satellite-based System (DMOSS); Wellcome Trust Sir Henry Wellcome Fellowship; Royal Society Dorothy Hodgkin Fellowship(Royal Society of London); Pasteur Institute Ho Chi Minh City; Pasteur Institute Nha Trang; Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology Tay Nguyen (TIHE); National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology (NIHE); D-MOSS grant,"This work was funded by the UK Space Agency (https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/uk-space-agency) Dengue forecasting MOdel Satellite-based System (DMOSS) awarded to GT, DL, MH, OJB and RL.

In this study we present results from 37 sensitivity experiments that were performed with the Planet Simulator (PlaSim), an Earth System Model of intermediate complexity. In contrast to previous studies, in which only a limited number of potential climate-controlling parameters were assessed with different climate models, we tested our presumed key parameters within one single model. This approach makes it easier to compare the influence of the various parameters on extreme climate change as postulated for the Neoproterozoic Era. Furthermore we compare the results obtained to most recent high complexity state-of-the-art approaches. This comparison helps to estimate, which internal model interactions and physics are crucial for a Snowball Earth simulation and hence should be included into a model that is capable of realistically simulating a Neoproterozoic climate. To this effect we carried out simulations that involved reduced solar irradiation, land-sea distributions, atmospheric CO2 concentrations, relief of the land surface and length of day. In addition, we focus on different land surface albedo values, which were most likely exceptionally low and similar to the Martian albedo, and obliquity changes between 23.5 degrees and 80 degrees. Our findings suggest that changes in land surface albedo are a strong climate driver that can compensate a much lower Neoproterozoic total solar irradiance if it is combined with shifts in obliquity or atmospheric CO2 levels. We also obtained a critical threshold for increased obliquities beyond which a Snowball Earth situation turns into an extreme greenhouse climate with almost absent cryosphere, and furthermore, obliquity values that lead to a tropical ice age with sea ice spreading from the equator to high latitudes.

Under global warming, disruption of community interactions can arise when species differ in their sensitivity to rising temperature, leading to mismatched phenologies and/or dispersal patterns. To study species persistence under global climate change, it is critical to consider the ecology and evolution of multispecies interactions; however, the sheer number of potential interactions makes a full study of all interactions unfeasible. One mechanistic approach to solving the problem of complicated community context to global change is to (i) define strategy groups of species based on life-history traits, trophic position, or location in the ecosystem, (ii) identify species involved in key interactions within these groups, and (iii) determine from the interactions of these key species which traits to study in order to understand the response to global warming. We review the importance of multispecies interactions looking at two trait categories: thermal sensitivity of metabolic rate and associated life-history traits and dispersal traits of species. A survey of published literature shows pronounced and consistent differences among trophic groups in thermal sensitivity of life-history traits and in dispersal distances. Our approach increases the feasibility of unraveling such a large and diverse set of community interactions, with the ultimate goal of improving our understanding of community responses to global warming.","[Berg, Matty P.; Kiers, E.

In comparison with the September sea-ice extent, the September sea-ice volume has larger spread in the historical simulation but faster convergence in the projection simulation, especially in the context of increasing greenhouse gas emissions. This indicates that the ice volume might be more sensitive to external forcings than the ice extent. Using the averaged projection of those climate models from the 30 CMIP5 models that can better reflect the 'observed' sea-ice volume climatology and variability, it is shown that the September sea ice volume will decrease to similar to 3000 km(3) in the early 2060s, and then level off under a medium-mitigation scenario. However, it will drop to similar to 3000 km(3) in the early 2040s and reach a near-zero ice volume in the mid-2070s under a high-emission scenario. With respect to the historical condition, the reduction of the ice volume, associated with increasing greenhouse gas emissions, is more rapid than that of the ice extent during the twenty-first century.","[Song Mi-Rong] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, State Key Lab Numer Modeling Atmospher Sci & Geop, Beijing, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS","Song, MR (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, State Key Lab Numer Modeling Atmospher Sci & Geop, Beijing, Peoples R China.",songmirong@lasg.iap.ac.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [41305097, 41176169]; National Basic Research Program of China [973 program] [2011CB309704]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Basic Research Program of China [973 program](National Basic Research Program of China),"This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant numbers 41305097 and 41176169], the National Basic Research Program of China [973 program, grant number 2011CB309704].",,21,4,4,1,5,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1674-2834,2376-6123,,ATMOS OCEAN SCI LETT,Atmos.

One of the mission's principal objectives is to determine the global distribution of detailed aerosol and cloud properties with unprecedented accuracy, thereby facilitating the quantification of the aerosol direct and indirect radiative forcings. The other is to continue the 28-yr record of satellite-based measurements of total solar irradiance from which the effect of solar variability on the Earth's climate is quantified. These objectives will be met by flying two state-of-the-art science instruments on an Earth-orbiting platform. Based on a proven technique demonstrated with an aircraft-based prototype, the Aerosol Polarimetry Sensor (APS) will collect accurate multiangle photopolarimetric measurements of the Earth along the satellite ground track within a wide spectral range extending from the visible to the shortwave infrared. The Total Irradiance Monitor (TIM) is an improved version of an instrument currently flying on the Solar Radiation and Climate Experiment (SORCE) and will provide accurate and precise measurements of spectrally integrated sunlight illuminating the Earth. Because Glory is expected to fly as part of the A-Train constellation of Earth-orbiting spacecraft, the APS data will also be used to improve retrievals of aerosol climate forcing parameters and global aerosol assessments with other A-Train instruments. In this paper, we detail the scientific rationale and objectives of the Glory mission, explain how these scientific objectives dictate the specific measurement strategy, describe how the measurement strategy will be implemented by the APS and TIM, and briefly outline the overall structure of the mission. It is expected that the Glory results will be used extensively by members of the climate, solar, atmospheric, oceanic, and environmental research communities as well as in education and outreach activities.","NASA, Goddard Inst Space Studies, New York, NY 10025 USA; Univ Colorado, Lab Atmospher & Space Phys, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; Raytheon Santa Barbara Remote Sensing, Goleta, CA USA; NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; NASA Headquarters, Washington, DC USA; Orbital Sci Corp, Dulles, VA USA",National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA),"Mishchenko, MI (corresponding author), NASA, Goddard Inst Space Studies, 2880 Boradway, New York, NY 10025 USA.",mmishchenko@giss.nasa.gov,"Mishchenko, Michael I/D-4426-2012","Mishchenko, Michael/0000-0001-5252-7777; Cairns, Brian/0000-0002-1980-1022",,,,,62,228,234,0,34,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0003-0007,1520-0477,,B AM METEOROL SOC,Bull.

Effective watershed management practices are hydrologically defined, ecosystem-based, inclusive, and integrate biophysical as well as socioeconomic decisions. The uncertainties and unpredictability of climate change create an ambiguous backdrop to the increasingly social problem of water resource management. Inequities in watershed decision-making processes often lead to the reinforcement of power and resource imbalances. Future watershed managers must be able to engage across socioeconomic and cultural boundaries to support decisions that advance water as a human right in an uncertain future. We offer a design for a graduate level, 15-week university course that uses publicly available resources to help emerging watershed leaders prepare for an uncertain future. The design is interactive and constructivist, engaging the refereed literature and leading to an increased understanding of ecosystem-based watershed management under climate scenarios, with special attention to vulnerable populations.","[Perry, Jim] Univ Minnesota, Dept Fisheries Wildlife & Conservat Biol, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Thompson, Louise] Univ Minnesota, Nat Resource Sci & Management Grad Program, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Perry, J (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Fisheries Wildlife & Conservat Biol, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",jperry@umn.edu; louise.thompson061@gmail.com,,,,,,,53,2,2,2,8,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2073-4441,,,WATER-SUI,Water,APR,2019,4,,,,,,662,10.3390/w11040662,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w11040662,,,11,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,IF5FC,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000473105700032,View Full Record in Web of Science

By considering indoor air temperature (Ta-I), levelled oscillations above T-l are utilised to determine indoor temperature extremes/frequencies at a 10 min temporal resolution during the months of July and August 2020 in Ankara. These recordings were undertaken through the use of an interior in-situ Meteorological Station (MS), simultaneously, an outdoor in-situ MS was also mounted outside the naturally ventilated dwelling with the identical measurement interval period. Moreover, to supplement the encompassing outdoor data collection, two WMO MSs were utilised in the study to account for both encompassing local peri-urban Esenboga (EMS) and Ankara's urban (AMS) outdoor air temperatures (Ta-O) at a 1 h temporal resolution. In addition to the ICDN's identified variation of T-l levels, which frequently remained between +7 degrees C and +10 degrees C during periods of accentuated urban outdoor heat stress; their direct/latent cause-and-effect relationship with newly defined local extreme heat thresholds were established. Relative to July and August 2020, a total of 19 Very Hot Days (VHD33), 10 Monthly Tropical Night (MRT20), and 4 Heatwave Events (HWE31) were determined. These thresholds further underlined the growing need to associate indoor and outdoor heat stress during local extreme heat events, particularly in more vulnerable residential contexts; and moreover, in an era of increasing heat stress as result of rapid urbanisation and climate change.","[Nouri, A.

Since 2017, subsequent waves of EU research- and innovation-funded projects have substantially contributed to the knowledge base of funding and business models for NBS, particularly in the urban context. Collaborating and sharing knowledge through an EU Task Force, this first set of EU projects laid important knowledge foundations, reviewing existing literature, and compiling empirical evidence of different financing approaches and the business models that underpinned them. The second set of EU innovation actions advanced this knowledge base, developing and testing new implementation models, business model tools, and approaches.

In this work, we examine the use of machine learning (ML) to predict the occurrence of deep convection from a state-of-the-art atmospheric reanalysis (ERA5). Logistic regression, random forests, gradient-boosted decision trees, and deep neural networks were trained with lightning data to predict thunderstorm occurrence (TO) in Central and Northern Europe (2012-2017) and in Sri Lanka (2016-2017). Up to 40 input variables were used, representing, for example, instability, humidity, and inhibition. Feature importances derived for the various models emphasize the high importance of conditional instability for deep convection in Europe, while in Sri Lanka, TO is more strongly regulated by humidity. The Precision-Recall curve indicates more than a twofold improvement in skill over convective available potential energy for short-term (0-45 min) predictions of TO in Europe by using neural networks or gradient-boosted decision tree and a larger improvement in the tropical domain. The diurnal cycle of deep convection is closely reproduced, suggesting that ML could be used to trigger convection in climate models. Finally, a strong relationship was found between area-mean monthly TO and ML predictions, with correlation coefficients exceeding 0.94 in all domains. Convective available potential energy has a similar level of correlation with monthly thunderstorm activity only in Northern Europe.

Green spaces are promoted worldwide as local and city-scale cooling strategies but the amount, type, and functioning of vegetation in cities lack quantification and their interaction with urban climate in different settings remains a matter of debate. Here we use state-of-the-art remote sensing data from 145 city clusters to disentangle the drivers of surface urban heat islands (SUHI) intensity and quantify urban-rural differences in vegetation cover, species composition, and evaporative cooling. We show that nighttime SUHIs are affected mostly by abiotic factors, while daytime SUHIs are highly correlated with vegetation characteristics and the wetness of the background climate. Magnitude and seasonality of daytime SUHIs are controlled by urban-rural differences in plant transpiration and leaf area, which explain the dependence of SUHIs on wetness conditions. Leaf area differences are caused primarily by changes in vegetation type and a loss of in-city forested areas, highlighting the importance of maintaining natural reserves as a sustainable heat mitigation policy.","[Paschalis, Athanasios] Imperial Coll London, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, London, England; [Chakraborty, T.

Daily maximum and minimum temperature data at 121 well-distributed stations for the period 1970-2003 have been used to study the observed changes in objectively defined values of temperature extremes. In addition, an assessment of future scenarios of temperature extremes associated with increase in the concentration of atmospheric greenhouse gases is done using simulations of a state-of-the-art regional climate modelling system known as PRECIS (Providing Regional Climate for Impact Studies) performed to generate the climate for the present (1961-1990) and future projections for the period 2071-2100. Observational analysis done with 121 stations suggests the widespread warming through increase in intensity and frequency of hot events and also with decrease in frequency of cold events. More than 75% stations show decreasing trend in number of cold events and about 70% stations show increasing trend in hot events. Percentage of stations towards the warming through intensity indices of highest maximum temperature, lowest minimum temperature is 78 and 71% stations, respectively. Remaining stations show opposite trends, however, most of them are statistically insignificant. Observational analysis for India as a whole also shows similar results. Composite anomalies for monthly temperature extremes over two equal parts of the data period show increase (decrease) in the frequency of hot (cold) events for all months. In general, PRECIS simulations under both A2 and B2 scenarios indicate increase (decrease) in hot (cold) extremes towards the end of twenty-first century. Both show similar patterns, but the B2 scenario shows slightly lower magnitudes of the projected changes. Temperatures are likely to increase in entire calendar year, but the changes in winter season are expected to be prominent. Diurnal temperature range is expected to decrease in winter (JF) and pre-monsoon (MAM) months.","[Revadekar, J. V.; Kothawale, D. R.; Patwardhan, S. K.; Pant, G. B.; Kumar, K.

In December-February over that epoch, there is a northward shift of frontal activity in the Pacific in the Northern Hemisphere (NH). In the Southern Hemisphere (SH), the largest trends are identified in the austral summer and are manifested by a southward shift of frontal activity over the Southern Ocean. Variability of frontal behavior is found to be closely related to the main modes of atmospheric circulation, such as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) for the Atlantic-European sector in the NH and the southern annular mode (SAM) in the middle and high latitudes of the SH. A signal associated with El Nino and hence emanating from the tropics is also apparent in the behavior of frontal systems over the Pacific by a reduction in the number of fronts in the middle South Pacific and intensification of frontal activity in high and low latitudes throughout the year. It is shown in general that the associations of the large-scale modes with frontal variability are much stronger than with cyclones. This indicates that the quantification of the behavior of fronts is an important component of understanding the climate system. At the very high latitudes, it is also shown here that, in the recent years of rapid sea ice reduction in the Arctic, there have been fewer summer fronts observed over the Canadian Arctic.","[Rudeva, Irina; Simmonds, Ian] Univ Melbourne, Sch Earth Sci, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Rudeva, Irina] Russian Acad Sci, PP Shirshov Inst Oceanol, Moscow, Russia",University of Melbourne; Russian Academy of Sciences; Shirshov Institute of Oceanology,"Rudeva, I (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Sch Earth Sci, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",irina.rudeva@unimelb.edu.au,,"Rudeva, Irina/0000-0001-9851-8198; Simmonds, Ian/0000-0002-4479-3255",Australian Research Council,Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"The authors thank Kevin Keay for his help in setting up the frontal identification scheme.

In this study, we extracted the leading inter-model mode of the EASM changes based on the atmospheric circulation, and investigated its relationship with the WNPSH and EAJ. The leading mode of circulation, characterized as a low-level cyclonic circulation change, is closely correlated with a weakened or eastward-retreated WNPSH and a southward-shifted EAJ. This systematic link between them is maintained by the stronger tropospheric warming over East Asia and the western North Pacific, which originates from the greater surface warming over the equatorial western Pacific.","[Zhou, Shijie; Huang, Gang; Huang, Ping] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, State Key Lab Numer Modeling Atmospher Sci & Geop, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Shijie; Huang, Gang] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Earth & Planetary Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Huang, Gang] Qingdao Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol, Lab Reg Oceanog & Numer Modeling, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Huang, Gang; Huang, Ping] Joint Ctr Global Change Studies JCGCS, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Huang, Ping] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Ctr Monsoon Syst Res, Beijing, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Qingdao National Laboratory for Marine Science & Technology; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS","Huang, G; Huang, P (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, State Key Lab Numer Modeling Atmospher Sci & Geop, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Huang, G (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Earth & Planetary Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Huang, G (corresponding author), Qingdao Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol, Lab Reg Oceanog & Numer Modeling, Qingdao, Peoples R China.;Huang, G; Huang, P (corresponding author), Joint Ctr Global Change Studies JCGCS, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Huang, P (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Ctr Monsoon Syst Res, Beijing, Peoples R China.",hg@mail.iap.ac.cn; huangping@mail.iap.ac.cn,"huang, gang/D-6427-2012","huang, gang/0000-0002-8692-7856","National Key R&D Program of China [2019YFA0606703]; Key Deployment Project of Centre for Ocean Mega-Research of Science, Chinese academy of science [COMS2019Q03]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41975116, 41722504, 41831175, 91937302, 41721004]; Youth Innovation Promotion Association CAS [2016074]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [BX20200329]; Special Research Assistant Project","National Key R&D Program of China; Key Deployment Project of Centre for Ocean Mega-Research of Science, Chinese academy of science; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Youth Innovation Promotion Association CAS; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); Special Research Assistant Project","This work was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (Grant 2019YFA0606703), the Key Deployment Project of Centre for Ocean Mega-Research of Science, Chinese academy of science (COMS2019Q03), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grants 41975116, 41722504, 41831175, 91937302, and 41721004), the Youth Innovation Promotion Association CAS (2016074), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, the Special Research Assistant Project and the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (BX20200329).

Here we incorporate the latest global non-CO2 emissions and mitigation data into a state-of-the-art integrated assessment model GCAM and examine 90 mitigation scenarios pairing different levels of CO2 and non-CO2 GHG abatement pathways. We estimate that when non-CO2 mitigation contributions are not fully implemented, the timing of net-zero CO2 must occur about two decades earlier. Conversely, comprehensive GHG abatement that fully integrates non-CO2 mitigation measures in addition to a net-zero CO2 commitment can help achieve 1.5 degrees C stabilization. While decarbonization-driven fuel switching mainly reduces non-CO2 emissions from fuel extraction and end use, targeted non-CO2 mitigation measures can significantly reduce fluorinated gas emissions from industrial processes and cooling sectors. Our integrated modeling provides direct insights in how system-wide all GHG mitigation can affect the timing of net-zero CO2 for 1.5 degrees C and 2 degrees C climate change scenarios. Stabilizing climate change requires simultaneous mitigation of all greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs). Here the authors examine 90 mitigation scenarios pairing different levels of CO2 and non-CO2 GHG abatement pathways to demonstrate the contributions of different GHGs towards 1.5 degrees C and 2 degrees C goals.","[Ou, Yang; Roney, Christopher; Calvin, Katherine; Edmonds, Jae; Kyle, Page; Narayan, Kanishka; O'Rourke, Patrick; Patel, Pralit; Smith, Steven J.; McJeon, Haewon] Joint Global Change Res Inst, Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, College Pk, MD USA; [Alsalam, Jameel; Creason, Jared; Fawcett, Allen A.; Ragnauth, Shaun] US EPA, Washington, DC 20460 USA; [Roney, Christopher] Elect Power Res Inst, Washington, DC USA",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Pacific Northwest National Laboratory; United States Environmental Protection Agency; Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI),"McJeon, H (corresponding author), Joint Global Change Res Inst, Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, College Pk, MD USA.",Haewon.McJeon@pnnl.gov,"Kyle, Page/AFP-3602-2022; Ou, Yang/GMX-3718-2022","Ou, Yang/0000-0002-1889-6218",U.S. Environmental Protection Agency [IAA DW089-92460001],U.S. Environmental Protection Agency(United States Environmental Protection Agency),"This research was supported by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (IAA DW089-92460001).

Mineralization stores CO2 by converting it into a thermodynamically stable solid. Beyond storing CO2, the products of CO2 mineralization can potentially substitute conventional products in several industries. Substituting conventional production increases both the economic and the environmental potential of carbon capture and utilization (CCU) by mineralization. The promising potential of CO2 mineralization is, however, challenged by the high energy demand required to overcome the slow reaction kinetics. To provide a sound assessment of the climate impacts of CCU by mineralization, we determine the carbon footprint of CCU by mineralization based on life cycle assessment. For this purpose, we analyze 7 pathways proposed in literature: 5 direct and 2 indirect mineralization pathways, considering serpentine, olivine, and steel slag as feedstock. The mineralization products are employed to partially substitute cement in blended cement. Our results show that all considered CCU technologies for mineralization could reduce climate impacts over the entire life cycle based on the current state-of-the-art and today's energy mix. Reductions range from 0.44 to 1.17 ton CO2e per ton CO2 stored. To estimate an upper bound on the potential of CCU by mineralization, we consider an ideal-mineralization scenario that neglects all process inefficiencies and utilizes the entire product. For this ideal mineralization, mineralization of 1 ton CO2 could even avoid up to 3.2 times more greenhouse gas emissions than only storing CO2. For all mineralization pathways, the carbon footprint is mainly reduced due to the permanent storage of CO2 and the credit for substituting conventional products. Thus, developing suitable products is critical to realize the potential benefits in practice. Then, carbon capture and utilization by mineralization could provide a promising route for climate change mitigation.","[Ostovari, Hesam; Sternberg, Andre; Bardow, Andre] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Inst Tech Thermodynam, Aachen, Germany; [Bardow, Andre] Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Energy & Climate Res, Energy Syst Engn IEK 10, Julich, Germany; [Sternberg, Andre] Fraunhofer Inst Solar Syst, Freiburg, Germany",RWTH Aachen University; Helmholtz Association; Research Center Julich,"Bardow, A (corresponding author), Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Inst Tech Thermodynam, Aachen, Germany.;Bardow, A (corresponding author), Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Energy & Climate Res, Energy Syst Engn IEK 10, Julich, Germany.",andre.bardow@ltt.rwth-aachen.de,"Bardow, Andre/C-5446-2009","Bardow, Andre/0000-0002-3831-0691; Ostovari, Hesam/0000-0002-0225-6427; Sternberg, Andre/0000-0003-2873-0577",project CO2MIN [033RC014]; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF),project CO2MIN; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"This work has been carried out within the project CO2MIN (033RC014).

This is particularly problematic when attempting to detect trends in tropical cyclone metrics that may be attributable to climate change. Here the authors apply a state-of-the-art automated algorithm to a globally homogenized satellite data record to create a more temporally consistent record of tropical cyclone intensity within the period 1982-2009, and utilize this record to investigate the robustness of trends found in the best-track data. In particular, the lifetime maximum intensity (LMI) achieved by each reported storm is calculated and the frequency distribution of LMI is tested for changes over this period. To address the unique issues in regions around the Indian Ocean, which result from a discontinuity introduced into the satellite data in 1998, a direct homogenization procedure is applied in which post-1998 data are degraded to pre-1998 standards. This additional homogenization step is found to measurably reduce LMI trends, but the global trends in the LMI of the strongest storms remain positive, with amplitudes of around +1 m s(-1) decade(-1) and p value = 0.1. Regional trends, in ms(-1) decade(-1), vary from -2 (p = 0.03) in the western North Pacific, +1.7 (p 5 0.06) in the south Indian Ocean, +2.5 (p = 0.09) in the South Pacific, to +8 (p < 0.001) in the North Atlantic.","[Kossin, James P.; Knapp, Kenneth R.] NOAA Natl Climat Data Ctr, Asheville, NC USA; [Kossin, James P.; Olander, Timothy L.] Univ Wisconsin, Cooperat Inst Meteorol Satellite Studies, Madison, WI USA",National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Kossin, JP (corresponding author), NOAA CIMSS, 1225 W Dayton St, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",james.kossin@noaa.gov,"Kossin, James/C-2022-2016; Knapp, Kenneth R/E-9817-2011","Kossin, James/0000-0003-0461-9794; Knapp, Kenneth R/0000-0001-5635-8755","Naval Research Lab in Monterey, California; Office of Naval Research; NOAA/NESDIS","Naval Research Lab in Monterey, California; Office of Naval Research(Office of Naval Research); NOAA/NESDIS(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA)","The continued development of the Advanced Dvorak Technique has been supported by the Naval Research Lab in Monterey, California, and the Office of Naval Research, with additional support from NOAA/NESDIS.

The first section focuses on the prominent policy instrument of carbon pricing. It starts by analysing the somewhat confusing use made of carbon pricing modelling in policy reports emanating from the French and British governments, then reviews some modelling results on carbon pricing in a 'second best' world. The second section lists the impressive collection of more focused policy instruments that are advocated in both governmental and non-governmental literature. It insists on the contrast between the high degree of precision of some of these policy proposals and the limited modelling of their impacts, either from an environmental or an economic point of view. The third section concludes on recommendations to the policy modelling community inspired by this survey. Purposely avoiding the current controversies surrounding cost-benefit analysis, it advocates further applied research on the cost efficiency of carbon pricing trajectories (when flexibility); on the terra incognita beyond first best uniform pricing (where flexibility); on the elicitation of policy overlaps; and on the modelling of extended policy portfolios in comprehensive, consistent modelling frameworks.","CIRED, CNRS, F-94736 Nogent Sur Marne, France",AgroParisTech; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Ecole des Ponts ParisTech; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay,"Ghersi, F (corresponding author), CIRED, CNRS, 45 Bis,Ave Belle Gabrielle, F-94736 Nogent Sur Marne, France.",ghersi@centre-cired.fr,,"Ghersi, Frederic/0000-0002-8994-7086","Fondazione Eni Enrico Mattei, Isola di San Giorgio Maggiore, Venice, Italy","Fondazione Eni Enrico Mattei, Isola di San Giorgio Maggiore, Venice, Italy","An earlier version of this paper was written during a visiting year at and with the gratefully acknowledged support of the Fondazione Eni Enrico Mattei, Isola di San Giorgio Maggiore, 30124 Venice, Italy.

The TRB is dynamic and has been shown to shift south as a coherent system during periods of Northern Hemisphere cooling. However, recent studies of Indo-Pacific hydroclimate suggest that during the Little Ice Age (LIA; AD 1400-1850), the TRB in this region contracted rather than being displaced uniformly southward. This behaviour is not well understood, particularly during climatic fluctuations less pronounced than those of the LIA, the largest centennial-scale cool period of the last millennium. Here we show that the Indo-Pacific TRB expanded and contracted numerous times over multi-decadal to centennial scales during the last 3,000 yr. By integrating precisely-dated stalagmite records of tropical hydroclimate from southern China with a newly enhanced stalagmite time series from northern Australia, our study reveals a previously unidentified coherence between the austral and boreal summer monsoon.

We show that, contrary to previous expectations, C(s) decays for large s as a power law, C(s) similar to s(-gamma) For continental stations, the exponent gamma is always close to 0.7, while for stations on islands gamma congruent to 0.4. In contrast to the temperature fluctuations, the fluctuations of the rainfall usually cannot be characterized by long-term power-law correlations but rather by pronounced short-term correlations. The universal persistence law for the temperature fluctuations on continental stations represents an ideal (and uncomfortable) test-bed for the state-of-the-art global climate models and allows us to evaluate their performance.

As a result, work has been undertaken to develop the Singapore IMPact ASSessment (SIMPASS) methodology by adapting and modifying existing LCIA methodologies to suit the Singaporean context. It is envisioned that the use of SIMPASS will improve the accuracy of LCA studies conducted for industries operating in Singapore. The development is initiated by a compendious review of the available LCIA methodologies, in order to familiarise state-of-the-art developments and best available practice for LCIA in the world. Subsequently, five key design considerations are discussed. Firstly, six impact categories (climate change, acidification, eutrophication, fossil fuel depletion, water use and land use) are identified and prioritised for detailed analysis in this project, in view of their relevance and criticality to Singapore. Subsequently, user issues and the type of LCIA approach are considered. Following which, four areas of protection (namely Human Health, Natural Environment, Natural Resources and Man-made Environment) are selected for consideration in the SIMPASS methodology. With the development approach in mind, extensive research is conducted in the six selected impact categories to construct the characterisation framework for SIMPASS. The characterisation framework is strongly based on current best practices in LCIA characterisation, while the characterisation models are chosen based on their extent of comprehensiveness, scientific sophistication, as well as specificity to Singapore. SIMPASS proposes an attractive and feasible LCIA methodology that is highly specific to Singapore. Feasible recommendations are drawn to further develop and operationalise the characterisation framework.","[Khoo, Hsien Hui] Inst Chem & Engn Sci, Singapore 627833, Singapore; [Chan, Yin Tat; Tan, Reginald B.

This study was a descriptive research using survey on 120 farmers' children (called as Taruna Tani) in Sragen Regency, Indonesia with direct interview through questionnaires as primary data. The results showed that most youths had fairly good perceptions in terms of income, social status, and work convenience in the agricultural sector, but not in terms of career development and warranty of future life. The youth concerned with the lack of careers and warranty of future life if they work in the agricultural sector. However, today's young generations are very potential to be prepared for being the human resources to develop agricultural development in the future. Therefore, some efforts are needed to encourage the youths to work in the agricultural sector through socializing and educating them about agriculture and introducing technology and cultivation innovations to anticipate the impacts of climate change on the agricultural sector.","[Widiyanti, E.] Univ Sebelas Maret, Extens & Agr Commun, Fac Agr, Jl Ir Sutami 36 A Kentingan, Surakarta 57126, Indonesia; [Setyowati, N.] Univ Sebelas Maret, Agribusiness Study Program, Fac Agr, Surakarta, Indonesia; [Ardianto, D.

The objective of this study is to evaluate the ability of HydroSVS, the component of SVS responsible for the vertical redistribution of water, to simulate soil moisture under snow-free conditions when using flux-tower observations of evapotranspiration as forcing data. We assessed (1) model fidelity by comparing soil moisture modelled with HydroSVS to point-scale measurements of volumetric soil water content and (2) model complexity by comparing the performance of HydroSVS to that of HydroGeoSphere, a state-of-the-art integrated surface and subsurface hydrologic model. To do this, we performed one-dimensional soil column simulations at four sites of the AmeriFlux network. Results indicate that under Mediterranean and temperate climates, HydroSVS satisfactorily simulated soil moisture (Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency between 0.26 and 0.70; R-2 >= 0.80), with a performance comparable to HydroGeoSphere (Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency >= 0.60; R-2 >= 0.80). However, HydroSVS performed weakly under a semiarid climate while HydroGeoSphere performed relatively well. By decoupling the magnitude and sourcing of evapotranspiration, this study proposes a powerful diagnostic tool to evaluate the representation of subsurface hydrological processes in land surface models. Overall, this study highlights the potential of SVS for hydrological applications. Crown Copyright (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

This study presents a conceptual coal fired power plant design that utilizes these liquid phase sorbents for high temperature CO2 capture coupled with the simultaneous removal of other acid gases. To effectively recover heat from the process both the absorber and desorber are located within the boiler and steam is used for near-isothermal regeneration of the sorbent. The potential thermodynamic opportunity was evaluated through process simulation, with results indicating molten sorbents could outperform the state-of-the-art amine-based systems for CO2 capture. An energy penalty as low as 6% points was projected for systems using molten sorbents, half that for the amine system. An initial economic evaluation confirmed the benefits of molten sorbents; for the optimized design, levelized cost of electricity increased 39% (25%-49%) relative to that for the power plant without carbon capture. The expected cost of CO2 avoided was $34/tonne ($18/tonne to $56/tonne) which is 38% (27%-50%) lower than that for the amine process and competitive with the social cost of CO2. Challenges were identified with future work proposed and justified by the opportunity to mitigate climate change at a lower cost than current systems allow.","[Halliday, Cameron; Hatton, T.

The outcome of these experiments suggests that the existence of high mountains at Greenland causes a reinforcement of the stationary wave field in the Atlantic sector, colder temperatures to the west of Greenland and warmer temperatures to the east and south, over the North Atlantic. The impact on the flow field cannot be understood in the framework of standing Rossby waves, but it indicates a resonance between remotely forced stationary waves and local (thermo-) dynamics. The pattern of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), in particular the northern centre, lies further to the east in the flat-Greenland experiment compared to the control run and the observations. Together with the fact that the climatological low-pressure system around Iceland hardly shifts, this suggests that the location of the NAO is not necessarily tied to the time mean pressure distributions. Considering the model resolution as a parameter, experiments with a high resolution (T106) suggest that the near-field changes are represented sufficiently by a T42 resolution, a standard resolution used in state-of-the-art coupled climate models. In contrast, far-field changes depend critically on model resolution. Hemispheric circulation and temperature changes differ substantially from low to high resolution, and generalized statements about the impact of Greenland's orography cannot be made.","Univ Hamburg, Inst Meteorol, D-2000 Hamburg, Germany; Max Planck Inst Meteorol, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany",University of Hamburg; Max Planck Society,"Junge, MM (corresponding author), Univ Hamburg, Inst Meteorol, Martinistr 52, D-2000 Hamburg, Germany.",junge@dkrz.de,,,,,,,28,22,22,0,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0930-7575,1432-0894,,CLIM DYNAM,Clim.

The objective of this paper is to provide a comprehensive description of this 4C version (v2.2) for scientific users of the model and to present an evaluation of 4C at four different forest sites across Europe. The evaluation focuses on forest growth as well as carbon (net ecosystem exchange, gross primary production), water (actual evapotranspiration, soil water content), and heat fluxes (soil temperature) using data from the PROFOUND database. We applied different evaluation metrics and compared the daily, monthly, and annual variability of observed and simulated values. The ability to reproduce forest growth (stem diameter and biomass) differs from site to site and is best for a pine stand in Germany (Peitz, model efficiency ME = 0.98). 4C is able to reproduce soil temperature at different depths in Soro and Hyytiala with good accuracy (for all soil depths ME > 0.8). The dynamics in simulating carbon and water fluxes are well captured on daily and monthly timescales (0.51 < ME < 0.983) but less so on an annual timescale (ME < 0). This model-data mismatch is possibly due to the accumulation of errors because of processes that are missing or represented in a very general way in 4C but not with enough specific detail to cover strong, site-specific dependencies such as ground vegetation growth. These processes need to be further elaborated to improve the projections of climate change on forests. We conclude that, despite shortcomings, 4C is widely applicable, reliable, and therefore ready to be released to the scientific community to use and further develop the model.","[Lasch-Born, Petra; Suckow, Felicitas; Reyer, Christopher P.

Decadal variability and long-term trends in tropical TPTs as well as stratospheric water vapour are largely unknown. Here, we present for the first time evidence, from reanalysis and state-of-the-art climate model simulations, of a link between decadal variability in tropical TPTs and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). The negative phase of the PDO is associated with anomalously cold sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the tropical east and central Pacific, which enhance the zonal SST gradient across the equatorial Pacific. The latter drives a stronger Walker Circulation and a weaker Hadley Circulation, which leads to less convection and subsequently a warmer tropopause over the central equatorial Pacific. Over the North Pacific, positive sea level pressure anomalies occur, which damp vertical wave propagation into the stratosphere. This in turn slows the Brewer-Dobson circulation, and hence warms the tropical tropopause, enabling more water vapour to enter the stratosphere. The reverse chain of events holds for the positive phase of the PDO. Such ocean-troposphere-stratosphere interactions may provide an important feedback on the Earth's global surface temperature.","[Wang, Wuke; Matthes, Katja; Latif, Mojib] GEOMAR Helmholtz Zentrum Ozeanforsch Kiel, Kiel, Germany; [Matthes, Katja; Latif, Mojib] Univ Kiel, Kiel, Germany; [Omrani, Nour-Eddine] Univ Bergen, Geophys Inst, Bergen, Norway; [Omrani, Nour-Eddine] Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, Bergen, Norway",Helmholtz Association; GEOMAR Helmholtz Center for Ocean Research Kiel; University of Kiel; University of Bergen; Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research,"Wang, W (corresponding author), GEOMAR Helmholtz Zentrum Ozeanforsch Kiel, Kiel, Germany.",wwang@geomar.de,"Latif, Mojib/C-2428-2016; Matthes, Katja/F-7361-2014; Omrani, Noue-Eddine/GQQ-7245-2022","Latif, Mojib/0000-0003-1079-5604; Matthes, Katja/0000-0003-1801-3072; ","Helmholtz-Association; GEOMAR, the Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel","Helmholtz-Association(Helmholtz Association); GEOMAR, the Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel","This work was performed within the Helmholtz-University Young Investigators Group NATHAN, funded by the Helmholtz-Association and GEOMAR, the Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel.

Using the state-of-the-art modeling approach, we assess effects of ozone and aerosols on rice and wheat under two contrasting air pollution emission scenarios in China, rigorous emission controls versus current legislation. Currently, ozone and aerosol pollution together induces 11.3% yield losses for rice and 14.6% for wheat. Following the current legislation scenario, we simulate additional yield declines of 5.4% for rice and 0.4% for wheat. However, implementation of maximum feasible technological reductions in emissions relative to the current legislation scenario avoids rice and wheat yield losses by 14-15%, economically equivalent to 18.9 billion USD. Such remarkable benefits are primarily from ozone controls, whose mitigating effect is approximately double that of the aerosol reductions. This demonstrates that reprioritizing air pollution control targets from particulate aerosols alone to both aerosols and ozone can substantially alleviate crop losses in China.","[Zhang, Tianyi; Dong, Xin] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys IAP, State Key Lab Atmospher Boundary Layer Phys & Atm, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Yue, Xu; Feng, Zhaozhong] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Unger, Nadine] Univ Exeter, Exeter, Devon, England; [Zheng, Bangyou] CSIRO Agr & Food, St Lucia, Qld, Australia; [Li, Tao] DNDC Applicat, Res & Training, Durham, NH USA; [Lei, Yadong; Zhou, Hao] Chinese Acad Sci, Climate Change Res Ctr, IAP, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Liu, Yu] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Sci & Dev, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Liu, Yu] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Publ Policy & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Jiang] Chinese Acad Sci, Int Ctr Climate & Environm Sci, IAP, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Yang, Xiaoguang] China Agr Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; University of Exeter; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; China Agricultural University","Zhang, TY (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys IAP, State Key Lab Atmospher Boundary Layer Phys & Atm, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Yue, X (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Nanjing, Peoples R China.",zhangty@post.iap.ac.cn; yuexu@nuist.edu.cn,"Yue, Xu/ABD-9066-2021","Li, Tao/0000-0002-1360-1396","National Key Research and Development Project of China, China [2019YFA0607402, 2016YFC0207705]; Youth Innovation Promotion Association of Chinese Academy of Sciences, China [2018104]","National Key Research and Development Project of China, China; Youth Innovation Promotion Association of Chinese Academy of Sciences, China","We appreciate the valuable suggestions of two anonymous reviewers.

Here, we show examples of how these state-of-the-art methods can be used to establish and refine the archaeological cultural chronology for the Shangluo area in the Qinling Mountains of central China. In this study, the Donglongshan and Zijing sites were dated using the high-precision accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) C-14 method. Also, detailed magnetic-susceptibility measurements were conducted at both sites to gain preliminary information about past climate changes. The C-14 dates, after being treated with Bayesian statistics, provide a firm constraint on the archaeological chronological framework for this area. Within this framework, the Malan loess-Holocene soil transition can be placed at 10,400-10,090 BC, while the duration of the Yangshao and Longshan cultures was dated to similar to 4200-2900 and similar to 2900-2100 BC, respectively, revealing an undisrupted history of human occupation in this area until the early dynastic period. Magnetic susceptibility values began to increase in the early Holocene, indicating a progressive amelioration of regional climate. The widespread development of paleosol during the middle Holocene indicates that warm and wet climate conditions prevailed, providing a favorable environmental context within which the Yangshao culture thrived. Magnetic susceptibility values then decreased from similar to 2100 BC when the Xia Dynasty started, and loess accumulated again, pointing to cooling and drying climate conditions that may have led to a cultural transition from the Neolithic to the dynastic civilization.","[Zhu, Yizhi; Cheng, Peng; Yu, Shi-Yong; Yu, Huagui; Kang, Zhihai; Zhou, Weijian] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Earth Environm, State Key Lab Loess & Quaternary Geol, Xian 710075, Peoples R China; [Cheng, Peng; Kang, Zhihai; Zhou, Weijian] Xian AMS Ctr, Xian 710072, Peoples R China; [Yu, Huagui] Inst Shannxi Yanchang Petr Grp Co Ltd, Xian 710075, Peoples R China; [Yang, Yachang] Shaanxi Archaeol Inst, Xian 710054, Peoples R China; [Jull, A.

Records from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and (Advanced) Along Track Scanning Radiometer ((A) ATSR) are providing long-term time series information. Assessing the quality of remote sensing-based temperature measurements provides feedback to the climate modeling community and other users by identifying agreements and discrepancies when compared to temperature records from meteorological stations. This paper presents a comparison of state-of-the-art remote sensing-based land surface temperature data with air temperature measurements from meteorological stations on a pan-arctic scale (north of 60 latitude). Within this study, we compared land surface temperature products from (A) ATSR, MODIS and AVHRR with an in situ air temperature (Tair) database provided by the National Climate Data Center (NCDC). Despite analyzing the whole acquisition time period of each land surface temperature product, we focused on the inter-annual variability comparing land surface temperature (LST) and air temperature for the overlapping time period of the remote sensing data (2000-2005). In addition, land cover information was included in the evaluation approach by using GLC2000. MODIS has been identified as having the highest agreement in comparison to air temperature records. The time series of (A) ATSR is highly variable, whereas inconsistencies in land surface temperature data from AVHRR have been found.","[Urban, Marcel; Eberle, Jonas; Huettich, Christian; Schmullius, Christiane] Univ Jena, Dept Earth Observat, D-07743 Jena, Germany; [Herold, Martin] Wageningen Univ, Ctr Geoinformat, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands",Friedrich Schiller University of Jena; Wageningen University & Research,"Urban, M (corresponding author), Univ Jena, Dept Earth Observat, D-07743 Jena, Germany.",marcel.urban@uni-jena.de; jonas.eberle@uni-jena.de; christian.huettich@uni-jena.de; c.schmullius@uni-jena.de; martin.herold@wur.nl,"Herold, Martin/F-8553-2012","Herold, Martin/0000-0003-0246-6886; Urban, Marcel/0000-0002-0127-2804",,,,,59,46,51,4,68,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2072-4292,,,REMOTE SENS-BASEL,Remote Sens.,MAY,2013,5,,,,2348,2367,,10.3390/rs5052348,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs5052348,,,20,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,151CT,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000319438900017,View Full Record in Web of Science

Reduced temperature and sunlight could drive unprecedented reductions in agricultural production, endangering global food security. However, the effects of nuclear war on marine wild-capture fisheries, which significantly contribute to the global animal protein and micronutrient supply, remain unexplored. We simulate the climatic effects of six war scenarios on fish biomass and catch globally, using a state-of-the-art Earth system model and global process-based fisheries model. We also simulate how either rapidly increased fish demand (driven by food shortages) or decreased ability to fish (due to infrastructure disruptions), would affect global catches, and test the benefits of strong prewar fisheries management. We find a decade-long negative climatic impact that intensifies with soot emissions, with global biomass and catch falling by up to 18 +/- 3% and 29 +/- 7% after a US-Russia war under business-as-usual fishing-similar in magnitude to the end-of-century declines under unmitigated global warming. When war occurs in an overfished state, increasing demand increases short-term (1 to 2 y) catch by at most similar to 30% followed by precipitous declines of up to similar to 70%, thus offsetting only a minor fraction of agricultural losses. However, effective prewar management that rebuilds fish biomass could ensure a short-term catch buffer large enough to replace similar to 43 +/- 35% of today's global animal protein production. This buffering function in the event of a global food emergency adds to the many previously known economic and ecological benefits of effective and precautionary fisheries management.","[Scherrer, Kim J.

Wagner casts his artwork of the future as taking account of...the natural characteristics of [Germanic] native skies; it would channel the Teutonic climate lost to civilization and, through exposure to it in the theater, engender a new social order.

We use state-of-the-art models to simulate land surface processes and river dynamics and to separate TWS into its main components. Based on a proposed impact index, we show that surface water storage (SWS) contributes 8% of TWS variability globally, but that contribution differs widely among climate zones. Changes in SWS are a principal component of TWS variability in the tropics, where major rivers flow over arid regions and at high latitudes. SWS accounts for similar to 22-27% of TWS variability in both the Amazon and Nile Basins. Changes in SWS are negligible in the Western U.S., Northern Africa, Middle East, and central Asia. Based on comparisons with Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment-based TWS, we conclude that accounting for SWS improves simulated TWS in most of South America, Africa, and Southern Asia, confirming that SWS is a key component of TWS variability.","[Getirana, Augusto; Kumar, Sujay; Rodell, Matthew] NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Hydrol Sci Lab, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; [Getirana, Augusto] Univ Maryland, Earth Syst Sci Interdisciplinary Ctr, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Girotto, Manuela] NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Global Modeling & Assimilat Off, Greenbelt, MD USA; [Girotto, Manuela] Univ Space Res Assoc, GESTAR, Columbia, MD USA",National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; Universities Space Research Association (USRA),"Getirana, A (corresponding author), NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Hydrol Sci Lab, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA.;Getirana, A (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Earth Syst Sci Interdisciplinary Ctr, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",augusto.getirana@nasa.gov,"Kumar, Sujay V/B-8142-2015; Getirana, Augusto/G-4630-2011; Girotto, Manuela/AAK-2193-2021; Rodell, Matthew/E-4946-2012","Kumar, Sujay V/0000-0001-8797-9482; Girotto, Manuela/0000-0003-2795-2063; Rodell, Matthew/0000-0003-0106-7437; Getirana, Augusto/0000-0001-9635-7220",NASA's Applied Sciences-Water Resources and SERVIR Program; GRACE and GRACE Follow On Science Team; NASA MEaSUREs Program,NASA's Applied Sciences-Water Resources and SERVIR Program; GRACE and GRACE Follow On Science Team; NASA MEaSUREs Program,This study was funded by NASA's Applied Sciences-Water Resources and SERVIR Programs and the GRACE and GRACE Follow On Science Team.

The objective of the study is to provide an assessment of the capability of various global models, participating in CMIP5 project, in capturing the realistic spatial and temporal distribution of aerosol species over the Indian subcontinent. Results from our analysis show that majority of the CMIP5 models (excepting HADGEM2-ES, HADGEM2-CC) seriously underestimates the spatio-temporal variability of aerosol species over the Indian subcontinent, in particular over Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP). Since IGP region is dominated by anthropogenic activities, high population density, and wind driven transport of dust and other aerosol species. MODIS observations reveal high AOD values over this region. Though the representation of black carbon (BC) loading in many models is fairly good, the dust loading is observed to be significantly low in majority of the models. The presence of pronounced dust activity over northern India and dust being one of the major constituent of aerosol species, the biases in dust loading has a great impact on the AOD of that region. We found that considerable biases in simulating the 850 hPa wind field (which plays important role in transport of dust from adjacent deserts) would be the possible reason for poor representation of dust AOD and in turn total AOD over Indian region in CMIP5 models. In addition, aerosol radiative forcing (ARF) underestimated/overestimated in most of the models. However, spatial distribution of ARF in multi-model ensemble mean is comparable reasonably well with observations with bias in magnitudes. This analysis emphasizes the fundamental need to improve the representation of aerosol species in current state of the art climate models. As reported in Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) fourth assessment report (AR4), the level of scientific understanding (LOSU) of climatic impact of aerosols is medium-low. For better understanding of short and long term implications of changing concentrations of aerosol species on climate, it is imperative to have a realistic representation of aerosol distribution over regions with high aerosol loading.

However, their restorative potential and role in regulating phytoplankton remains uncertain in tropical lakes. We investigated the effects of emergent (Ludwigia adscendens and Persicaria barbata) and submerged (Vallisneria spiralis) macrophytes on the phytoplankton community of a turbid tropical reservoir. Through two in situ mesocosm experiments (similar to 1000 l capacity) lasting 4 weeks, we (1) determined the effects of macrophyte density on phytoplankton biomass and composition, and (2) compared these effects between emergent and submerged macrophytes. In Experiment 1, macrophyte treatments reduced phytoplankton biomass and increased water clarity in a density-dependent manner. Only the 'high density' treatment (300 g/m(2) emergent and 650 g/m(2) submerged macrophytes) induced a taxonomic and functional shift from an initial community dominated by turbid water-adapted filamentous cyanobacteria to one dominated by clear water-adapted green algae and cryptophytes. In Experiment 2, emergent and submerged macrophytes reduced phytoplankton biomass and distinctly altered taxonomic and functional composition, with submerged macrophytes inhibiting Microcystis and stimulating cryptophyte taxa. Our results indicate that macrophytes can induce substantial phytoplankton community shifts in turbid tropical lakes, demonstrating the potential to assist in the reversal from turbid to clear water states during restoration efforts.","[Sim, Darren Z.

The stability of the palsas are seriously threatened by climate warming which will change the permafrost dynamic and induce a degradation of the mires. We used stable carbon isotope depth profiles in two palsa mires of Northern Sweden to track environmental change during the formation of the mires. Soils dominated by aerobic degradation can be expected to have a clear increase of carbon isotopes (delta C-13) with depth, due to preferential release of C-12 during aerobic mineralization. In soils with suppressed degradation due to anoxic conditions, stable carbon isotope depth profiles are either more or less uniform indicating no or very low degradation or depth profiles turn to lighter values due to an enrichment of recalcitrant organic substances during anaerobic mineralisation which are depleted in C-13. The isotope depth profile of the peat in the water saturated depressions (hollows) at the yet undisturbed mire Storflaket indicated very low to no degradation but increased rates of anaerobic degradation at the Stordalen site. The latter might be induced by degradation of the permafrost cores in the uplifted areas (hummocks) and subsequent breaking and submerging of the hummock peat into the hollows due to climate warming. Carbon isotope depth profiles of hummocks indicated a turn from aerobic mineralisation to anaerobic degradation at a peat depth between 4 and 25 cm. The age of these turning points was C-14 dated between 150 and 670 yr and could thus not be caused by anthropogenically induced climate change. We found the uplifting of the hummocks due to permafrost heave the most likely explanation for our findings. We thus concluded that differences in carbon isotope profiles of the hollows might point to the disturbance of the mires due to climate warming or due to differences in hydrology. The characteristic profiles of the hummocks are indicators for micro-geomorphic change during permafrost up heaving.","[Alewell, C.; Rollog, M.] Univ Basel, Inst Environm Geosci, CH-4003 Basel, Switzerland; [Giesler, R.; Klaminder, J.] Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, Climate Impacts Res Ctr, Abisko, Sweden; [Leifeld, J.] Agroscope Reckenholz Tanikon Res Stn ART, Zurich, Switzerland",University of Basel; Umea University; Swiss Federal Research Station Agroscope; Swiss Federal Research Station for Agroecology & Agriculture,"Alewell, C (corresponding author), Univ Basel, Inst Environm Geosci, CH-4003 Basel, Switzerland.",christine.alewell@unibas.ch,"Leifeld, Jens/A-3298-2014; Leifeld, Jens/GYR-0349-2022; Alewell, Christine/K-5104-2016","Leifeld, Jens/0000-0002-7245-9852; Leifeld, Jens/0000-0002-7245-9852; Klaminder, Jonatan/0000-0001-8814-0013; Alewell, Christine/0000-0001-9295-9806",,,,,43,56,58,6,84,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1726-4170,1726-4189,,BIOGEOSCIENCES,Biogeosciences,,2011,7,,,,1769,1778,,10.5194/bg-8-1769-2011,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/bg-8-1769-2011,,,10,"Ecology; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology,810UT,,"Green Submitted, gold, Green Accepted",,,12/21/22,WOS:000294153700002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Yet, collaborative adaptation responses remain not well understood, particularly in terms of the relational and political dimensions of this practice. This paper seeks to push beyond collaboration as an assumed good and contributes to deeper theorization and conceptualization of the arts of collaborating within the context of climate adap-tation and sustainable development. The paper draws upon participatory and ethnographic engagements in the struggle for collaborative adaptation to rapid glacier melt in the Peruvian highlands between 2015 and 2018. Insights are derived from various qualitative methods that allowed for following through a network of local to global adaptation actors (State institutions, development NGOs, and campesinos) as they worked towards a common goal of becoming resilient to ensuing radical landscape changes. By paying attention to divergent adaptation imaginaries, as well as historically produced uneven geographies of power upon which current adaptation strategies are materializing, this study illuminates frictions that emerge from collaborative engagements and the systemic oppression of local ways of knowing and being. This study finds that, through a privileged adaptation discourse, State and transnational actors enact a techno-scientific and developmentalist-adaptation reality that is indifferent to the needs and preferences of highland inhabitants. I argue that, adaptation in this way performs a coloniality of power that perpetuates the erasure of social alterity from world-making projects. As a counter-proposal, I call for doing adaptation otherwise, that is, decolonially. This practice is informed by the relational ontology of highland campesinos, and strives to create an alternative approach to formal adaptation that allows for rights of self-determination and the empowerment of designs from below.

The sea-ice component involves state-of-the-art dynamics; the ocean component consists of a 3.5 degrees x 3.5 degrees x 11 layer primitive-equation model. Depending on the physical description of sea ice, significant changes are detected in the convective activity, in the hydrographic properties and in the thermohaline circulation of the ocean model. Most of these changes originate in the Southern Ocean, emphasizing the crucial role of sea ice in this marginally stably stratified region of the world's oceans. Specifically if the effect of brine release is neglected, the deep layers of the Southern Ocean warm up considerably; this is associated with a weakening of the Southern Hemisphere overturning cell. The removal of the commonly used salinity enhancement leads to a similar effect. The deep-ocean salinity is almost unaffected in both experiments. Introducing explicit new-ice thickness growth in partially ice-covered gridcells leads to a substantial increase in convective activity, especially in the Southern Ocean, with a concomitant significant cooling and salinification of the deep ocean. Possible mechanisms for the resulting interactions between sea-ice processes and deep-ocean characteristics are suggested.","Texas A&M Univ, Dept Oceanog, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Stossel, A (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Dept Oceanog, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",,,,,,,,0,4,4,0,0,INT GLACIOLOGICAL SOC,CAMBRIDGE,"LENSFIELD RD, CAMBRIDGE CB2 1ER, ENGLAND",0260-3055,,0-946417-20-2,ANN GLACIOL,,,1997,,,,,111,115,,10.3189/S0260305500013884,http://dx.doi.org/10.3189/S0260305500013884,,,3,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences; Oceanography,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences; Oceanography,BK58K,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000072623800020,View Full Record in Web of Science

Given this level of uncertainty, it is important to develop useful strategies to identify realistic low-frequency signals optimally from these analyses. In this paper, we present an ensemble method to estimate the variability of upper-ocean heat content (HC) in the tropical Atlantic based on multiple-ocean reanalysis products. Six state-of-the-art global ocean reanalaysis products, all of which are widely used in the climate research community, are examined in terms of their HC variability from 1979 to 2007. The conventional empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis of the HC anomalies from each individual analysis indicates that their leading modes show significant qualitative differences among analyses, especially for the first modes, although some common characteristics are discernable. Then, the simple arithmetic average (or ensemble mean) is applied to produce an ensemble dataset, i.e., the EM analysis. The leading EOF modes of the EM analysis show quantitatively consistent spatial-temporal patterns with those derived from an alternative EOF technique that maximizes signal-to-noise ratio of the six analyses, which suggests that the ensemble mean generates HC fields with the noise reduced to an acceptable level. The quality of the EM analysis is further validated against AVISO altimetry sea level anomaly (SLA) data and PIRATA mooring station data. A regression analysis with the AVISO SLA data proved that the leading modes in the EM analysis are realistic. It also demonstrated that some reanalysis products might contain higher level of intrinsic noise than others. A quantitative correlation analysis indicates that the HC fields are more realistic in the EM analysis than in individual products, especially over the equatorial regions, with signals contributed from all ensemble members. A direct comparison with the HC anomalies derived from in situ temperature measurements showed that the EM analysis generally gets realistic HC variability at the five chosen PIRATA mooring stations. Overall, these results demonstrate that the EM analysis is a promising alternative for studying physical processes and possibly for initializing climate predictions.","[Zhu, Jieshun; Huang, Bohua] Inst Global Environm & Soc, Ctr Ocean Land Atmosphere Studies, Calverton, MD USA; [Huang, Bohua] George Mason Univ, Dept Atmospher Ocean & Earth Sci, Coll Sci, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Balmaseda, Magdalena A.] European Ctr Medium Range Weather Forecasts, Reading RG2 9AX, Berks, England",George Mason University; European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF),"Zhu, JS (corresponding author), Inst Global Environm & Soc, Ctr Ocean Land Atmosphere Studies, Calverton, MD USA.",jieshun@cola.iges.org,"; Zhu, Jieshun/G-5524-2012","Huang, Bohua/0000-0003-4869-3849; Alonso Balmaseda, Magdalena/0000-0002-9611-8788; Zhu, Jieshun/0000-0002-1508-9808",NOAA CVP Program [NA07OAR4310310],NOAA CVP Program(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA),"Funding for this study is provided by the NOAA CVP Program (NA07OAR4310310).

A multi-scale approach vis-a-vis the super-parameterization appears to overcome the uncertainty of convective parameterization and thereby improve models ability to simulate rainfall. In this study, performance of super-parameterized community climate system model's atmospheric only (SPCAM) forced with observed SST and coupled (SPCCSM) versions have been evaluated to capture Indian summer monsoon rainfall characteristics. Analyses show that, simulation of rainfall and its extremes are better represented in the atmospheric model (SPCAM) over the Indian landmass. This is largely because of better representation of convection in the uncoupled version. It is also observed that 2-10 day synoptic mode of the summer monsoon has a large variance over Indian region which may be broadly responsible for extreme events, and SPCAM captures this synoptic variability reasonably well. Our study also indicates that models may have poor moisture holding capacity. This problem is more prominent in SPCCSM.","[Goswami, Tanmoy; Krishna, R.

The narrative of the film is discussed to uncover the technological mindset that underpins the plot, which amounts to the belief that technology can provide the means to master even extreme, anthropogenic natural processes and events, in this way maintaining a global biosphere within which humans can survive. To put the underpinning techno-philosophy of Geostorm in perspective, the work of Gil Germain (2017) on technology is scrutinised and employed to analyse and interpret Geostorm. What emerges from this interpretation is that the film in question instantiates what Germain terms a 'misreading of reality by the technological mind', which means that such a 'misreading' does not take into account that modern science and, related to it, modern technology, are nothing more than specific interpretations of 'reality' (among others) - or of what Jacques Lacan calls the 'real' instead of being, as the current technophiliac culture would have it, a 'true' reflection of the essence of the 'real', that is, the only acceptable interpretation of it. The relevant aspects of Germain's work - such as the notion of 'blowback' - are clarified to be able to do justice to the claim, that technology, although it is understood as a panacea in the contemporary world, is, in the long run, a liability that poses the danger of undermining human life as well as natural ecologies. Films such as Geostorm, however, hide this from the public because of their persuasive simulation of technological control of extreme climate events by means of computer-generated images.","[Olivier, Bert] Univ Free State, Bloemfontein, South Africa",University of the Free State,"Olivier, B (corresponding author), Univ Free State, Bloemfontein, South Africa.",OlivierG1@ufs.ac.za,,,,,,,29,0,0,0,0,ART HISTORICAL WORK GROUP SOUTH AFRICA-AHWG,PRETORIA,"ART HISTORICAL WORK GROUP SOUTH AFRICA-AHWG, PRETORIA, 00000, SOUTH AFRICA",0258-3542,,,SOUTH AFR J ART HIST,South Afr.

After extensive literature reviews on the SDG-related research initiatives and activities, we find that the majority of contributions to SDGs recognized by the IEEE and ACM research communities have mainly focused on the technical aspects while there are lack of the holistic social good perspectives.

However, quantitative estimates of the effects of clouds on the GrIS melt area and ice-sheet-wide surface mass balance are still lacking. Here we assess the effects of clouds with a state-of-the-art regional climate model, conducting a numerical sensitivity test in which adiabatic atmospheric conditions as well as zero cloud water/ice amounts are assumed (i.e., clear-sky conditions), although the precipitation rate is the same as in the control all-sky simulation. By including or excluding clouds, we quantify time-integrated feedbacks for the first time. We find that clouds were responsible for a 3.1%, 0.3%, and 0.7% increase in surface melt extent (of the total GrIS area) in 2012, 2013, and 2014, respectively. During the same periods, clouds reduced solar heating and thus daily runoff by 1.6, 0.8, and 1.0 Gt day(-1), respectively: clouds did not enhance surface mass loss. In the ablation areas, the presence of clouds results in a reduction of downward latent heat flux at the snow/ice surface so that much less energy is available for surface melt, which highlights the importance of indirect time-integrated feedbacks of cloud radiative effects.","[Niwano, Masashi; Hashimoto, Akihiro; Aoki, Teruo] Japan Meteorol Agcy, Meteorol Res Inst, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050052, Japan; [Aoki, Teruo] Natl Inst Polar Res, Tachikawa, Tokyo 1908518, Japan",Japan Meteorological Agency; Meteorological Research Institute - Japan; Research Organization of Information & Systems (ROIS); National Institute of Polar Research (NIPR) - Japan,"Niwano, M (corresponding author), Japan Meteorol Agcy, Meteorol Res Inst, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050052, Japan.",mniwano@mri-jma.go.jp,"Niwano, Masashi/N-6723-2016","Niwano, Masashi/0000-0003-3121-3802","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [JP16H01772, JP15H01733, JP17K12817, JP17KK0017, JP18H03363, JP18H05054]; Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency through the Global Change Observation Mission-Climate (GCOM-C)/Second-generation GLobal Imager (SGLI) Mission; Ministry of the Environment of Japan through the Experimental Research Fund for Global Environmental Research Coordination System; Institute of Low Temperature Science, Hokkaido University [18S007, 18G035]","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency through the Global Change Observation Mission-Climate (GCOM-C)/Second-generation GLobal Imager (SGLI) Mission; Ministry of the Environment of Japan through the Experimental Research Fund for Global Environmental Research Coordination System; Institute of Low Temperature Science, Hokkaido University","We gratefully appreciate constructive comments and suggestions by two anonymous reviewers.

Such effects strongly depend on the optical properties of the particles that are in turn affected by the particle shape. For simplicity, dust particles are usually assumed to be spherical. But this assumption can lead to large errors in modeling and remote sensing applications. This study investigates the impact of dust particle shape on its direct radiative effect in a next-generation atmospheric modeling system ICON-ART (ICOsahedral Nonhydrostatic weather and climate model with Aerosols and Reactive Trace gases) to verify if accounting for nonsphericity enhances the model-observation agreement. Two sets of numerical experiments are conducted by changing the optical shape of the particles: one assuming spherical particles and the other one assuming a mixture of 35 randomly oriented triaxial ellipsoids. The simulations are compared to MISR (Multiangle Imaging Spectroradiometer), AERONET (Aerosol Robotic Network), and CALIPSO (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation) observations (with focus on North Africa). The results show that consideration of particle nonsphericity increases the dust AOD (Aerosol Optical Depth) at 550nm by up to 28% and leads to slight enhancement of the agreement between modeled and measured AOD. However, the model performance varies significantly when focusing on specific regions in North Africa. These differences stem from the uncertainties associated with particle size distribution and emission mechanisms in the model configuration. Regarding the attenuated backscatter, the simulated profile assuming nonsphericity differs by a factor of 2 to 5 from the experiment assuming spherical dust and is in a better agreement with the CALIPSO observations.","[Hoshyaripour, G.

To achieve this goal, the scalability of climate models and efficiency of individual model components are both important. Radiative transfer is among the most computationally expensive components in a typical climate model. Here we attempt to model this component using a neural network. We aim to study the feasibility of replacing an explicit, physics-based computation of longwave radiative transfer by a neural network emulator and assessing the resultant performance gains. We compare multiple neural-network architectures, including a convolutional neural network, and our results suggest that the performance loss from the use of conventional convolutional networks is not offset by gains in accuracy. We train the networks with and without noise added to the input profiles and find that adding noise improves the ability of the networks to generalise beyond the training set. Prediction of radiative heating rates using our neural network models achieve up to 370x speedup on a GTX 1080 GPU setup and 11x speedup on a Xeon CPU setup compared to the a state-of-the-art radiative transfer library running on the same Xeon CPU. Furthermore, our neural network models yield less than 0.1 Kd(-1) mean squared error across all pressure levels. Upon introducing this component into a single-column model, we find that the time evolution of the temperature and humidity profiles is physically reasonable, though the model is conservative in its prediction of heating rates in regions where the optical depth changes quickly. Differences exist in the equilibrium climate simulated when using the neural network, which are attributed to small systematic errors that accumulate over time. Thus, we find that the accuracy of the neural network in the offline mode does not reflect its performance when coupled with other components.","[Liu, Ying; Caballero, Rodrigo; Monteiro, Joy Merwin] Stockholm Univ, Dept Meteorol, Stockholm, Sweden",Stockholm University,"Liu, Y (corresponding author), Stockholm Univ, Dept Meteorol, Stockholm, Sweden.",ying.liu.sweden@gmail.com,,"Monteiro, Joy/0000-0002-3932-3603; Caballero, Rodrigo/0000-0002-5507-9209",Swedish e-Science Research Centre (SeRC),Swedish e-Science Research Centre (SeRC),This research has been supported by the Swedish e-Science Research Centre (SeRC).,,46,7,7,0,8,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1991-959X,1991-9603,,GEOSCI MODEL DEV,Geosci.

We can produce the biochar at all likely scales, ranging from the industrial to the domestic level and even at individual farms, thus, the biochar industry is leading as a most appropriate at different socioeconomic settings. The possibility of sustainable biochar production practices and multi-functionality features make it a promising candidate to fulfill an increasing demand in the fields of soil amendment, agricultural sustainability, environmental protection, cutting-edge materials, and to achieve circular bio-economy and mitigation of climate change. An available fraction of waste biomass (agroforestry waste, biomass crops, agricultural residues, mill residues, and animal manure, and many more) can be used efficiently in pyrolysis and converted into desired biochar materials, besides this alternative energy products, such as syngas, bio-oil, electricity generation, and process heat. This report emphasizes the fate of biomass composition, pyrolysis mechanisms, and applications of modern analytical and characterization techniques that are being adopted, applied, and standardized to improve understandings of molecular, structural, and surface properties characteristics of biochar. To achieve precisely designed biochar, there is a need to understand the latest advances in biochar materialization mechanisms and structure-application relationships to speed up their agronomic applications and to achieve a zero-waste dream. This report also summarizes a wide range of literature published on feedstocks, pyrolysis, and biochar and suggests several practical recommendations appropriate to implement and bring together specific details on the thermochemical conversion of biomass, desired biochar properties, organic and inorganic phases, and the significance to the agronomic applications.

Rainfall is a prime example, as it exhibits unique characteristics of high volatility and chaotic patterns that do not exist in other time series data. This work's main impact is to show the benefit machine learning algorithms, and more broadly intelligent systems have over the current state-of-the-art techniques for rainfall prediction within rainfall derivatives. We apply and compare the predictive performance of the current state-of-the-art (Markov chain extended with rainfall prediction) and six other popular machine learning algorithms, namely: Genetic Programming, Support Vector Regression, Radial Basis Neural Networks, M5 Rules, M5 Model trees, and k-Nearest Neighbours. To assist in the extensive evaluation, we run tests using the rainfall time series across data sets for 42 cities, with very diverse climatic features. This thorough examination shows that the machine learning methods are able to outperform the current state-of-the-art. Another contribution of this work is to detect correlations between different climates and predictive accuracy. Thus, these results show the positive effect that machine learning-based intelligent systems have for predicting rainfall based on predictive accuracy and with minimal correlations existing across climates.

The proxies include surfaces of dissolution, variation in layer-specific width, changing mineralogy, varying abundance of detrital material, varying growth rate, and oxygen and carbon isotope data. They combine to suggest a period of exceptional wetness that can be assigned with greatest certainty to 1810-1820 CE and may have been wettest in 1817. The same proxy data conversely suggest relatively dry conditions after about 1835, and increasing dryness after about 1930. Bone Cave lies in the summer rainfall zone, at the southern margin of the tropical rain belt associated with the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). Previously published data from other records combine with the Bone Cave record to support wetter conditions in the 1700s and until about 1830, and drier conditions thereafter. The period of exceptional wetness in 1810-1820 recorded in BC97-14 coincides with a decade of exceptional cold in the Northern Hemisphere, and its acme may be coincident with the Tambora eruption and its resultant year without a summer in Europe and North America. These results are thus compatible with movement of the austral-summer ITCZ southward (rather than an increase in rain its customary position) when the Northern Hemisphere cooled relative to the Southern Hemisphere. Conversely, they suggest that the ITCZ has not come as far south as frequently during Earths warming in the past century.","[Railsback, L.

In terms of their global mass, SSA have the largest uncertainty of all aerosols. In this study we review 21 SSA source functions from the literature, several of which are used in current climate models. In addition, we propose a new function. Even excluding outliers, the global annual SSA mass produced spans roughly 3-70 Pg yr(-1) for the different source functions, for particles with dry diameter D-p < 10 mu m, with relatively little interannual variability for a given function. The FLEXPART Lagrangian particle dispersion model was run in backward mode for a large global set of observed SSA concentrations, comprised of several station networks and ship cruise measurement campaigns. FLEXPART backward calculations produce gridded emission sensitivity fields, which can subsequently be multiplied with gridded SSA production fluxes in order to obtain modeled SSA concentrations. This allowed us to efficiently and simultaneously evaluate all 21 source functions against the measurements. Another advantage of this method is that source-region information on wind speed and sea surface temperatures (SSTs) could be stored and used for improving the SSA source function parameterizations. The best source functions reproduced as much as 70% of the observed SSA concentration variability at several stations, which is comparable with state of the art aerosol models. The main driver of SSA production is wind, and we found that the best fit to the observation data could be obtained when the SSA production is proportional to U-10(3.5), where U-10 is the source region averaged 10m wind speed. A strong influence of SST on SSA production, with higher temperatures leading to higher production, could be detected as well, although the underlying physical mechanisms of the SST influence remains unclear. Our new source function with wind speed and temperature dependence gives a global SSA production for particles smaller than D-p < 10 mu m of 9 Pg yr(-1), and is the best fit to the observed concentrations.","[Grythe, H.; Strom, J.; Krejci, R.] Stockholm Univ, Atmospher Sci Unit, Dept Appl Environm Sci ITM, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Grythe, H.; Stohl, A.] Norwegian Inst Air Res NILU, N-2027 Kjeller, Norway; [Grythe, H.] Air Qual Res, FMI, Helsinki 00101, Finland; [Krejci, R.] Univ Helsinki, Dept Phys, Div Atmospher Sci, Helsinki 00014, Finland; [Quinn, P.] NOAA, Pacific Marine Environm Lab, Seattle, WA 98115 USA",Stockholm University; Norwegian Institute for Air Research; University of Helsinki; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Grythe, H (corresponding author), Stockholm Univ, Atmospher Sci Unit, Dept Appl Environm Sci ITM, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",zhg@nilu.no,"Krejci, Radovan/L-3257-2013; Quinn, Patricia/R-1493-2016; Stohl, Andreas/A-7535-2008; Grythe, Henrik/O-4933-2019; Grythe, Henrik/Q-4072-2019","Krejci, Radovan/0000-0002-9384-9702; Quinn, Patricia/0000-0003-0337-4895; Stohl, Andreas/0000-0002-2524-5755; Grythe, Henrik/0000-0001-5074-4858; ",NordForsk as part of the Nordic Centre of Excellence Cryosphere Atmosphere Interactions in an Arctic Changing Climate (CRAICC),NordForsk as part of the Nordic Centre of Excellence Cryosphere Atmosphere Interactions in an Arctic Changing Climate (CRAICC),"This work was supported by NordForsk as part of the Nordic Centre of Excellence Cryosphere Atmosphere Interactions in an Arctic Changing Climate (CRAICC).

The Richelieu River is the last section of the complex Richelieu basin, which is composed of the large Lake Champlain located in a valley between two large mountains. Previous attempts in reproducing the Richelieu River flow relied on the use of simplified lumped models and showed mixed results. In order to prepare a tool to assess accurately the change of flood recurrences in the future, a state-of-the-art distributed hydrological model was applied over the Richelieu basin. The model setup comprises several novel methods and data sets such as a very high resolution river network, a modern calibration technique considering the net basin supply of Lake Champlain, a new optimization algorithm, and the use of an up-to-date meteorological data set to force the model. The results show that the hydrological model is able to satisfactorily reproduce the multiyear mean annual hydrograph and the 2011 flow time series when compared with the observed river flow and an estimation of the Lake Champlain net basin supply. Many factors, such as the quality of the meteorological forcing data, that are affected by the low density of the station network, the steep terrain, and the lake storage effect challenged the simulation of the river flow. Overall, the satisfactory validation of the hydrological model allows to move to the next step, which consists in assessing the impacts of climate change on the recurrence of Richelieu River floods.","[Lucas-Picher, Philippe; Arsenault, Richard; Poulin, Annie] Ecole Technol Super, Dept Construct Engn, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Lucas-Picher, Philippe] Ctr Natl Rech Meteorol, Grp Meteorol Grande Echelle & Climat, Toulouse, France; [Ricard, Simon; Lachance-Cloutier, Simon; Turcotte, Richard] Minist Environm & Lutte Changements Climat Quebec, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Ricard, Simon] Univ Laval, Dept Civil & Water Engn, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Turcotte, Richard] Ouranos Consortium Reg Climatol & Adaptat Climate, Montreal, PQ, Canada",University of Quebec; Ecole de Technologie Superieure - Canada; Laval University; Ouranos Consortium,"Lucas-Picher, P (corresponding author), Ecole Technol Super, Dept Construct Engn, Montreal, PQ, Canada.;Lucas-Picher, P (corresponding author), Ctr Natl Rech Meteorol, Grp Meteorol Grande Echelle & Climat, Toulouse, France.",p.lucas.picher@gmail.com,"Ricard, Simon/AAY-3986-2020; Ricard, Simon/HGB-8704-2022","Ricard, Simon/0000-0002-3049-8933; Ricard, Simon/0000-0002-3049-8933; Arsenault, Richard/0000-0003-2834-2750",IJC Lake Champlain and Richelieu River project; Direction de l'Expertise Hydrique du Ministere de l'Environnement et de la Lutte contre les Changements Climatiques,IJC Lake Champlain and Richelieu River project; Direction de l'Expertise Hydrique du Ministere de l'Environnement et de la Lutte contre les Changements Climatiques,The authors are grateful to one anonymous reviewer and Professor Alain Rousseau for their valuable comments that helped improving the manuscript.

The aim of this paper is to summarize the main sustainability challenges related to building thermal energy use and to identify the key strategies for how to address these challenges. The paper's basic premises and results are provided by and updated from the analysis conducted for the Global Energy Assessment: identification of strategies and key solutions; scenario assessment; and the comparison of the results with other models in the literature. The research has demonstrated that buildings can play a key role in solving sustainability challenges: close to one-third of 2005 building energy use can be eliminated by the proliferation of state-of-the-art construction and retrofit know-how in each world region, while maintaining wealth and amenity increases. In contrast, approximately 80% of this 2005 energy use will be locked in by the middle of the century if policies are not sufficiently ambitious in targeting regionally specific state-of-the-art performance levels.","[Urge-Vorsatz, Diana; Petrichenko, Ksenia] Cent European Univ, Ctr Climate Change & Sustainable Energy Policy 3C, H-1051 Budapest, Hungary; [Staniec, Maja] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, London, ON N6A 5B8, Canada; [Eom, Jiyong] Pacific NW Natl Lab, Joint Global Change Res Inst, College Pk, MD 20740 USA",Central European University; Western University (University of Western Ontario); United States Department of Energy (DOE); Pacific Northwest National Laboratory,"Urge-Vorsatz, D (corresponding author), Cent European Univ, Ctr Climate Change & Sustainable Energy Policy 3C, Nador St 9, H-1051 Budapest, Hungary.",vorsatzd@ceu.hu,"Ürge-Vorsatz, Diana/J-6713-2016; Eom, Jiyong/A-1161-2014","Ürge-Vorsatz, Diana/0000-0003-2570-5341; Eom, Jiyong/0000-0002-8092-5921",,,,,71,80,80,0,26,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1877-3435,,,CURR OPIN ENV SUST,Curr.

In this special issue, Modestou et al. (2020) (doi.org/10.1029/2020PA003927) reconstruct deep ocean warmth based on the clumped isotopic composition of benthic foraminifera, a technique that allows the ice volume and thermal components of the benthic oxygen isotope stack to be separated. These data reveal a very warm deep ocean while simultaneously suggesting that continental ice volume may, at times, have been greater than today. Here, I review these results in the context of recent developments in geochemical proxies and ice sheet modeling, and explore how the presence of a large Miocene ice sheet could be reconciled with CO2 at least as high as present. More broadly, I argue that many of the 'paradoxes' that pepper the paleoclimate literature result as much from our imperfect understanding of the proxies, as from our understanding of the climate system. Robust proxies with a well-understood mechanistic basis, as employed by Modestou et al. (2020), as well as advances in model-data comparability usher in a new era of palaeoclimate research; an exciting future of untangling Earth's myriad past climate states awaits. Plain Language Summary Reconstructing climate variation in Earth's geologic past informs us of the broad features of warm climates, which is relevant to preparing for climate change over the coming centuries. Moreover, these data can be compared to state-of-the-art climate models, which provides a test of the degree to which our models can reproduce warm climate states. A paper recently published in this journal applies a new method in order to reconstruct the temperature of the deep ocean in the middle Miocene (between 17 and 12 million years ago), when the atmospheric CO2 concentration was naturally similar to or higher than it is today. Coupled with decades of previous study, these exciting results depict an unfamiliar world characterized by a warm deep ocean, and yet a large ice sheet was present on Antarctica. Both models and data agree that the Antarctic ice sheet in the Miocene was highly responsive to changes in the atmospheric CO2 concentration, a clear cause of concern in the context of ongoing anthropogenic climate change.","[Evans, David] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Inst Geosci, Frankfurt, Germany",Goethe University Frankfurt,"Evans, D (corresponding author), Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Inst Geosci, Frankfurt, Germany.",evans@em.uni-frankfurt.de,,"Evans, David/0000-0002-8685-671X",Projekt DEAL,Projekt DEAL,"The author would like to thank an anonymous reviewer and the editor for providing feedback that substantially improved this contribution, and Will Gray for discussion of benthic foraminifera geochemistry.

The skills-based side of medicine is best represented by apprenticeship, which has a continuous but not linear history up to the present. In the early modern period apprenticeship was an essential albeit flexible institution involving most regular practitioners. Medical reform after 1800 performed a sleight of hand whereby apprenticeship was preserved in a liberal occupation at the same time as it was discredited by a climate of laissez faire owing much to the influence of Adam Smith. To achieve this, a privatised form of apprenticeship which had become the norm in the eighteenth century was transformed by a countervailing ethos deriving from classical humanism, which idealised the one-to-one relationship between senior and junior. This made it possible to divest apprenticeship of the associations which educated middle-class practitioners found most repellent, including poverty, servitude, trade and low status.","[Pelling, Margaret] Univ Oxford, Wellcome Unit Hist Med, Oxford, England",University of Oxford,"Pelling, M (corresponding author), Wellcome Unit Hist Med, 45-47 Banbury Rd, Oxford OX2 6PE, England.",Margaret.pelling@history.ox.ac.uk,,,,,,,111,3,3,0,0,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0951-631X,1477-4666,,SOC HIST MED,Soc.

AGCMs depict good representation of climatological spatial distribution of monsoon rainfall over both the regions. Interestingly, the year-to-year variability of the south Asian (Indian) monsoon rainfall is well simulated by the models compared to the circulation features. Whereas, for the western-north Pacific region, the AGCMs depict poor representation of monsoon rainfall variability, but circulation features are simulated with better skill. Thus suggesting that, models with good performance of monsoon rainfall variability need not necessarily have better representation of monsoon circulation features. Further analysis indicate that most models with good skill in simulating monsoon variability have better representation of monsoon-SST teleconnections with the Indo-Pacific SSTs. For the south Asian region, better simulating models have good representation of monsoon-ENSO teleconnection whereas most models have poor representation of monsoon-IOD relationship, suggesting requirement for realistic representation of these teleconnections in the models. For the western-north Pacific region, most models have unrealistic relationship of monsoon rainfall with SSTs during preceding winter and concurrent monsoon season, indicating that the poor (better) skill in simulating rainfall (circulation) probably arise from the unrealistic (realistic) representation of monsoon-SST teleconnections. Thus, the importance of realistic representation of monsoon-SST teleconnections in the climate models have been brought out for better simulation of monsoon variability over the south Asian and the western-north Pacific regions.","[Prasanna, Venkatraman] Ctr Climate Res Singapore, Singapore, Singapore; [Preethi, Bhaskar] Indian Inst Trop Meteorol, Pune, Maharashtra, India; [Oh, Jaiho; Kim, Inwon; Woo, Sumin] Pukyong Natl Univ, Busan, South Korea",Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) - India; Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM); Pukyong National University,"Prasanna, V (corresponding author), Ctr Climate Res Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.",prasa_arnala@yahoo.com,"PRASANNA, Venkatraman/AAE-6612-2022","PRASANNA, Venkatraman/0000-0001-5967-3793",,,,,62,2,2,5,9,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29a, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8181,1872-6364,,GLOBAL PLANET CHANGE,Glob.

These changes in snow cover affect Earth's climate system via the surface energy budget, and influence freshwater resources across a large proportion of the Northern Hemisphere(4-6). In contrast to snow extent, reliable quantitative knowledge on seasonal snow mass and its trend is lacking(7-9). Here we use the new GlobSnow 3.0 dataset to show that the 1980-2018 annual maximum snow mass in the Northern Hemisphere was, on average, 3,062 +/- 35 billion tonnes (gigatonnes). Our quantification is for March (the month that most closely corresponds to peak snow mass), covers non-alpine regions above 40 degrees N and, crucially, includes a bias correction based on in-field snow observations. We compare our GlobSnow 3.0 estimates with three independent estimates of snow mass, each with and without the bias correction. Across the four datasets, the bias correction decreased the range from 2,433-3,380 gigatonnes (mean 2,867) to 2,846-3,062 gigatonnes (mean 2,938)-a reduction in uncertainty from 33% to 7.4%. On the basis of our bias-corrected GlobSnow 3.0 estimates, we find different continental trends over the 39-year satellite record. For example, snow mass decreased by 46 gigatonnes per decade across North America but had a negligible trend across Eurasia; both continents exhibit high regional variability. Our results enable a better estimation of the role of seasonal snow mass in Earth's energy, water and carbon budgets. Applying a bias correction to a state-of-the-art dataset covering non-alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere and to three other datasets yields a more constrained quantification of snow mass in March from 1980 to 2018.","[Pulliainen, Jouni; Luojus, Kari; Lemmetyinen, Juha; Salminen, Miia; Ikonen, Jaakko; Takala, Matias; Cohen, Juval; Smolander, Tuomo; Norberg, Johannes] Finnish Meteorol Inst, Helsinki, Finland; [Derksen, Chris; Mudryk, Lawrence] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Climate Res Div, Toronto, ON, Canada",Finnish Meteorological Institute; Environment & Climate Change Canada,"Pulliainen, J (corresponding author), Finnish Meteorol Inst, Helsinki, Finland.",jouni.pulliainen@fmi.fi,"Pulliainen, Jouni/Y-4810-2019; Salminen, Miia A/C-3912-2018; Smolander, Tuomo/B-5022-2018; Derksen, Chris/S-9828-2017; Lemmetyinen, Juha/B-3739-2016","Pulliainen, Jouni/0000-0003-1157-2920; Salminen, Miia A/0000-0003-1847-6472; Smolander, Tuomo/0000-0003-1592-8920; Derksen, Chris/0000-0001-6821-5479; Lemmetyinen, Juha/0000-0003-4434-9696; Luojus, Kari/0000-0002-4066-6005; Cohen, Juval/0000-0001-6396-1536",,,,,46,115,119,17,97,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,MAY,2020,7808,,,,294,+,,10.1038/s41586-020-2258-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2258-0,,,15,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,LQ2CZ,32433620,,Y,N,12/21/22,WOS:000534818200013,View Full Record in Web of Science

Simulated CF also shows consistent spatial patterns with those in observations. However, almost all models overestimate the CF amount throughout the year when compared to CERES-MODIS and APP-x. On average, clouds warm the surface of the Arctic Basin mainly via the longwave (LW) radiation cloud warming effect in winter. Simulated surface energy loss of LW is less than that in CERES-EBAF observation, while the net surface shortwave (SW) flux is underestimated. The biases may result from the stronger cloud LW warming effect and SW cooling effect from the overestimated CF by the models. These two biases compensate each other, yielding similar net surface radiation flux between model output (3.0 W/m(2)) and CERES-EBAF observation (6.1 W/m(2)). During 2001-2014, significant increasing trend of spring CF is found in the multi-model mean, consistent with previous studies based on surface and satellite observations. Although most of the 22 CMIP6 models show common seasonal cycles of CF and liquid water path/ice water path (LWP/IWP), large inter-model spreads exist in the amounts of CF and LWP/IWP throughout the year, indicating the influences of different cloud parameterization schemes used in different models. Cloud Feedback Model Intercomparison Project (CFMIP) observation simulator package (COSP) is a great tool to accurately assess the performance of climate models on simulating clouds. More intuitive and credible evaluation results can be obtained based on the COSP model output. In the future, with the release of more COSP output of CMIP6 models, it is expected that those inter-model spreads and the model-observation biases can be substantially reduced. Longer term active satellite observations are also necessary to evaluate models' cloud simulations and to further explore the role of clouds in the rapid Arctic climate changes.","[Wei, Jianfen] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China; [Wei, Jianfen; Luo, Jing-Jia] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Inst Climate & Applicat Res ICAR, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China; [Wang, Zhaomin] Hohai Univ, Coll Oceanog, Nanjing 210098, Peoples R China; [Wang, Zhaomin] Southern Marine Sci & Engn Guangdong Lab Zhuhai, Zhuhai 519082, Peoples R China; [Gu, Mingyi] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Atmospher Sci, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China; [Luo, Jing-Jia] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteoro, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster,Minist Educ, Joint Int Res Lab Climate & Environm Change, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yunhe] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Oceanol, CAS Key Lab Marine Geol & Environm, Qingdao 266071, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yunhe] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Hohai University; Southern Marine Science & Engineering Guangdong Laboratory; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Oceanology, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Luo, JJ (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Inst Climate & Applicat Res ICAR, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China.;Wang, ZM (corresponding author), Hohai Univ, Coll Oceanog, Nanjing 210098, Peoples R China.;Wang, ZM (corresponding author), Southern Marine Sci & Engn Guangdong Lab Zhuhai, Zhuhai 519082, Peoples R China.;Luo, JJ (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteoro, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster,Minist Educ, Joint Int Res Lab Climate & Environm Change, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China.",zhaomin.wang@hhu.edu.cn; jjluo@nuist.edu.cn,"Luo, Jing-Jia/T-9612-2019; Keyes, Dennis/AAZ-9285-2021","Luo, Jing-Jia/0000-0003-2181-0638; Wei, Jianfen/0000-0001-8655-2970",,,,,94,4,4,6,31,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0253-505X,1869-1099,,ACTA OCEANOL SIN,Acta Oceanol.

Albeit conversion to organic farming frequently comes along with a decline in crop yields, proponents of organic farming emphasize the sustainability of that system particularly because of improving organic matter-related soil quality. Based on recent research on mechanisms driving soil organic matter turnover, however, it rather appears that low-input agro ecosystems may convert to smaller efficiency in terms of substrate use by heterotrophs which may affect soil organic matter storage in the long run. A compilation of field data confirms an inferior use efficiency in some organic soils and thus questions the claim of an overall sustainable use of the soil resource in organic farming systems.

Conserved species-specific traits can act as exaptations that may enhance parasite fitness in changing environments. Using a series of experiments, we revealed several unique adaptations of the free-living stages of M. marshalli that differ from other ostertagiines. Eggs were isolated from the feces of bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) from the Canadian Rocky Mountains and were cultured at different temperatures and with different media. Hatching occurred primarily as Lis in an advanced stage of development, morphologically very similar to a L2. When cultured at 20 degrees C, however, 2.86% of eggs hatched as L3, with this phenomenon being significantly more common at higher temperatures, peaking at 30 degrees C with 28.95% of eggs hatching as L3s. After hatching, free-living larvae of M. marshalli did not feed nor grow as they matured from L1 to infective L3. These life history traits seem to be adaptations to cope with the extreme environmental conditions that Marshallagia faces across its extensive latitudinal distribution in North America and Eurasia. In order to refine the predictions of parasite dynamics under scenarios of a changing climate, basic life history traits and temperature-dependent phenotypic behaviour should be incorporated into models for parasite biology.

To overcome these shortcomings, here, we present insulated cooling with evaporation and radiation (ICER), which utilizes a solar-reflecting layer; an infrared-emitting evaporative layer; and an infrared-transparent, solar-reflecting, and vapor-permeable insulation layer. One major advantage of ICER is that it synergistically combines thermal insulation, evaporative cooling, and radiative cooling. Consequently, it consistently achieves below-wet-bulb temperatures with much less water consumption than pure evaporation while reaching 9.3 degrees C below the ambient temperature under direct sunlight. With unfavorable climate conditions, ICER delivers 96 W/m(2) daytime cooling power at the ambient temperature and shows a 300% enhancement over the state-of-the-art radiative cooler. During the summer months, without electricity, ICER can extend food shelf life by 40% in humid climates and 200% in dry climates with low water-refilling frequencies.","[Lu, Zhengmao; Patil, Jatin J.; Grossman, Jeffrey C.] MIT, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Leroy, Arny; Zhang, Lenan; Wang, Evelyn N.] MIT, Dept Mech Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Grossman, JC (corresponding author), MIT, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.;Wang, EN (corresponding author), MIT, Dept Mech Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",enwang@mit.edu; jcg@mit.edu,,"/0000-0003-1281-2359; Wang, Evelyn/0000-0001-7045-1200",Abdul Latif Jameel Water and Food Systems Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,Abdul Latif Jameel Water and Food Systems Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,The authors thank Dr. Leon Glicksman and Dr. Shaoting Lin for the helpful discussion.

In this study, we employed a state-of-the-art formulation of the generalized complementary relationship (GCR) to estimate terrestrial evapotranspiration (ET). The GCR ET estimates were used to assess historical droughts over the contiguous United States (CONUS) in relation to long-term natural fluctuations. Results showed that the GCR provided strong performance in reproducing water balance ET estimates and correlations to the El Nino-Southern Oscillation, when compared to observation-driven estimates and land surface models. For 1982-2011, the GCR yielded better performance than land surface models even with estimated radiation inputs and no wind speed variations. The Standardized Evapotranspiration Deficit Index (SEDI) based on the GCR provided a consistent drought assessment with precipitation-based drought identification and remotely sensed vegetation conditions. The SEDI seems to capture the heat wave-driven flash drought together with water deficit-driven droughts. In the CONUS, the La Nina-like conditions were likely to trigger extensive vegetation droughts with extreme severity. This study found the three long-term environmental factors that affect the general trend of ET deficits over the CONUS, which are the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, the mean air temperature, and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. Especially, the Atlantic Oscillation seems to be the most significant predictor that could explain the long-term variation of vegetation droughts over the CONUS. This study highlights that the GCR-based SEDI could be useful for monitoring and assessment of drought risks at a continental scale.","[Kim, Daeha; Lee, Woo-Seop; Kim, Seon Tae; Chun, Jong Ahn] APEC Climate Ctr, Climate Analyt Dept, Busan, South Korea",,"Chun, JA (corresponding author), APEC Climate Ctr, Climate Analyt Dept, Busan, South Korea.",jachun@apcc21.org,"Kim, Seon Tae/G-6361-2011","Kim, Seon Tae/0000-0003-2628-0904; Lee, Woo-Seop/0000-0003-1677-1929; Chun, Jong Ahn/0000-0001-8047-1811",APEC Climate Center,APEC Climate Center,This study is supported by the APEC Climate Center.

Two sets of experiments have been designed; in the first set (EXP1), observed daily sea ice concentration and SST variations are used as lower boundary forcing over 1982-2014 while in the second set (EXP2) the SST variations are replaced by the daily SST climatology. The observed winter 2m air temperature (T2m) variations are relatively well reproduced in a number of mid and high latitude land areas in EXP1, with best agreement in southwestern North America and northern Europe. Sea ice variations are important for the interannual T2m variations in northern Europe but have limited impact on all other mid and high latitude land regions. In particular, sea ice variations do not contribute to the observed opposite variations in the Arctic and mid latitude in our model experiments. The spread across ensemble members is large and many ensemble members are required to reproduce the observed T2m variations over northern Europe in our models. The amplitude of T2m anomalies in the coldest observed winters over northern Europe is not reproduced by our multi-model ensemble means. However, the sea ice conditions in these respective winters and mainly the thermodynamic response to the ice anomalies lead to an enhanced likelihood for occurrence of colder than normal winters and extremely cold winters. Still, the main reason for the observed extreme cold winters is internal atmospheric dynamics. The coldest simulated northern European winters in EXP1 and EXP2 between 1982 and 2014 show the same large scale T2m and atmospheric circulation anomaly patterns as the observed coldest winters, indicating that the models are well able to reproduce the processes, which cause these cold anomalies. The results are robust across all six models used in this study.","[Koenigk, T.] Swedish Meteorol & Hydrol Inst, Norrkoping, Sweden; [Koenigk, T.] Stockholm Univ, Bolin Ctr Climate Res, Stockholm, Sweden; [Gao, Y.; Keenlyside, N.; Suo, L.] Nansen Environm & Remote Sensing Ctr, Bergen, Norway; [Gao, Y.; Keenlyside, N.; Ogawa, F.; Orsolini, Y.] Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, Bergen, Norway; [Gao, Y.; Wang, T.] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Nansen Zhu Int Res Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Gastineau, G.] Sorbonne Univ, UPMC, CNRS, IRD,MNHN,LOCEAN,IPSL, Paris, France; [Keenlyside, N.; Ogawa, F.] Univ Bergen, Geophys Inst, Bergen, Norway; [Nakamura, T.] Hokkaido Univ, Fac Environm Earth Sci, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan; [Orsolini, Y.] Norwegian Inst Air Res, NILU, Kjeller, Norway; [Semenov, V.] RAS, AM Obukhov Inst Atmospher Phys, Moscow, Russia; [Semenov, V.] RAS, Inst Geog, Moscow, Russia; [Tian, T.; Yang, S.] Danish Meteorol Inst, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Wettstein, J.

While many models are available, relatively few include the influence of supplementary lighting on the greenhouse climate and crop. This study presents GreenLight, a model for greenhouses with supplemental lighting. GreenLight extends state of the art models by describing the qualitative difference between the common lighting system of high-pressure sodium (HPS) lamps, and the newest technology for horticultural lighting - the light-emitting diodes (LEDs). LEDs differ from HPS lamps in that they operate at lower temperatures, emit mostly convective heat and relatively little radiative heat, and can be more efficient in converting electricity to photo-synthetically active radiation (PAR). These differences can have major implications on the greenhouse climate and operation, and on the amount of heat that must be supplied from the greenhouse heating system. Model predictions have been evaluated against data collected in greenhouse compartments equipped with HPS and LED lamps. The model predicted the greenhouse's heating needs with an error of 8-51 W m(-2), representing 1-12% of the measured values; the RMSE for indoor temperature was 1.74-2.04 degrees C; and the RMSE for relative humidity was 5.52-8.5%. The model is freely available as open source MATLAB software at http://github.com/davkat1/GreenLight. It is hoped that it may be further evaluated and used by researchers worldwide to analyse the influence of the most recent lighting technologies on greenhouse climate control. (C) 2020 The Authors.

The GCM forecasts of temperature for a whole season issued in November from various organizations are compared with observed gridded temperature data obtained from the India Meteorological Department (IMD) for the period 1982-2009.

An accurate; knowledge of BC emitting sources is necessary for devising appropriate mitigation strategies and; policies to reduce the associated climate/environmental burden. The radiocarbon isotope (C-14 or carbon-14) fingerprinting allows for an unambiguous and quantitative constraining of the BC sources and is therefore a well-popularized method.

Near-surface (2 m) air temperature (T-a) and surface (skin) temperature (T-s) are two crucial parameters of land-atmosphere interactions and climate change. Their difference (Delta T = T-s - T-a) determines the heating source over the TP that drives the Asian summer monsoon. This study focuses on climatology, inter-annual variability, and long-term trend of Delta T over the TP in the last four decades (1979-2018), based on four latest reanalysis datasets including ERA-Interim, ERA5, MERRA2, and JRA55, along with observational data. We show that Delta T-based different datasets display fairly different climatology in terms of seasonality, spatial distribution, and long-term trend. Delta T exhibits a clear seasonality with negative value in winter and positive ones in summer despite different strengths and timings presented by the reanalyses. Along with global warming, all reanalyses except JRA55 exhibit obvious downwards trends of Delta T in a spatially non-uniform way. The median Delta T among the four reanalyses features uniform decreases in all seasons, with the most distinct area on the northern TP, as well as the largest and least decreases in autumn and spring, respectively. Further analysis shows that the differences in Delta T are most likely associated with discrepancies in radiation forcing, snow cover, wind speed, and boundary layer height within the reanalyses. The present findings highlight the difficulty for the state-of-the-art reanalyses to represent the climate change over the TP and point to possible factors behind the deficiencies identified.","[Wang, Xuejia; Yang, Meixue] Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Ecoenvironm & Resources, State Key Lab Cryospher Sci, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xuejia; Chen, Deliang; Pang, Guojin; Ou, Tinghai] Lanzhou Jiaotong Univ, Fac Geomat, Lanzhou, Peoples R China; [Pang, Guojin] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Earth Sci, Reg Climate Grp, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Wang, Meng] Southwest Forestry Univ, Forestry Coll, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China",Chinese Academy of Sciences; Lanzhou Jiaotong University; University of Gothenburg; Southwest Forestry University - China,"Wang, XJ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Ecoenvironm & Resources, State Key Lab Cryospher Sci, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu, Peoples R China.;Chen, DL (corresponding author), Univ Gothenburg, Dept Earth Sci, Reg Climate Grp, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden.",xjwang@lzb.ac.cn; deliang@gvc.gu.se,"pang, guojin/AAS-3679-2020; Wang, Xuejia/H-2780-2015; Ou, Tinghai/A-5068-2013; Chen, Deliang/A-5107-2013","Wang, Xuejia/0000-0002-4761-9156; Chen, Deliang/0000-0003-0288-5618; Yang, Meixue/0000-0001-8328-929X; Ou, Tinghai/0000-0002-6847-4099","Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research Program (STEP) [2019QZKK0208]; Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) [XDA19070204]; Innovation Research Group of NSFC [41721091]; Strategic Priority Research Programof CAS [XDA20100102]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41601077, 41771068, 41571066]; Youth Innovation Promotion Association CAS [2018460]; Program of China Scholarship Council [201804910129]; CAS Light of West China Program",Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research Program (STEP); Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS); Innovation Research Group of NSFC; Strategic Priority Research Programof CAS; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Youth Innovation Promotion Association CAS; Program of China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council); CAS Light of West China Program,"This study was jointly supported by the Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research Program (STEP) (2019QZKK0208), the Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) (XDA19070204), the Innovation Research Group of NSFC (41721091), the Strategic Priority Research Programof CAS (XDA20100102), the National Natural Science Foundation of China(41601077, 41771068, and 41571066), the CAS Light of West China Program, theYouth Innovation Promotion Association CAS (2018460), and the Program of China Scholarship Council (201804910129).

Three sites are involved this campaign, including one permanent site (Semi-Arid Climate and Environment Observatory of Lanzhou University (SACOL)) (located in Yuzhong, 35.95 degrees N, 104.1 degrees E), one SACOL's Mobile Facility (SMF) (deployed in Jintai, 37.57 degrees N, 104.23 degrees E), and the U. S. Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation Measurements (ARM) Ancillary Facility (AAF mobile laboratories, SMART-COMMIT) (deployed in Zhangye, 39.08 degrees N, 100.27 degrees E). This paper presents the results of direct measurement analysis of the dust plume transport case. During the dust plume period, the OMI AI data and air mass back trajectory model (HYSPLIT) clearly illustrated that the air mass originated from the Taklamakan desert and Inner Mongolia Gobi desert. The daily averaged concentrations of PM10 were about 0.2 +/- 0.03 mg/m(3) at SACOL and Zhangye, but during the dust plume the mass concentration of dust aerosol were 0.98 mg/m(3) at Zhangye and 0.52 mg/m(3) at SACOL. The black carbon (BC) value reached its high peak during the dust plume. However, the concentration of BC was not only fluctuated with the dust plume, but also affected by the local air pollutants. When the dust plume occurred, the multiwavelength aerosol optical depth can be raised to similar to 2, similar to 1.5 times as high as that during the non dust plume period, and the number (mass) distribution during the dust plume showed the aerosol types considered correspond to urban/industrial aerosols, coarse mode particles. The meteorological analysis indicated that these polluted layers are not only transported from their sources, but also include the local sources.","[Wang, Xin; Huang, Jiangping; Zhang, Rudong; Chen, Bin; Bi, Jianrong] Lanzhou Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Semiarid Climate Change, Coll Atmospher Sci, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China",Lanzhou University,"Wang, X (corresponding author), Lanzhou Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Semiarid Climate Change, Coll Atmospher Sci, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China.",wxin@lzu.edu.cn,"zhang, zhijuan/H-9917-2016; wang, xin/H-3936-2015; Huang, Jianping/A-6600-2012; CHEN, BIN/A-6537-2012","zhang, zhijuan/0000-0002-5328-7506; wang, xin/0000-0002-8839-8345; Huang, Jianping/0000-0003-2845-797X; ","National Satellite Meteorological Center, CMA [2008BAC40B05-02]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [860034]","National Satellite Meteorological Center, CMA; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities)","This research is supported by the National Satellite Meteorological Center, CMA under grant 2008BAC40B05-02, and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities under grant 860034.

Whereas the WAM occurs in the boreal summer, ENSO events generally peak in late autumn. Statistics show that, in the observations, the WAM is influenced either during the developing phase of ENSO or during the decay of some long-lasting La Nina events. The timing of ENSO thus seems essential to the teleconnection process. Composite maps for the developing ENSO illustrate the large-scale mechanisms of the teleconnection. The most robust features are a modulation of the Walker circulation and a Kelvin wave response in the high troposphere. In the Centre National de Recherches Meteorologiques Coupled Global Climate Model, version 3 (CNRM-CM3), the teleconnection occurs unrealistically at the end of ENSO events. An original sensitivity experiment is presented in which the ocean component is forced with a reanalyzed wind stress over the tropical Pacific. This allows for the reproduction of the observed ENSO chronology in the coupled simulation. In CNRM-CM3, the atmospheric response to ENSO is slower than in the reanalysis data, so the influence on the WAM is delayed by a year. The two principal features of the teleconnection are the timing of ENSO onsets and the time lag of the atmospheric response. Both are assessed separately in 16 twentieth-century simulations of the third phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP3). The temporal aspects of the ENSO teleconnection are reproduced with difficulty in state-of-the-art coupled models. Only four models simulate an impact of ENSO on the WAM during the developing phase.","[Joly, Mathieu] Meteo France, CNRM GMGEC UDC, CNRM GAME, CNRS, F-31057 Toulouse 1, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Meteo France,"Joly, M (corresponding author), Meteo France, CNRM GMGEC UDC, CNRM GAME, CNRS, 42 Ave G Coriolis, F-31057 Toulouse 1, France.",mathieu.joly@meteo.fr,,,AMMA; ENSEMBLES European project [GOCE-CT-2003-505539],AMMA; ENSEMBLES European project,"This work was supported by the AMMA program (http://www.amma-international.org), and by the ENSEMBLES European project (Contract GOCE-CT-2003-505539).

In this paper, authors review the state of the art in tropical heat island intensity, its influence on building energy consumption and the effect of urban compactness in the tropics. The review is limited to peer-reviewed journal publications found on four databases: Web of Science, Scopus, Google Scholar and Science Direct. The review indicates that although the tropical belt has large variations in topography, forest cover, land mass and development patterns, much of the current work is confined largely to Far East Asia, South Asia and South America. Future studies should focus on protocol for parameterisation and standardisation of measurement, in depth and scientific understanding of the influence of vegetation, water and topography, survey and monitoring of the context specific relationship between UHI and energy consumption, development of database for numerical model validation and improvement, and the context specific development of LCZ based institutional framework to integrate UHI mitigation strategies with environmental design guidelines.","[Giridharan, Renganathan] Univ Kent, Kent Sch Architecture, Canterbury, Kent, England; [Emmanuel, Rohinton] Glasgow Caledonian Univ, Sch Engn & Built Environm, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland",University of Kent; Glasgow Caledonian University,"Giridharan, R (corresponding author), Univ Kent, Kent Sch Architecture, Canterbury, Kent, England.",g.renganathan@kent.ac.uk,"Emmanuel, Rohinton/H-6313-2019; Renganathan, Giridharan/AAI-6213-2020","Emmanuel, Rohinton/0000-0002-3726-5892; Renganathan, Giridharan/0000-0002-8627-5616",,,,,135,82,84,22,156,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2210-6707,2210-6715,,SUSTAIN CITIES SOC,Sust.

Although these models often share the same concept, they differ with respect to the number and kind of PFTs, complicating the comparability of simulated vegetation distributions. Pollen-based vegetation reconstructions are initially only available in the form of time series of individual taxa that are not distinguished in the models. Thus, to evaluate simulated vegetation distributions, the modelling results and pollen-based vegetation reconstructions have to be converted into a comparable format. The classical approach is the method of biomisation, but hitherto PFT-based biomisation methods were only available for individual models. We introduce and evaluate a simple, universally applicable technique to harmonise PFT distributions by assigning them into nine mega-biomes, using only assumptions on the minimum PFT cover fractions and few bioclimatic constraints (based on the 2 m temperature). These constraints mainly follow the limitation rules used in the classical biome models (here BIOME4). We test the method for six state-of-the-art dynamic vegetation models that are included in Earth system models based on pre-industrial, mid-Holocene and Last Glacial Maximum simulations. The method works well, independent of the spatial resolution or the complexity of the models. Large biome belts (such as tropical forest) are generally better represented than regionally confined biomes (warm-temperate forest, savanna). The comparison with biome distributions inferred via the classical biomisation approach of forcing biome models (here BIOME1) with the simulated climate states shows that the PFT-based biomisation is even able to keep up with the classical method. However, as the new method considers the PFT distributions actually calculated by the Earth system models, it allows for a direct comparison and evaluation of simulated vegetation distributions which the classical method cannot do. Thereby, the new method provides a powerful tool for the evaluation of Earth system models in general.","[Dallmeyer, Anne; Claussen, Martin; Brovkin, Victor] Max Planck Inst Meteorol, Bundesstr 53, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany; [Claussen, Martin] Univ Hamburg, CEN, Meteorol Inst, Bundesstr 55, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany",Max Planck Society; University of Hamburg,"Dallmeyer, A (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Meteorol, Bundesstr 53, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany.",anne.dallmeyer@mpimet.mpg.de,"Brovkin, Victor/C-2803-2016","Brovkin, Victor/0000-0001-6420-3198; Dallmeyer, Anne/0000-0002-3270-610X; Claussen, Martin/0000-0001-6225-5488","German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), Research for Sustainability initiative (FONA); PalMod","German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), Research for Sustainability initiative (FONA)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); PalMod","This work contributes to the project PalMod, funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), Research for Sustainability initiative (FONA, https://www.fona.de, last access: 8 February 2019).

By mapping the morphology in the vicinity of 25 glaciers several glacier stages could be differentiated. Each glacier forefield is bordered by great lateral moraines, indicating the historical maximum glaciation (glacier stage 1, ELA-lowering = 89 m). Highly likely the last built up of the stage 1-moraines happened during the Little Ice Age maximum (AD 1600-1800). As to the maximum historical glaciation the glacier area in the study section was 145 km(2). Relative to the current conditions (approximately 107 km(2)) it was increased the 1.35-fold. Between the stage 1-moraines, which probably accumulated by two to three historical advances and the today's glacier snouts, three more glacier stages (2, 3 and 4) were evidenced by moraine walls and -ledges. Very likely the stages 2 and 3 (ELA-depression 79 m and 42 m) were caused by cold and humid phases in the first half of the 19th century (stage 2) and in the beginning of the 20th century (stage 3). Photographic material documents that very fresh moraines were deposited as to glacier stage 4, which took place from ca. AD 1974 to 1980. This youngest advance/stagnation was reasoned by an interruption of the ongoing warming trend of the last century starting around 1940/50 (max. temperature decrease of about 0.3 degrees C). The glacier retreat following stage 4 was due to the strong warming after the 1970s. Outwards the glacier forefields (below moraines of stage 1) neoglacial lateral moraines (5500-1700 BP) occur. The very similar moraine sequences of the investigated glacier forefields as well as the synchronous glacier stage around the 1970s verify the hypothesis that the snouts of the glaciers in the Inner Himalaya react relatively directly to climate signals. A comparison with the state of the art shows that in almost all regions of High Asia historical and neoglacial glacier advances/stagnations took place (max. ELA-lowering ca. 400 m). Moraine findings indicating historical and neoglacial glacier extensions are restricted to the vicinity of modem glaciation. In contrast, older glacial traces are observable over large areas. They evidence high- and late-glacial ELA-depressions of 700 to 1300 m.","Inst Geog, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany",,"Achenbach, H (corresponding author), Inst Geog, Goldschmidtstr 5, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany.",hachenb1@gwdg.de,,,,,,,72,0,0,0,3,VEREIN FREUNDE & FORDERER NATURKUNDE MUSEUMS ERFURT E V,ERFURT,"GROBE ARCHE 14, ERFURT, D-99084, GERMANY",,,978-3-00-038976-4,,,,2012,,,,,47,61,,,,,,15,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BFB37,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000319084700003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here we use in situ observations to assess the performance of monthly VPD calculated from state-of-the-art data sets including CRU, ERA5, and Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA2). We investigate trends in VPD at global scale and for different climatic zones for 1981-2020 and future trends (2021-2100) from Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6) outputs. The results show that monthly VPD estimated from CRU, ERA5, and MERRA2 correlated well against in situ estimates from 15,531 World Meteorological Organization stations, with R-2 ranging between 0.92 and 0.96. Moreover, robust correlations were also found across in situ stations and when analyzing different months separately. During 1981-2020, VPD increased in all climatic zones, with the strongest increase in the arid zone, followed by tropical, temperate, cold and polar zones. CMIP6 simulations show a continuously increasing trend in VPD (0.028 hPa year(-1)), with the largest increase in the arid zone (0.063 hPa year(-1)). The magnitudes of trends are found to increase following the magnitude of CO2 increases in the future emission scenarios. We highlight that atmospheric aridification will continue under global warming, which may pose an increasing threat to terrestrial ecosystems and particularly dryland agricultural systems.","[Fang, Zhongxiang; Zhang, Wenmin; Brandt, Martin; Abdi, Abdulhakim M.; Fensholt, Rasmus] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Geosci & Nat Resource Management, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Abdi, Abdulhakim M.] Lund Univ, Ctr Environm & Climate Sci, Lund, Sweden",University of Copenhagen; Lund University,"Zhang, WM (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen, Dept Geosci & Nat Resource Management, Copenhagen, Denmark.",wenminzhg@gmail.com,"Brandt, Martin/E-4598-2015","Brandt, Martin/0000-0001-9531-1239; Fang, Zhongxiang/0000-0003-3336-8824; Zhang, Wenmin/0000-0001-6520-9559",China Scholarship Council (CSC) [201906410082]; ERC project TOFDRY [947757]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [42001349]; Villum Foundation [34306],China Scholarship Council (CSC)(China Scholarship Council); ERC project TOFDRY; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Villum Foundation(Villum Fonden),ZF is funded by the China Scholarship Council (CSC) (Grant 201906410082).

We examine this trend in two state-of-the-art chemistry-climate models. Under high greenhouse gas emissions scenarios, the stratospheric entry value of water vapor increases by similar to 1ppmv over the 21st century in both models. We show with trajectory runs driven by model meteorological fields that the warming tropical tropopause layer (TTL) explains 50-80% of this increase. The remainder is a consequence of trends in evaporation of ice convectively lofted into the TTL and lower stratosphere. Our results further show that within the models we examined, ice lofting is primarily important on long time scales; on interannual time scales, TTL temperature variations explain most of the variations in lower stratospheric humidity. Assessing the ability of models to realistically represent ice lofting processes should be a high priority in the modeling community.","[Dessler, A.

Desertification is considered to be the last stage of land degradation. In recent years, various studies have been carried out to reveal effective natural and human factors on desertification. Important one of the parameters commonly used in these studies is the soil quality index. Soil quality refers to the soil's capacity to function. Soil quality index cannot be measured directly; it is obtained by combining some physical, chemical and biological soil properties in a spatial sense. In this study, the relationship between some soil criteria and desertification has been discussed and evaluated. The research area covers the boundaries of the Kalecik district of Ankara and covers 116,000 ha. The study area consists of different geomorphological units and has semi-arid climate characteristics. In this study erosion risk, soil depth, texture, organic matter content, soil reaction, main material, drainage, salinization and alkalization, lime content and soil pollution of the soils of the research area were examined, and classified by analytic hierarchy process method according to their degree of weight and assembled in geographic information systems environment in layer logic. As a result of analysis, soil quality map was obtained from the viewpoint of land degradation and desertification based on soil and land characteristics of the study area. According to the obtained result soil quality is determined: 39.2% of the study area as low, 54.5% as medium, and 6.2% as high.","[Imamoglu, Ali] Nevsehir Hacibektas Veli Univ, Fac Art & Sci, Dept Geog, Nevsehir, Turkey; [Dengiz, Orhan] Ondokuz Mayis Univ, Dept Soil Sci Samsun, Fac Agr, Samsun, Turkey",Nevsehir Haci Bektas Veli University; Ondokuz Mayis University,"Imamoglu, A (corresponding author), Nevsehir Hacibektas Veli Univ, Fac Art & Sci, Dept Geog, Nevsehir, Turkey.",aliimamoglu@yandex.com,"Dengiz, Orhan/ABG-7284-2020","dengiz, orhan/0000-0002-0458-6016",,,,,30,6,6,2,33,SPRINGER-VERLAG ITALIA SRL,MILAN,"VIA DECEMBRIO, 28, MILAN, 20137, ITALY",2037-4631,1720-0776,,REND LINCEI-SCI FIS,Rend.

Repeated snowfall, high concentration of UV and IR radiation, high diurnal temperature variation, negligible rainfall and high wind velocity (45-60 miles h(-1)) during winter are some of the main features of the climate of this region. The glacial melts serve as source of irrigation during summer. The soils are shallow, sandy loam in texture, low in organic matter and neutral to alkaline in reaction. The experiment evaluating six spur type cultivars namely 'Red Chief', 'Well Spur', 'Silver Spur', 'Red Spur', 'Oregon Spur-II', and 'Golden Spur' in relation to two standard cultivars, 'Starking Delicious' and 'Vance Delicious' grafted on seedling rootstocks, was conducted at the Regional Horticultural Research Sub-Station, Tabo, district Lahaul & Spiti, Himachal Pradesh, India, situated at an elevation of 3250 m. There were 833 tree ha(-1) at a spacing of 4x3 m planted in March 1996 on seedling rootstock. The maximum yield (18.5 kg tree(-1)) and productivity (15.4 t ha(-1)) were recorded with 'Silver Spur'. The best quality fruit were produced by 'Red Chief' in terms of quality and market acceptability. The studies revealed that the 'Red Chief' and 'Silver Spur' were superior in terms of fruit quality, precocity and productivity and thus can be recommended for growing under high density plantations in the cold desert conditions of North-Western Himalayas.","[Sharma, D.

Achieving this goal requires that such models adequately capture the observed variation in the NAO at interannual as well as interdecadal timescales. We investigate whether this is the case by comparing interannual variability in the HadAM3 atmospheric model with observations in the SOC air-sea flux dataset for 1980-1995. We find that the model NAO time variation does not correspond to that observed, thus claims of multiannual predictability need to be viewed with caution. In addition, analysis of the observations reveals that NAO related SST anomalies do not exert a significant heat flux feedback on the atmosphere at seasonal to interannual timescales.","Southampton Oceanog Ctr, James Rennell Div Ocean Circulat & Climate, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, England",NERC National Oceanography Centre; University of Southampton,"Josey, SA (corresponding author), Southampton Oceanog Ctr, James Rennell Div Ocean Circulat & Climate, European Way, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, England.",Simon.A.Josey@soc.soton.ac.uk,"Kent, Elizabeth/C-1281-2011","Kent, Elizabeth/0000-0002-6209-4247",,,,,14,15,15,0,3,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",0094-8276,1944-8007,,GEOPHYS RES LETT,Geophys.

A theory and process for ABR is presented to address three current needs: (i) designing better visualizations by making it possible for non-programmers to rapidly design and critique many alternative data-to-visual mappings; (ii) expanding the visual vocabulary used in scientific visualizations to depict increasingly complex multivariate data; (iii) bringing a more engaging, natural, and human-relatable handcrafted aesthetic to data visualization. New tools and algorithms to support ABR include front-end applets for constructing artifact-based colormaps, optimizing 3D scanned meshes for use in data visualization, and synthesizing textures from artifacts. These are complemented by an interactive rendering engine with custom algorithms and interfaces that demonstrate multiple new visual styles for depicting point, line, surface, and volume data. A within-the-research-team design study provides early evidence of the shift in visualization design processes that ABR is believed to enable when compared to traditional scientific visualization systems.

The CFSIE experiments are designed to reduce weather noise and using a few ten-year long forecasts this study shows that reduction in weather noise leads to lower SST forecast skill. To understand the pathways that cause the reduced SST prediction skill, two twenty-year long forecasts produced with CFS and CFSIE for 1980-2000 are analyzed for the ocean subsurface characteristics that influence SST due to the reduction in weather noise in the North Pacific. The heat budget analysis in the oceanic mixed layer across the North Pacific reveals that weather noise significantly impacts the heat transport in the oceanic mixed layer. In the CFSIE forecasts, the reduced weather noise leads to increased variations in heat content due to shallower mixed layer, diminished heat storage and enhanced horizontal heat advection. The enhancement of the heat advection spans from the active Kuroshio regions of the east coast of Japan to the west coast of continental United States and significantly diffuses the basin-wide SST anomaly (SSTA) contrasts and leads to reduction in the SST prediction skill in decadal forecasts.","[Narapusetty, Balachandrudu] George Mason Univ, Atmospher Ocean & Earth Sci, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Narapusetty, Balachandrudu] NWS, NCEP, Innovim, Climate Predict Ctr, College Pk, MD USA; [Narapusetty, Balachandrudu] NOAA, Ctr Weather & Climate Predict, 5830 Univ Res Court, College Pk, MD 20740 USA",George Mason University; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Narapusetty, B (corresponding author), George Mason Univ, Atmospher Ocean & Earth Sci, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.;Narapusetty, B (corresponding author), NWS, NCEP, Innovim, Climate Predict Ctr, College Pk, MD USA.;Narapusetty, B (corresponding author), NOAA, Ctr Weather & Climate Predict, 5830 Univ Res Court, College Pk, MD 20740 USA.",bala.narapusetty@noaa.gov,,,NSF [AGS-1338427]; NOAA [NA14OAR4310160]; NASA [NNX14AM19G],NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)),"This research is funded by NSF AGS-1338427, NOAA NA14OAR4310160, and NASA NNX14AM19G grants.

The classical manual microscopy counts are gradually being replaced by high throughput imaging and nucleic acid sequencing. DNA sequencing allows deep taxonomic resolution (including cryptic species) as well as high detection power (detecting rare species), while RNA provides insights on function and potential activity. However, these methods are affected by database limitations, PCR bias, and copy number variability across taxa. Recent developments in high-throughput imaging applied in situ or on collected samples (high-throughput microscopy, Underwater Vision Profiler, FlowCam, ZooScan, etc) has enabled a rapid enumeration of morphologically-distinguished plankton populations, estimates of biovolume/biomass, and provides additional valuable phenotypic information. Although machine learning classifiers generate encouraging results to classify marine plankton images in a time efficient way, there is still a need for large training datasets of manually annotated images. Here we provide workflow examples that couple nucleic acid sequencing with high-throughput imaging for a more complete and robust analysis of microbial communities. We also describe the publicly available and collaborative web application EcoTaxa, which offers tools for the rapid validation of plankton by specialists with the help of automatic recognition algorithms. Finally, we describe how the field is moving with citizen science programs, unmanned autonomous platforms with in situ sensors, and sequencing and digitalization of historical plankton samples.","[Karlusich, Juan Jose Pierella; Bowler, Chris] Univ Paris Sci & Lettres PSL, Inst Biol Ecole Normale Super IBENS, Ecole Normale Super, Inst Natl Sante Rech Med INSERM,Ctr Natl Rech Sci, Paris, France; [Karlusich, Juan Jose Pierella; Lombard, Fabien; Bowler, Chris] Ctr Natl Rech Sci CNRS, Tara Oceans Global Ocean Syst Ecol & Evolut GOSEE, Res Federat study Global Ocean Syst Ecol & Evolut, Paris, France; [Lombard, Fabien; Irisson, Jean-Olivier] Sorbonne Univ, Ctr Natl Rech Sci CNRS, Lab Oceanog Villefranche LOV, Villefranche Sur Mer, France; [Lombard, Fabien; Irisson, Jean-Olivier] Inst Univ France IUF, Paris, France; [Foster, Rachel A.] Stockholm Univ, Dept Ecol Environm & Plant Sci, Stockholm, Sweden",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); UDICE-French Research Universities; PSL Research University Paris; Ecole Normale Superieure (ENS); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Institut Universitaire de France; Stockholm University,"Karlusich, JJP (corresponding author), Univ Paris Sci & Lettres PSL, Inst Biol Ecole Normale Super IBENS, Ecole Normale Super, Inst Natl Sante Rech Med INSERM,Ctr Natl Rech Sci, Paris, France.;Karlusich, JJP (corresponding author), Ctr Natl Rech Sci CNRS, Tara Oceans Global Ocean Syst Ecol & Evolut GOSEE, Res Federat study Global Ocean Syst Ecol & Evolut, Paris, France.;Foster, RA (corresponding author), Stockholm Univ, Dept Ecol Environm & Plant Sci, Stockholm, Sweden.",pierella@biologie.ens.fr; rachel.foster@su.se,"Pierella Karlusich, Juan J/AAW-9429-2021; Lombard, Fabien/H-6702-2012","Pierella Karlusich, Juan J/0000-0003-1739-4424; Lombard, Fabien/0000-0002-8626-8782","FFEM -French Facility for Global Environment, French Government 'Investissements d'Avenir' program OCEANOMICS [ANR-11-BTBR-0008]; FFEM -French Facility for Global Environment, French Government 'Investissements d'Avenir' program FRANCE GENOMIQUE [ANR-10-INBS-09-08]; FFEM -French Facility for Global Environment, French Government 'Investissements d'Avenir' program MEMO LIFE [ANR-10-LABX-54]; FFEM -French Facility for Global Environment, French Government 'Investissements d'Avenir' program PSL Research University [ANR-11-IDEX-0001-02]; Fonds Francais pour l'Environnement Mondial; Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation","FFEM -French Facility for Global Environment, French Government 'Investissements d'Avenir' program OCEANOMICS(French National Research Agency (ANR)); FFEM -French Facility for Global Environment, French Government 'Investissements d'Avenir' program FRANCE GENOMIQUE(French National Research Agency (ANR)); FFEM -French Facility for Global Environment, French Government 'Investissements d'Avenir' program MEMO LIFE(French National Research Agency (ANR)); FFEM -French Facility for Global Environment, French Government 'Investissements d'Avenir' program PSL Research University(French National Research Agency (ANR)); Fonds Francais pour l'Environnement Mondial; Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation(Knut & Alice Wallenberg Foundation)","This work has been supported by the FFEM -French Facility for Global Environment, French Government 'Investissements d'Avenir' programs OCEANOMICS (ANR-11-BTBR-0008), FRANCE GENOMIQUE (ANR-10-INBS-09-08), MEMO LIFE (ANR-10-LABX-54), and PSL Research University (ANR-11-IDEX-0001-02).

This effort involves the recovery of land surface, ship, rawinsonde, pibal, aircraft, satellite, and other data; quality controlling and assimilating these data with a data assimilation system that is kept unchanged over the reanalysis period 1957-96. This eliminates perceived climate jumps associated with changes in the data assimilation system. The NCEP/NCAR 40-yr reanalysis uses a frozen state-of-the-art global data assimilation system and a database as complete as possible. The data assimilation and the model used are identical to the global system implemented operationally at the NCEP on 11 January 1995, except that the horizontal resolution is T62 (about 210 km). The database has been enhanced with many sources of observations not available in real time for operations, provided by different countries and organizations. The system has been designed with advanced quality control and monitoring components, and can produce 1 mon of reanalysis per day on a Gray YMP/8 supercomputer. Different types of output archives are being created to satisfy different user needs, including a ''quick look'' CD-ROM (one per year) with six tropospheric and stratospheric fields available twice daily, as well as surface, top-of-the atmosphere, and isentropic fields. Reanalysis information and selected output is also available on-line via the Internet (http//:nic.fb4.noaa.gov:8000). A special CDROM, containing 13 years of selected observed, daily, monthly, and climatological data from the NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis, is included with this issue. Output variables are classified into four classes, depending on the degree to which they are influenced by the observations and/or the model. For example, ''C'' variables (such as precipitation and surface fluxes) are completely determined by the model during the data assimilation and should be used with caution. Nevertheless, a comparison of these variables with observations and with several climatologies shows that they generally contain considerable useful information. Eight-day forecasts, produced every 5 days, should be useful for predictability studies and for monitoring the quality of the observing systems. The 40 years of reanalysis (1957-96) should be completed in early 1997. A continuation into the future through an identical Climate Data Assimilation System will allow researchers to reliably compare recent anomalies with those in earlier decades. Since changes in the observing systems will inevitably produce perceived changes in the climate, parallel reanalyses (at least 1 year long) will be generated for the periods immediately after the introduction of new observing systems, such as new types of satellite data. NCEP plans currently call for an updated reanalysis using a state-of-the-art system every five years or so. The successive reanalyses will be greatly facilitated by the generation of the comprehensive database in the present reanalysis.","NATL CTR ENVIRONM PREDICT,CLIMATE PREDICT CTR,WASHINGTON,DC 20233; NATL CTR ATMOSPHER RES,BOULDER,CO 80307",National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA,"Kalnay, E (corresponding author), NATL CTR ENVIRONM PREDICT,ENVIRONM MODELING CTR,W NMCZ,ROOM 204 WWB,WASHINGTON,DC 20233, USA.",,"Kalnay, Eugenia/F-4393-2010; Bond, Alexander L/A-3786-2010; Wang, Julian/C-3188-2016","Kalnay, Eugenia/0000-0002-9984-9906",,,,,59,22838,24472,112,2486,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693",0003-0007,,,B AM METEOROL SOC,Bull.

Because TC intensification is significantly controlled by atmosphere and ocean environments, changes in these environments may cause changes in TC intensity. Changes in surface and subsurface ocean conditions can both influence a TC's intensification. Regarding global warming, minimal exploration of the subsurface ocean has been undertaken. Here we investigate future subsurface ocean environment changes projected by 22 state-of-the-art climate models and suggest a suppressive effect of subsurface oceans on the intensification of future TCs. Under global warming, the subsurface vertical temperature profile can be sharpened in important TC regions, which may contribute to a stronger ocean coupling (cooling) effect during the intensification of future TCs. Regarding a TC, future subsurface ocean environments may be more suppressive than the existing subsurface ocean environments. This suppressive effect is not spatially uniform and may be weak in certain local areas.","[Huang, Ping; Huang, Rong-Hui] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Ctr Monsoon Syst Res, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Huang, Ping] JCGCS, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Lin, I-I] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, Taipei 10617, Taiwan; [Chou, Chia] Acad Sinica, Res Ctr Environm Changes, Taipei 11529, Taiwan","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; National Taiwan University; Academia Sinica - Taiwan","Lin, II (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.",iilin@as.ntu.edu.tw,"Lin, I-I/J-4695-2013; Huang, Ping/A-6399-2013","Lin, I-I/0000-0002-8364-8106; Huang, Ping/0000-0001-7891-8848","National Basic Research Program of China [2012CB955604]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41461164005]; Taiwan's Ministry of Science and Technology [NSC 101-2628-M-002-001 -MY4, MOST 103-2111-M-002-002 -MY3]",National Basic Research Program of China(National Basic Research Program of China); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Taiwan's Ministry of Science and Technology,"This study is supported by the National Basic Research Program of China (2012CB955604), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41461164005) and Taiwan's Ministry of Science and Technology (NSC 101-2628-M-002-001 -MY4 and MOST 103-2111-M-002-002 -MY3).

The model has been constrained with two isoprene emission inventories: (1) the canopy-scale Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature (MEGAN) and (2) a leaf-scale algorithm coupled to the Lund-Potsdam-Jena General Ecosystem Simulator (LPJ-GUESS) dynamic vegetation model, and the model has been run using two different chemical mechanisms that contain alternative treatments of isoprene photo-oxidation. Large differences of up to 100 Tg C yr (1) exist between the isoprene emissions predicted by each inventory, with MEGAN emissions generally higher. Based on our simulations we estimate that tropical South America (30-85 degrees W, 14 degrees N-25 degrees S) contributes about 15-35% of total global isoprene emissions. We have quantified the model sensitivity to changes in isoprene emissions, chemistry, boundary layer mixing, and soil NOx emissions using ground-based and airborne observations. We find GEOS-Chem has difficulty reproducing several observed chemical species; typically hydroxyl concentrations are underestimated, whilst mixing ratios of isoprene and its oxidation products are overestimated. The magnitude of model formaldehyde (HCHO) columns are most sensitive to the choice of chemical mechanism and isoprene emission inventory. We find GEOS-Chem exhibits a significant positive bias (10-100%) when compared with HCHO columns from the Scanning Imaging Absorption Spectrometer for Atmospheric Chartography (SCIAMACHY) and Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) for the study year 2006. Simulations that use the more detailed chemical mechanism and/or lowest isoprene emissions provide the best agreement to the satellite data, since they result in lower-HCHO columns.","[Barkley, Michael P.] Univ Leicester, Dept Phys & Astron, EOS Grp, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England; [Palmer, Paul I.] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Geosci, Edinburgh EH9 3JW, Midlothian, Scotland; [Ganzeveld, Laurens] Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, Dept Environm Sci, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands; [Arneth, Almut; Hagberg, Daniel] Lund Univ, Geobiosphere Sci Ctr, Dept Phys Geog & Ecosyst Anal, SE-22362 Lund, Sweden; [Kurosu, Thomas P.; Chance, Kelly] Harvard Smithsonian Ctr Astrophys, Atom & Mol Phys Div, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Mueller, J. -F.; De Smedt, Isabelle; Van Roozendael, Michel] Belgian Inst Space Aeron, B-1180 Brussels, Belgium; [Karl, Thomas; Guenther, Alex] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [Mao, Jingqiu] Princeton Univ, Geophys Fluid Dynam Lab, Princeton, NJ 08628 USA; [Paulot, Fabien; Wennberg, Paul O.] CALTECH, Div Engn & Appl Sci, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Wang, Yuxuan] Tsinghua Univ, Minist Educ Key Lab Earth Syst Modeling, Ctr Earth Syst Sci, Inst Global Change Studies, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Yantosca, Robert M.] Harvard Univ, Div Engn & Appl Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Arneth, Almut] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Karlsruhe, Germany; [Chen, Dan] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Engn, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Wennberg, Paul O.] CALTECH, Div Geol & Planetary Sci, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA",University of Leicester; University of Edinburgh; Wageningen University & Research; Lund University; Harvard University; Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory; Smithsonian Institution; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Princeton University; California Institute of Technology; Tsinghua University; Harvard University; Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; Tsinghua University; California Institute of Technology,"Barkley, MP (corresponding author), Univ Leicester, Dept Phys & Astron, EOS Grp, Univ Rd, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England.",mpb14@le.ac.uk,"Chen, Dan/R-4486-2016; Yantosca, Robert M/F-7920-2014; Paulot, Fabien/C-1002-2011; Mao, Jingqiu/F-2511-2010; De Smedt, Isabelle/AAP-5377-2021; Wang, Yuxuan/C-6902-2014; Barkley, Michael/AAT-6494-2021; Wennberg, Paul O/A-5460-2012; Guenther, Alex B/B-1617-2008; kurosu, thomas p/F-8040-2013; Palmer, Paul I/F-7008-2010; Karl, Thomas/D-1891-2009; Arneth, Almut/B-2702-2013","Chen, Dan/0000-0002-6317-0707; Yantosca, Robert M/0000-0003-3781-1870; Mao, Jingqiu/0000-0002-4774-9751; De Smedt, Isabelle/0000-0002-3541-7725; Wang, Yuxuan/0000-0002-1649-6974; Wennberg, Paul O/0000-0002-6126-3854; Guenther, Alex B/0000-0001-6283-8288; Palmer, Paul I/0000-0002-1487-0969; Karl, Thomas/0000-0003-2869-9426; Arneth, Almut/0000-0001-6616-0822; Chance, Kelly/0000-0002-7339-7577","NASA; Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/G013810/1, NE/D001471]; Swedish Research Council Formas; NERC [NE/G013810/2] Funding Source: UKRI; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/G013810/2] Funding Source: researchfish",NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Swedish Research Council Formas(Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council Formas); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),The authors would like to thank all members of the GABRIEL Science team for their provision of the aircraft data.

These biases are most pronounced during the winter season. We here employ ideal vertical profiles of temperature and wind from turbulence-resolving simulations to perform a priori studies of the first-order eddy-viscosity closure scheme employed in the ARPEGE/IFS model. This reveals that the coarse vertical resolution (31 layers) of the model cannot be expected to realistically resolve the Arctic stable boundary layer. The curvature of the Arctic inversion and thus also the vertical turbulent-exchange processes cannot be reproduced by the coarse vertical mesh employed. To investigate how turbulent vertical exchange processes in the Arctic boundary layer are represented by the model parameterization, a simulation with high vertical resolution (90 layers in total) in the lower troposphere is performed. Results from the model simulations are validated against data from the ERA-40 reanalysis. The dependence of the surface air temperature on surface winds, surface energy fluxes, free atmosphere stability and boundary layer height is investigated. The coarse-resolution run reveals considerable biases in these parameters, and in their physical relations to surface air temperature. In the simulation with fine vertical resolution, these biases are clearly reduced. The physical relation between governing parameters for the vertical turbulent-exchange processes improves in comparison with ERA-40 data.","[Byrkjedal, Oyvind] Kjeller Vindtekn, N-2027 Kjeller, Norway; [Esau, Igor] Nansen Environm & Remote Sensing Ctr, N-5006 Bergen, Norway; Univ Bergen, Inst Geophys, N-5007 Bergen, Norway",Nansen Environmental & Remote Sensing Center (NERSC); University of Bergen,"Byrkjedal, O (corresponding author), Kjeller Vindtekn, POB 122, N-2027 Kjeller, Norway.",oyvind.byrkjedal@vindteknikk.no,"Esau, Igor/AAG-9769-2021; Esau, Igor/C-6298-2008","Esau, Igor/0000-0003-4122-6340; Esau, Igor/0000-0003-4122-6340",,,,,47,21,21,1,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0930-7575,1432-0894,,CLIM DYNAM,Clim.

In India, areas with high population are exposed to heavy rainfall events and their associated risks. Indian monsoon rainfall simulation and prediction at various spatial and temporal scales are challenging scientific tasks for the weather/climate modelling community. Skilful short-and medium-range predictions of rainfall from global numerical models during monsoons are highly desirable for various hydro-meteorological applications, including flood forecasting. For recent years (e.g. 2000-2016) higher resolution global advanced assimilation-forecast systems have resulted in improved medium-range rainfall forecasts. These model rainfall forecasts potentially could be used in hydro-meteorological applications including water-related disaster management/planning. In this study, deterministic rainfall forecasts from two state-of-the-art global models (from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction and the Met Office) were evaluated against observed rainfall for the Indian summer monsoon season. Objective skill scores such as mean, bias, correlation co-efficient, mean absolute error and root-mean-square error from Day 1 to Day 5 were examined for the monsoon season over India and at seven major river basins within India for 2013. It was seen that both of the models had useful skill for different regions and basins. For the Indus and Krishna basins, even the Day 5 forecasts were seen to be skilful. In general, the Met Office Day 5 forecasts were more skilful at all seven river basins. Finally, rainfall forecasts from the latest higher resolution Met Office Global Unified Model (implemented in July 2014) were compared with its immediate predecessor to document any further improvement during the monsoon period over India. It was seen that, at the medium range, the newer version of the Met Office model simulated Indian monsoon rainfall more realistically than the previous versions, with much reduced biases in the core monsoon trough region.","[Prakash, Satya; Mitra, Ashis K.; Momin, I.

However, the attribution of the observed warming to human activities remains less clear, particularly because of the apparent slow-down in warming since the late 1990s. Here we analyse radiative forcing and temperature time series with state-of-the-art statistical methods to address this question without climate model simulations. We show that long-term trends in total radiative forcing and temperatures have largely been determined by atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations, and modulated by other radiative factors. We identify a pronounced increase in the growth rates of both temperatures and radiative forcing around 1960, which marks the onset of sustained global warming. Our analyses also reveal a contribution of human interventions to two periods when global warming slowed down. Our statistical analysis suggests that the reduction in the emissions of ozone-depleting substances under the Montreal Protocol, as well as a reduction in methane emissions, contributed to the lower rate of warming since the 1990s. Furthermore, we identify a contribution from the two world wars and the Great Depression to the documented cooling in the mid-twentieth century, through lower carbon dioxide emissions. We conclude that reductions in greenhouse gas emissions are effective in slowing the rate of warming in the short term.","[Estrada, Francisco; Martinez-Lopez, Benjamin] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Ctr Ciencias Atmosfera, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico; [Estrada, Francisco] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Perron, Pierre] Boston Univ, Dept Econ, Boston, MA 02215 USA",Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Boston University,"Estrada, F (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Ctr Ciencias Atmosfera, Ciudad Univ, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico.",feporrua@atmosfera.unam.mx,"Estrada, Francisco/H-1104-2015","Estrada Porrua, Francisco/0000-0002-1403-2180; Martinez Lopez, Benjamin/0000-0003-0803-3854",Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia [CONACYT-310026]; PASPA DGAPA of the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico,Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)); PASPA DGAPA of the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico,"F.E. acknowledges financial support from the Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (http://www.conacyt.gob.mx) under grant CONACYT-310026, as well as from PASPA DGAPA of the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico.",,34,82,83,0,54,NATURE PORTFOLIO,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",1752-0894,1752-0908,,NAT GEOSCI,Nat.

Several pedotransfer functions have been derived in the last few decades, providing divergent estimates of soil hydraulic parameters. In this study, we quantify how uncertainties embedded in using different pedotransfer functions propagate to ecosystem dynamics, including simulated hydrological fluxes and vegetation response to water availability. Using a state-of-the-art ecohydrological model applied at 79 sites worldwide, we show that uncertainties related to pedotransfer functions can affect both hydrological and vegetation dynamics. Uncertainties in evapotranspiration, plant productivity, and vegetation structure, quantified as leaf area, are in the order of similar to 10% at annual time scales. Runoff and groundwater recharge uncertainties are one order of magnitude larger. All uncertainties are largely amplified when small-scale topography is taken into account in a distributed domain, especially for water-limited ecosystems with low permeability soils. Overall, pedotransfer function related uncertainties for a given soil type are higher than uncertainties across soil types in both hydrological and ecosystem dynamics. The magnitude of uncertainties is climate-dependent but not soil type-dependent. Evapotranspiration, vegetation structure, and plant productivity uncertainties are higher in water-limited semiarid climates, whereas groundwater recharge uncertainties are higher in climates where potential evapotranspiration is comparable to precipitation.","[Paschalis, Athanasios; Guo, Yanran] Imperial Coll London, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, London, England; [Bonetti, Sara] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Sch Architecture Civil & Environm Engn, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Fatichi, Simone] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Singapore, Singapore",Imperial College London; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne; National University of Singapore,"Paschalis, A (corresponding author), Imperial Coll London, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, London, England.",a.paschalis@imperial.ac.uk,,", Athanasios/0000-0003-4833-9962; Bonetti, Sara/0000-0001-8856-3438; Fatichi, Simone/0000-0003-1361-6659",NERC [NE/S003495/1]; National University of Singapore through the project Bridging scales from below: The role of heterogeneities in the global water and carbon budgets [22-3637-A0001],NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); National University of Singapore through the project Bridging scales from below: The role of heterogeneities in the global water and carbon budgets,"AP acknowledges funding from NERC (NE/S003495/1).

However, differences in model structure and parameterizations, in both the vegetation and fire components of these models, could influence overall model performance, and to date there has been limited evaluation of how well different models represent various aspects of fire regimes. The Fire Model Intercomparison Project (FireMIP) is coordinating the evaluation of state-of-the-art global fire models, in order to improve projections of fire characteristics and fire impacts on ecosystems and human societies in the context of global environmental change. Here we perform a systematic evaluation of historical simulations made by nine FireMIP models to quantify their ability to reproduce a range of fire and vegetation benchmarks. The FireMIP models simulate a wide range in global annual total burnt area (39-536 Mha) and global annual fire carbon emission (0.91-4.75 PgC yr(-1)) for modern conditions (2002-2012), but most of the range in burnt area is within observational uncertainty (345-468 Mha). Benchmarking scores indicate that seven out of nine FireMIP models are able to represent the spatial pattern in burnt area. The models also reproduce the seasonality in burnt area reasonably well but struggle to simulate fire season length and are largely unable to represent interannual variations in burnt area. However, models that represent cropland fires see improved simulation of fire seasonality in the Northern Hemisphere. The three FireMIP models which explicitly simulate individual fires are able to reproduce the spatial pattern in number of fires, but fire sizes are too small in key regions, and this results in an underestimation of burnt area. The correct representation of spatial and seasonal patterns in vegetation appears to correlate with a better representation of burnt area. The two older fire models included in the FireMIP ensemble (LPJ-GUESS-GlobFIRM, MC2) clearly perform less well globally than other models, but it is difficult to distinguish between the remaining ensemble members; some of these models are better at representing certain aspects of the fire regime; none clearly outperforms all other models across the full range of variables assessed.","[Hantson, Stijn; Arneth, Almut; Rabin, Sam S.] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Atmospher Environm Res, Garmisch Partenkirchen, Germany; [Hantson, Stijn] Univ Calif Irvine, Geospatial Data Solut Ctr, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Kelley, Douglas, I] UK Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Wallingford OX10 8BB, Oxon, England; [Harrison, Sandy P.] Univ Reading, Sch Archaeol Geog & Environm Sci, Reading, Berks, England; [Archibald, Sally] Univ Witwatersrand, Ctr African Ecol, Sch Anim Plant & Environm Sci, Private Bag X3, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa; [Bachelet, Dominique; Sheehan, Tim] Oregon State Univ, Biol & Ecol Engn, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Forrest, Matthew; Hickler, Thomas; Lasslop, Gitta] Senckenberg Biodivers & Climate Res Inst BiK F, Senckenberganlage 25, D-60325 Frankfurt, Germany; [Hickler, Thomas] Goethe Univ, Inst Phys Geog, Altenhoferallee 1, D-60438 Frankfurt, Germany; [Li, Fang] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Int Ctr Climate & Environm Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Mangeon, Stephane; Voulgarakis, Apostolos] Imperial Coll London, Dept Phys, London, England; [Melton, Joe R.] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Climate Res Div, Victoria, BC V8W 2Y2, Canada; [Nieradzik, Lars] Lund Univ, Dept Phys Geog & Ecosyst Sci, S-22362 Lund, Sweden; [Prentice, I.

In this study, shortwave cloud radiative forcing (SWCF) over major stratus regions is evaluated for Atmospheric Models Intercomparison Project (AMIP)-type simulations of models involved in the third and fifth phases of the Coupled Models Intercomparison Project (CMIP3 and CMIP5). Over stratus regions, large deviations in both climatological mean and seasonal cycle of SWCF are found among the models. An ambient field sorted by dynamic (vertical motion) and thermodynamic (inversion strength or stability) regimes is constructed and used to measure the response of SWCF to large-scale controls. In marine boundary layer regions, despite both CMIP3 and CMIP5 models being able to capture well the center and range of occurrence frequency for the ambient field, most of the models fail to simulate the dependence of SWCF on boundary layer inversion and the insensitivity of SWCF to vertical motion. For eastern China, there are large differences even in the simulated ambient fields. Moreover, almost no model can reproduce intense SWCF in rising motion and high stability regimes. It is also found that models with a finer grid resolution have no evident superiority than their lower resolution versions. The uncertainties relating to SWCF in state-of-the-art models may limit their performance in IPCC experiments.","[Zhang Yi] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, State Key Lab Numer Modeling Atmospher Sci & Geop, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Zhang Yi] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Li Jian] China Meteorol Adm, Chinese Acad Meteorol Sci, State Key Lab Severe Weather, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; China Meteorological Administration; Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences (CAMS); Chinese Academy of Sciences","Li, J (corresponding author), China Meteorol Adm, Chinese Acad Meteorol Sci, State Key Lab Severe Weather, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",lijian@cams.cma.gov.cn,"Zhang, Yi/L-7562-2019; Zhang, Yi/A-1217-2014; LI, Jian/E-3497-2018","Zhang, Yi/0000-0002-6823-7915; Zhang, Yi/0000-0002-6823-7915; LI, Jian/0000-0001-7223-0022",Major National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program) on Global Change [2010CB951902]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41221064]; Basic Scientific Research and Operation Foundation of CAMS [2010Z003],Major National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program) on Global Change(National Basic Research Program of China); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Basic Scientific Research and Operation Foundation of CAMS,"This research was supported by the Major National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program) on Global Change (Grant No. 2010CB951902), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41221064), and the Basic Scientific Research and Operation Foundation of CAMS (Grant No. 2010Z003).

However, observation- and modeling-based estimates of carbon turnover and its response to climate are still characterized by large uncertainties. In this study, by assessing the apparent whole ecosystem carbon turnover times (tau) as the ratio between carbon stocks and fluxes, we provide an update of this ecosystem level diagnostic and its associated uncertainties in high spatial resolution (0.083 degrees) using multiple, state-of-the-art, observation-based datasets of soil organic carbon stock (C-soil), vegetation biomass (C-veg) and gross primary productivity (GPP). Using this new ensemble of data, we estimated the global median tau to be 43(-7)(+7) yr (median(-difference to percentile 25)(+difference to percentile 75)) when the full soil is considered, in contrast to limiting it to 1 m depth. Only considering the top 1 m of soil carbon in circumpolar regions (assuming maximum active layer depth is up to 1 m) yields a global median tau of 37(-6)(+3) yr, which is longer than the previous estimates of 23(-4)(+7) yr (Carvalhais et al., 2014). We show that the difference is mostly attributed to changes in global C-soil estimates. C-soil accounts for approximately 84 % of the total uncertainty in global tau estimates; GPP also contributes significantly (15 %), whereas C veg contributes only marginally (less than 1 %) to the total uncertainty. The high uncertainty in C-soil is reflected in the large range across state-of-the-art data products, in which full-depth C-soil spans between 3362 and 4792 PgC. The uncertainty is especially high in circumpolar regions with an uncertainty of 50 % and a low spatial correlation between the different datasets (0.2 < r < 0.5) when compared to other regions (0.6 < r < 0.8). These uncertainties cast a shadow on current global estimates of tau in circumpolar regions, for which further geographical representativeness and clarification on variations in C-soil with soil depth are needed. Different GPP estimates contribute significantly to the uncertainties of tau mainly in semiarid and arid regions, whereas C-veg causes the uncertainties of tau in the subtropics and tropics. In spite of the large uncertainties, our findings reveal that the latitudinal gradients of tau are consistent across different datasets and soil depths. The current results show a strong ensemble agreement on the negative correlation between tau and temperature along latitude that is stronger in temperate zones (30-60 degrees; N) than in the subtropical and tropical zones (30 degrees S-30 degrees N). Additionally, while the strength of the tau-precipitation correlation was dependent on the C-soil data source, the latitudinal gradients also agree among different ensemble members. Overall, and despite the large variation in tau, we identified robust features in the spatial patterns of tau that emerge beyond the differences stemming from the data-driven estimates of C-soil, C-veg and GPP. These robust patterns, and associated uncertainties, can be used to infer tau-climate relationships and for constraining contemporaneous behavior of Earth system models (ESMs), which could contribute to uncertainty reductions in future projections of the carbon cycle-climate feedback. The dataset of tau is openly available at https://doi.org/10.17871/bgitau.201911 (Fan et al., 2019).","[Fan, Naixin; Koirala, Sujan; Reichstein, Markus; Ahrens, Bernhard; Weber, Ulrich; Carvalhais, Nuno] Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, Hans Knoll Str 10, D-07745 Jena, Germany; [Thurner, Martin] Senckenberg Gesell Naturforsch, Biodivers & Climate Res Ctr BiK, Senckenberganlage 25, D-60325 Frankfurt, Germany; [Avitabile, Valerio] Joint Res Ctr, European Commiss, Via E Fermi 2749, I-21027 Ispra, Italy; [Santoro, Maurizio] Gamma Remote Sensing, CH-3073 Gumlingen, Switzerland; [Carvalhais, Nuno] Univ Nova Lisboa, Fac Ciencias & Tecnol, Dept Ciencias & Engn Ambiente, DCEA,FCT, P-2829516 Caparica, Portugal",Max Planck Society; Senckenberg Gesellschaft fur Naturforschung (SGN); European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site; GAMMA Remote Sensing AG; Universidade Nova de Lisboa,"Fan, NX; Carvalhais, N (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, Hans Knoll Str 10, D-07745 Jena, Germany.;Carvalhais, N (corresponding author), Univ Nova Lisboa, DCEA,FCT, Fac Ciencias & Tecnol, Dept Ciencias & Engn Ambiente, P-2829516 Caparica, Portugal.",nfan@bgc-jena.mpg.de; ncarval@bgc-jena.mpg.de,"Reichstein, Markus/A-7494-2011; Ahrens, Bernhard/P-1790-2018; Thurner, Martin/K-4854-2017","Reichstein, Markus/0000-0001-5736-1112; Thurner, Martin/0000-0003-2362-5161; Carvalhais, Nuno/0000-0003-0465-1436; Fan, Naixin/0000-0001-7370-5843",International Max Planck Research School for Global Biogeochemical Cycle; European Space Agency [4000113100/14/I-NB],International Max Planck Research School for Global Biogeochemical Cycle; European Space Agency(European Space AgencyEuropean Commission),This research has been supported by the International Max Planck Research School for Global Biogeochemical Cycle and the European Space Agency (grant no.

Despite the critical dependency of the region's agricultural and societal activities to climate variability and change, no comprehensive water and energy budget assessment has yet been developed for this drought-prone region. This study represents the first attempt at developing a comprehensive climatology of water and energy budgets for the SRB. Different observed, remotely-sensed, (re-)analyzed and modeled datasets were used to obtain independent estimates of the budgets. In particular, flux measurements from the Boreal Ecosystem Research and Monitoring Sites (BERMS) Coordinated Enhanced Observing Period (CEOP) reference site provide valuable validation data for the surface flux assessments. Budget results for the SRB are compared to those assessed for the Mackenzie River Basin to gain insights into the differences in water and energy cycling, and challenges in their quantifications, for these two neighboring major basins in North America. Apart from the development of state-of-the-art budget estimates for the SRB, the relative merits of current models, data assimilation systems and global blended datasets in representing aspects of the water and energy cycle of this semi-arid region were also assessed. Although some of the assessed component budgets compared quite well with observations, magnitudes of the residuals in balancing the budgets are often comparable to the budget terms themselves in all the analysis datasets, suggesting that substantial improvements to the models and observations are needed before we can vastly improve the assessment of water and energy budgets for the region.","Environm Canada, Div Climate Res, Downsview, ON M3H 5T4, Canada",Environment & Climate Change Canada,"Szeto, KK (corresponding author), Environm Canada, Div Climate Res, 4905 Dufferin St, Downsview, ON M3H 5T4, Canada.",kit.szeto@ec.gc.ca,,,,,,,34,16,17,0,5,METEOROLOGICAL SOC JAPAN,TOKYO,"C/O JAPAN METEOROLOGICAL AGENCY 1-3-4 OTE-MACHI, CHIYODA-KU, TOKYO, 100-0004, JAPAN",0026-1165,2186-9057,,J METEOROL SOC JPN,J.

They are, however, also arguably failing humanity when their impact is measured against the level of progress being made in stimulating the societal changes needed to address challenges like climate change. In this research we used a novel futures-oriented and participatory approach that asked what future envisioned knowledge systems might need to look like and how we might get there. Findings suggest that envisioned future systems will need to be much more collaborative, open, diverse, egalitarian, and able to work with values and systemic issues. They will also need to go beyond producing knowledge about our world to generating wisdom about how to act within it. To get to envisioned systems we will need to rapidly scale methodological innovations, connect innovators, and creatively accelerate learning about working with intractable challenges. We will also need to create new funding schemes, a global knowledge commons, and challenge deeply held assumptions. To genuinely be a creative force in supporting longevity of human and non-human life on our planet, the shift in knowledge systems will probably need to be at the scale of the enlightenment and speed of the scientific and technological revolution accompanying the second World War. This will require bold and strategic action from governments, scientists, civic society and sustained transformational intent.","[Fazey, Ioan] Univ York, Dept Geog & Environm, Wentworth Way, York YO105NG, N Yorkshire, England;

In this study, the diurnal cycles of summertime precipitation from 21 CMIP6 historical simulations are evaluated with the NASA IMERG data via the diurnal harmonic amplitude and phase from the Fourier analysis in seven regional monsoon systems: Northern and Southern Africa monsoons, South Asia monsoon, East Asia monsoon, Australia monsoon, and North and South America monsoons. Particularly, we focus on four subregions including ocean, coastal ocean, land, and coastal land considering the different underlying physical processes. It is found that the CMIP6 historical simulations perform fairly well on reproducing the diurnal cycle of precipitation over ocean and coastal ocean, while the simulated diurnal harmonic phase and amplitude over land and coastal land show larger biases and model spread compared to biases over ocean and coastal ocean. The simulation of precipitation diurnal cycle is substantially improved in the multi-model mean of both CMIP6 historical and CMIP6 AMIP simulations compared with that of CMIP5 historical simulations. But the model bias of precipitation diurnal cycle is in general similar between CMIP6 AMIP and CMIP6 historical simulations, which suggests that the impact of the interactive ocean on the simulated diurnal precipitation averaged over a large domain is generally minor. The influence of model resolution on the diurnal cycle is shown in mixed directions across various subregions, and significant improvement from the low- to high-resolution models is only notable over coastal ocean.","[Tao, Cheng; Xie, Shaocheng; Lee, Jiwoo; Ma, Hsi-Yen; Zhang, Chengzhu] Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, Atmospher Earth & Energy Div L103, Livermore, CA 94550 USA; [Tang, Shuaiqi] Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Richland, WA 99352 USA; [Lin, Wuyin] Brookhaven Natl Lab, Brookhaven, NY USA",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Pacific Northwest National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Brookhaven National Laboratory,"Tao, C (corresponding author), Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, Atmospher Earth & Energy Div L103, Livermore, CA 94550 USA.",tao4@llnl.gov,,,"U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC52-07NA27344, DE-AC05-76RL01830, DE-SC0012704]",U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)),"This work was funded by the U.S. Department of Energy (DE-AC52-07NA27344, DE-AC05-76RL01830, and DE-SC0012704).",,67,0,0,7,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0930-7575,1432-0894,,CLIM DYNAM,Clim.

Because it is not possible to survey the many sites in this remote part of the world, new methods are urgently needed to detect and assess the potential degradation. Here, we investigate organic deposits at seven archaeological sites located along the dominating west-east climatic gradient in West Greenland. We show that, regardless of age, depositional history and environmental conditions, all organic deposits are highly vulnerable to degradation. A state-of-the-art model that simulates the effect of future climate change on degradation indicates that 30-70% of the archaeological fraction of organic carbon (OC) could disappear within the next 80 years. This range reflects the variation within the climatic gradient and the future climate scenario applied (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5). All archaeological deposits are expected to experience a substantial loss, but the most rapid degradation seems to occur in the continental inland areas of the region, dominated by dry and warm summers. This suggests that organic remains from the Norse Viking Age settlers are especially under threat in the coming years.","[Hollesen, Jorgen; Matthiesen, Henning; Fenger-Nielsen, Rasmus] Natl Museum Denmark, Environm Archaeol & Mat Sci, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark; [Hollesen, Jorgen; Fenger-Nielsen, Rasmus; Westergaard-Nielsen, Andreas; Elberling, Bo] Univ Copenhagen, Ctr Permafrost CENPERM, Dept Geosci & Nat Resource Management IGN, Oster Voldgade 10, DK-1350 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Abermann, Jakob] Asiaq, Greenland Survey, Postbox 1003, GL-3900 Nuuk, Greenland; [Abermann, Jakob] Graz Univ, Dept Geog & Reg Sci, Heinrichstr 36, A-8010 Graz, Austria",University of Copenhagen; University of Graz,"Hollesen, J (corresponding author), Natl Museum Denmark, Environm Archaeol & Mat Sci, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark.;Hollesen, J (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen, Ctr Permafrost CENPERM, Dept Geosci & Nat Resource Management IGN, Oster Voldgade 10, DK-1350 Copenhagen, Denmark.",joergen.hollesen@natmus.dk,"Elberling, Bo/M-4000-2014","Elberling, Bo/0000-0002-6023-885X; Matthiesen, Henning/0000-0003-2618-7021; Westergaard-Nielsen, Andreas/0000-0003-1021-0530",VELUX FONDEN [33813]; Danish National Research Foundation [CENPERM DNRF100],VELUX FONDEN(Velux Fonden); Danish National Research Foundation(Danmarks Grundforskningsfond),"We gratefully acknowledge the financial support from VELUX FONDEN (33813) and Danish National Research Foundation (CENPERM DNRF100).

The model known as Polar WRF is tested for land areas with a western Arctic grid that has 25-km resolution. This work serves as preparation for the high-resolution Arctic System Reanalysis of the years 2000-10. The model is based upon WRF version 3.0.1.1, with improvements to the Noah land surface model and snow/ice treatment. Simulations consist of a series of 48-h integrations initialized daily at 0000 UTC, with the initial 24 h taken as spinup for atmospheric hydrology and boundary layer processes. Soil temperature and moisture that have a much slower spinup than the atmosphere are cycled from 48-h output of earlier runs. Arctic conditions are simulated for a winter-to-summer seasonal cycle from 15 November 2006 to 1 August 2007. Simulation results are compared with a variety of observations from several Alaskan sites, with emphasis on the North Slope. Polar WRF simulation results show good agreement with most near-surface observations. Warm temperature biases are found for winter and summer. A sensitivity experiment with reduced soil heat conductivity, however, improves simulation of near-surface temperature, ground heat flux, and soil temperature during winter. There is a marked deficit in summer cloud cover over land with excessive incident shortwave radiation. The cloud deficit may result from anomalous vertical mixing of moisture by the turbulence parameterization. The new snow albedo parameterization for WRF 3.1.1 is successfully tested for snowmelt over the North Slope of Alaska.","[Hines, Keith M.; Bromwich, David H.; Bai, Le-Sheng] Ohio State Univ, Polar Meteorol Grp, Byrd Polar Res Ctr, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Barlage, Michael] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [Slater, Andrew G.] Univ Colorado, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Bromwich, David H.] Ohio State Univ, Atmospher Sci Program, Dept Geog, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Hines, KM (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, Polar Meteorol Grp, Byrd Polar Res Ctr, 1090 Carmack Rd, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",hines.91@osu.edu,"Bromwich, David/C-9225-2016; Slater, Andrew/B-4666-2008","Slater, Andrew/0000-0003-0480-8560; SLATER, ANDREW/0000-0002-4009-4844","NSF [ARC-0733023, ARC-0733058, ARC-0732986]; DOE [GRT00008066]; UCAR [S01-22961]; Ohio Supercomputer Center, state of Ohio [PAS0400]","NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); DOE(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); UCAR; Ohio Supercomputer Center, state of Ohio","This research is supported by NSF IPY Grants ARC-0733023, ARC-0733058, and ARC-0732986, DOE Award GRT00008066, and UCAR Sub-contract S01-22961.

Fluctuations can be induced by weather conditions, management decisions, weeds, diseases, and pests. Although an explicit quantification and deeper understanding of weather-induced crop-yield variability is essential for adaptation strategies, so far it has only been addressed by empirical models. Here, we provide conservative estimates of the fraction of reported national yield variabilities that can be attributed to weather by state-of-the-art, process-based crop model simulations. We find that observed weather variations can explain more than 50% of the variability in wheat yields in Australia, Canada, Spain, Hungary, and Romania. For maize, weather sensitivities exceed 50% in seven countries, including the United States. The explained variance exceeds 50% for rice in Japan and South Korea and for soy in Argentina. Avoiding water stress by simulating yields assuming full irrigation shows that water limitation is a major driver of the observed variations in most of these countries. Identifying the mechanisms leading to crop-yield fluctuations is not only fundamental for dampening fluctuations, but is also important in the context of the debate on the attribution of loss and damage to climate change. Since process-based crop models not only account for weather influences on crop yields, but also provide options to represent human-management measures, they could become essential tools for differentiating these drivers, and for exploring options to reduce future yield fluctuations.","[Frieler, Katja; Schauberger, Bernhard; Mueller, Christoph; Schaphoff, Sibyll; Schewe, Jacob; Warszawski, Lila; Levermann, Anders] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Potsdam, Germany; [Arneth, Almut; Pugh, Thomas A.

Debate over the scale and potential impact of anthropogenic global warming is one of the dominant narratives of the twenty-first century. Predicting future climates and determining how environment and society might be affected by climate change are global issues of social, economic and political importance. They require responses from different research communities and necessitate closer inter-disciplinary working relationships for an integrated approach. Improving the datasets required for long-term climate models is an important part of this process. Establishing a multi-disciplinary dialogue and approach to DARE activities is increasingly being recognised as the best way to achieve this. This paper focuses on the recovery of the long-term instrumental weather observations used for models and reconstructions of the climate over the past two-hundred years. Written from the perspective of an historian working in the field, it does not seek to explore the reconstructions themselves but the process of data gathering, advocating a closer working relationship between the arts, social sciences, and sciences to extend the geographic and temporal coverage of extant datasets. This is especially important for regions where data gaps exist currently. First, it will offer a justification for extending data recovery activities for Southeast Asia and the China Seas region. Second, it will offer a brief overview of the data recovery projects currently operating in that area and the types of historic source material that are used. Third, it will explore the work currently being undertaken for Southeast Asia and China under the Atmospheric Circulation Reconstructions over the Earth initiative as an example of a successful cross-disciplinary program. Finally, it will argue the importance of advertising DARE activities across different fields and the benefits of a more joined-up discussion on potential data sources by exploring the use of the resource by the wider academic community.","[Williamson, Fiona] Natl Univ Singapore, Asia Res Inst, 10 Kent Ridge Crescent, Singapore 119260, Singapore",National University of Singapore,"Williamson, F (corresponding author), Natl Univ Singapore, Asia Res Inst, 10 Kent Ridge Crescent, Singapore 119260, Singapore.",ariwfc@nus.edu.sg,,"Williamson, Fiona/0000-0002-1203-8546","Asia Pacific Network for Global Change CAPaBLE scheme [CBA2012-FP03, CBA2014-01CMY]; Singapore Ministry of Education Academic Research Fund Tier 2 grant [MOE2014-T2-1-017]","Asia Pacific Network for Global Change CAPaBLE scheme; Singapore Ministry of Education Academic Research Fund Tier 2 grant(Ministry of Education, Singapore)","The author wishes to acknowledge the Asia Pacific Network for Global Change CAPaBLE scheme for research funds 2012-14 under project code CBA2012-FP03-D'Arrigo and CBA2014-01CMY-D'Arrigo: ACRE SE Asia-Towards New Weather and Climate Baselines for Assessing Weather and Climate Extremes, Impacts and Risks over SE Asia.

CHEESMAN; IN-VITRO REGENERATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; GENETIC DIVERSITY; GENOME SEQUENCE; CROP; MUSACEAE; WILD; BANANA; FOOD,"Background Enset (Ensete ventricosum, Musaceae) is an African crop that currently provides the staple food for approx. 20 million Ethiopians. Whilst wild enset grows over much of East and Southern Africa and the genus extends across Asia to China, it has only ever been domesticated in the Ethiopian Highlands. Here, smallholder farmers cultivate hundreds of landraces across diverse climatic and agroecological systems. Scope Enset has several important food security traits. It grows over a relatively wide range of conditions, is somewhat drought-tolerant, and can be harvested at any time of the year, over several years. It provides an important dietary starch source, as well as fibres, medicines, animal fodder, roofing and packaging. It stabilizes soils and microclimates and has significant cultural importance. In contrast to the other cultivated species in the family Musaceae (banana), enset has received relatively little research attention. Here, we review and critically evaluate existing research, outline available genomic and germplasm resources, aspects of pathology, and explore avenues for crop development. Conclusion Enset is an underexploited starch crop with significant potential in Ethiopia and beyond. Research is lacking in several key areas: empirical studies on the efficacy of current agronomic practices, the genetic diversity of landraces, approaches to systematic breeding, characterization of existing and emerging diseases, adaptability to new ranges and land-use change, the projected impact of climate change, conservation of crop wild relatives, by-products or co-products or non-starch uses, and the enset microbiome. We also highlight the limited availability of enset germplasm in living collections and seedbanks, and the lack of knowledge of reproductive and germination biology needed to underpin future breeding. By reviewing the current state of the art in enset research and identifying gaps and opportunities, we hope to catalyse the development and sustainable exploitation of this neglected starch crop.","[Borrell, James S.; Davis, Aaron P.; Willis, Kathy; Demissew, Sebsebe; Wilkin, Paul] Royal Bot Gardens, Richmond TW9 3AE, Surrey, England; [Biswas, Manosh K.; Goodwin, Mark; Schwarzacher, Trude; Heslop-Harrison, J.

Additionally, some technical details of the network are described, as well as variables measured and some meta information presented, which is expected to be useful for future users of the observational database. A strong emphasis is made on showing the observational methods and protocols evolution, as it will help researchers to understand the sources of errors, data gaps and the final stage of the network. This paper summarizes mostly the common sources of errors when designing and operating a small network of this kind, so it can be useful for individual researchers and small size groups that undertake a similar task on their own. Strengths and weaknesses of some of the variables measured are discussed and some basic calculations are made in order to show the potential of the database and to anticipate future deeper climatological analyses over the area.

However, people are able to perceive the warm infrared component of the solar radiation by means of thermal-(dis)comfort. This study investigated the potentiality of perceived outdoor heat stress as a valuable proxy for the unperceivable effect of UV-induced risk of erythema in a Mediterranean city. Meteorological data and UVB (280-320 nm) measurements were obtained for the 2004-2012 period by a weather station located in the municipality of Florence. Continuous measurements of erythemally effective UV (UVEry) were performed by means of a broadband temperature-corrected radiometer with the spectral response close to the erythemal action spectrum. Hourly UVEry doses were expressed as Standard Erythemal Doses (SEDs). The newly developed Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI), that represents the state-of-the-art of outdoor thermal (dis)comfort evaluation, was also assessed. Descriptive analyses of the hourly distribution per month of the frequencies of days with heat stress and UVEry exceeding 2.0, 3.0, 4.5 and 6.0 SEDs were carried out based on the general skin-type characteristics. The association between UVEry and UTCI was analyzed by a two-way contingency table approach. The probability of UVEry exceeding specific SED thresholds when heat stress occurs was often significantly higher than the same probability when no heat stress is perceived. Furthermore, increased magnitudes of the ratios, ranging from the very sensitive to the minimally sensitive skin types, were also found. However, during several months, too many days occur without any signs of heat discomfort, even when people may be exposed to relevant doses of harmful UVEry for the skin of various phototypes. These findings underlie the need for public health authorities to provide differentiated advice per month in relation to. potential UV skin damage in the city of Florence. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Overall, we show that, counterintuitively, the direct and diffuse irradiances predicted by solar radiation models that use empirically adjusted fixed aerosol extinction may be more accurate than more sophisticated radiative transfer models that require inputs of aerosols. We conclude that, compared to ground observations, the mean absolute error in satellite-retrieved aerosol optical depth over the U.S., and possibly elsewhere, should be reduced to less than 0.025 aerosol optical depth unit to assure improvement over the predictions of a simpler, aerosol-insensitive radiation model.","[Ruiz-Arias, Jose A.; Santos-Alamillos, Francisco J.; Pozo-Vazquez, David] Univ Jaen, Dept Phys, Jaen, Spain; [Gueymard, Christian A.] Solar Consulting Serv, Colebrook, NH USA",Universidad de Jaen,"Ruiz-Arias, JA (corresponding author), Univ Jaen, Dept Phys, Jaen, Spain.",jararias@ujaen.es,"Gueymard, Christian A/O-7286-2014; Santos-Alamillos, Francisco J/D-1611-2017; Ruiz-Arias, Jose Antonio/C-8630-2019; Pozo-Vazquez, David/L-7349-2014","Gueymard, Christian A/0000-0003-0362-4655; Santos-Alamillos, Francisco J/0000-0001-7592-9242; Ruiz-Arias, Jose Antonio/0000-0003-4220-1751; Pozo-Vazquez, David/0000-0002-1135-4926",Marie Curie Action within the Seventh European Community Framework Programme [PIOF-GA-2010-273648]; Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [CGL2011-30377-C02-01]; FEDER funds through the Junta de Andalucia [TEP-220]; NCAR's SunCast project - U.S. Department of Energy,"Marie Curie Action within the Seventh European Community Framework Programme; Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Ministry of Science and Innovation, Spain (MICINN)Spanish Government); FEDER funds through the Junta de Andalucia; NCAR's SunCast project - U.S. Department of Energy","The authors would like to thank the AERONET, BSRN, NOAA, and MODIS science teams and the ARM Climate Research Facility for establishing and maintaining the sites and data used in this investigation.

Forecasting the magnitude of such impact, with multiple environmental stressors changing simultaneously, is only possible with the help of process-based models. In order to assess their performance, such models require careful evaluation against measurements. However, direct comparison of model outputs against observational data is often not reliable, as models may provide the right answers due to the wrong reasons. This would severely hinder forecasting abilities under unprecedented climate conditions. Here, we present a methodology for model assessment, which supplements the traditional output-to-observation model validation. It evaluates model performance through its ability to reproduce observed seasonal changes of the most limiting environmental driver (MLED) for a given process, here daily gross primary productivity (GPP). We analyzed seasonal changes of the MLED for GPP in two contrasting pine forests, the Mediterranean Pinus halepensis Mill. Yatir (Israel) and the boreal Pinus sylvestris L. Hyytiala (Finland) from three years of eddy-covariance flux data. Then, we simulated the same period with a state-of-the-art process-based simulation model (LandscapeDNDC). Finally, we assessed if the model was able to reproduce both GPP observations and MLED seasonality. We found that the model reproduced the seasonality of GPP in both stands, but it was slightly overestimated without site-specific fine-tuning. Interestingly, although LandscapeDNDC properly captured the main MLED in Hyytiala (temperature) and in Yatir (soil water availability), it failed to reproduce high-temperature and high-vapor pressure limitations of GPP in Yatir during spring and summer. We deduced that the most likely reason for this divergence is an incomplete description of stomatal behavior. In summary, this study validates the MLED approach as a model evaluation tool, and opens up new possibilities for model improvement.","[Nadal-Sala, Daniel; Grote, Ruediger; Birami, Benjamin; Ruehr, Nadine K.] Karlsruhe Inst Technol KIT, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res Atmospher Environm Re, D-82467 Garmisch Partenkirchen, Germany; [Lintunen, Anna; Mammarella, Ivan; Salmon, Yann] Univ Helsinki, Fac Agr & Forestry, Inst Atmospher & Earth Syst Res Forest Sci, Latokartanonkaari 7,POB 27, Helsinki 00014, Finland; [Lintunen, Anna; Salmon, Yann] Univ Helsinki, Fac Sci, Inst Atmospher & Earth Syst Res Phys, POB 68,Gustaf Hallstromin Katu 2b, Helsinki 00014, Finland; [Preisler, Yakir] Harvard Univ, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, 16 Divin Ave, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Rotenberg, Eyal; Tatarinov, Fedor; Yakir, Dan] Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Environm Sci & Energy Res, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel",Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; University of Helsinki; University of Helsinki; Harvard University; Weizmann Institute of Science,"Nadal-Sala, D (corresponding author), Karlsruhe Inst Technol KIT, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res Atmospher Environm Re, D-82467 Garmisch Partenkirchen, Germany.",daniel.sala@kit.edu,"Lintunen, Anna/D-5942-2015; Tatarinov, Fyodor/AAR-8371-2021; Grote, Rüdiger/A-7350-2013; Mammarella, Ivan/E-7782-2016; Ruehr, Nadine K/C-6986-2011; Preisler, Yakir/ABF-8259-2020; Nadal-Sala, Daniel/AAC-2904-2020","Lintunen, Anna/0000-0002-1077-0784; Tatarinov, Fyodor/0000-0002-8338-6070; Grote, Rüdiger/0000-0001-6893-6890; Mammarella, Ivan/0000-0002-8516-3356; Ruehr, Nadine K/0000-0001-5989-7463; Preisler, Yakir/0000-0001-5861-8362; Nadal-Sala, Daniel/0000-0002-0935-6201; Salmon, Yann/0000-0003-4433-4021",German Research Foundation through its Emmy Noether Program [RU 1657/2-1]; German Research Foundation through its German-Israeli project cooperation program [CSCHM 2736/2-2],German Research Foundation through its Emmy Noether Program(German Research Foundation (DFG)); German Research Foundation through its German-Israeli project cooperation program,"This study was supported by the German Research Foundation through its Emmy Noether Program (RU 1657/2-1).

This study presents a comprehensive analysis of hourly surface observations, radiosonde measurements, and two latest state-of-the-art reanalysis products for the period 1979-2018 to examine the diurnal and vertical variations of DA and their connections with planetary boundary layer height (PBLH). It focuses on the Arabian Peninsula (AP), where observations are relatively abundant compared to the data scarce Sahara regions. Both observational and reanalysis data show that the diurnal cycle of surface warming rate depends, to some extent, inversely on the magnitude of climatological PBLH, and so DA has a distinct diurnal asymmetry with a stronger warming for a shallower PBLH. Results of upper air profiles reveal that DA is a bottom-heavy warming profile, which maximizes near the surface, decreases quickly with height, and is limited to the lower troposphere (> 700 hPa) and surface. The major PBLH biases could explain, at least partially, some of the diurnal and vertical warming/cooling biases in the reanalyses. These results suggest that besides the surface radiative forcing, the PBLH may play an important role in modulating the diurnal and vertical structure of DA over the AP through heat redistributing via turbulent mixing.","[Zhou, Liming] SUNY Albany, Dept Atmospher & Environm Sci, 1400 Washington Ave, Albany, NY 12222 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Albany,"Zhou, LM (corresponding author), SUNY Albany, Dept Atmospher & Environm Sci, 1400 Washington Ave, Albany, NY 12222 USA.",lzhou@albany.edu,"Zhou, Liming/A-2688-2012","Zhou, Liming/0000-0002-7009-2487","National Science Foundation [NSF AGS-1952745, AGS-1535426]",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),L.Z. was supported by National Science Foundation (NSF AGS-1952745 and AGS-1535426).,,95,4,4,2,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0930-7575,1432-0894,,CLIM DYNAM,Clim.

To understand how such systems can be designed, the current state-of-the-art is to apply techno-economical optimisation modelling with high spatial and temporal resolution. This approach relies on a number of climatic, technical and economic predictions that reach multiple decades into the future. In this paper, we investigate how the design of a fossil-free energy system for Europe is affected by changes in these assumptions. In particular, the synergy among renewable generators, power-to-heat converters, storage units, synthetic gas and transmission manage to deliver an affordable net-zero emissions system. We find that levelised cost of energy decreases due to heat savings, but not for global temperature increases. In both cases, heat pumps become less favourable as surplus electricity is more abundant for heating. Demand-side management through buildings' thermal inertia could shape the heating demand, yet has modest impact on the system configuration. Cost reductions of heat pumps impact resistive heaters substantially, but not the opposite. Cheaper power-to-gas could lower the need for thermal energy storage.","[Zhu, K.; Victoria, M.; Andresen, G. B.; Greiner, M.] Aarhus Univ, Dept Engn, Aarhus, Denmark; [Victoria, M.; Andresen, G.

Through conducting literature reviews, this study introduces a new method of regulating green buildings based on the temperature factor of local climates and the sequestration of carbon on green covers, besides integrating the results of monetary studies with judgments of experts in AHP technology to effectively reduce energy consumption and its consequences carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Taking into consideration the varying climatic conditions of the country, a separate quantitative model of assessing and ranking buildings has been developed for each of 600 cities considered; in such a way that it minimizes climatic disadvantages.

There is a bulk of research in the field of sustainable development applying it for testing implementation of carbon taxation, analyzing reductions of greenhouse gas (GHG), or addressing agricultural issues to work the land efficiently. The main objective of this review is to provide an exhaustive analysis of the literature about these models and their evolution over the last 50 years. The search was conducted in the main academic databases (Scopus and Web of Science), where 1353 articles were found from 1966 to 2019 related to the topic. The results of the descriptives, relational, and content analyses carried out show the current state of the-art, trends, subfields of research, and future gaps to fulfill. This article contributes to the literature that uses CGE models providing an overview of its different applications in the field of sustainability. It gives useful insights to academics who want to further research the field.","[Fabregat-Aibar, Laura; Ninerola, Angels; Pie, Laia] Univ Rovira & Virgili, Dept Business Management, Av Univ 1, Reus 43204, Spain",Universitat Rovira i Virgili,"Ninerola, A (corresponding author), Univ Rovira & Virgili, Dept Business Management, Av Univ 1, Reus 43204, Spain.",angels.ninerola@urv.cat,"Fabregat-Aibar, Laura/S-7580-2018","Fabregat-Aibar, Laura/0000-0002-0077-161X; Pie Dols, Laia/0000-0003-3596-7097; Ninerola, Angels/0000-0001-5598-1203",,,,,54,0,0,13,24,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0944-1344,1614-7499,,ENVIRON SCI POLLUT R,Environ.

The region is highly vulnerable to changes in rainfall, highlighting the need to understand the underlying controls. We present a stalagmite-based delta O-18 record from Kesang Cave in western China, using MC-ICP-MS U-series dating and stable isotope analysis. Stalagmite calcite delta O-18 largely documents changes in the delta O-18 of precipitation. delta O-18 in stalagmites was low during the early and middle Holocene (10.0-3.0 ka BP), and shifted to higher values between 3.0 and 2.0 ka BP. After 2.01 ka BP, delta O-18 fluctuates with distinct centennial-scale variations. Drawing from results of state-of-the-art atmospheric general circulation model simulations for the preindustrial period and 9 ka BP, we propose that changes in moisture source regions and the wetter climate both contributed to the isotopic depletion of precipitation during the early and middle Holocene. Multiple records from surrounding regions indicate a generally wetter climate during the early and mid- Holocene, supporting our interpretation on the speleothem delta O-18. Changes in precipitation seasonality do not appear to be a viable explanation for the observed changes, nor increased penetration of monsoonal moisture to the study site. We speculate that the climatic regime shifted around 3.0-2.0 ka BP towards a drier climate, resulting in temperature having dominant control on precipitation delta O-18. The demise of three settlements around 500AD at the margin of Tarim Basin coincided with a period of decreased precipitation and increased temperature that likely affected local water resources, underscoring the potential impact of climate on human habitation in this region.

Here, we use a wavelet-based spectral Principal Component Analysis (wsPCA) to evaluate the skill of 20 state-of-the-art CMIP6 models in capturing the magnitude and dynamics of the MJO. By construction, wsPCA has the ability to focus on desired frequencies and capture each propagative physical mode with one principal component (PC). We show that the MJO contribution to the total intraseasonal climate variability is substantially underestimated in most CMIP6 models. The joint distribution of the modulus and angular frequency of the wavelet PC series associated with MJO is used to rank models relatively to the observations through the Wasserstein distance. Using Hovmoller phase-longitude diagrams, we also show that precipitation variability associated with MJO is underestimated in most CMIP6 models for the Amazonia, Southwest Africa, and Maritime Continent.","[Le, Phong V.

Since local communities are relying on the same marine food web as marine mammals in the Arctic, it requires a One Health approach to understand the holistic ecosystem health including that of humans. Here we collect and identify gaps in the current knowledge of health in the Arctic and present the veterinary perspective of One Health and ecosystem dynamics. The review shows that exposure to persistent organic pollutants (POPs) is having multiple organ-system effects across taxa, including impacts on neuroendocrine disruption, immune suppression and decreased bone density among others. Furthermore, the warming Arctic climate is suspected to influence abiotic and biotic long-range transport and exposure pathways of contaminants to the Arctic resulting in increases in POP exposure of both wildlife and human populations. Exposure to vector-borne diseases and zoonoses may increase as well through range expansion and introduction of invasive species. It will be important in the future to investigate the effects of these multiple stressors on wildlife and local people to better predict the individual-level health risks. It is within this framework that One Health approaches offer promising opportunities to survey and pinpoint environmental changes that have effects on wildlife and human health.","[Sonne, Christian; Jenssen, Bjorn Munro; Desforges, Jean-Pierre; Eulaers, Igor; Andersen-Ranberg, Emilie; Gustavson, Kim; Dietz, Rune] Aarhus Univ, Fac Sci & Technol, Dept Biosci, ARC, Frederiksborgvej 399,POB 358, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark; [Letcher, Robert James] Carleton Univ, Natl Wildlife Res Ctr, Ecotoxicol & Wildlife Hlth Div, Environm & Climate Change Canada, Ottawa, ON K1A 0H3, Canada; [Jenssen, Bjorn Munro] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Biol, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway; [Jenssen, Bjorn Munro] Univ Ctr Svalbard, Dept Arctic Technol, POB 156, N-9171 Longyearbyen, Norway; [Styrishave, Bjarne] Univ Copenhagen, Fac Hlth & Med Sci, Dept Pharm, Toxicol Lab, Univ Parken 1, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark",Aarhus University; Carleton University; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service; National Wildlife Research Centre - Canada; Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); University Centre Svalbard (UNIS); University of Copenhagen,"Sonne, C (corresponding author), Aarhus Univ, Fac Sci & Technol, Dept Biosci, ARC, Frederiksborgvej 399,POB 358, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark.",cs@bios.au.dk,"Dietz, Rune/F-9154-2015; Desforges, Jean-Pierre W/B-9217-2016; Jenssen, Bjorn M/J-4830-2012; Sonne, Christian/I-7532-2013; Eulaers, Igor/AAJ-5912-2020; Jenssen, Bjorn Munro/O-3217-2019; Eulaers, Igor/A-3265-2012","Dietz, Rune/0000-0001-9652-317X; Desforges, Jean-Pierre W/0000-0002-6816-7697; Jenssen, Bjorn M/0000-0002-7042-2191; Sonne, Christian/0000-0001-5723-5263; Eulaers, Igor/0000-0002-7130-9932; Jenssen, Bjorn Munro/0000-0002-7042-2191; Eulaers, Igor/0000-0002-7130-9932; Gustavson, Kim/0000-0001-8242-0276","Nordic Council of Ministers (NMR NORDEN); BONUS [Art.185]; EU; Innovation Fund Denmark [6180-00001B, 6180-00002B]; Forschungszentrum Julich GmbH; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research [FKZ 03F0767A]; Academy of Finland [311966]; Swedish Foundation for Strategic Environmental Research (MISTRA)",Nordic Council of Ministers (NMR NORDEN); BONUS; EU(European Commission); Innovation Fund Denmark; Forschungszentrum Julich GmbH; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); Academy of Finland(Academy of Finland); Swedish Foundation for Strategic Environmental Research (MISTRA)(Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research),"Nordic Council of Ministers (NMR NORDEN) is acknowledged for financial support to the project entitled Infectious Zoonotic Diseases Transmissible from harvested Wildlife to humans in the European Arctic (ZORRO).

Compared with the present climate, the upper ocean is more stratified, and the mixed layer depth (MLD) shoals in warmer climate. The maximum change of winter MLD appears in the Kuroshio-Oyashio extension (KOE) region, where the mean MLD is the deepest in the North Pacific. This weakens the MLD front and reduces lateral induction. As a result of the reduced subduction rate and a decrease in sea surface density in KOE, mode waters form on lighter isopycnals with reduced thickness. Advected southward, the weakened mode waters decelerate the STCC. On decadal timescales, the dominant mode of sea surface height in the central subtropical gyre represents STCC variability. This STCC mode decays as CO2 concentrations double in the twenty-first century, owing both to weakened mode waters in the mean state and to reduced variability in mode waters. The reduced mode-water variability can be traced upstream to reduced variations in winter MLD front and subduction in the KOE region where mode water forms.","[Xu, Lixiao; Xie, Shang-Ping; Liu, Qinyu] Phys Oceanog Lab, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Xu, Lixiao; Xie, Shang-Ping; Liu, Qinyu] Ocean Atmosphere Interact & Climate Lab, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Xie, Shang-Ping] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Meteorol, Int Pacific Res Ctr, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Kobashi, Fumiaki] Tokyo Univ Marine Sci & Technol, Fac Marine Technol, Tokyo, Japan; [Kobashi, Fumiaki] Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, Res Inst Global Change, Yokosuka, Kanagawa 2370061, Japan",University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; Tokyo University of Marine Science & Technology; Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science & Technology (JAMSTEC),"Xie, SP (corresponding author), Phys Oceanog Lab, Qingdao, Peoples R China.",xie@hawaii.edu,"Xie, Shang-Ping/C-1254-2009; KOBASHI, Fumiaki/O-2028-2014","Xie, Shang-Ping/0000-0002-3676-1325; ","Qianren project; Changjiang Scholar Program; Natural Science Foundation of China [40830106, 40921004]; National Key Program for Developing Basic Science of China [2007CB411803, 2010CB428904]; US National Science Foundation; Japan Agency for Marine Earth Science and Technology; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [23340139] Funding Source: KAKEN","Qianren project; Changjiang Scholar Program(Program for Changjiang Scholars & Innovative Research Team in University (PCSIRT)); Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key Program for Developing Basic Science of China; US National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Japan Agency for Marine Earth Science and Technology; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","We thank the anonymous reviewers for constructive and helpful comments.

A wide array of geochemical proxies, including stable isotopes and trace elements are present within speleothems to reconstruct past climate variability. However, each proxy is influenced by multiple factors, often hampering robust interpretation. Sr isotope ratios (Sr-87/Sr-86) can provide useful information about water residence time and water mixing in the host rock, as they are not fractionated during calcite precipitation. Laser ablation multi-collector-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-MC-ICP-MS) has rarely been used for determination of Sr isotope signatures in speleothems, as speleothems often do not possess appropriately high concentrations of Sr to facilitate this analysis. Yet the advantages of this approach include rapid data acquisition, higher spatial resolution, larger sample throughput and the absence of chemical treatment prior to analysis. We present LA-MC-ICP-MS Sr isotope data from two speleothems from Morocco (Grotte de Piste) and India (Mawmluh Cave), and we compare linescan and spot analysis ablation techniques along speleothem growth axes. The analytical uncertainty of our LA-MC-ICP-MS Sr data is comparable to studies conducted on other carbonate materials. The results of both ablation techniques are reproducible within analytical error, implying that this technique yields robust results when applied to speleothems. In addition, several comparative measurements of different carbonate reference materials (i.e. MACS 3, JCt-1, JCp-1), including tests with standard bracketing and comparison of the 87Sr/86Sr ratios with a nanosecond laser ablation system and a state-of-the-art femtosecond laser ablation system, highlight the robustness of the method.","[Weber, Michael; Wassenburg, Jasper A.; Scholz, Denis] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Inst Geosci, JJ Becher Weg 21, D-55128 Mainz, Germany; [Weber, Michael; Wassenburg, Jasper A.; Jochum, Klaus Peter] Otto Hahn Inst, Max Planck Inst Chem, Climate Geochem Dept, Postbox 3060, D-55020 Mainz, Germany; [Breitenbach, Sebastian F.

Different observed, remotely sensed, (re)analyzed, and modeled datasets were used to obtain independent estimates of the budgets. In particular, assimilated datasets, including the National Centers for Environmental Prediction Global Reanalysis 2 (NCEP-R2). the global 40-yr European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Re-Analysis (ERA-40), the NCEP North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR), and the Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC) operational regional analysis as well as results from the Canadian Regional Climate Model (CRCM) simulations, are used in the study. Apart from the development of state-of-the-art budget estimates for the MRB, the relative merits of current models, data assimilation systems, and global blended datasets in representing aspects of the water and energy cycle of this northern and data-sparse region were also assessed. In addition, the levels of uncertainty in assessing the budgets as well as their sources are discussed. The regional water budget for the MRB is closed within 10% of the observed runoff by using the moisture flux convergence from ERA-40, NARR, CMC, or CRCM. While these are noted improvements over previous water closure assessments for the region, magnitudes of the residuals in balancing the budgets are often comparable to the budget terms themselves in all the model and analysis datasets, and the spreads of bud-let estimates from the different datasets are also typically large, suggesting that substantial improvements to the models and observations are needed before the assessments of water and energy budgets for this northern region can be vastly improved.","[Szeto, K.

Taking a sociological perspective and viewing organizations as cultural systems embedded in wider social contexts, I have developed a multilevel framework addressing institutional, organizational, and individual dimensions shaping decisions on energy efficiency. The frameworks development is based on qualitative empirical fieldwork and integrates insights into organizational theory; neo-institutional theory, the attention-based view of the firm, and organizational culture theories. I conclude that decisions on energy efficiency are results of problematization and theorization processes. These processes emerge between the institutional issue-field, the organization, and its members. The model explains decisions shaped by environment (external and material), organizational processes (energy-efficiency practices, climate and culture) and individuals' characteristics. The framework serves several purposes: introducing a meta-theory of decision making, providing a concept for empirical analysis, and enabling connectivity to the research on barriers.","[Koenig, Werner] Reutlingen Univ, Reutlingen Ctr Energy Syst & Energy Efficiency, Alteburgstr 150, D-72762 Reutlingen, Germany",,"Konig, W (corresponding author), Reutlingen Univ, Reutlingen Ctr Energy Syst & Energy Efficiency, Alteburgstr 150, D-72762 Reutlingen, Germany.",werner.koenig@reutlingen-university.de,,"Konig, Werner/0000-0002-4661-5671","Ministry of Science, Research and Art of the German Federal State Baden-Wurttemberg","Ministry of Science, Research and Art of the German Federal State Baden-Wurttemberg","The author gratefully acknowledges the support of the Ministry of Science, Research and Art of the German Federal State Baden-Wurttemberg within the scope of the project Decisions for Energy Efficiency.

However, all data products should be evaluated for their performance before being used for specific applications in different regions or locations. In this study, we evaluated 20 precipitation products for their drought monitoring performance over Ethiopia. These datasets are produced by different state-of-the-art techniques, including: 1) gauge interpolated, 2) satellite-estimate, 3) reanalysis and 4) merged from multi-sources. The Ethiopian gauge satellite gridded precipitation dataset and gauge records from 126 stations were used for ground truthing. Drought indices were generated for all data products using the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) method at 3-and 12-month time scales. We evaluated accuracy of the data products in representing occurrence and spatial and temporal patterns of the 3-and 12-month droughts using visual and correlation analysis techniques. The data were visually compared against reference data in representing four selected major drought episodes in the country (1984, 2002, 2009 and 2015). The Spearman's correlation was used to quantify relationships between the 20 precipitation products and two reference datasets using SPI values generated at 3-and 12-month time scales. Results showed considerable discrepancies and poor performance for most datasets. The ability to represent the spatial pattern and severity of major drought events varied between drought years. Although the correlation result for areal average SPI time series of the 3-and 12-month droughts for all data products showed statistically significant correlation with the reference data, there is discrepancy between the data products across space. Overall, only three out of the 20 products (CHIRPS, FLDAS and GPCC) performed relatively better. Our results provide important information to guide the choice of precipitation products for drought research, and operational drought risk management as well as useful feedback to data developers to further improve their products.","[Bewket, Woldeamlak; Degefu, Mekonnen Adnew] Addis Ababa Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, POB 1176, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Degefu, Mekonnen Adnew] Debre Markos Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, POB 269, Debre Markos, Ethiopia; [Amha, Yosef] United Nations Econ Commiss Africa UNECA, European Econ Commiss Africa, African Climate Policy Ctr ACPC, POB 3001, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia",Addis Ababa University,"Degefu, MA (corresponding author), Addis Ababa Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, POB 1176, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.",woldeamlak.bewket@aau.edu.et; amhay@un.org; woldeamlak.bewket@aau.edu.et,"Degefu, Mekonnen Adnew/GRR-6199-2022","Degefu, Mekonnen Adnew/0000-0001-6316-7543","Climate Research for Development (CR4D) Postdoctoral Fellowship, African Academy of Sciences (AAS) [CR4D-19-19]; United Kingdom's Department for International Development (DfID) Weather and Climate Information Services for Africa (WISER) programme; African Climate Policy Center (ACPC) of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA)","Climate Research for Development (CR4D) Postdoctoral Fellowship, African Academy of Sciences (AAS); United Kingdom's Department for International Development (DfID) Weather and Climate Information Services for Africa (WISER) programme; African Climate Policy Center (ACPC) of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA)",This work was supported through the Climate Research for Development (CR4D) Postdoctoral Fellowship [CR4D-19-19] implemented by the African Academy of Sciences (AAS) in partnership with the United Kingdom's Department for International Development (DfID) Weather and Climate Information Services for Africa (WISER) programme and the African Climate Policy Center (ACPC) of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA).

Two experiments were designed and performed to quantify the influence of AH on the surface balance of energy and water through running the Integrated urban Land Model (IUM). The results show that due to accounting for AH, the simulated LST increases; the net radiation decreases around noon; the absolute value of the ground heat flux increases around noon; the sensible heat flux increases in the daytime; the evapotranspiration decreases around noon and increases in the morning and evening; volumetric soil moisture and soil water storage decrease; aggregated evapotranspiration increases.","[Meng, C.] China Meteorol Adm, Inst Urban Meteorol, 55 Beiwaxili, Beijing 100089, Peoples R China; [Jiang, L.] Taihu Meteorol Bur, Anqing 246400, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Jin, H.] Jizhou Meteorol Bur, Tianjin 301900, Peoples R China; [Ren, Lili; Chen, T.] Hetian Meteorol Bur, Hetian 848000, Xinjiang, Peoples R China",China Meteorological Administration,"Meng, C (corresponding author), China Meteorol Adm, Inst Urban Meteorol, 55 Beiwaxili, Beijing 100089, Peoples R China.",clmeng@ium.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [41875125],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant 41875125).,,40,1,2,7,15,PLEIADES PUBLISHING INC,MOSCOW,"BUTLEROVA UL 17 B, MOSCOW, RUSSIA",1068-3739,1934-8096,,RUSS METEOROL HYDRO+,Russ.

We measured carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes at three grassland sites (400, 1000, and 2000 m elevation) and estimated carbon sequestration for two different but exceptionally warm years (2006 and 2007). Grasslands at higher elevations (>1000 m), managed at lower intensities, exhibited a larger net CO2 uptake compared to intensively managed grasslands at lower elevations (400 m). Taking into account harvest outputs as well as manure inputs, we calculated the carbon stocks and their changes for grasslands at 400 m and 1000 m during two years. Similar to the cumulative net ecosystem CO2 fluxes, the seasonal course of carbon stock changes were strongly driven by management intensity, in particular by timing and amount of manure applications. Despite differences in environmental and management conditions with elevation, both grassland sites were carbon sinks during 2006 and 2007 (between 25 and 150 g C m(-2) yr(-1)).

Secondly, youth perspectives on healthy and justice-oriented environments and communities challenge environmental health scholars to consider youth as powerful actors. Youth perspectives of healthy and justice-oriented communities present a necessarily structural perspective to consider not only the impacts of environmental decision-making on health, but the conditions that have allowed for harmful impacts.

Here we first develop an analytical framework for assessing the Peruvian initiatives of conservation incentives. We then identify six ongoing interventions that have introduced incentives conditional upon compliance with voluntary environmental commitments. We collected information from secondary sources and conducted semi-structured interviews with thirty national- and local-level stakeholders. We scrutinized the extent to which such initiatives featured impact-oriented design and implementation elements, as typically recommended in the state-of-the-art literature on Payment for Environmental Services (PES) and Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+). We found only limited adoption of such recommendations, including spatial targeting, payment differentiation, enforced conditionality, and customized measures nurturing locally perceived equity and transparency. We argue, supported by a still incipient rigorous evidence from impact evaluations, that suboptimal design and implementation choices probably have influenced outcomes towards limiting the sought-for environmental and welfare impacts. We discuss three critical aspects for upscaling: overcoming financial and legal constraints, strategic involvement of non-government stakeholders, and more impact-oriented design of the interventions.","[Montoya-Zumaeta, Javier G.; Tacconi, Luca] Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Wunder, Sven] European Forest Inst EFI, Barcelona, Spain; [Montoya-Zumaeta, Javier G.; Wunder, Sven] Ctr Int Forestry Res CIFOR, Bogor, Indonesia; [Montoya-Zumaeta, Javier G.] World Agroforestry Ctr ICRAF, Lima, Peru",Australian National University; CGIAR; Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR),"Montoya-Zumaeta, JG (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, 132 Lennox Crossing, Acton, ACT 2601, Australia.",javier.montoya@anu.edu.au,"Wunder, Sven/ABE-7773-2020","Wunder, Sven/0000-0002-9422-0260; Montoya-Zumaeta, Javier G./0000-0001-5059-4036","Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (Norad); Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT); European Commission (EC); International Climate Initiative (IKI) of the German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (BMU); United Kingdom Department for International Development (UKAID); CGIAR Research Program on Forests, Trees and Agroforestry (CRP-FTA); European Commission [773702]; FONDECYT-Peru [130-2016]; Crawford School of Public Policy at the Australian National University","Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (Norad)(CGIAR); Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT)(Australian Government); European Commission (EC)(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre); International Climate Initiative (IKI) of the German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (BMU); United Kingdom Department for International Development (UKAID)(CGIAR); CGIAR Research Program on Forests, Trees and Agroforestry (CRP-FTA)(CGIAR); European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre); FONDECYT-Peru; Crawford School of Public Policy at the Australian National University(Australian National University)","This research is part of CIFOR's Global Comparative Study on REDD+ (www.cifor.org/gcs).The funding partners that have supported this research include the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (Norad), the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), the European Commission (EC), the International Climate Initiative (IKI) of the German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (BMU), the United Kingdom Department for International Development (UKAID), and the CGIAR Research Program on Forests, Trees and Agroforestry (CRP-FTA), with financial support from the donors contributing to the CGIAR Fund.

As Director for the School of Art at the University of Houston, I have spent 6 years developing experimental, hybrid, and cross-disciplinary courses that have brought together architecture, art, anthropology, biology, creative writing, computer science, engineering, music, and social/urban studies. Additionally, we developed an MFA program in Interdisciplinary Practices and Emerging Forms (IPEF) to foment new strategies in creative research. My presentation would review the development of the different methodologies employed, tracing their evolution to the present, and speculating on future initiatives. This fall, I will be in Spain as a Fulbright Scholar developing the international components of these newly designed programs. It would be a great honor and opportunity to present my experiences in developing new educational strategies with fellow educational professionals to get feedback and exchange ideas. Particularly with the topic of Sustainability, it is clear that novel approaches are imperative at every level and in every discipline. This is a global issue that demands a global response. But, as Einstein noted, We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them. Global can no longer mean that one size fits all; challenges play out differently in every locality and yet, we are all connected with the same goal. Our responsibility is to develop the new educational practices that can address these unique problems: integrating the abilities of diverse fields, increasing international cooperation and understanding, and empowering individuals with knowledge and experience.","[Reed, John] Univ Houston, Sch Art, Houston, TX 77004 USA",University of Houston System; University of Houston,,jreed@uh.edu; esthermera@gmail.com,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,12,IATED-INT ASSOC TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION A& DEVELOPMENT,VALENICA,"LAURI VOLPI 6, VALENICA, BURJASSOT 46100, SPAIN",,,978-84-615-3324-4,,,,2011,,,,,6266,6271,,,,,,6,Education & Educational Research,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Education & Educational Research,BEK53,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000317080006043,View Full Record in Web of Science

Results from three 2030 emissions scenarios, broadly representing optimistic,'' likely,'' and pessimistic'' options, are compared to a base year 2000 simulation. This base case realistically represents the current global distribution of tropospheric ozone. A further set of simulations considers the influence of climate change over the same time period by forcing the central emissions scenario with a surface warming of around 0.7K. The use of a large multimodel ensemble allows us to identify key areas of uncertainty and improves the robustness of the results. Ensemble mean changes in tropospheric ozone burden between 2000 and 2030 for the 3 scenarios range from a 5% decrease, through a 6% increase, to a 15% increase. The intermodel uncertainty (+/-1 standard deviation) associated with these values is about +/-25%. Model outliers have no significant influence on the ensemble mean results. Combining ozone and methane changes, the three scenarios produce radiative forcings of -50, 180, and 300 mW m(-2), compared to a CO2 forcing over the same time period of 800-1100 mW m(-2). These values indicate the importance of air pollution emissions in short-to medium-term climate forcing and the potential for stringent/lax control measures to improve/worsen future climate forcing. The model sensitivity of ozone to imposed climate change varies between models but modulates zonal mean mixing ratios by +/-5 ppbv via a variety of feedback mechanisms, in particular those involving water vapor and stratosphere-troposphere exchange. This level of climate change also reduces the methane lifetime by around 4%. The ensemble mean year 2000 tropospheric ozone budget indicates chemical production, chemical destruction, dry deposition and stratospheric input fluxes of 5100, 4650, 1000, and 550 Tg(O-3) yr(-1), respectively. These values are significantly different to the mean budget documented by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Third Assessment Report (TAR). The mean ozone burden (340 Tg(O-3)) is 10% larger than the IPCC TAR estimate, while the mean ozone lifetime (22 days) is 10% shorter. Results from individual models show a correlation between ozone burden and lifetime, and each model's ozone burden and lifetime respond in similar ways across the emissions scenarios. The response to climate change is much less consistent. Models show more variability in the tropics compared to midlatitudes. Some of the most uncertain areas of the models include treatments of deep tropical convection, including lightning NOx production; isoprene emissions from vegetation and isoprene's degradation chemistry; stratosphere-troposphere exchange; biomass burning; and water vapor concentrations.","Univ Edinburgh, Sch Geosci, Edinburgh EH9 3J9, Midlothian, Scotland; Joint Res Ctr, Inst Environm & Sustainabil, I-21020 Ispra, Italy; Max Planck Inst Meteorol, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany; Univ Oslo, Dept Geosci, N-0316 Oslo, Norway; Royal Netherlands Meteorol Inst, De Bilt, Netherlands; Japan Marine Sci & Technol Ctr, Frontier Res Ctr Global Change, Kanazawa Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2360001, Japan; Univ Cambridge, Ctr Atmospher Sci, Cambridge CB2 1EW, England; Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria; Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, Div Atmospher Sci, Livermore, CA 94550 USA; NASA, Goddard Inst Space Studies, New York, NY 10025 USA; Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; Max Planck Inst Chem, D-55128 Mainz, Germany; Hadley Ctr Climate Predict & Res, Met Off, Exeter EX1 3PB, Devon, England; rdscientific, Newbury RG14 6LH, Berks, England; NOAA, Geophys Fluid Dynam Lab, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA; Lab Sci Climat & Environm, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Div Atmospher Chem, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; Univ Aquila, Dipartimento Fis, I-67010 Laquila, Italy; Belgian Inst Space Aeron, B-1180 Brussels, Belgium; Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Miami, FL 33149 USA; NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD USA",University of Edinburgh; European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site; Max Planck Society; University of Oslo; Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute; Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science & Technology (JAMSTEC); University of Cambridge; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne; Max Planck Society; Met Office - UK; Hadley Centre; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; CEA; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; University of L'Aquila; University of California System; University of California Irvine; University of Miami; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center,"Stevenson, DS (corresponding author), Univ Edinburgh, Sch Geosci, Crew Bldg,Kings Bldg, Edinburgh EH9 3J9, Midlothian, Scotland.",dstevens@staffmail.ed.ac.uk,"Savage, Nicholas Henry/AAA-4015-2020; Unger, Nadine/AAI-4462-2021; Hauglustaine, Didier/A-4154-2012; Rodriguez, Jose/G-3751-2013; Shindell, Drew/D-4636-2012; Unger, Nadine/M-9360-2015; SZOPA, Sophie/F-8984-2010; Lamarque, Jean-Francois/L-2313-2014; Strahan, Susan E/H-1965-2012; Schultz, Martin G/I-9512-2012; Stevenson, David S/C-8089-2012; Krol, Maarten/B-3597-2010; Sudo, Kengo/I-6394-2014; Ellingsen, Kjerstin/AAV-5047-2021; Bergmann, Daniel J/F-9801-2011; Magaña, Felipe/B-6966-2013; Butler, Tim/G-1139-2011; Pitari, Giovanni/O-7458-2016; Krol, Maarten C./E-3414-2013; Horowitz, Larry/D-8048-2014; Collins, William/A-5895-2010; Wild, Oliver/A-4909-2009","Savage, Nicholas Henry/0000-0001-9391-5100; Unger, Nadine/0000-0001-7739-2290; Hauglustaine, Didier/0000-0002-4826-5118; Rodriguez, Jose/0000-0002-1902-4649; Shindell, Drew/0000-0003-1552-4715; SZOPA, Sophie/0000-0002-8641-1737; Lamarque, Jean-Francois/0000-0002-4225-5074; Strahan, Susan E/0000-0002-7511-4577; Schultz, Martin G/0000-0003-3455-774X; Stevenson, David S/0000-0002-4745-5673; Sudo, Kengo/0000-0002-5013-4168; Bergmann, Daniel J/0000-0003-4357-6301; Pitari, Giovanni/0000-0001-7051-9578; Krol, Maarten C./0000-0002-3506-2477; Horowitz, Larry/0000-0002-5886-3314; Collins, William/0000-0002-7419-0850; Wild, Oliver/0000-0002-6227-7035; Zeng, Guang/0000-0002-9356-5021; Derwent, Richard/0000-0003-4498-645X; Fiore, Arlene/0000-0003-0221-2122; Lawrence, Mark/0000-0002-2178-4903; Butler, Timothy/0000-0002-2219-4657","Natural Environment Research Council [NE/C001672/1, NER/J/S/2000/00840] Funding Source: researchfish",Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),,,155,572,577,8,182,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",2169-897X,2169-8996,,J GEOPHYS RES-ATMOS,J.

This marked increase, which is among the highest globally, has previously been attributed primarily to enhanced poleward moisture transport from lower latitudes(3,4). Here we use state-of-the-art global climate models(5) to show that the projected increases in Arctic precipitation over the twenty-first century, which peak in late autumn and winter, are instead due mainly to strongly intensified local surface evaporation (maximum in winter), and only to a lesser degree due to enhanced moisture inflow from lower latitudes(maximum in late summer and autumn). Moreover, we show that the enhanced surface evaporation results mainly from retreating winter sea ice, signalling an amplified Arctic hydrological cycle. This demonstrates that increases in Arctic precipitation are firmly linked to Arctic warming and sea-ice decline. As a result, the Arctic mean precipitation sensitivity (4.5 per cent increase per degree of temperature warming) is much larger than the global value (1.6 to 1.9 per cent per kelvin). The associated seasonally varying increase in Arctic precipitation is likely to increase river discharge(6-8) and snowfall over ice sheets(9) (thereby affecting global sea level), and could even affect global climate through freshening of the Arctic Ocean and subsequent modulations of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation(10,11).","[Bintanja, R.; Selten, F.

Together with liquid water measurements this new data set was used to evaluate arctic cloud properties, simulated with a state-of-the-art mesoscale atmospheric model. Dependent on the method used for comparison, the mean cloud fraction was found to lie between 51 and 58% in the observations and 53% in the simulations. The hit rate for the total water content was estimated to be between 65 and 71% and the systematic error to a few percent. On the basis of in-cloud observations only, the model was able to reproduce cloudy conditions in 74% of the data points. On the other hand, the model underestimated the occurrence of the liquid phase by about 80% and slightly overestimated the occurrence of the ice phase. Also, in the temperature range from 255 K to 230 K, where considerable amounts of supercooled water were observed, the model failed to produce the liquid phase. Our results confirm the previous finding that despite high forecast skill with respect to cloudy or cloud-free events, the model underpredicts the occurrence of liquid phase in arctic clouds. This shortcoming will have a large influence on precipitation forecasts, as well as on climate predictions. Despite some improvements in recent years, more research is needed to improve the parameterization of arctic cloud properties in fine-scale weather prediction models. For climate models, which have to employ a much cruder parameterization of the microphysics, we face a number of challenges.","Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, Bergen, Norway; Geminali AS, Bergen, Norway; Univ Bergen, Inst Geophys, N-5020 Bergen, Norway; Univ Bergen, Dept Phys & Technol, N-5020 Bergen, Norway; Stevens Inst Technol, Dept Phys & Engn Phys, Hoboken, NJ 07030 USA",Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research; University of Bergen; University of Bergen; Stevens Institute of Technology,"Sandvik, A (corresponding author), Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, Bergen, Norway.",anne.sandvik@bjerknes.uib.no,"Sandvik, Anne Dagrun/AAK-8165-2021","Sandvik, Anne Dagrun/0000-0003-2592-566X",,,,,41,21,21,0,2,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",2169-897X,,,J GEOPHYS RES-ATMOS,J.

The term specification indicates that the predictor and predictands are not lagged in time, as would be the case for true prediction. Four state-of-the-art general circulation models (GCMs) and linear empirical models with predictors derived from observations and dynamical models are considered. Predictors are derived from model hindcasts using principal component analysis (PCA), canonical correlation analysis (CCA), and discriminant analysis. The last technique has appeared in the climate literature, but its use in the present context appears new. A distinguishing feature of this paper is that several methods and models are compared in a common framework. The specification skill of GCMs for the period 1982-98 is statistically significant in the northwestern region near Washington State, British Columbia, and central Canada, with some local correlations exceeding 0.6. The specification skill of GCMs is comparable to, or better than, the skill of the best empirical model for the particular 17-yr period examined. No single specification strategy was found to improve the model hindcast skill in all cases. Predictors derived from discriminant analysis generally lead to larger skill than predictors based on PCA or CCA. The signal-to-noise ratio varies greatly among models and appears to be, if anything, inversely related to the specification skill when discriminants are used as predictors. Predictors based on 500-hPa geopotential height can lead to specification skill at least as good as predictors based on land surface temperature. Evidence is presented for the existence of at least two distinct dynamically predictable components of land surface temperature arising from two distinct flavors of SST anomalies associated with El Nino and La Nina.","Ctr Ocean Land Atmosphere Studies, Calverton, MD 20705 USA; George Mason Univ, Fairfax, VA USA",George Mason University,"DelSole, T (corresponding author), Ctr Ocean Land Atmosphere Studies, 4041 Powder Mill Rd, Calverton, MD 20705 USA.",delsole@cola.iges.org,"DelSole, Timothy/ABE-2478-2020","DelSole, Timothy/0000-0003-2041-3024",,,,,38,24,24,0,4,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0894-8755,1520-0442,,J CLIMATE,J.

Despite its importance, current literature focuses primarily on single aspects of the interaction between the back-up heater and the heat pump system. Furthermore, influences of varying scenarios are typically not considered. This paper simultaneously investigates the impact of 18 different scenarios on the optimal answer to the questions: Which back-up heater to choose, where to place it, and how to control it? A scenario consists of boundary conditions for weather, building envelope, radiator sizing, operational envelope, and the electricity-to-gas price/emission ratio, respectively. Using annual dynamic Modelica simulations, we evaluate and assess all interdependencies based on a full factorial design. We analyze final energy consumption, thermal comfort, and back-up heater as objectives. For gas-fired back-up heaters, the optimal placement and control align with current state-of-the-art recommendations. However, for electric back-up heaters, current guideline recommendations yield up to 30% higher operational costs and emissions compared to our findings. Consequently, future studies should develop optimal design rules for sustainable retrofit heat pump systems.","[Wuellhorst, Fabian; Vering, Christian; Maier, Laura; Mueller, Dirk] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, EON Energy Res Ctr, Inst Energy Efficient Bldg & Indoor Climate, D-52074 Aachen, Germany",E-ON; RWTH Aachen University,"Wullhorst, F (corresponding author), Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, EON Energy Res Ctr, Inst Energy Efficient Bldg & Indoor Climate, D-52074 Aachen, Germany.",fabian.wuellhorst@eonerc.rwth-aachen.de,,"Wullhorst, Fabian/0000-0003-3325-5707; Vering, Christian/0000-0001-7456-1722",Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action (BMWK) [03EN1022B],Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action (BMWK),This research was funded by the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action (BMWK) promotional reference 03EN1022B.,,48,0,0,1,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1996-1073,,ENERGIES,Energies,OCT,2022,19,,,,,,7134,10.3390/en15197134,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en15197134,,,22,Energy & Fuels,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Energy & Fuels,5G1UK,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000866790900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Their performance has been tested extensively against observations and by model intercomparison studies. In the present analysis, Lund-Potsdam-Jena General Ecosystem Simulator (LPJ-GUESS), a state-of-the-art ecosystem model, was evaluated by performing a global sensitivity analysis. The study aims at examining potential model limitations, particularly with regard to long-term applications. A detailed sensitivity analysis based on variance decomposition is presented to investigate structural model assumptions and to highlight processes and parameters that cause the highest variability in the output. First- and total-order sensitivity indices were calculated for selected parameters using Sobol's methodology. In order to elucidate the role of climate on model sensitivity, different climate forcings were used based on observations from Switzerland. The results clearly indicate a very high sensitivity of LPJ-GUESS to photosynthetic parameters. Intrinsic quantum efficiency alone is able to explain about 60% of the variability in vegetation carbon fluxes and pools for a wide range of climate forcings. Processes related to light harvesting were also found to be important together with parameters affecting forest structure (growth, establishment, and mortality). The model shows minor sensitivity to hydrological and soil texture parameters, questioning its skills in representing spatial vegetation heterogeneity at regional or watershed scales. In the light of these results, we discuss the deficiencies of LPJ-GUESS and possibly that of other, structurally similar, dynamic vegetation models and we highlight potential directions for further model improvements.","[Pappas, Christoforos; Fatichi, Simone; Burlando, Paolo] ETH, Inst Environm Engn, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Leuzinger, Sebastian] AUT Univ, Earth & Ocean Sci Res Inst, Sch Appl Sci, Auckland, New Zealand; [Leuzinger, Sebastian; Wolf, Annett] ETH, Inst Terr Ecosyst, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Auckland University of Technology; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Pappas, C (corresponding author), ETH, Inst Environm Engn, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland.",pappas@ifu.baug.ethz.ch,"Leuzinger, Sebastian/C-1330-2011","Fatichi, Simone/0000-0003-1361-6659","Swiss National Science Foundation [4061-125926]; European project ACQWA, Framework Programme 7 [212250]","Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission); European project ACQWA, Framework Programme 7","We would like to thank Veiko Lehsten and the LPJ course team from the Department of Earth and Ecosystem Sciences at Lund University, for organizing the ClimBEco graduate research school: Applications of LPJ-GUESS to research problems within Earth System Sciences, where C.

The coupled model is used to simulate black carbon (BC) and dust concentrations and their radiative forcing in seasonal snow over North China in January-February of 2010, with extensive field measurements used to evaluate the model performance. In general, the model simulated spatial variability of BC and dust mass concentrations in the top snow layer (hereafter BCS and DSTS, respectively) are consistent with observations. The model generally moderately underestimates BCS in the clean regions but significantly overestimates BCS in some polluted regions. Most model results fall within the uncertainty ranges of observations. The simulated BCS and DSTS are highest with > 5000 ng g(-1) and up to 5 mg g(-1), respectively, over the source regions and reduce to < 50 ng g(-1) and < 1 mu g g(-1), respectively, in the remote regions. BCS and DSTS introduce a similar magnitude of radiative warming (similar to 10 W m(-2)) in the snowpack, which is comparable to the magnitude of surface radiative cooling due to BC and dust in the atmosphere. This study represents an effort in using a regional modeling framework to simulate BC and dust and their direct radiative forcing in snowpack. Although a variety of observational data sets have been used to attribute model biases, some uncertainties in the results remain, which highlights the need for more observations, particularly concurrent measurements of atmospheric and snow aerosols and the deposition fluxes of aerosols, in future campaigns.","[Zhao, C.; Hu, Z.; Qian, Y.; Leung, L.

The contribution of the blesser phenomenon to gender-based violence and intimate partner violence,HTS TEOLOGIESE STUDIES-THEOLOGICAL STUDIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,blesser phenomenon; transactional sex; blesser-blessee relationships; gender-based violence; intimate partner violence; femicide; positive deconstruction; art of holy listening,,"This article examines the blesser phenomenon in South Africa, which gained rapid popularity in 2016. A large body of research exists that reveals that transactional sex is a significant theme within the phenomenon of blesser and blessee relationships. Scholarship has demonstrated that transactional sex has contributed to an increase in human immunodeficiency virus infection rates, especially amongst women aged 15-24 years, as well as a concerning increase in teenage pregnancy. Whilst these are dire realities of blesser-blessee relationships, the one that is most concerning in the current climate in South Africa is the increase in gender-based violence (GBV), intimate partner violence (IPV) and femicide. Therefore, this article concerns itself primarily with this epidemic as it seeks to demonstrate how the blesser phenomenon contributes to GBV and IPV. Blessees are the young women in the blesser-blessee relationships who experience trauma and shame because of the violence and abuse inflicted on them by the older male blessers. The article argues that the church should be seen to be taking decisive action in addressing the scourge of GBV and IPV. The narrative approach is used to give the blessees the opportunity to share their stories. By applying the techniques of narrative therapy, positive deconstruction and the art of holy listening, the study reaches its key outcome: to offer to the church a framework for a pastoral care and healing methodology to help our sisters in Christ to experience healing and to move from shame to self-worth. Contribution: The Blesser phenomen has never been dealt with in theology, especially from the African perspective. Both sides of the problem need pastoral care. The major issue is where do we begin? I started, pastorally working with the blessee, who is in relationship with an older man. The main question that could be pastorally followed is, why pursue an older man for provision? This is a major pastoral issue, especially in poor communities. The younger women are in need of finance, in order to complete their studies and eke out a living. Beside the Covid 19 pandemic, this is the second major issue affecting black townships.","[Frieslaar, Brent, V; Masango, Maake] Univ Pretoria, Fac Theol, Dept Pract Theol, Pretoria, South Africa",University of Pretoria,"Masango, M (corresponding author), Univ Pretoria, Fac Theol, Dept Pract Theol, Pretoria, South Africa.",maake.masango@up.ac.za,,"Masango, Maake/0000-0002-5362-9940",,,,,40,1,1,1,9,AOSIS,CAPE TOWN,"POSTNET SUITE 55, PRIVATE BAG X22, TYGERVALLEY, CAPE TOWN, 00000, SOUTH AFRICA",0259-9422,2072-8050,,HTS TEOL STUD-THEOL,HTS Teol.

Run-off water from the surface is traditionally let through a drainage system, and the roads are kept dry. Due to climate changes, heavy precipitation and high-intensity rainfalls are putting pressure on the infrastructure. Traditionally, water in subbase materials reduces the resilient E-moduli and the lifespan of the pavement design. Studies show that increasing saturation reduces the bearing capacity of a traditional subbase material. Unbound materials with highly grained fines and high moisture content have higher tendency to show reduced resilient E-moduli. One study was found where the E-moduli of five different coarse grained aggregates used in permeable pavements were examined through a triaxial test. It was found that the E-moduli varied from 110-371 MPa. Other studies examining the E-moduli of permeable subbases based on moisture content were not found. However, this paper discusses different experiences regarding the bearing capacity of traditional vs. permeable subbase materials. It also covers a discussion and an analysis of missing research areas that needs to be investigated for further knowledge about the usage of permeable pavements in areas with a risk of flooding.","[Muttuvelu, Dansani Vasanthan; Kjems, Erik] Aalborg Univ, Div Civil & Environm Engn, Thomas Manns Vej 23, DK-9220 Aalborg, Denmark; [Muttuvelu, Dansani Vasanthan] WSP Denmark AS, Dept Traff Rd & Harbours, DK-2630 Taastrup, Denmark",Aalborg University,"Muttuvelu, DV (corresponding author), Aalborg Univ, Div Civil & Environm Engn, Thomas Manns Vej 23, DK-9220 Aalborg, Denmark.;Muttuvelu, DV (corresponding author), WSP Denmark AS, Dept Traff Rd & Harbours, DK-2630 Taastrup, Denmark.",dvm@build.aau.dk; kjems@build.aau.dk,,"Kjems, Erik/0000-0002-4519-6583; Muttuvelu, Dansani Vasanthan/0000-0001-9859-4852",Innovation Fund Denmark; WSP Denmark A/S as part of an industrial PhD,Innovation Fund Denmark; WSP Denmark A/S as part of an industrial PhD,"This research was funded by the Innovation Fund Denmark grant number 1044-00063A, and by WSP Denmark A/S as part of an industrial PhD.",,64,3,3,2,4,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2412-3811,,INFRASTRUCTURES-BASE,Infrastructures-Basel,DEC,2021,12,,,,,,179,10.3390/infrastructures6120179,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/infrastructures6120179,,,16,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Civil; Transportation Science & Technology",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Construction & Building Technology; Engineering; Transportation,XY7RH,,"Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000737164600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the analysis and representation of a multiscale complex relationship that exists in the global climate system are limited. A logical first step in addressing this issue is to construct multiple networks over different timescales. Therefore, we propose to apply the wavelet multiscale correlation (WMC) similarity measure, which is a combination of two state-of-the-art methods, viz. wavelet and Pearson's correlation, for investigating multiscale processes through complex networks. Firstly we decompose the data over different timescales using the wavelet approach and subsequently construct a corresponding network by Pearson's correlation. The proposed approach is illustrated and tested on two synthetics and one real-world example. The first synthetic case study shows the efficacy of the proposed approach to unravel scale-specific connections, which are often undiscovered at a single scale. The second synthetic case study illustrates that by dividing and constructing a separate network for each time window we can detect significant changes in the signal structure. The real-world example investigates the behavior of the global sea surface temperature (SST) network at different timescales. Intriguingly, we notice that spatial dependent structure in SST evolves temporally. Overall, the proposed measure has an immense potential to provide essential insights on understanding and extending complex multivariate process studies at multiple scales.","[Agarwal, Ankit; Maheswaran, Rathinasamy; Marwan, Norbert; Caesar, Levke; Kurths, Juergen] Leibniz Assoc, Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res PIK, Potsdam, Germany; [Agarwal, Ankit; Kurths, Juergen] Univ Potsdam, Inst Earth & Environm Sci, Potsdam, Germany; [Agarwal, Ankit] GFZ German Res Ctr Geosci, Sect Hydrol 5 4, Potsdam, Germany; [Maheswaran, Rathinasamy] MVGR Coll Engn, Civil Engn Dept, Vizianagaram, India; [Caesar, Levke] Univ Potsdam, Inst Phys & Astron, Potsdam, Germany; [Kurths, Juergen] Humboldt Univ, Inst Phys, Berlin, Germany",Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; University of Potsdam; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Center Potsdam GFZ German Research Center for Geosciences; University of Potsdam; Humboldt University of Berlin,"Agarwal, A (corresponding author), Leibniz Assoc, Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res PIK, Potsdam, Germany.;Agarwal, A (corresponding author), Univ Potsdam, Inst Earth & Environm Sci, Potsdam, Germany.;Agarwal, A (corresponding author), GFZ German Res Ctr Geosci, Sect Hydrol 5 4, Potsdam, Germany.",agarwal@pik-potsdam.de,"AGARWAL, ANKIT/X-6301-2018; Marwan, Norbert/D-9576-2011; Caesar, Levke/AEB-5340-2022","AGARWAL, ANKIT/0000-0001-8572-7046; Marwan, Norbert/0000-0003-1437-7039; Caesar, Levke/0000-0002-5626-0392; Rathinasamy, Maheswaran/0000-0002-8124-3092","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) [GRK 2043/1]; Humboldt Foundation; Alexander Von Humboldt Fellowship award; DST, India","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Humboldt Foundation(Alexander von Humboldt Foundation); Alexander Von Humboldt Fellowship award; DST, India(Department of Science & Technology (India))","This research for authors (AA, NM, and JK) was funded by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) (GRK 2043/1) within the graduate research training group Natural risk in a changing world (NatRiskChange) at the University of Potsdam (http://www.uni-potsdam.de/natriskchange).RM would like to thank the Humboldt Foundation for supporting this research through the Alexander Von Humboldt Fellowship award.

Owing to, inter alia, the interdisciplinary work of the Experimental Workshop, an artistic collective inspired by European culture - active during the fifties of the past century - the poetic impulse continued to permeate the artistic climate in the next decade. Although the cinematic language of the next generation of artists owes more to the influence of American cultural models, the intertextual experiments by such avant-garde luminaries as the poet Terayama Shuji successfully transcended the limitations of particular artistic disciplines, creating an authentic expression on the intersection of literature, theater and film.","[Grubacic, Marko S.] Filoloski Fak Beogradu, Belgrade, Serbia",,"Grubacic, MS (corresponding author), Filoloski Fak Beogradu, Belgrade, Serbia.",grubomark@gmail.com,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,0,"UNIV MONTENEGRO, INST LANGUAGE & LITERATURE, FAC PHILOSOPHY-NIKSIC",NIKSIC,"DANILA BOJOVICA BB, NIKSIC, CRNA GORA 81400, MONTENEGRO",1800-8542,,,FOLIA LINGUIST LITT,Folia Linguist.

The assumed climate, eutrophication and cod (Gadus morhua) fisheries scenarios modified seal predation impacts on fish. Fish biomass and catches are more affected by fishing mortality and the environment than by seal predation. Our results highlight that the impacts of the increasing seal population on lower trophic levels are complex; thus, we emphasize the need to consider a range of possible ecosystem contexts when evaluating potential impacts of top predators.

These discussions have involved widely varying estimates based on drought indices and model-based projections of the future. To investigate and understand the causes for such a disparity between these previous estimates, the authors analyzed the soil moisture at the near-surface soil layer and the entire soil column, as well as the Palmer drought severity index, the Palmer Z index, and the standardized precipitation and evaporation index using the output from the Community Climate System Model, version 4 (CCSM4), and 25 state-of-the-art climate models. These drought indices were computed using potential evapotranspiration estimated by the physically based Penman-Monteith method (PE_pm) and the empirically based Thornthwaite method (PE_th). The results showed that the short-term drought indices are similar to modeled surface soil moisture and show a small but consistent drying trend in the future. The long-term drought indices and the total column soil moisture, however, are consistent in projecting more intense future drought. When normalized, the drought indices with PE_th all show unprecedented future drying, while the drought indices with PE_pm show comparable dryness with the modeled soil moisture. Additionally, the drought indices with PE_pm are closely related to soil moisture during both the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Overall, the drought indices with PE_pm, as well as the modeled total column soil moisture, suggest a widespread and very significant drying in the Great Plains toward the end of the century. The results suggest that the sharp contrasts about future drought risk in the Great Plains discussed in previous studies are caused by 1) comparing the projected changes in short-term droughts with that of the long-term droughts and/or 2) computing the atmospheric evaporative demand using an empirically based method (e.g., PE_th). The analysis here may be applied for drought projections in other regions across the globe.","[Feng, Song; Zhang, Yongjun] Univ Arkansas, Dept Geosci, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA; [Trnka, Miroslav] AS CR, Vvi, Global Change Res Inst, Brno, Czech Republic; [Trnka, Miroslav] Mendel Univ Brno, Inst Agr Syst & Bioclimatol, Brno, Czech Republic; [Hayes, Michael] Univ Nebraska, Sch Nat Resources, Natl Drought Mitigat Ctr, Lincoln, NE USA",University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville; Czech Academy of Sciences; Global Change Research Centre of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Mendel University in Brno; University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Lincoln,"Feng, S (corresponding author), Univ Arkansas, Dept Geosci, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA.",songfeng@uark.edu,"Trnka, Miroslav/F-9428-2014","Trnka, Miroslav/0000-0003-4727-8379","National Basic Research Program of China [2012CB955303]; NSF [AGS-1103316]; Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of CR [LO1415]; GACR [16-16549S]","National Basic Research Program of China(National Basic Research Program of China); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of CR(Ministry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech Republic); GACR(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic)","We thank the editor, Dr. Joseph Barsugli, Dr. Sergio M.

High-resolution simulations that correctly reproduce organized cloud systems are necessary to understand the role of deep convection in the Earth's climate system. However, there remain issues regarding convergence with respect to grid spacing. To investigate the resolution necessary for a reasonable simulation of deep convection, we conducted grid-refinement experiments using state-of-the-art atmospheric models. We found that the structure of an updraft ensemble in an organized cloud system converges at progressively smaller scales as the grid spacing is reduced. The gap between two adjacent updrafts converges to a particular distance when the grid spacing becomes as small as 1/20-1/40 of the updraft radius. We also found that the converged inter-updraft distance value is not significantly different between Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes simulations and large eddy simulations for grid spacings in the terra incognita range.","[Sueki, Kenta; Yamaura, Tsuyoshi; Yashiro, Hisashi; Nishizawa, Seiya; Kajikawa, Yoshiyuki; Tomita, Hirofumi] RIKEN, Ctr Computat Sci, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan; [Sueki, Kenta; Tomita, Hirofumi] RIKEN, Cluster Pioneering Res, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan; [Yamaura, Tsuyoshi; Kajikawa, Yoshiyuki] Kobe Univ, Res Ctr Urban Safety & Secur, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan; [Yashiro, Hisashi] Natl Inst Environm Studies, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Yoshida, Ryuji] Univ Colorado, CIRES, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Yoshida, Ryuji] NOAA, Earth Syst Res Lab, Boulder, CO USA",RIKEN; RIKEN; Kobe University; National Institute for Environmental Studies - Japan; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Sueki, K (corresponding author), RIKEN, Ctr Computat Sci, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan.;Sueki, K (corresponding author), RIKEN, Cluster Pioneering Res, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan.",kenta.sueki@riken.jp,"Yoshida, Ryuji/C-5283-2016; Yamaura, Tsuyoshi/C-5356-2016; YASHIRO, HISASHI/AAK-8378-2020; Nishizawa, Seiya/N-9689-2015","Yoshida, Ryuji/0000-0003-3238-2595; Yamaura, Tsuyoshi/0000-0002-1823-6869; YASHIRO, HISASHI/0000-0002-2678-526X; Nishizawa, Seiya/0000-0001-9457-7457; Sueki, Kenta/0000-0001-9089-3356","JST CREST, Japan [JPMJCR1312]; RIKEN Center for Computational Science (RIKEN R-CCS) through the HPCI System Research project [hp170113, hp170232]","JST CREST, Japan(Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology (CREST)); RIKEN Center for Computational Science (RIKEN R-CCS) through the HPCI System Research project","We thank the three anonymous reviewers of our manuscript for their helpful suggestions.

We thus know little about the conditions facing Later Stone Age human populations at this time, particularly those in the highland interior where temperature shifts would have had strong impacts on floral and faunal distributions. In Lesotho, a well-defined altitudinal distribution of C3 and C4 photosynthetic plant taxa, and their remains in soil organic matter, provides a means of estimating past temperature shifts. We applied this principle to stratified sediments from two archaeological sequences in the Lesotho lowlands (c. 1600m a.s.l.) to produce a palaeotemperature record focusing on the period 140009500 cal a BP. The results show an overall trend from exclusively C3 vegetation at the Last Glacial Maximum towards greater contributions of C4 taxa, and thus warmer conditions, during the Holocene. However, large temperature fluctuations are evident within this trend, with rapid changes of up to 4 degrees C visible between 11200 and 9500 cal a BP. The continued presence of hunter-gatherers during this time suggests that the region must have remained attractive to human populations despite significant climatic instability and cool episodes.

DAC can therefore be used alongside other negative emissions technologies, in principle, to mitigate CO2 emissions from a wide variety of sources, including those that are mobile and dispersed. The ultimate fate of the CO2, whether it is stored, reused, or utilised, along with choices related to the energy and materials inputs for a DAC process, dictates whether or not the overall process results in negative emissions.

As we find that man has altered the planet at just about every scale we are capable of measuring, the question concerning the essence of technology, in its power to not only imitate but in many ways even surpass the forces of nature, has become critical for the discussion about global environmental change. Often, the empirical findings of the geosciences have been interpreted as a motive to question the long-standing dualism between nature and artifice that itself has served, during almost the entirety of the history of Western philosophy, as the productive tension through which concepts such as technology and history have hitherto been conceptualized. But if much of our contemporary discourse on global environmental change is premised upon the functional and formal similarities between natural and artificial organs, I argue that returning to the intellectual current of 1920s and 30s Weimar Culture, where the relationship between globalization and industrialization first became of central hermeneutic concern, may shed new light on the Anthropocene as the conceptual site for a resurged geoaesthetics that denotes the ontological ubiquity of the designed environment, making the technological the foundation for a modern typological cosmology. Examining Ernst Junger's early work on the meaning of the planetary impact of modern technology, I caution that by reifying the cybernetic disclosure of the earth as a natural-artificial hybrid into a naturalistic ontology of work, we are liable to render our planet perfectly functional to its sustained instrumental appropriation as standing-reserve.","[Andersson, J.

In areas of downwelling the simulated surface-ocean bomb C-14 maxima occur too early with too much amplitude. This indicates inadequate vertical mixing and coupling between the wind driven and deeper regions of the ocean with a piling up of radiocarbon and CO2 in the upper ocean.

With regard to the increasing demand for high-resolution temperature data for climate impact studies, a statistical approach is presented, which allows estimating high-resolution near-surface temperature fields in complex terrain. High-resolution free air temperatures are derived from climate model data by considering the current stratification of the atmosphere. The residuals compared with in situ observation of near-surface temperatures are subsequently analyzed using a regression tree approach with suitable large-scale atmospheric and local-scale terrain parameters as predictors. The model identifies the predominant synoptic and topographic controls for the local-scale distribution of residuals and can be used to regionalize residual fields with high spatial resolution. The disadvantage that a tree-structured model generates stepwise constant predictant values can be overcome by integrating a fuzzifying routine. A fuzzified regression tree model was applied to analyze and predict the spatial and temporal variability of topographically induced temperatures for a target area in the Central Himalayas. Large-scale atmospheric variables, derived from the ERA-Interim reanalysis, and local terrain parameters were used as potential predictors. The model sufficiently identified the main influencing factors for the temperature heterogeneity. The potential solar insolation was found to be the predominant predictor, but also, hydroclimatic large-scale variables were found to be crucial. During clear nights, the model showed a distinct elevation dependency of residuals which indicates the importance of nocturnal cold air drainage and accumulation for the local-scale temperature distribution in the highly structured target area.","Univ Hamburg, Inst Geog, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany",University of Hamburg,"Gerlitz, L (corresponding author), Univ Hamburg, Inst Geog, Bundesstr 55, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany.",lars.gerlitz@uni-hamburg.de,,,,,,,45,17,18,0,9,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0177-798X,1434-4483,,THEOR APPL CLIMATOL,Theor.

However, so far, there is no confirmation of a relation between model mean biases and variability. While most coupled models exhibit substantial sea surface temperature (SST) biases in the Tropical Atlantic, they are still able to reproduce reasonable SST variability in the basin. We investigate the relationship between the first- and second-order moments of the SST distribution in the equatorial Atlantic using Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 simulations. Results suggest that the ability of the coupled models to properly reproduce the interannual variability is linked to their ability to simulate a realistic seasonal cycle evolution, that is, a realistic cold tongue development and a realistic Bjerknes feedback during the beginning of summer, rather than to their ability to represent the summer SST climatology. Plain Language Summary To study climate change and natural climate variability, the climate community uses global coupled models. However, these models are not perfect; model systematic errors or biases appear due to approximations in the equations and misrepresentation of different parametrized processes. Biases affect all timescales: the climatology, the seasonal cycle evolution, and interannual variability. In the Tropical Atlantic, almost all state-of-the-art coupled models show very large biases in sea surface temperature. At the same time, this region has a very strong seasonal cycle and a leading mode of variability at equatorial latitudes called the Atlantic Nino. In the present study, by analyzing 36 coupled models, we conclude that it is essential to properly simulate the seasonal cycle evolution to yield a realistic simulation of the Atlantic Nino.","[Prodhomme, C.; Garcia-Serrano, J.] UB, Grp Meteorol, Barcelona, Spain; [Prodhomme, C.; Exarchou, E.; Garcia-Serrano, J.; Guemas, V.] BSC, Barcelona, Spain; [Voldoire, A.] CNRM, Meteo France CNRS UMR3589, Toulouse, France; [Deppenmeier, A. -L.] Wageningen Univ, Meteorol & Air Qual, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Deppenmeier, A. -L.] Royal Netherlands Meteorol Inst KNMI, RD Weather & Climate Models, De Bilt, Netherlands",University of Barcelona; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Earth Sciences & Astronomy (INSU); Meteo France; Wageningen University & Research; Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute,"Prodhomme, C (corresponding author), UB, Grp Meteorol, Barcelona, Spain.;Prodhomme, C (corresponding author), BSC, Barcelona, Spain.",chloe.prodhomme@ub.edu,"García-Serrano, Javier/I-5058-2015; Guemas, Virginie/B-9090-2016","García-Serrano, Javier/0000-0003-3913-0876; Deppenmeier, Anna-Lena/0000-0003-0549-7143; Prodhomme, Chloe/0000-0003-2304-8958; Guemas, Virginie/0000-0002-6340-3558",Spanish Juan de la Cierva program [IJCI-2016-30802]; Ramon y Cajal program [RYC-2016-21181]; EU-FP7 PREFACE Project [603521],Spanish Juan de la Cierva program(Spanish Government); Ramon y Cajal program(Spanish Government); EU-FP7 PREFACE Project,"Chloe Prodhomme and Javier Garcia-Serrano were supported by the Spanish Juan de la Cierva (IJCI-2016-30802) and Ramon y Cajal (RYC-2016-21181) programs, respectively.

The biogeochemical models exhibit different structural complexities, ranging from simple nutrient-restoring to multi-nutrient NPZD type models. We evaluate the simulations using the observed volume distribution of phosphate. The errors in these simulated volume class distributions are significantly larger when preformed phosphate (or regenerated phosphate) rather than total phosphate is considered. Our analysis reveals that models can achieve similarly good fits to observed total phosphate distributions for a very different partitioning into preformed and regenerated nutrient components. This has implications for the strength and potential climate sensitivity of the simulated biological carbon pump. We suggest complementing the use of total nutrient distributions for assessing model skill by an evaluation of the respective preformed and regenerated nutrient components.","[Duteil, O.; Koeve, W.; Oschlies, A.] Helmholtz Zentrum Ozeanforsch Kiel, GEOMAR, D-24105 Kiel, Germany; [Aumont, O.] Ctr IRD Bretagne, F-29280 Plouzane, France; [Bianchi, D.; Sarmiento, J.

Although wave energy is still less developed than other marine renewables, its high density, great potential and minimal environmental impact have renewed the interest of developers, investors and governments globally, also in view of the increasing awareness of climate change and of the necessity to reduce carbon emissions. In parallel with technological development, the reliable characterization of wave climate and of the associated energy resource is crucial to the design of efficient Wave Energy Converters and to an effective site-technology matching, especially in low-energy seas. The preliminary scrutiny of suitable technologies and the identification of promising sites for their deployment often rely on wave climatological atlases, yet a more detailed characterization of the local resource is needed to account for high-frequency spatial and temporal variability that significantly impact power generation and the economic viability of WEC farms. We present a high-resolution assessment of the wave energy resource at specific locations in the Mediterranean Sea, based on a 7-years dataset derived from the operative wave forecast system that has been developed at ENEA and has been running since 2013. The selected areas correspond to the target regions of the Blue Deal project, where energy resource estimates were combined with technical and environmental considerations, so as to identify optimal sites for Blue Energy exploitation, from a Maritime Spatial Planning perspective. The available resource at selected sites is analysed together with site theoretical productivity for three state-of-the art WECs, showing interesting potential for future deployment.","[Carillo, Adriana; Pisacane, Giovanna; Struglia, Maria Vittoria] ENEA, Dept Sustainabil, Div Model & Technol Risk Reduct, Climate Modeling Lab, Rome, Italy",Italian National Agency New Technical Energy & Sustainable Economics Development,"Pisacane, G (corresponding author), ENEA, Dept Sustainabil, Div Model & Technol Risk Reduct, Climate Modeling Lab, Rome, Italy.",giovanna.pisacane@enea.it,,,European Regional Development Fund [2019-2022],European Regional Development Fund(European Commission),This study has been developed in the framework of the Interreg Med BLUE-DEAL (2019-2022) project co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund.

During the last decades, the subject has experienced a constant decrease of importance, reflected in the loss of representation in most universities. After 200 years of existence, an insufficient theoretical basis and the prevalence of bibliographical and institutional studies on post-medieval periods have isolated the field and hindered interdisciplinary exchange. Here we present possible new perspectives, proposing wider methodological, chronological, thematic, and geographical areas of focus. This paper summarizes the development of the field over time and recommends content enhancement, providing a specific example of application from Roman France. Furthermore, we introduce a topical definition of forest history. Following the lead of other fields of the humanities and environmental sciences focussing on the past, forest history has to adapt to using other available archives in addition to historical written sources. In particular, historical and archeological timber as well as pollen are essential sources for the study of past forests. Research into forest history can substantially add to our understanding of relevant issues like societal responses to climate change and resource scarcity in the past and contribute to future scenarios of sustainability.","[Muigg, Bernhard] Albert Ludwigs Univ Freiburg, Chair Forest Hist, Inst Forest Sci, Freiburg, Germany; [Muigg, Bernhard; Tegel, Willy] Kenton Thurgau, Amt Archaol, Frauenfeld, Switzerland; [Tegel, Willy] Albert Ludwigs Univ Freiburg, Chair Forest Growth & Dendroecol, Inst Forest Sci, Freiburg, Germany",University of Freiburg; University of Freiburg,"Muigg, B (corresponding author), Albert Ludwigs Univ Freiburg, Chair Forest Hist, Inst Forest Sci, Freiburg, Germany.;Muigg, B (corresponding author), Kenton Thurgau, Amt Archaol, Frauenfeld, Switzerland.",muigg@dendroarchaeology.com,"Tegel, Willy/M-8187-2014",,"BadenWuerttemberg Ministry of Science, Research and Art; University of Freiburg","BadenWuerttemberg Ministry of Science, Research and Art; University of Freiburg","This article processing charge was funded by the BadenWuerttemberg Ministry of Science, Research and Art and the University of Freiburg in the funding program Open Access Publishing.",,171,1,1,2,4,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",2296-701X,,,FRONT ECOL EVOL,Front.

Results for a higher emissions scenario illustrate changes that may occur if dependence on fossil fuels continues over the coming century. Summertime precipitation is projected to decrease across much of the central NE, but increase over the southernmost and northernmost portions of the domain. Evaporation is expected to increase across the entire domain. The balance between these two results in a decrease in soil moisture content across most of the domain (by approximately 10 mm) and an increase in the summertime soil-moisture depletion rate (by approximately 10 mm/month). At the same time, an increase in both atmospheric near-surface specific and saturation specific humidity is projected, resulting in an increase in relative humidity across the southern portion of the domain, with slight decreases over the northern portion. Combined with an average increase in summer temperatures of 3.5A degrees C, the projected increase in relative humidity results in a marked increase in the average daily maximum heat index for the region on the order of 3.9A degrees C, as well as a 350-400% increase in the number of days with heat index values exceeding 32.2A degrees C (90A degrees F)-the level of extreme caution.

If the cap does not capture all sectors, we demonstrate that variations of a renewable energy subsidy change aggregate carbon emissions through an inter-industry leakage effect. We decompose this effect into intuitively intelligible components that depend in natural ways on measurable elasticity parameters. Raising the subsidy always reduces emissions if funded by a lump-sum tax, reinforcing recent findings that tightening environmental regulation can cause negative leakage. However, if the subsidy is funded by a levy on electricity, it can increase emissions. These results provide a valuable basis for an informed design of renewable energy policies and an accurate assessment of their effectiveness. We highlight how a state-of-the-art statistic used by governments to gauge such effectiveness, virtual emission reductions, is biased, because inter-industrial leakage effects are not captured.

J,"Gaffney, M",,,,"Gaffney, Michael",,,The Ice Age and Us: Imagining Geohistory in Kim Stanley Robinson's Shaman,SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"This essay examines how Kim Stanley Robinson's Shaman (2014) depicts the deep history of both humans and the Earth. Centered around humans living 32,000 years ago during the last ice age, it contributes to the genre of prehistoric fiction as well as, less obviously, climate fiction. As prehistoric fiction, it foregrounds the continuity of human identity across history, particularly our impulses toward art-making and science, and thereby challenges our sense of separation from the deep past. At the same time, Robinson's novel may also be understood as climate fiction. Typically, climate fiction is associated with contemporary global warming, but this article approaches the genre in terms of its tendency to envision environments historically, a capacity referred to here as the geohistorical imagination. While Shaman shares this imagination with other climate fictions, it differs remarkably from most ice-age narratives because it describes the slow pace of glaciation and the persistence of daily life, rather than the apocalypse. Drawing out the consequences of this figuration of geohistory, this essay argues in conclusion that Shaman enables us to think historically about global warming and the Anthropocene.","[Gaffney, Michael] Duke Univ, Program Literature, Durham, NC 27706 USA",Duke University,"Gaffney, M (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Program Literature, Durham, NC 27706 USA.",,,,,,,,45,1,1,0,4,SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES,GREENCASTLE,"DEPAUW UNIV, DEPT ROMANCE LANGUAGES, GREENCASTLE, IN 46135-0037 USA",0091-7729,,,SCI-FICTION STUD,Sci.-Fict.

Climate experts expect an increase of this trend in the future due to global warming. A GIS model has been developed to determine start and end of growing season by using daily temperature surfaces in high spatial resolution. The data set for generating the temperature maps can be both observations in the past and climate scenarios. Several temperature threshold variations, according to state-of-the-art definitions of the climatological growing season, are processed and result in maps of information about start, end and length of the growing season. With long-term analysis of yearly results, spatial and temporal shifts can be identified and spatially visualized. It provides a data base to support an understanding of climate impact on local scaled changes of environmental conditions. Therefore, adaptation strategies do not have to be based purely on changing signals of temperature but also on grassland-relevant interpretation of climate data in growing season parameters.","[Schaumberger, A.; Poetsch, E.

The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) hosts most of the world's alpine permafrost, yet its impending changes remain largely unclear, thereby affecting regional hydrological and ecological processes and the global carbon budget. By employing a land surface model adapted to simulate frozen ground, and using state-of-the-art multi-model and multi-scenario data from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6, changes in permafrost distribution and its thermal regimes on the QTP are systematically predicted under various shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs). Projections for SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 show that most of the continuous permafrost region of the QTP will persist through 2050. Much of the permafrost is likely to degrade in the late 21st century, with projected area losses of 44 +/- 4%, 59 +/- 5%, and 71 +/- 7%, respectively, by 2100. In particular, the Three Rivers Source region in the central eastern part of the QTP is a key area of permafrost degradation, where permafrost is most vulnerable and degradation occurs earliest. The mean annual ground temperature of QTP permafrost will increase by 0.8 +/- 0.2 degrees C, 2.0 +/- 0.3 degrees C, and 2.6 +/- 0.3 degrees C under SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5, respectively, and the active layer thickness will increase by 0.7 +/- 0.1 m, 1.5 +/- 0.3 m, and 3.0 +/- 1.0 m, respectively. The surviving permafrost under SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5 will be thermally unstable, which is a clear warning sign of complete disappearance.

We demonstrate how rare event algorithms can improve the statistics of extreme events in state-of-the-art climate models. We study extreme warm summers and heatwaves over France and Scandinavia with CESM1.2.2 in present-day climate. The algorithm concentrates the simulations on events of importance, and shifts the probability distributions of regional temperatures such that warm summers become common. We estimate return times of extremes orders of magnitude larger than what feasible with direct sampling, and we compute statistically significant composite maps of dynamical quantities conditional on the occurence of the extremes. We show that extreme warm summers are associated to wavenumber 3 hemispheric teleconnection patterns, and that the most extreme summers are related to the succession of rare subseasonal heatwaves. Plain Language Summary The impact of extreme climatic events is often dominated by the rarest events. These events have return times (a measure of how often they occur on average) of hundreds of years or more, but they could, and do, happen anytime. These events are poorly understood because of lack of statistics. Climate models are computationally expensive, and cannot be run for long enough to study events with return times longer than a few decades. We use a new computational technique that allows simulations to focus only on trajectories leading to extreme heatwaves over a target region, optimizing the use of computational resources. We thus gather robust statistics for seasonal heatwaves with return times of hundreds or thousands of years, and observe even rarer events impossible to observe otherwise. We find that extreme warm summer over France or Scandinavia are synchronized with extreme warm summers in specific regions of Asia and North-America by a teleconnection pattern extending over the entire Northern hemisphere. We also find suggestions that extreme warm summers over Scandinavia may occur in two distinct ways. This new method can be used to better study the impact of global warming on the risk of catastrophic events, and to improve their predictability.","[Ragone, F.; Bouchet, F.] Univ Claude Bernard, Univ Lyon, Ens Lyon, CNRS,Lab Phys, Lyon, France; [Ragone, F.] Catholic Univ Louvain, Georges Lemaitre Ctr Earth & Climate Res TECLIM, Earth & Life Inst, Louvain La Neuve, Belgium; [Ragone, F.] Royal Meteorol Inst Belgium, Brussels, Belgium",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon (ENS de LYON); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; Universite Catholique Louvain; Royal Meteorological Institute of Belgium,"Ragone, F (corresponding author), Univ Claude Bernard, Univ Lyon, Ens Lyon, CNRS,Lab Phys, Lyon, France.;Ragone, F (corresponding author), Catholic Univ Louvain, Georges Lemaitre Ctr Earth & Climate Res TECLIM, Earth & Life Inst, Louvain La Neuve, Belgium.;Ragone, F (corresponding author), Royal Meteorol Inst Belgium, Brussels, Belgium.",francesco.ragone@uclouvain.be,,"Ragone, Francesco/0000-0002-2493-7020","ACADEMICS grant of the IDEXLYON, project of the Universite de Lyon, PIA [ANR-16-IDEX-0005]; European Research Council under the European Union's seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013 Grant) [616811]","ACADEMICS grant of the IDEXLYON, project of the Universite de Lyon, PIA; European Research Council under the European Union's seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013 Grant)","This work was granted access to the HPC resources of CINES under the allocation 2019-A0070110575 of GENCI.

A fingerprint for the occurrence of QRA can be defined in terms of the zonally averaged surface temperature field. Examining state-of-the-art [Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5)] climate model projections, we find that QRA events are likely to increase by similar to 50% this century under business-as-usual carbon emissions, but there is considerable variation among climate models. Some predict a near tripling of QRA events by the end of the century, while others predict a potential decrease. Models with amplified Arctic warming yield the most pronounced increase in QRA events. The projections are strongly dependent on assumptions regarding the nature of changes in radiative forcing associated with anthropogenic aerosols over the next century. One implication of our findings is that a reduction in midlatitude aerosol loading could actually lead to Arctic de-amplification this century, ameliorating potential increases in persistent extreme weather events.","[Mann, Michael E.; Miller, Sonya K.] Penn State Univ, Dept Meteorol & Atmospher Sci, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Rahmstorf, Stefan; Kornhuber, Kai; Petri, Stefan; Coumou, Dim] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Earth Syst Anal, Potsdam, Germany; [Rahmstorf, Stefan] Univ Potsdam, Inst Phys & Astron, Potsdam, Germany; [Steinman, Byron A.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Duluth, MN 55812 USA; [Steinman, Byron A.] Univ Minnesota, Large Lakes Observ, Duluth, MN 55812 USA; [Coumou, Dim] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies IVM, Amsterdam, Netherlands",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; University of Potsdam; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Duluth; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Duluth; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Mann, ME (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Dept Meteorol & Atmospher Sci, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",mann@psu.edu,"Coumou, Dim/ABE-6666-2020; Rahmstorf, Stefan/A-8465-2010; Mann, Michael E/B-8472-2017","Coumou, Dim/0000-0003-2155-8495; Rahmstorf, Stefan/0000-0001-6786-7723; Mann, Michael E/0000-0003-3067-296X; Kornhuber, Kai/0000-0001-5466-2059; Petri, Stefan/0000-0002-4379-4643",BMBF,BMBF(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),D.C. and K.K. were supported by the BMBF.,,38,74,74,1,16,AMER ASSOC ADVANCEMENT SCIENCE,WASHINGTON,"1200 NEW YORK AVE, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20005 USA",2375-2548,,,SCI ADV,Sci.

Current state-of-the-art deep learning methods are based on self-attention and use satellite image time series (SITS) to discriminate crop types based on their unique growth patterns. However, existing methods generalize poorly to regions not seen during training mainly due to not being robust to temporal shifts of the growing season caused by variations in climate. To this end, we propose Thermal Positional Encoding (TPE) for attention-based crop classifiers. Unlike previous positional encoding based on calendar time (e.g. day-of-year), TPE is based on thermal time, which is obtained by accumulating daily average temperatures over the growing season. Since crop growth is directly related to thermal time, but not calendar time, TPE addresses the temporal shifts between different regions to improve generalization. We propose multiple TPE strategies, including learnable methods, to further improve results compared to the common fixed positional encodings. We demonstrate our approach on a crop classification task across four different European regions, where we obtain state-of-the-art generalization results.

Current numerical models, including climate system models (CSMs) and atmospheric general circulation models (AGCMs), have difficulties in capturing the fundamental and intrinsic features of the AAM. By applying the stochastic multicloud model (SMCM) to the state-of-the-art ECHAM6.3 atm model, we investigated the impacts of SMCM on the simulation of AAM precipitation. Though the modified model with the SMCM improves simulations of the AAM precipitation in June-July-August-September season, the solstice mode, the AAM domain, and the AAM precipitation intensity, deficiencies also exist in other aspects, that is, simulations of rainfall in December-January-February-March and April-May seasons, and the equinox mode. Analyses also unravelled the modified model improves in simulating the spatial patterns of seasonal variation of precipitation in the Indian monsoon region, western North Pacific monsoon region, and Australian monsoon region in terms of pattern correlation coefficient and normalized root-mean square error scores. The enhanced simulation of solar radiation in the modified model favours improving the performance of the simulated solstice mode. In addition, moisture budget analysis was applied to investigate physical processes that modulate the variations and distributions of AAM precipitation. Analyses revealed that variations and distributions of the vertical integral of moisture flux convergence is closely associated with changes in precipitation, while the stratification of vertical moist transport is associated with changes in precipitation over land in the AAM region. In addition, the modified model influences the AAM precipitation mainly through the variations of moisture flux convergence. The present work potentially provides a method to improve the simulated capability of AGCMs.","[Ma, Libin] Chinese Acad Meteorol Sci, State Key Lab Severe Weather, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Ma, Libin; Cao, Jian] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster Minist Educ KLME, Joint Int Res Lab Climate & Environm Change ILCEC, CIC FEMD,Sch Atmospher Sci, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Zijun] Hunan First Normal Univ, Sch Math & Computat Sci, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China",Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences (CAMS); Chinese Academy of Sciences; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Hunan First Normal University,"Ma, LB (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Meteorol Sci, South Zhongguancun St 46, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",malibin109@163.com,,"Ma, Libin/0000-0002-5236-5429","Basic Research Fund of CAMS Natural Science Foundation of China of Jiangsu Province [2018Z007, BK20180812]",Basic Research Fund of CAMS Natural Science Foundation of China of Jiangsu Province,"The Basic Research Fund of CAMS Natural Science Foundation of China of Jiangsu Province, Grant/Award Numbers: 2018Z007, BK20180812",,63,3,3,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0899-8418,1097-0088,,INT J CLIMATOL,Int.

Heat gained from upwelling and watermass transformation in the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean (PO) is transported through the ITF into the Indian Ocean, ultimately connecting to high-latitude regions of heat loss such as the North Atlantic. However, state-of-the-art General Circulation Models (GCMs) often poorly simulate upwelling, particularly in the eastern Pacific boundary regions. Recent studies have hypothesized that these difficulties may be related to biases in downstream ITF volume and heat transport, whereby insufficient warm surface water from the western PO passes through the ITF, a complex region that is hard to accurately represent in models. Here, we test this hypothesis using a coarse-resolution ocean model by artificially widening the ITF and allowing greater quantities of warm water to exit the western PO. This reduces the Indo-Pacific sea-surface height and pressure gradient biases. Using diagnostics in temperature coordinates, we trace the source of increased ITF warm-water transport to enhanced watermass transformation of cold-to-warm waters in the eastern tropical PO. Additional cool water is brought to the surface in the Cold Tongue region, resulting in an enhancement of surface flux-driven warming. However, we find only limited evidence for changes in upwelling at lower temperatures along the eastern PO margins, considerably less than hypothesized in a previous study. Our experiment provides useful insights to help understand simulated ITF mass and heat transport biases and their links with the tropical PO in GCMs.","[Eabry, M. D.; Holmes, R.

The work's multiple meanings emerge when the material is considered, for sealing wax, along with its traditional counterpart - the seal - stand for a particular kind of sensual and intellectual perception. Tu thus functions as a metaphor for the charged 'impressions' that leave their mark on the artist's mind, body, and senses during the planning and execution of an artwork, a mode of apprehension that Fabro extends to the experience of the observer as well. His material choice reflects the intense, intimate connection he envisions between his work and its eventual viewer, and even, if indirectly, the tense cultural and political climate in Italy at the time of the work's creation. Tu's medium thus signifies a 'sealing together' of the vital relationship that binds not only the artist to his art but also the artist's work to his viewer beginning with the instant of a work's conception.",,,,,,,,,,,56,0,0,0,2,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6540,,,OXFORD ART J,Oxf.

Contemporary data indicate that latitudinal dines in body size, predicted by BR, also exist in ectothermic organisms and in some groups appear to be fairly common. Despite plenty of data from literature, it is still impossible to estimate the frequency of Bergmann's clines occurrence in ectotherms as thoroughly as it is done for homoiotherms. Within large taxa of ectotherms (Arthropoda, Mollusca, Pisces), Bergmann's clines occur alongside with anti-Bergmann's and U-shaped ones. Since classic explanation of BR, which is based on thermoregulation principles, is not applicable to most ectotherms, quite a few hypotheses have been proposed that appeal to other foundations in search of such an explanation. One part of them suggests a direct modifying influence of temperature, though most authors look for adaptive sense in increase of ectotherms size at high latitudes and/or low temperatures. It appears that a single universal explanation of all the cases of Bergmann's variability in ectotherms can not be formulated. Observed clines, as it seems, arise as a result of synergetic interactions between several factors that are covaried with latitude (or altitude above sea level). It is not always possible to estimate the exact contribution of each one of them.","Omsk State Pedag Univ, Omsk 644099, Russia",Omsk State Pedagogical University,"Vinarski, MV (corresponding author), Omsk State Pedag Univ, Naberezhnaya Tukhachevskogo 14, Omsk 644099, Russia.",radix.vinarski@gmail.com,"Vinarski, Maxim/D-6103-2014","Vinarski, Maxim/0000-0002-7644-4164",,,,,128,2,3,1,69,MEZHDUNARODNAYA KNIGA,MOSCOW,"39 DIMITROVA UL., MOSCOW, 113095, RUSSIA",0044-4596,,,ZH OBSHCH BIOL,Zhurnal Obshchei Biol.,SEP-OCT,2013,5,,,,327,339,,,,,,13,Biology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics,245TE,25438565,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000326485900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper discusses the changes in land use and land cover for the past twenty-three years in the region altering the rich cultural heritage, revealing by the presence of numerous painted rock-shelter sites in the region. The land cover and land use changes in terms of deforestation, urban growth and development and sandstone mining have been evaluated in the present study. Some of the above-mentioned parameters have been quantified using remote sensing and GIS data by peeping into the past and the present demonstrating sufficient practical and scientific value for the present work. The use of landsat satellite data of appropriate spectral and spatial resolution are imperative in this research where two supervised classificatory schemes viz. MLC (maximum likelihood classification) and SVM (support vector machine) are implemented for image classification. Landsat images of the years 1989, 2000 and 2011 have been processed to detect the current and historical changes of cultural heritage sites in its structural and spectral aspects in one of the remote regions of central India that matched the ground truthing from the present day survey and field work. The techniques provided differential results and in terms of accuracy SVM performed better than MLC while detecting natural and archaeological change estimation of the contested landscape of rock art. The change analysis suggests the gradual and steady destruction of natural and cultural wealth of this area leading to complete fragility. The deforestation led to the exposure of painted sandstone rock-shelters with in situ archaeological deposits. In the recent past intensive sandstone mining till the present years is obliterating unique cultural heritage sites in this region of Central India. Finally, a set of guidelines has been recommended to employ good policies to align heritage conservation and development on the right track to promote sustainable land use cost-effectively.

Equally important to trends in the mean climate are changes in interannual variability, but changes in precipitation fluctuations are highly uncertain and the associated processes are unknown. Here, we use various state-of-the-art global climate model simulations to show that interannual variability of Arctic precipitation will likely increase markedly (up to 40% over the 21st century), especially in summer. This can be attributed to increased poleward atmospheric moisture transport variability associated with enhanced moisture content, possibly modulated by atmospheric dynamics. Because both the means and variability of Arctic precipitation will increase, years/seasons with excessive precipitation will occur more often, as will the associated impacts.","[Bintanja, R.; van der Wiel, K.; van der Linden, E.

Given the susceptibility of global water cycle to climate change and anthropogenic influence, the synthesis of science with sustainable reservoir operation strategy is required as part of an integrated approach to water management. Here, we take advantage of new approaches combining state-of-the-art computational models and a novel satellite-based reservoir operation scheme to spatially and temporally decompose Lake Victoria's TWS, which has been dam-controlled since 1954. A ground-based lake bathymetry is merged with a global satellite-based topography to accurately represent absolute water storage, and radar altimetry data is integrated in the hydrodynamic model as a proxy of reservoir operation practices. Compared against an idealized naturalized system (i.e., no anthropogenic impacts) over 2003-2019, reservoir operation shows a significant impact on water elevation, extent, storage and outflow, controlling lake dynamics and TWS. For example, compared to Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) data, reservoir operation improved correlation and root mean square error of basin-wide TWS simulations by 80% and 54%, respectively. Results also show that lake water storage is 20% higher under dam control and basin-wide surface water storage contributes 64% of TWS variability. As opposed to existing reservoir operation schemes for large-scale models, the proposed model simulates spatially distributed surface water processes and does not require human water demand estimates. Our proposed approaches and findings contribute to the understanding of Lake Victoria's water dynamics and can be further applied to quantify anthropogenic impacts on the global water cycle.

As GCMs reach storm-resolving scales, they need to be able to produce realistic precipitation intensity, duration, and frequency at fine scales with consideration of scale-aware parameterization. This study uses a state-of-the-art storm-resolving GCM with a nonhydrostatic dynamical core - the Model for Prediction Across Scales (MPAS), incorporated in the atmospheric component (Community Atmosphere Model, CAM) of the open-source Community Earth System Model (CESM), within the System for Integrated Modeling of the Atmosphere (SIMA) framework (referred to as SIMA-MPAS). At uniform coarse (here, at 120 km) grid resolution, the SIMA-MPAS configuration is comparable to the standard hydrostatic CESM (with a finite-volume (FV) dynamical core) with reasonable energy and mass conservation on climatological timescales. With the comparable energy and mass balance performance between CAM-FV (workhorse dynamical core) and SIMAMPAS (newly developed dynamical core), it gives confidence in SIMA-MPAS's applications at a finer resolution. To evaluate this, we focus on how the SIMA-MPAS model performs when reaching a storm-resolving scale at 3 km. To do this efficiently, we compose a case study using a SIMAMPAS variable-resolution configuration with a refined mesh of 3 km covering the western USA and 60 km over the rest of the globe. We evaluated the model performance using satellite and station-based gridded observations with comparison to a traditional regional climate model (WRF, the Weather Research and Forecasting model). Our results show realistic representations of precipitation over the refined complex terrains temporally and spatially. Along with much improved near-surface temperature, realistic topography, and land-air interactions, we also demonstrate significantly enhanced snowpack distributions. This work illustrates that the global SIMA-MPAS at storm-resolving resolution can produce much more realistic regional climate variability, finescale features, and extremes to advance both climate and weather studies. This next-generation storm-resolving model could ultimately bridge large-scale forcing constraints and better inform climate impacts and weather predictions across scales.","[Huang, Xingying; Gettelman, Andrew; Skamarock, William C.; Lauritzen, Peter Hjort; Curry, Miles; Herrington, Adam; Truesdale, John T.; Duda, Michael] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Boulder, CO 80305 USA",National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA,"Huang, XY (corresponding author), Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Boulder, CO 80305 USA.",xyhuang@ucar.edu,,"Lauritzen, Peter/0000-0001-7066-138X; Gettelman, Andrew/0000-0002-8284-2599",National Science Foundation [2004973],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),This research has been supported by the National Science Foundation (grant no. 2004973).,,57,0,0,2,2,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1991-959X,1991-9603,,GEOSCI MODEL DEV,Geosci.

These two methods are in agreement for the onset of the PETM and initial recovery, or the clay layer (main body''), but seem to differ in the final recovery phase of the event above the clay layer, where the carbonate contents rise and carbon isotope values return toward background values. Here we present a state-of-the-art age model for the PETM derived from a new orbital chronology developed with cycle stratigraphic records from sites drilled during ODP Leg 208 (Walvis Ridge, Southeastern Atlantic) integrated with published records from Site 690 (Weddell Sea, Southern Ocean, ODP Leg 113). During Leg 208, five Paleocene-Eocene (P-E) boundary sections (Sites 1262 to 1267) were recovered in multiple holes over a depth transect of more than 2200 m at the Walvis Ridge, yielding the first stratigraphically complete P-E deep-sea sequence with moderate to relatively high sedimentation rates (1 to 3 cm/ka, where a'' is years). A detailed chronology was developed with nondestructive X- ray fluorescence (XRF) core scanning records on the scale of precession cycles, with a total duration of the PETM now estimated to be similar to 170 ka. The revised cycle stratigraphic record confirms original estimates for the duration of the onset and initial recovery but suggests a new duration for the final recovery that is intermediate to the previous estimates by cycle stratigraphy and He-ET.","[Roehl, Ursula; Westerhold, Thomas] Univ Bremen, Ctr Marine Environm Sci MARUM, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; [Bralower, Timothy J.] Penn State Univ, Dept Geosci, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Zachos, James C.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA",University of Bremen; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz,"Rohl, U (corresponding author), Univ Bremen, Ctr Marine Environm Sci MARUM, Leobener Str, D-28359 Bremen, Germany.",uroehl@marum.de,"Zachos, James C/A-7674-2008; Röhl, Ursula/G-5986-2011; Westerhold, Thomas/D-4581-2011","Zachos, James C/0000-0001-8439-1886; Röhl, Ursula/0000-0001-9469-7053; Westerhold, Thomas/0000-0001-8151-4684",,,,,51,278,290,4,115,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",,1525-2027,,GEOCHEM GEOPHY GEOSY,Geochem.

One such traditional craft called Namdads produced since ages in the state of Rajasthan which is famous throughout the world for its profile art treasures, for its scenic beauty and bracing climate so also for its crafts. The present study was an attempt to study the traditional Namda craft of Rajasthan. Efforts were directed towards documenting the traditional Namda art of Tonic and to highlight its unique characteristics with respect to methods, materials, implements, raw materials and surface ornamentation techniques employed. Concern was also given towards reflecting the present scenario of this handicraft industry. Another major objective was to study the socio-economic profile of the craftsmen involved in the craft.

Using a hierarchy of simulations with a state-of-the-art ocean-biogeochemical model, we demonstrate that the canonical isotopic gradient of 2-3 parts per thousand between the Pacific and Atlantic sectors of the Arctic Ocean has grown to 3-4 parts per thousand and will continue to expand under a high emissions climate change scenario by the end of the twenty-first century. delta N-15 increases in the Pacific-influenced high Arctic due to increased primary production, while Atlantic sector decreases result from the integrated effects of Atlantic inflow and anthropogenic inputs. While these trends will complicate longitudinal food web studies using delta N-15, they may aid those focussed on movement as the Arctic isoscape becomes more regionally distinct.","[Buchanan, Pearse James; Tagliabue, Alessandro; de la Vega, Camille; Mahaffey, Claire] Univ Liverpool, Dept Earth Ocean & Ecol Sci, 4 Brownlow St, Liverpool L69 3GP, Merseyside, England; [de la Vega, Camille] Leibniz Inst Balt Sea Res, D-18119 Rostock, Germany",University of Liverpool; Leibniz Institut fur Ostseeforschung Warnemunde,"Buchanan, PJ (corresponding author), Univ Liverpool, Dept Earth Ocean & Ecol Sci, 4 Brownlow St, Liverpool L69 3GP, Merseyside, England.",pearse.buchanan@liverpool.ac.uk; A.Tagliabue@liverpool.ac.uk; De-La-Vega@liverpool.ac.uk; mahaffey@liverpool.ac.uk,"Buchanan, Pearse James/P-1626-2014","Buchanan, Pearse James/0000-0001-7142-882X","ARISE Project, part of the Changing Arctic Ocean Programme - UKRI Natural Environmental Research Council (NERC) [NE/P006035/1]; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)","ARISE Project, part of the Changing Arctic Ocean Programme - UKRI Natural Environmental Research Council (NERC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF))","PJB, AT, CDLV, and CM were supported by the ARISE Project (NE/P006035/1), part of the Changing Arctic Ocean Programme, jointly funded by the UKRI Natural Environmental Research Council (NERC) and the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF).

Recently, several studies have considered Deep Learning to parameterize subgrid forcing within macroscale ocean equations using data from ocean-only simulations with idealized geometry. We present a stochastic Deep Learning parameterization that is trained on data generated by CM2.6, a high-resolution state-of-the-art coupled climate model. We train a Convolutional Neural Network for the subgrid momentum forcing using macroscale surface velocities from a few selected subdomains with different dynamical regimes. At each location of the coarse grid, rather than predicting a single number for the subgrid momentum forcing, we predict both the mean and standard deviation of a Gaussian probability distribution. This approach requires training our neural network to minimize a negative log-likelihood loss function rather than the Mean Square Error, which has been the standard in applications of Deep Learning to the problem of parameterizations. Each estimate of the conditional mean subgrid forcing is thus associated with an uncertainty estimate-the standard deviation-which will form the basis for a stochastic subgrid parameterization. Offline tests show that our parameterization generalizes well to the global oceans and a climate with increased CO2 levels without further training. We then implement our learned stochastic parameterization in an eddy-permitting idealized shallow water model. The implementation is stable and improves some statistics of the flow. Our work demonstrates the potential of combining Deep Learning tools with a probabilistic approach in parameterizing unresolved ocean dynamics.","[Guillaumin, Arthur P.; Zanna, Laure] NYU, Courant Inst Math Sci, New York, NY 10012 USA",New York University,"Guillaumin, AP (corresponding author), NYU, Courant Inst Math Sci, New York, NY 10012 USA.",ag7531@nyu.edu,"Zanna, Laure/L-3169-2019","Zanna, Laure/0000-0002-8472-4828",Schmidt Futures; NSF-GEO [1912357]; NOAA [CVP NA19OAR4310364],Schmidt Futures; NSF-GEO; NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA),"This research was made possible by Schmidt Futures, a philantropic initiative founded by Eric and Wendy Schmidt, as part of its Virtual Earth System Research Institute (VESRI).

Through the development of eco-geotechnics, various eco-friendly technologies have been developed to mitigate sandstorms and to improve the performance of earthen structures such as embankments, slopes and landfill covers. This state-of-the-art review introduces and discusses the important advances in the field of eco-geotechnics, covering theoretical developments, laboratory testing, centrifuge modelling, field monitoring and engineering applications. Finally, the research gaps and future needs of eco-geotechnics are highlighted and discussed.","[Ng, Charles Wang Wai; Zhang Qi] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Hong Kong 999077, Peoples R China; [Zhou Chao] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Hong Kong 999077, Peoples R China; [Ni JunJun] Southeast Univ, Sch Transportat, Nanjing 211189, Peoples R China",Hong Kong University of Science & Technology; Hong Kong Polytechnic University; Southeast University - China,"Ni, JJ (corresponding author), Southeast Univ, Sch Transportat, Nanjing 211189, Peoples R China.",nijunjun@seu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [U20A20320]; Environment and Conservation Fund [ECWW19EG01]; Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China [AoE/E-603/18, 16209522, 16210420, 16207819, 16212218]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [3221002220A1]; State Key Laboratory of Subtropical Building Science in South China University of Technology [2022ZC01]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Environment and Conservation Fund; Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China(Hong Kong Research Grants Council); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); State Key Laboratory of Subtropical Building Science in South China University of Technology","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. U20A20320), the Environment and Conservation Fund (Grant No. ECWW19EG01), and the Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China (Grant Nos.

The aim of this study was to investigate the impacts of grassland management and abandonment on soil carbon distribution in light (< 1.6 g?cm3) particulate organic matter (POM) and aggregation along a gradient of management intensity including hay meadows, pastures, and abandoned grasslands. The reduction of management intensity is an interregional phenomenon throughout the European Alps. We therefore selected sites from two typical climate regions, namely at Stubai Valley, Austria (MAT: 3 degrees C, MAP: 1097 mm) and Matsch Valley, Italy (MAT: 6.6 degrees C, MAP: 527 mm), to evaluate effects of land-use change in relation to climate. Free water-floatable and free POM (wPOM, fPOM), and an occluded POM fraction (oPOM), were isolated from three water-stable aggregate size classes (26.3 mm, 0.252 mm, < 0.25 mm) using density fractionation. Aggregate mean weight diameter slightly decreased with decreasing management intensity. In contrast to absolute POM-C, fPOM-C increased in aggregates at both sites with abandonment. Because the oPOM-C was less affected by abandonment, the ratio of oPOM-C : fPOM-C shifted from > 1 to < 1 from meadow to abandoned grassland in aggregates at both sites and thus independent of climate. This suggests that in differently managed mountain grasslands free and occluded POM are functionally different SOM fractions. In bulk soil, the oPOM-C : fPOM-C ratio is better suited as an indicator for the response of SOM to management reduction in subalpine grasslands than the total soil C, absolute or relative POM-C content.","[Meyer, Stefanie; Leifeld, Jens; Fuhrer, Juerg] Agroscope Res Stn Reckenholz Tanikon ART, Air Pollut Climate Grp, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland; [Bahn, Michael] Univ Innsbruck, Inst Ecol, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria",Swiss Federal Research Station Agroscope; University of Innsbruck,"Leifeld, J (corresponding author), Agroscope Res Stn Reckenholz Tanikon ART, Air Pollut Climate Grp, Reckenholzstr 191, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland.",jens.leifeld@art.admin.ch,"Bahn, Michael/I-3536-2013; Leifeld, Jens/A-3298-2014; Leifeld, Jens/GYR-0349-2022","Bahn, Michael/0000-0001-7482-9776; Leifeld, Jens/0000-0002-7245-9852; Leifeld, Jens/0000-0002-7245-9852",Swiss Federal Office for Education and Science [639]; Federal Office for the Environment,Swiss Federal Office for Education and Science; Federal Office for the Environment,"This work was funded by the Swiss Federal Office for Education and Science in the framework of COST Action 639, and by the Federal Office for the Environment.

However, in the past few years, several airlines and stakeholders (notably catering companies) have increased their efforts to tackle this issue. A number of factors such as low landfill disposal rates, particularly for inorganic fractions, lack of appropriate facilities and restrictive regulations had traditionally discouraged airlines and other actors to proactively look for solutions. LIFE+ Zero Cabin Waste aims to create a sustainable model to reduce, re-use and recycle (including energy recovery) waste recollected in Iberia airplane cabins in Madrid-Barajas Airport (Spain) and set the basis for its replication by other airlines and related stakeholders in the future. The objectives of this project are: properly separate the cabin waste on board, demonstrate that waste can be dealt with in a more environmentally friendly way contributing to the reduction of the high carbon footprint associated to the generation and the current inadequate management of cabin waste and set the basis for replication through standard protocols. The project, although it is in the first stage, has already been laid the bases and recommendations for future implementations and improvements that will allow reaching the proposed objectives.","[Blanca-Alcubilla, Gonzalo; Bala, Alba; Fullana-i-Palmer, Pere] Univ Pompeu Fabra, UNESCO, Chair Life Cycle & Climate Change, ESCI, Passeig Pujades 1, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Ignacio Hermira, Juan] IBERIA, Calle Martinez Villergas 49, Madrid 28027, Spain; [De-Castro, Nieves] GATE GOURMET, Carretera Munoza, Madrid 28042, Spain; [Chavarri, Rosa] ECOEMBES, Paseo Castellana 83-85, Madrid 28046, Spain; [Perales, Ruben] FERROVIAL, C Uranio 18, Fuenlabrada 28946, Spain; [Barredo, Ivan] BIOGAS FUEL & CELL, Calle Ada Byron 107, Gijon 33203, Asturias, Spain",Pompeu Fabra University,"Fullana-i-Palmer, P (corresponding author), Univ Pompeu Fabra, UNESCO, Chair Life Cycle & Climate Change, ESCI, Passeig Pujades 1, Barcelona 08003, Spain.",pere.fullana@esci.upf.edu,"Fullana-i-Palmer, Pere/J-6174-2013; Gala, Alba Bala/J-8625-2017","Fullana-i-Palmer, Pere/0000-0003-0013-5098; Gala, Alba Bala/0000-0002-5501-1140",European Union through the LIFE Programme [LIFE/ENV/ES209],European Union through the LIFE Programme,"ZERO CABIN WASTE (LIFE/ENV/ES209) is co-financed by the European Union through the LIFE Programme.

Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Earth System Model Version 2M (GFDL-ESM2M) and Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate version 5 (MIROC5) are the two models that exhibit realistic ENSO nonlinearity. With quadrupled atmospheric carbon dioxide, the ENSO amplitude of GFDL-ESM2M decreases by about 40%, whereas that of MIROC5 remains almost constant. Because GFDL-ESM2M exhibits stronger climatological thermal stratification than MIROC5, greenhouse gas forcing increases the upper ocean stability and causes the thermocline to be less sensitive to wind perturbations. The stiffer thermocline inhibits the nonlinear variations of sea surface temperature so that the ENSO amplitude substantially weakens. Idealized nonlinear recharge oscillator model experiments further support climatological thermal stratification as a determinant of the warming response. Observations exhibit stronger thermal stratification than both models, which suggests that the real world may terminate strong, nonlinear El Ninos sooner than model-based projections. Plain Language Summary The El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is the most prominent mode of interannual natural variability that influences global-mean temperature, severe weather, tropical cyclone activity, marine ecosystems, and food production worldwide. Potential future changes in ENSO under global warming have been disputed, however, due to difficulty in reproducing the observed ENSO features by global climate models. ENSO nonlinearity (i.e., El Nino events tend to be stronger than La Nina events in the real world) is one of those difficult features. Here we show that ENSO nonlinearity, though not reproduced well by most state-of-the-art climate models, could play a major role in determining the ENSO response. We examine two climate models that successfully reproduce realistic ENSO nonlinearity to discuss potentially important physical processes. Our results support a notion that strong El Nino events may be terminated in the near future.","[Kohyama, Tsubasa] Univ Tokyo, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Tokyo, Japan; [Hartmann, Dennis L.; Battisti, David S.] Univ Washington, Dept Atmospher Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",University of Tokyo; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Kohyama, T (corresponding author), Univ Tokyo, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Tokyo, Japan.",kohyama@uw.edu,"Battisti, David S/A-3340-2013; Kohyama, Tsubasa/Q-6214-2017","Battisti, David S/0000-0003-4871-1293; Kohyama, Tsubasa/0000-0002-5606-2062; Hartmann, Dennis/0000-0002-4495-7774",National Science Foundation (NSF) [AGS-1549579]; Takenaka Scholarship Foundation; Tamaki Foundation,National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Takenaka Scholarship Foundation; Tamaki Foundation,"This study is based on data from the GFDL Data Portal (http://nomads.gfdl.noaa.gov:8080/DataPortal/cmip5.jsp), the Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison website (https://pcmdi.llnl.gov/projects/cmip5/), and the GODAS data set (http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/gridded/data.godas.html).

They are needed for the calculation of turbulent fluxes in the surface layer and often rely on the Monin-Obukhov similarity theory requiring universal stability functions. The problem of a derivation of transfer coefficients based on different stability functions has been considered by many researchers over the years but it remains to this day. In this work, dedicated to the memory of S.S. Zilitinkevich, we also address this task, and obtain transfer coefficients from three pairs of theoretically derived stability functions suggested by Zilitinkevich and co-authors for stable conditios. Additionally, we construct non-iterative parametrizations of these transfer coefficients based on earlier work. Results are compared with state-of-the-art coefficients for land, ocean, and sea ice. The combined parametrizations form a package in a universal framework relying on a semi-analytical solution of the Monin-Obukhov similarity theory equations. A comparison with data of the Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic Ocean campaign (SHEBA) over sea ice reveals large differences between the coefficients for land conditions and the measurements over sea ice. However, two schemes of Zilitinkevich and co-authors show, after slight modification, good agreement with SHEBA although they had not been especially developed for sea ice. One pair of the modified transfer coefficients is superior and is compatible to earlier SHEBA-based parametrizations. Finally, an algorithm for practical use of all transfer coefficients in climate models is given.","[Gryanik, Vladimir M.] Russian Acad Sci, Obukhov Inst Atmospher Phys, Moscow, Russia; [Luepkes, Christof] Alfred Wegener Inst, Helmholtz Zentrum Polar & Meeresforsch, Bremerhaven, Germany","Russian Academy of Sciences; Obukhov Institute of Atmospheric Physics of Russian Academy of Sciences; Helmholtz Association; Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar & Marine Research","Lupkes, C (corresponding author), Alfred Wegener Inst, Helmholtz Zentrum Polar & Meeresforsch, Bremerhaven, Germany.",vgryanik@googlemail.com; Christof.Lueplces@awi.de,"amplification,  - Arctic/AAU-6640-2020; Lupkes, Christof/B-4897-2014","Lupkes, Christof/0000-0001-6518-0717","Helmholtz Association (HGF, Germany) [HRSF0036]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG; German Research Foundation) within the Transregional Collaborative Research Center Arctic Amplification ((AC)3) [268020496 TRR 172]","Helmholtz Association (HGF, Germany); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG; German Research Foundation) within the Transregional Collaborative Research Center Arctic Amplification ((AC)3)","Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.

This is compounded by future climate scenarios which indicate more frequent and severe heat waves in certain locations. There are members of communities that are more vulnerable to the effects of heat waves such as the elderly and infants and this presents particular challenges for the future. Hence it is timely to undertake a critical and systematic review of the effects of heat waves and mechanisms.to mitigate their effects. There are significant implications associated with heat waves such as extra power consumption, community health, water consumption and quality, and additional costs within the natural and built environments. One of the critical issues is peak electricity demand which is closely linked with factors such as building occupant health and costs to consumers. Utilization of renewable and sustainable energy helps to mitigate this specific issue. Common policy instruments to deal with risks associated with heat waves include heat impact assessment and heat warning system. Similarly, building design should take impacts of heat waves into consideration such as dwelling adaptation. This review provides useful inputs to both policy making and industry practice on improving the resilience of urban and regional areas in the event of extreme weather conditions such as heat waves in the future.

Our aim is to better understand the mechanisms underlying the astronomical forcing of this low-latitude climate system in detail. The North African monsoon is strengthened when northern hemisphere summer insolation is higher, as is the case in the minimum precession and maximum obliquity experiments. In these experiments, the low surface pressure areas over the Sahara are intensified and located farther north, and the meridional pressure gradient is further enhanced by a stronger South Atlantic high pressure area. As a result, the southwesterly monsoon winds are stronger and bring more moisture into the monsoon region from both the northern and southern tropical Atlantic. The monsoon winds, precipitation and convection also extend farther north into North Africa. The precession-induced changes are much larger than those induced by obliquity, but the latter are remarkable because obliquity-induced changes in summer insolation over the tropics are nearly zero. Our results provide a different explanation than previously proposed for mechanisms underlying the precession- and, especially, obliquity-related signals in paleoclimate proxy records of the North African monsoon. The EC-Earth experiments reveal that, instead of higher latitude mechanisms, increased moisture transport from both the northern and southern tropical Atlantic is responsible for the precession and obliquity signals in the North African monsoon. This increased moisture transport results from both increased insolation and an increased tropical insolation gradient.","[Bosmans, J. H. C.; Tuenter, E.; Hilgen, F. J.; Lourens, L.

We present new laboratory and field measurements showing that 7-9% of kerosene consumed by widely used simple wick lamps is converted to carbonaceous particulate matter that is nearly pure BC. These high emission factors increase previous BC emission estimates from kerosene by 20-fold, to 270 Gg/year (90% uncertainty bounds: 110, 590 Gg/year). Aerosol climate forcing on atmosphere and snow from this source is estimated at 22 mW/m(2) (8, 48 mW/m(2)), or 7% of BC forcing by all other energy-related sources. Kerosene lamps have affordable alternatives that pose few clear adoption barriers and would provide immediate benefit to user welfare.

Thermal stress events can cause reduced performance, morbidity, and mortality, resulting in significant economic losses and animal welfare concerns. Environment control in confined animal housing systems is typically based on heat and moisture production rates at predetermined ambient temperature levels measured between 1950 and 1980. This traditional control method can fall short in meeting the true thermal needs of the animals since it does not account for factors now acknowledged as affecting the animal's productive responses to surrounding conditions, such as humidity, drafts, radiation, physiological state, and social interactions. Also, advancements in animal genetics, nutrition, and management practices have led to considerable changes in sensible and latent heat loads of modern livestock buildings. In this context, precision livestock farming technologies (sensors, detectors, cameras, microphones, etc.), enabling the automatic monitoring of environmental, physiological, and behavioural variables, can be used to continuously assess livestock performance and well-being in relation to their environment. An innovative strategy for environment control of livestock buildings could include the analysis of: (i) heat and moisture production rates using the most recent bioenergetic models; (ii) thermal stress through multi-factor animal comfort indices based on some environmental and physiological measurements; and (iii) animal behaviour as a response to changing environmental conditions. This paper presents a critical review of the state of the art of precision environment control of livestock buildings, identifying knowledge gaps, research opportunities, and technical challenges.(C) 2016 IAgrE.

However, the major causes of this change remain unclear, and none of the current state-of-the-art process-based hydrological models are able to reproduce the significantly drying/wetting trends in GRACE TWS. Here we investigate 12 terrestrial regions that show a significantly drying/wetting trend, using partial least-square regression (PLSR) to relate TWS anomalies to various climatic variables and leaf area index (LAI). Through PLSR modeling, we find changes in LAI, downward longwave radiation (DLW) and precipitation are most strongly associated with a wetting trend. Increases in precipitation appear to be responsible for the wetting trend in tropical/subtropical monsoon regions, while decreases in vegetation transpiration and atmospheric demand appear to be responsible for the wetting trend in extratropical regions. Enhanced atmospheric demand caused by increases in air temperature and the resulting enhanced DLW dominates the significant drying trend in the mid-latitude subtropical drylands, and in the cold and alpine regions. The PLSR modeling also suggests that, over global continents, the climatic forcing factors show a dominant impact on TWS over all the wetting regions, while only four out of the seven drying regions show climate-dominated drying, implying an additional impact of anthropogenic responses to the water stress on drying.","[Yuan, Rui-Qiang] Shanxi Univ, Sch Environm & Resource, Taiyuan 030006, Shanxi, Peoples R China; [Yuan, Rui-Qiang; Chang, Li-Ling; Gupta, Hoshin; Niu, Guo-Yue] Univ Arizona, Dept Hydrol & Atmospher Sci, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA",Shanxi University; University of Arizona,"Yuan, RQ (corresponding author), Shanxi Univ, Sch Environm & Resource, Taiyuan 030006, Shanxi, Peoples R China.;Yuan, RQ; Niu, GY (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Dept Hydrol & Atmospher Sci, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",rqyuan@sxu.edu.cn; niug@email.arizona.edu,"Gupta, Hoshin V/D-1642-2010; Yuan, Ruiqiang/L-4605-2016; Niu, Guo-Yue/B-8317-2011; Gupta, Hoshin V/CAG-5323-2022","Gupta, Hoshin V/0000-0001-9855-2839; Niu, Guo-Yue/0000-0003-2105-7690; Gupta, Hoshin V/0000-0001-9855-2839",NASA MAP Program [80NSSC17K0352]; China scholarship council; Australian Research Council Center of Excellence [CE170100023]; Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence [CE170100023]; NOAAOAR's OWAQ [NA18OAR4590397],NASA MAP Program(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); China scholarship council(China Scholarship Council); Australian Research Council Center of Excellence(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence(Australian Research Council); NOAAOAR's OWAQ,"This research project was funded by NASA MAP Program (80NSSC17K0352), NOAAOAR's OWAQ (NA18OAR4590397), and the China scholarship council.

He lived from 73/74 BCE to 4 CE. He died with an illness and symptoms that have been the source of considerable speculation. Richard Strauss depicted Herod in his classic opera, Salome. That opera was derived from a play of the same name by Oscar Wilde, which was based on an 1876 painting, Salome Dancing Before Herod, by Gustave Moreau. The operatic Herod was afflicted with an illness characterized by dementia, hallucinations, paranoia, alcoholism (from drinking the Emperor's wine), violence, twitches, and sterility; different interpretations showed him also with falls, chills, shaking, thirst, forgetfulness, and sleepiness, for which we suggest the novel diagnosis of chronic lead intoxication (which can manifest to rheumatologists as saturnine gout). He had compatible symptoms (encephalopathy and neuromuscular abnormalities) and consumed excessive quantities of imperial wine, known to be highly contaminated with lead and likely associated with similar symptoms among Roman aristocracy. Herod's demented cruelties-an oppressive reign which including the beheading of John the Baptist-exacerbated the political climate and may have contributed to the subsequent violent 7-year revolt culminating in the destruction of the second temple. How different might history have been if Herod the Great had been abstemious?.","[Leatherwood, Cianna] Univ Southern Calif, Keck Sch Med, Dept Med, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Leatherwood, Cianna; Panush, Richard S.] USC LAC Med Ctr, Los Angeles, CA 90033 USA; [Leatherwood, Cianna] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Rheumatol, 75 Francis St, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Panush, Richard S.] Univ Southern Calif, Keck Sch Med, Div Rheumatol, Dept Med, Los Angeles, CA 90033 USA",University of Southern California; Los Angeles County+USC Medical Center; Harvard University; Brigham & Women's Hospital; University of Southern California,"Panush, RS (corresponding author), USC LAC Med Ctr, Los Angeles, CA 90033 USA.;Panush, RS (corresponding author), Univ Southern Calif, Keck Sch Med, Div Rheumatol, Dept Med, Los Angeles, CA 90033 USA.",cleatherwood@partners.org; panush@usc.edu,,,,,,,25,3,3,0,5,SPRINGER LONDON LTD,LONDON,"236 GRAYS INN RD, 6TH FLOOR, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND",0770-3198,1434-9949,,CLIN RHEUMATOL,Clin.

To do so, we analyse an ensemble of twelve atmosphere-only and six coupled GCMs, with different model formulations and with resolutions spanning those of state-of-the-art coupled GCMs, i.e. from resolutions coarser than 100km to resolutions finer than 25km. The main changes in the global energy budget with resolution are a systematic increase in outgoing longwave radiation and decrease in outgoing shortwave radiation due to changes in cloud properties, and a systematic increase in surface latent heat flux; when resolution is increased from 100 to 25km, the magnitude of the change of those fluxes can be as large as 5Wm(-2). Moreover, all but one atmosphere-only model simulate a decrease of the poleward energy transport at higher resolution, mainly explained by a reduction of the equator-to-pole tropospheric temperature gradient. Regarding hydrological processes, our results are the following: (1) there is an increase of global precipitation with increasing resolution in all models (up to 40x10(3) km(3)year(-1)) but the partitioning between land and ocean varies among models; (2) the fraction of total precipitation that falls on land is on average 10% larger at higher resolution in grid point models, but it is smallerat higher resolution in spectral models; (3) grid points models simulate an increase of the fraction of land precipitation due to moisture convergence twice as large as in spectral models; (4) grid point models, which have a better resolved orography, show an increase of orographic precipitation of up to 13x10(3) km(3)year(-1) which explains most of the change in land precipitation; (5) at the regional scale, precipitation pattern and amplitude are improved with increased resolution due to a better simulated seasonal mean circulation. We discuss our results against several observational estimates of the Earth'senergy budget and hydrological cycle and showthat they support recent high estimates of global precipitation.","[Vanniere, Benoit; Demory, Marie-Estelle; Vidale, Pier Luigi; Schiemann, Reinhard] Univ Reading, NCAS Climate, Dept Meteorol, Whiteknights Campus Earley Gate,POB 243, Reading RG6 6BB, Berks, England; [Roberts, Malcolm J.; Roberts, Christopher D.] Met Off Hadley Ctr, Exeter, Devon, England; [Roberts, Christopher D.; Senan, Retish] European Ctr Medium Range Weather Forecasting ECM, Reading, Berks, England; [Matsueda, Mio] Univ Tsukuba, Ctr Computat Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Terray, Laurent] Univ Toulouse, CECI, CNRS, CERFACS, Toulouse, France; [Koenigk, Torben] Swedish Meteorol & Hydrol Inst, Rossby Ctr, Norrkoping, Sweden",UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); NERC National Centre for Atmospheric Science; University of Reading; Met Office - UK; Hadley Centre; European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF); University of Tsukuba; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CERFACS; Universite de Toulouse; Swedish Meteorological & Hydrological Institute,"Vanniere, B (corresponding author), Univ Reading, NCAS Climate, Dept Meteorol, Whiteknights Campus Earley Gate,POB 243, Reading RG6 6BB, Berks, England.",b.vanniere@reading.ac.uk,"Schiemann, Reinhard/K-7755-2012; Vannière, Benoît/AAA-4546-2021; Senan, Retish/AAF-1798-2019; Roberts, Christopher David/AAA-6692-2020; Roberts, Christopher D/GRR-4034-2022; Vidale, Pier Luigi/AAF-6468-2019","Schiemann, Reinhard/0000-0003-3095-9856; Vannière, Benoît/0000-0001-8600-400X; Senan, Retish/0000-0003-1949-1893; Roberts, Christopher David/0000-0002-2958-6637; Roberts, Christopher D/0000-0002-2958-6637; Vidale, Pier Luigi/0000-0002-1800-8460; Matsueda, Mio/0000-0001-8913-1303; Demory, Marie-Estelle/0000-0002-5764-3248","European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [641727]; Joint U.

I then analyse each Germany's relation to its respective role in the Second World War, before examining how West/Germans in each text express either a German or a European identity.

In state-of-the-art climate models, the average response of the Asian monsoon cyclone, Pacific ocean anticyclone and jet stream to global warming is weak and responses of different models are diverse. Here we use a suite of simulations with atmospheric general circulation models with prescribed sea surface temperatures to separate the circulation responses to direct radiative forcing and indirect sea surface temperature warming. We find that the two contributions oppose each other. Using idealized aquaplanet simulations, we show that the different circulation responses are directly connected to the opposite responses of land-sea thermal contrast to the two forcing components. This tug of war on the circulation response to global warming is analogous to the seasonal response to insolation, which involves opposite land-sea thermal contrasts and circulation patterns governed by quasi-equilibrium thermodynamics and stationary-wave dynamics. We conclude that it is important to distinguish weak circulation responses to global warming that arise owing to compensating effects that are robust and physically understood from those that are associated with genuine uncertainty. We note that compensation places fundamental limits on the detection and attribution of circulation responses to global warming.","[Shaw, T.

The western Pacific Subtropical High (WPSH) is a prime circulation system affecting East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) and western North Pacific TS activities, but the sources of its variability and predictability have not been established. Here we show that the WPSH variation faithfully represents fluctuations of EASM strength (r = -0.92), the total TS days over the subtropical western North Pacific (r = -0.81), and the total number of TSs impacting East Asian coasts (r = -0.76) during 1979-2009. Our numerical experiment results establish that the WPSH variation is primarily controlled by central Pacific cooling/warming and a positive atmosphere-ocean feedback between the WPSH and the Indo-Pacific warm pool oceans. With a physically based empirical model and the state-of-the-art dynamical models, we demonstrate that the WPSH is highly predictable; this predictability creates a promising way for prediction of monsoon and TS. The predictions using the WPSH predictability not only yields substantially improved skills in prediction of the EASM rainfall, but also enables skillful prediction of the TS activities that the current dynamical models fail. Our findings reveal that positive WPSH-ocean interaction can provide a source of climate predictability and highlight the importance of subtropical dynamics in understanding monsoon and TS predictability.","[Wang, Bin] Univ Hawaii, Dept Meteorol, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Wang, Bin; Xiang, Baoqiang; Lee, June-Yi] Univ Hawaii, Int Pacific Res Ctr, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA",University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii System,"Wang, B (corresponding author), Univ Hawaii, Dept Meteorol, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",wangbin@hawaii.edu,"Lee, June-Yi/AAT-3407-2021; Lee, June-Yi/D-5752-2012; Xiang, Baoqiang/O-1890-2019; Xiang, Baoqiang/B-9353-2014","Lee, June-Yi/0000-0002-3986-9753; Lee, June-Yi/0000-0002-3986-9753; ","Korean Ministry of Education, Science and Technology through Global Research Laboratory Program [2011-0021927]; National Science Foundation [AGS-1005599]; Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Climate Center (APCC); International Pacific Research Center; Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; National Aeronautics and Space Administration; International Pacific Research Center (IPRC) [940]; School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology (SOEST) [8817]","Korean Ministry of Education, Science and Technology through Global Research Laboratory Program; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Climate Center (APCC); International Pacific Research Center; Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); National Aeronautics and Space Administration(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); International Pacific Research Center (IPRC); School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology (SOEST)","We thank Shibin Xu and Yuxing Yang for help with TC data and Dr. Tim Li for commenting on an initial version of the manuscript.

Often, such variation is considered at regional or global scales, but here we ask whether ecosystem-scale simulations can be used to better understand landscape-level variation that might be particularly important in complex terrain, such as high-elevation mountains. We performed ecosystem-scale simulations by using the Community Land Model (CLM) version 4.5 to better understand how the increased length of growing seasons may impact carbon, water, and energy fluxes in an alpine tundra landscape. The model was forced with meteorological data and validated with observations from the Niwot Ridge Long Term Ecological Research Program site. Our results demonstrate that CLM is capable of reproducing the observed carbon, water, and energy fluxes for discrete vegetation patches across this heterogeneous ecosystem. We subsequently accelerated snowmelt and increased spring and summer air temperatures in order to simulate potential effects of climate change in this region. We found that vegetation communities that were characterized by different snow accumulation dynamics showed divergent biogeochemical responses to a longer growing season. Contrary to expectations, wet meadow ecosystems showed the strongest decreases in plant productivity under extended summer scenarios because of disruptions in hydrologic connectivity. These findings illustrate how Earth system models such as CLM can be used to generate testable hypotheses about the shifting nature of energy, water, and nutrient limitations across space and through time in heterogeneous landscapes; these hypotheses may ultimately guide further experimental work and model development. Plain Language Summary Projecting ecosystem response to environmental change presents enormous challenges that are critical to understand for multiple stakeholders. These projections are complicated by complex interactions between physical drivers, like temperature and precipitation, and biotic agents like plants, animals, and soil microbes. Using long-term observations from a heterogeneous alpine ecosystem and a state-of-the-art land model, we explore how the physical environment shapes ecosystem function and how the function of this ecosystem may respond to climate change. We found that the land model was able to capture observed water, energy, and carbon fluxes from this well-studied alpine ecosystem, lending credibility to our results. Our simulations also indicated that earlier snowmelt and warmer summertime temperatures might drive divergent plant responses across the landscape. Notably, climate change may decouple the timing of snowmelt that delivers critical water resources from periods when plants experience the greatest water demand, thus altering plant productivity. Additionally, this work raises ecological questions that can be addressed with additional experimentation and/or model development.","[Wieder, William R.; Knowles, John F.; Suding, Katharine N.] Univ Colorado, Inst Arctic & Alpine Res, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Wieder, William R.; Swenson, Sean C.] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Climate & Global Dynam Lab, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [Blanken, Peter D.] Univ Colorado, Dept Geog, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Suding, Katharine N.] Univ Colorado, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Wieder, WR (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Inst Arctic & Alpine Res, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.;Wieder, WR (corresponding author), Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Climate & Global Dynam Lab, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA.",wwieder@ucar.edu,"Knowles, John F/B-1631-2013; Knowles, John/AAX-2990-2020; Wieder, William R./AAY-3338-2020; Suding, Katharine/O-6290-2017","Knowles, John F/0000-0002-3697-9439; Wieder, William R./0000-0001-7116-1985; Suding, Katharine/0000-0002-5357-0176; BLANKEN, PETER/0000-0002-7405-2220",NSF [DEB 1637686]; US Department of Agriculture [NIFA 2015-67003-23485],NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); US Department of Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)),"This research was supported by NSF grant DEB 1637686 to the Niwot Ridge LTER.

Uncertainties in mycorrhizal distributions are non-trivial, and current estimates disagree in up to 50% over 40% of the land area, including tropical forests. Remote sensing capabilities for mycorrhizal detection show promise for refining these estimates further. Here, we address for the first time the impact of mycorrhizal distributions on global carbon and nutrient cycling. Using the state-of-the-art carbon-nitrogen economics within the Community Land Model version 5, we found Net Primary Productivity (NPP) increased throughout the 21st century by 20%; however, as soil nitrogen has progressively become limiting, the costs to NPP for nitrogen acquisition-that is, to mycorrhizae-have increased at a faster rate by 60%. This suggests that nutrient acquisition will increasingly demand a higher portion of assimilated carbon to support the same productivity.","[Braghiere, R.

In pursuit of this aim, the research for this paper was built upon the discussion concerning Green Human Resource Management practices, which emerged with the Ability-Motivation-Opportunity theoretical lens to embed sustainability in such centers. It specifies a system of the key practices to implement a cleaner sustainability strategy within the sports center that has multiple effects at the macro, meso, and micro levels of society. In an attempt to address the lack of research on such a system, a novel multi-methods approach was implemented in three sections. The first section led to identifying an initial seven-factor structure based on factor analysis of a pilot study with ninety-seven respondents from the green community of Johor Darul Ta'zim Football Association. Next, interpretive structural modeling was performed using a survey of experts' judgment to develop the initial structure. Finally, structural equation modeling was considered to test the developed model. Upon validation of the proposed model, the results revealed a seven-factor interpretive structural equation model with four levels: performance management, and player involvement and empowerment; culture and supportive climate, and pay and reward systems; attracting and selecting; and training and development, and union role in player involvement and environmental management. The analyses indicated that there were strong relationships between these key practices throughout the system. The system highlighted practices toward correlating performance management, and player involvement and empowerment, which constitute the foundation for implementing the system. The research findings highlighted the importance of this system in making the transition to the notion of sustainable center in Johor Darul Ta'zim, as well as for other sports centers throughout Malaysia and other parts of the world.

Hereby, a strong motivational factor has been the goal to realize a win-win situation in the long term: climate neutrality and sustainable functioning are not only beneficial for the environment, but are equally beneficial for society and for the economy if well-integrated trajectories are adopted. Nevertheless, as actors across the fields start to implement these plans, many practical obstacles have arisen. These barriers are typical of a systemic transition: dominant practices are characterized by path dependencies, vast institutional frameworks and vested interests that are hard to break through. At the same time, relevant initiatives typically show some elements of uncertainty and a long term return, factors that make it difficult to attract financial investments. The present article addresses the state of the art for current transition experiments in the region of Flanders, Belgium, focusing on actions related to energy and buildings in cities. A brief overview of the state of affairs in several cities and provinces is presented, and some important opportunities and bottlenecks are identified. The resultant findings are tested against the framework of transition theory and related literature on the subject.

This is manifest in a distinct shift in ENSO behavior during the late 1970s. This study investigates mechanisms that may force this interdecadal variability and, in particular, on modulations driven by extratropical Rossby waves. Results from oceanic shallow-water models show that the Rossby wave theory can explain small near-zonal changes in equatorial thermocline depth that can alter the amplitude of simulated ENSO events. However, questions remain over whether the same mechanism operates in more complex coupled general circulation models (CGCMs) and what the magnitude of the resulting change would be. Experiments carried out in a state-of-the-art z-coordinate primitive equation model confirm that the Rossby wave mechanism does indeed operate. The effects of these interactions are further investigated using a partial coupling (PC) technique. This allows for the isolation of the role of wind stress-forced oceanic exchanges between the extratropics and the tropics and the subsequent modulation of ENSO variability. It is found that changes in the background state of the equatorial Pacific thermocline depth, induced by a fixed off-equatorial wind stress anomaly, can significantly affect the probability of ENSO events occurring. This confirms the results obtained from simpler models and further validates theories that rely on oceanic wave dynamics to generate Pacific Ocean interdecadal variability. This indicates that an improved predictive capability for seasonal-to-interannual ENSO variability could be achieved through a better understanding of extratropical-to-tropical Pacific Ocean transfers and western boundary processes. Furthermore, such an understanding would provide a physical basis to enhance multiyear probabilistic predictions of ENSO indices.","[McGregor, Shayne] Macquarie Univ, Dept Phys Geog, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia; [Sen Gupta, Alex] Univ New S Wales, Ctr Climate Change Res, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Holbrook, Neil J.] Univ Tasmania, Sch Geog & Environm Studies, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Power, Scott B.] Bur Meteorol, Ctr Australian Weather & Climate Res, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Macquarie University; University of New South Wales Sydney; University of Tasmania; Bureau of Meteorology - Australia; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"McGregor, S (corresponding author), Macquarie Univ, Dept Phys Geog, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia.",shayne.mcgregor@gmail.com,"Holbrook, Neil J/M-7544-2013; Gupta, Alexander R Sen/B-7995-2011; Power, Scott Brendan/AAF-3370-2019; McGregor, Shayne/A-9059-2013","Holbrook, Neil J/0000-0002-3523-6254; Gupta, Alexander R Sen/0000-0001-5226-871X; Power, Scott Brendan/0000-0002-9596-4368; McGregor, Shayne/0000-0003-3222-7042",Macquarie University Research Area Centre's of Excellence (RAACE) Scholarship; Australian Research Council Network for Earth System Science (ARCNESS),Macquarie University Research Area Centre's of Excellence (RAACE) Scholarship; Australian Research Council Network for Earth System Science (ARCNESS)(Australian Research Council),"We wish to thank Caroline Ummenhofer for providing the spun- up CCSM3 ocean component model.

The integration of thermal storage, especially latent heat storage (LHS), with SAHS significantly reduces the fluctuation in the availability of solar energy. The different designs of SAHS with LHS have been thoroughly reviewed in this article. The integrated collector storage (ICS) and non-integrated collector storage (NICS) type SAHS have been extensively reviewed and their performances have been compared. The effect of various design and operating parameters on the performance of SAHS with LHS have been presented. While the ICS-SAHS has been extensively studied in literature because of their simple design and low cost, the NICS-SAHS provides numerous benefits over ICS-SAHS like less thermal losses during discharging, high thermal storage capacity, and flexibility with better HTF. As a result, the effectiveness of the NICS-SAHS is superior to the ICS-SAHS. It is concluded that for improving the practical applicability of SAHS, more research should be directed towards developing efficient designs of NICS-SAHS.","[Sharma, Ashutosh; Chauhan, Ranchan] Dr BR Ambedkar NIT Jalandhar, Dept Mech Engn, Jalandhar 144011, Punjab, India; [Pitchumani, Ranga] Virginia Tech, Dept Mech Engn, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA",National Institute of Technology (NIT System); Dr B R Ambedkar National Institute of Technology Jalandhar; Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University,"Chauhan, R (corresponding author), Dr BR Ambedkar NIT Jalandhar, Dept Mech Engn, Jalandhar 144011, Punjab, India.",chauhan.303@gmail.com,,,,,,,135,7,7,4,8,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",,2352-152X,,J ENERGY STORAGE,J.

It explores the correlations between traditional risks associated with critical infrastructures - as understood by the Sendai framework - cyber security risks and the cascading effects characteristic of today's complex and interrelated shocks and stresses. It takes a step further, expanding the focus of traditionally understood technological risks to explore cyber security risks, at the heart of our societies' digital transformations,and showcase opportunities from the European context. Design/methodology/approach By reviewing existing literature on cyber security, disaster resilience and cascading disasters, this paper highlights current challenges and good practices undertaken by various governments. Findings Understanding disaster risks is a precondition to improving the mitigation of impacts of existing risks and preventing new risks. Effective risk reduction relies on a solid understanding of losses resulting from events to inform future actions, and on the assessment of risks relying on a robust evidence base and state-of-the-art scientific capacity to model and simulate potential hazards. In this context, embedding cyber security risks, and the complexity of cascading impacts in improving the understanding of disaster risks, calls for appropriate methods and tools allowing for a multi-risk and holistic focus to the assessment of risks and the planning of risk management capacities that follow. Research limitations/implications Globally and in Europe, focus on interconnected risk and their impacts is steadily increasing. Risk assessments are still conservative; incorporation of cyber resilience into national and local level DRR plans is yet not visible. Originality/value Existing research is restricted to cyber security and disaster resilience, as separated subjects. This paper, for the first time, brings together the interconnection between the two topic options to address them.","[Panda, Abhilash] Univ Huddersfield, Sch Art Design & Architecture, Huddersfield, W Yorkshire, England; [Panda, Abhilash; Bower, Andrew] United Nations Off Disaster Risk Reduct New York, New York, NY 10017 USA",University of Huddersfield,"Panda, A (corresponding author), Univ Huddersfield, Sch Art Design & Architecture, Huddersfield, W Yorkshire, England.;Panda, A (corresponding author), United Nations Off Disaster Risk Reduct New York, New York, NY 10017 USA.",abhilash.panda@hud.ac.uk; Andrew.bower@un.org,,,,,,,29,6,6,0,14,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1759-5908,1759-5916,,INT J DISASTER RESIL,Int.

No information regarding the independent effects of temperature measured proximally to the patient, the personal-level environmental temperature (PET), is available. Inclusion of daylight hours in multivariate analysis might allow exploring the independent interaction of BP with seasonality. To investigate whether ambulatory BP monitoring is affected by PET or by seasonality, 1897 patients referred to our hypertension units underwent ambulatory BP monitoring with a battery-powered temperature data logger fitted to the carrying pouch of the monitor. Predictors of 24-hour daytime and nighttime BP and of morning BP surge were investigated with a multivariate stepwise regression model, including age, sex, body mass index, antihypertensive treatment, office BP, ambulatory heart rate, PET, relative humidity, atmospheric pressure, and daylight hours as independent variables. At adjusted regression analysis, daytime systolic BP was negatively related to PET (-0.14; 95% confidence interval, -0.25 to -0.02); nighttime BP was positively related to daylight hours (0.63; 0.37-0.90); and morning BP surge was negatively related to daylight hours (-0.54; -0.87 to -0.21). These results provide new evidence that PET and seasonality (daylight hours) are 2 independent predictors of ambulatory BP monitoring.

Over the longer term (decades to centuries), many coastal communities will have to retreat inland away from the coast and toward something new. To date, there appears to be little consideration of how arts and humanities could be leveraged to encourage learning and experimentation to help communities adapt to our changing climate. In this article, we describe an interactive theater model that seeks to address the challenge of bridging scientific knowledge and community conversations on managed retreat and serve as an innovative tool to encourage more productive community conversations about adapting to rising sea levels. The interactive theater workshop consists of two components. The first is a set of short intertwining monologues by three characters (a municipal leader, a climate scientist, and a coastal property owner) who share their thoughts regarding the prospect of managed retreat. Each character provides a glimpse into the attitudes, values, motivations, and fears related to distinct and authentic perspectives on managed retreat. The monologues are followed by a professionally facilitated interactive session during which audienceparticipants are invited to probe characters' perspectives and even redirect and replay scenes in new ways to seek more constructive outcomes. The workshop is designed for all session participants to examine their own strengths and weaknesses when engaging others on this subject, to be more prepared to accommodate a range of emotional connections to the subject matter, and to anticipate social dynamics at play. The workshop has now been piloted at four different events. Initial feedback from post-workshop voluntary surveys suggest that the workshop is useful for improving the capacity of resilience professionals to encourage more productive conversations about difficult climate adaptation actions.","[Wake, Cameron] Univ New Hampshire, Inst Study Earth Oceans & Space, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Wake, Cameron] Univ New Hampshire, Sustainabil Inst, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Kaye, David] Univ New Hampshire, Dept Theatre & Dance, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Kaye, David; Lewis, C.

In this study, Dendrobium nobile, Dendrobium officinale, and Dendrobium moniliforme were selected to predict the potential suitable distributions and ecological niche shifts. A comparison of 19 environmental variables of the three Dendrobium species revealed three climatic factors that differed significantly when the species were compared two at a time. The principal component analysis was carried out in order to screen seven climatic factors for ecological niche shift analysis. All three Dendrobium species were found to have a very similar ecological niche, but with a relatively small range of variability regarding certain climatic factors. Finally, the current and future suitable areas for these three Dendrobium species in China were predicted using the MaxEnt model and ArcGIS using the two representative concentration pathways (RCP 2.6 and 8.5). Overall, the analysis of the climatic factors' comparisons, niche shift, and current and future suitable areas of these three Dendrobium species provides a basis for medicinal plant resource conservation and utilization, and our methods could be applied to the study of other similar valuable medicinal plants.","[Zuo, Jiajia; Zhang, Hanyue; Zu, Mengting; Yuan, Yingdan] Yangzhou Univ, Coll Hort & Plant Protect, Jiangsu Key Lab Crop Genet & Physiol, Yangzhou 225009, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Tang, Xinggang] Nanjing Forestry Univ, Coinnovat Ctr Sustainable Forestry Southern China, Jiangsu Prov Key Lab Soil & Water Conservat & Eco, Nanjing 210037, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xihe] Yangzhou Univ, Guangling Coll, Dept Tourism & Art, Yangzhou 225009, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Yangzhou University; Nanjing Forestry University; Yangzhou University,"Yuan, YD (corresponding author), Yangzhou Univ, Coll Hort & Plant Protect, Jiangsu Key Lab Crop Genet & Physiol, Yangzhou 225009, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",yyd@yzu.edu.cn,,,"Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province, China [BK20210800]; Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD)","Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province, China(Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province); Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD)","This project was funded by the Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province, China (Grant No. BK20210800), and the Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD).",,86,0,0,20,20,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0944-1344,1614-7499,,ENVIRON SCI POLLUT R,Environ.

However, experimentation is a major step to validate any model. To get some accurate data, the devices must be efficient. That is why their prices is very expensive. To overcome this problem, researchers leading to new approaches for developing their own prototypes. The challenge is to have accuracy devices for a lower cost. Measurement of diffuse illuminance requires the use of a device to mask the solar disk, like the shadow-ring. In this paper, a manufacturing protocol is proposed to design a shadow-ring, named SHADECO, according to the latitude of the study site and composed of basic materials. For the same efficiency, it allows a cost 4 to 6 times lower than industrial ring. To demonstrate the low cost-saving ratio of the data obtains, a study was conducted on predictive modeling of the behavior of an indoor lighting device. Two models are compared: one using diffuse illuminance deduced (from kt) and the other using the diffuse illuminance obtained with SHADECO. Using data measured instead of data deduced can improve by almost 34% the model's accuracy. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the SST signal preserved in sedimentary archives can be affected by contributions of additional isoGDGT sources. Methods now exist to identify and possibly correct for overprinting effects on the isoGDGT distribution in marine sediments. Here, we use the current proxy insights to (re-)assess the reliability of the isoGDGT-based SST signal in 69 newly analyzed and 242 reanalyzed sediments at Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Site 1172 (East Tasman Plateau, Australia) following state-of-the-art chromatographic techniques. We compare our results with paleoenvironmental and paleoclimatologic reconstructions based on dinoflagellate cysts. The resulting similar to 130 kyr resolution Maastrichtian-Oligocene SST record based on the TetraEther indeX of tetraethers with 86 carbon atoms (TEX86) confirms previous conclusions of anomalous warmth in the early Eocene SW Pacific and remarkably cool conditions during the midPaleocene. Dinocyst diversity and assemblages show a strong response to the local SST evolution, supporting the robustness of the TEX86 record. Soil-derived branched GDGTs stored in the same sediments are used to reconstruct mean annual air temperature (MAAT) of the nearby land using the Methylation index of Branched Tetraethers with 5-methyl bonds (MBT'(5me)) proxy. MAAT is consistently lower than SST during the early Eocene, independent of the calibration chosen. General trends in SST and MAAT are similar, except for (1) an enigmatic absence of MAAT rise during the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum and Middle Eocene Climatic Optimum, and (2) a subdued middle-late Eocene MAAT cooling relative to SST. Both dinocysts and GDGT signals suggest a mid-shelf depositional environment with strong river runoff during the Paleocene-early Eocene progressively becoming more marine thereafter. This trend reflects gradual subsidence and more pronounced wet/dry seasons in the northward-drifting Australian hinterland, which may also explain the subdued middle Eocene MAAT cooling relative to that of SST. The overall correlation between dinocyst assemblages, marine biodiversity and SST changes suggests that temperature exerted a strong influence on the surface-water ecosystem. Finally, we find support for a potential temperature control on compositional changes of branched glycerol monoalkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGMGTs) in marine sediments. It is encouraging that a critical evaluation of the GDGT signals confirms that most of the generated data are reliable. However, this also implies that the high TEX86-based SSTs for the Eocene SW Pacific and the systematic offset between absolute TEX86-based SST and MBT'(5me)-based MAAT estimates remain without definitive explanation.","[Bijl, Peter K.; Frieling, Joost; Cramwinckel, Margot J.; Boschman, Christine; Sluijs, Appy; Peterse, Francien] Univ Utrecht, Dept Earth Sci, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Frieling, Joost] Univ Oxford, Dept Earth Sci, South Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3AN, England; [Cramwinckel, Margot J.] Univ Southampton, Natl Oceanog Ctr Southampton, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci, Southampton, Hants, England",Utrecht University; University of Oxford; NERC National Oceanography Centre; University of Southampton,"Bijl, PK (corresponding author), Univ Utrecht, Dept Earth Sci, Utrecht, Netherlands.",p.k.bijl@uu.nl,"; Peterse, Francien/H-5627-2011","Bijl, Peter/0000-0002-1710-4012; Frieling, Joost/0000-0002-5374-1625; Peterse, Francien/0000-0001-8781-2826","NWO Vernieuwingsimpuls Veni [863.13.002]; Dutch Ministry of Education, Culture and Science; Ammodo Foundation; European Research Council [802835, 771497]","NWO Vernieuwingsimpuls Veni; Dutch Ministry of Education, Culture and Science; Ammodo Foundation; European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)European Commission)","Peter K.

Using state-of-the-art emission inventories, a global three-dimensional photochemical tracer/transport model of the troposphere, and a global radiative transfer model based on methods presented in the latest IPCC Assessment Report (2007-AR4), we estimate the radiative forcing (RF) attributable to household fuel combustion in Asia in terms of current global annual-mean RF and future global integrated RF for a one-year pulse of emissions (2000) over two time horizons (100 and 20 years). Despite the significant emissions of black carbon (BC) aerosols, these estimates indicate that shorter-lived (non-Kyoto) air pollutants from household fuel use in the region overall seem to exert a small net negative RF because of the strong influence of reflective aerosols. There are, however, major uncertainties in emission estimates for solid fuel burning, and about the sustainability of household fuel wood harvesting in Asia (the carbon neutrality of harvesting). In addition, there is still substantial uncertainty associated with the BC radiative forcing. As a result we find that the sign of the RF from household biomass burning in the region cannot be established. While recognizing the value of integrating climate change and air pollution policies, we are concerned that for a 'Kyoto style' post-Kyoto treaty (with global cap-and-trade and the Global Warming Potential as the metric) expanding the basket of components with a selection of short-lived species without also including the wider range of co-emitted species may lead to unintended consequences for global-scale climate. Additional measurement, modelling, and policy research is urgently needed to reduce the uncertainties so that the net impact on climate of emissions and mitigation measures in this sector can be accurately assessed.

Here, we apply an up-to-date emission inventory of BC in 2006 to investigate its loading, optical depth (AOD) at 550 nm and DRF using the coupled Regional Climate Chemistry Modeling System (RegCCMS). A state of the art air quality model (WRF/Chem) is also used to access surface BC concentration. Simulated surface concentrations of BC from these two models were compared with observations, while the AOD was compared with the results both from the Goddard Chemistry Aerosol Radiation and Transport (GOCART) model and from satellite and ground-based simulations. Results show that RegCCMS presented similar patterns and levels of annual mean-surface BC concentration to those of WRF/Chem. The regional distributions and monthly variations of RegCCMS BC were reproduced well in comparison to observations. Simulated pattern of AODs are consistent to but lower than those from satellite (Omi-0.25A degrees) and AERONET simulations. Annual mean DRFs mainly distribute in the area with high BC loadings, with regional mean of 0.75 W m(-2) and predicted global mean of 0.343 W m(-2). In general, the results are about 0.4-5 times for regional column burden, about 2 times as high for regional mean DRFs, about 1.3-1.8 times for global mean DRFs and about 3-4 times for AOD at 550 nm as compared to those in previous studies in China. These increasing DRFs of BC imply that its warming effect and climate response should be stronger and the DRF of total aerosols should be weaker (less negative).","[Zhuang, Bingliang; Jiang, Fei; Wang, Tijian; Li, Shu] Nanjing Univ, Sch Atmospher Sci, Nanjing 210093, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Fei] Nanjing Univ, Int Inst Earth Syst Sci, Nanjing 210093, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Bin] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Atmospher Phys, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China",Nanjing University; Nanjing University; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology,"Wang, TJ (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ, Sch Atmospher Sci, Hankou Rd 22, Nanjing 210093, Peoples R China.",tjwang@nju.edu.cn,"Jiang, Fei/A-9862-2014; Zhuang, Bingliang/R-3898-2018","Jiang, Fei/0000-0003-1744-7565; Zhuang, Bingliang/0000-0001-7092-7096","National Key Basic Research Development Program of China [2011CB403406, 2010CB428503, 2009CB426313]; National Special Fund for the Weather Industry [GYHY200806001-1, GYHY2007-6-36]",National Key Basic Research Development Program of China(National Basic Research Program of China); National Special Fund for the Weather Industry,"This work was supported by the National Key Basic Research Development Program of China (2011CB403406, 2010CB428503, 2009CB426313), and the National Special Fund for the Weather Industry (GYHY200806001-1, GYHY2007-6-36).",,39,37,42,0,59,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0177-798X,1434-4483,,THEOR APPL CLIMATOL,Theor.

The effects of salinisation can be observed in numerous vital ecological and non-ecological soil functions. Drivers of salinisation can be detected both in the natural and man-made environment, with climate and the foreseen climate change also playing an important role. This review outlines the state of the art concerning drivers and pressures, key indicators as well as monitoring, modeling and mapping methods for soil salinity. Furthermore, an overview Of the effect of salinisation on soil functions-and the respective mechanism is presented. Finally, the state of salinisation in Europe is presented according to the most recent literature and a synthesis of consistent datasets. We conclude that future research in the field of soil salinisation should be focused on among others carbon dynamics of saline soil, further exploration of remote sensing of soil properties and the harmonization and enrichment of soil salinity maps across Europe within a general context of a soil threat monitoring system to support policies and strategies for the protection of European soils.

These climate-induced changes will most likely affect species distribution via changes in growth, behavior, evolution, dispersal, and species interactions. However, the future risk of novel and disappearing environmental conditions in the ocean is poorly understood, in particular for compound effects of climate and nutrient management changes. We map the compound risk of the occurrence of future novel and disappearing environmental conditions, analyze the outcome of climate and nutrient management scenarios for the world's largest estuary, the Baltic Sea, and the potential consequences for three charismatic species. Overall, the future projections show, as expected, an increase in environmental novelty over time. The future nutrient reduction management that improves the eutrophication status of the Baltic Sea contributes to large novel and disappearing conditions. We show the consequences of novel and disappearing environmental conditions for fundamental niches of three charismatic species under different scenarios. This first step toward comprehensively analyzing environmental novelty and disappearing conditions for a marine system illustrates the urgent need to include novelty and disappearing projection outputs in Earth System Models. Our results further illustrate that adaptive management is needed to account for the emergence of novelty related to the interplay of multiple drivers.

State-of-the-art strategies address the problem as a supervised learning task and optimize algorithms that predict subgrid fluxes based on information from coarse resolution models. In practice, training data are generated from higher resolution numerical simulations transformed in order to mimic coarse resolution simulations. By essence, these strategies optimize subgrid parametrizations to meet so-called a priori criteria. But the actual purpose of a subgrid parametrization is to obtain good performance in terms of a posteriori metrics which imply computing entire model trajectories. In this paper, we focus on the representation of energy backscatter in two-dimensional quasi-geostrophic turbulence and compare parametrizations obtained with different learning strategies at fixed computational complexity. We show that strategies based on a priori criteria yield parametrizations that tend to be unstable in direct simulations and describe how subgrid parametrizations can alternatively be trained end-to-end in order to meet a posteriori criteria. We illustrate that end-to-end learning strategies yield parametrizations that outperform known empirical and data-driven schemes in terms of performance, stability, and ability to apply to different flow configurations.

Although this model was not developed explicitly for snow surfaces, it can capture the geometric-optical effect caused by the shadowing of rugged or undulating snow surfaces. However, in this study, this model has been further developed to better characterize the scattering properties of snow surface, which can also exhibit strongly forward-scattering behavior. This study proposes a new snow kernel to characterize the reflectance anisotropy of pure snow based on the asymptotic radiative transfer (ART) model that assumes snow can be modeled as a semi-infinite, plane-parallel, weakly absorbing light scattering layer. This new snow kernel adopts a correction term with a free parameter a to correct the analytic form of the ART model that has been reported to underestimate observed snow reflectance in the forward scattering direction in the principal plane (PP), particularly in cases of a large viewing zenith angle (> 60 degrees). This snow kernel has now been implemented in the kernel-driven RTLSR BRDF model framework in conjunction with two additional kernels (i.e., the volumetric scattering kernel and geometric-optical scattering kernel) and is validated using observed and simulated multiangle data from three data sources. Pure snow targets were selected from the extensive archive of the Polarization and Directionality of the Earth's Reflectance (POLDER) BRDF data. Antarctic snow field measurements, which were taken from the top of a 32-m-tall tower at Dome C Station and include 6336 spectral bidirectional reflectance factors (BRFs), were also utilized. Finally, a set of simulated BRFs, generated by a hybrid scattering snow model that combines the geometric optics with vector radiative transfer theory, were used to further assess the proposed method. We first retrieve the value of the free parameter a for a comprehensive analysis using single multiangle snow data with a sufficient BRDF sampling. Then, we determine the optimally fixed value of the a parameter as prior information for potential users. The new snow kernel method is shown to be quite accurate, presenting a high correlation coefficient (R-2 = similar to 0.9) and a negligible bias between the modeled BRFs and the various snow BRDF validation data. The finding demonstrates that this snow kernel provides an improved potential compared to that of the original kernel-driven model framework for a pure snow surface in many applications, particularly those involving the global water cycle and radiation budget, where snow cover plays an important role.","[Jiao, Ziti] Beijing Normal Univ & Inst Remote Sensing & Digit, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Jiao, Ziti; Ding, Anxin; Zhang, Xiaoning; Yin, Siyang; Cui, Lei; Chang, Yaxuan] Beijing Normal Univ, Fac Geog Sci, Inst Remote Sensing Sci & Engn, Beijing Engn Res Ctr Global Land Remote Sensing P, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Kokhanovsky, Alexander] VITROCISET, Bratustr 7, D-64293 Darmstadt, Germany; [Schaaf, Crystal] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Environm Earth & Ocean Sci, Boston, MA 02125 USA; [Breon, Francois-Marie] UVSQ, CNRS, CEA, Lab Sci Climat & Environm, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Dong, Yadong] Beijing Normal Univ, Coll Water Sci, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Wang, Zhuosen] NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Terr Informat Syst Lab, Greenbelt, MD USA; [Wang, Zhuosen] Univ Maryland, Earth Syst Sci Interdisciplinary Ctr, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Liu, Yan] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Remote Sensing & Digital Earth, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Mei, Linlu] Univ Bremen, Inst Environm Phys, Otto Hahn Allee 1, D-28359 Bremen, Germany","Beijing Normal University; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Boston; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; CEA; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Beijing Normal University; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; Chinese Academy of Sciences; The Institute of Remote Sensing & Digital Earth, CAS; University of Bremen","Jiao, ZT (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, 19 Xinjiekouwai St, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",jiaozt@bnu.edu.cn,"ding, anxin/Z-3725-2019; LIU, Yansui/T-6954-2019; Kokhanovsky, Alexander/X-1930-2019; Wang, Zhuosen/HCI-3669-2022; Zhang, Xiaoning/GPS-5614-2022; amplification,  - Arctic/AAU-6640-2020","ding, anxin/0000-0001-6591-328X; Zhang, Xiaoning/0000-0002-1352-5143; Kokhanovsky, Alexander/0000-0001-7110-223X","National Key RAMP;D Program of China [2018YFA0605503]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41571326]; NASA [NNX14AI73G, 80NSSC18K0642]; European Space Agency of ESRIN [4000118926/16/I-NB]; Arcti C Amplification: Climate Relevant Atmospheric and SurfaCe Processes, and Feedback Mechanisms (AC)3 - DFG (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft) [SFB/TR 172]","National Key RAMP;D Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); European Space Agency of ESRIN; Arcti C Amplification: Climate Relevant Atmospheric and SurfaCe Processes, and Feedback Mechanisms (AC)3 - DFG (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft)(German Research Foundation (DFG))","We thank the National Key R&D Program of China (2018YFA0605503) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41571326) for supporting this research.

The El Nino/Southern Oscillation is characterized by irregular warm (El Nino) and cold (La Nina) events in the tropical Pacific Ocean, which have substantial global environmental and socioeconomic impacts. These events are generally attributed to the instability of basin-scale air-sea interactions in the equatorial Pacific. However, the role of sub-basin-scale processes in the El Nino/Southern Oscillation life cycle remains unknown due to the scarcity of observations and coarse resolution of climate models. Here, using a long-term high-resolution global climate simulation, we find that equatorial ocean eddies with horizontal wavelengths less than several hundred kilometres substantially inhibit the growth of La Nina and El Nino events. These submesoscale eddies are regulated by the intensity of Pacific cold-tongue temperature fronts. The eddies generate an anomalous surface cooling tendency during El Nino by inducing a reduced upward heat flux from the subsurface to the surface in the central-eastern equatorial Pacific; the opposite occurs during La Nina. This dampening effect is missing in the majority of state-of-the-art climate models. Our findings identify a pathway to resolve the long-standing overestimation of El Nino and La Nina amplitudes in climate simulations.","[Wang, Shengpeng; Jing, Zhao; Wu, Lixin; Cai, Wenju; Wang, Hong; Geng, Tao; Chen, Zhaohui; Ma, Xiaohui; Gan, Bolan; Yang, Haiyuan] Ocean Univ China, Frontiers Sci Ctr Deep Ocean Multispheres & Earth, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Wang, Shengpeng; Jing, Zhao; Wu, Lixin; Cai, Wenju; Wang, Hong; Geng, Tao; Chen, Zhaohui; Ma, Xiaohui; Gan, Bolan; Yang, Haiyuan] Ocean Univ China, Key Lab Phys Oceanog, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Wang, Shengpeng; Jing, Zhao; Wu, Lixin; Cai, Wenju; Wang, Hong; Geng, Tao; Chen, Zhaohui; Ma, Xiaohui; Gan, Bolan; Yang, Haiyuan] Pilot Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol Qingdao, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Jing, Zhao; Chang, Ping; Wang, Hong; Danabasoglu, Gohkan; Ma, Xiaohui] Texas A&M Univ, Int Lab High Resolut Earth Syst Predict, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Cai, Wenju] CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere, Ctr Southern Hemisphere Oceans Res CSHOR, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Chang, Ping] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Oceanog, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Chang, Ping] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, College Stn, TX USA; [Danabasoglu, Gohkan] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA",Ocean University of China; Ocean University of China; Qingdao National Laboratory for Marine Science & Technology; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA,"Jing, Z (corresponding author), Ocean Univ China, Frontiers Sci Ctr Deep Ocean Multispheres & Earth, Qingdao, Peoples R China.;Jing, Z (corresponding author), Ocean Univ China, Key Lab Phys Oceanog, Qingdao, Peoples R China.;Jing, Z (corresponding author), Pilot Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol Qingdao, Qingdao, Peoples R China.;Jing, Z (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Int Lab High Resolut Earth Syst Predict, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",jingzhao@ouc.edu.cn,"MA, XIAO/HHN-5611-2022","geng, tao/0000-0002-3385-7110","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41822601, 41776006, 42006011]; iHESP; Pilot National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology (Qingdao); US National Science Foundation [1852977]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); iHESP; Pilot National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology (Qingdao); US National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41822601, 41776006 and 42006011) and completed through the iHESP, a collaboration by the Qingdao National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology Development Center, Texas A&M University and the National Center for Atmospheric Research.

By 1998 the number of commercial cultivars in Russia has reached 60. This crop spread widely in private and commercial gardens of Northern and Central Russia, in the Urals, Siberia and the Far East. Major positive features of blue honeysuckle are extra-early ripening, high content of ascorbic acid and bioactive flavonoides in fruits, and outstanding frost resistance of plants and flowers. Collecting missions by the N.I.Vavilov Research Institute of Plant Industry (VIR) have composed a unique collection numbering over 500 accessions. By morphological, anatomical, biochemical and DNA analyses, as well as ploidy studies and geographical mapping of blue honeysuckle genetic resources, it has been found that in Eurasia genetic diversity of the crop is represented by four species, that are the diploid endemic ones L. edulis Turcz. ex Freyn, L. boczkarnikowae Plekh., L. iliensis Pojark and the tetraploid L. caerulea L. Only L. caerulea has been domesticated. A long-term program for honeysuckle breeding and corresponding methods have been developed. Priorities of the program are as follows: high productivity, deep dormancy, fruit quality, high content of ascorbic acid and bioactive flavonoides. As a result of investigations, genetical control of ripening, non-shattering and fruit size have been elucidated, The VIR's collection has been successfully screened for the sources of 18 valuable breeding characters. By now, 15 cultivars have been bred at VIR.","NI Vavilov Res Inst Plant Ind, Dept Fruit Crops, St Petersburg 190000, Russia",Vavilov All-Russian Institute of Plant Genetic Resources,"Plekhanova, MN (corresponding author), NI Vavilov Res Inst Plant Ind, Dept Fruit Crops, 42 Bolshaya Morskaya, St Petersburg 190000, Russia.",,,,,,,,5,50,58,0,17,INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,90-6605-903-6,ACTA HORTIC,,,2000,538,,,,159,164,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2000.538.25,http://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2000.538.25,,,6,Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BR48U,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000166608900025,View Full Record in Web of Science

The data were used to implement measure-correlate-predict (MCP) approaches at 37 sites throughout the United Kingdom (UK). The monthly and hourly linear correlation between the UK4-predicted and observed wind speeds indicates that UK4 is capable of representing the wind climate better than the nearby meteorological stations considered. Linear MCP algorithms were implemented at the same sites using reference data from UK4 and nearby meteorological stations to predict the long-term (10-year) wind resource. To obtain robust error statistics, MCP algorithms were applied using onsite measurement periods of 1-12 months initiated at 120 different starting months throughout an 11 year data record. Using linear regression MCP over 12 months, the average percentage errors in the long-term predicted mean wind speed and power density were 3.0% and 7.6% respectively, using UK4, and 2.8% and 7.9% respectively, using nearby meteorological stations. The results indicate that UK4 is highly competitive with nearby meteorological observations as an MCP reference data source. UK4 was also shown to systematically improve MCP predictions at coastal sites due to better representation of local diurnal effects. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Design/methodology/approach - This paper is written in a conceptual form. The theoretical starting point is that strong sustainable development is necessary to combat climate change. The practical example is state-of-the-art of CCS, and whether this contributes to combat climate change or not. Findings - This paper finds using circulation economics adds essential environmental preconditions to the technique of CCS. First, the global environmental gain must not be outnumbered through an increase in production volume. Second, if the technique does not contribute to strong sustainable development then the producers must instead limit the extraction of petroleum. Research limitations/implications - The figures in this paper build upon the current knowledge within this research area. Extensive research is taking place, and may change the figures. The findings and conclusions of this paper will not be affected though by changes in figures. Practical implications-The findings of this paper show that it is necessary to use a holistic and global theoretical approach in choosing tools to combat climate change. Originality/value - The paper uses a relatively new economic theoretical approach to highlight environmental aspects regarding a technique of capturing carbon, which is currently being developed to combat climate change.","[Nilsen, Heidi] Bodo Grad Sch Business, Bodo, Norway",Nord University,"Nilsen, HR (corresponding author), Bodo Grad Sch Business, Bodo, Norway.",Heidi.rapp.nilsen@hibo.no,,,,,,,35,4,4,0,0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0306-8293,1758-6712,,INT J SOC ECON,Int.

The article presents a methodology of statistical downscaling based on sparse Bayesian learning and Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) to model streamflow at river basin scale for monsoon period (June, July, August, September) using GCM simulated climatic variables. NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data have been used for training the model to establish a statistical relationship between streamflow and climatic variables. The relationship thus obtained is used to project the future streamflow from GCM simulations. The statistical methodology involves principal component analysis, fuzzy clustering and RVM. Different kernel functions are used for comparison purpose. The model is applied to Mahanadi river basin in India. The results obtained using RVM are compared with those of state-of-the-art Support Vector Machine (SVM) to present the advantages of RVMs over SVMs. A decreasing trend is observed for monsoon streamflow of Mahanadi due to high surface warming in future, with the CCSR/NIES GCM and B2 scenario.

This share is expected to further increase in the near future owing to growing renewable energy needs. The residual biomass harvestable from the local agronomic sector, mostly based on the cultivation of apple, is a promising option to supply relatively cheap bioenergy feedstock. In this study, we investigate the use of woody residues from apple orchards (apple orchard's woody residues, AWRs) for the production of bioenergy using the life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology. The system boundaries include the harvesting and chipping of AWRs, their transport to the energy plant and conversion into heat and power in a gasification unit. The life cycle inventory (LCI) data rely on field measurements for AWRs harvesting and chipping operations, as well as for their chemical and energy characterization. In the life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) phase, we consider various environmental impact categories like climate change, acidification, fossil depletion, and others. We benchmark the outcomes with two alternative reference systems based on fossils fuels. Our results show that the energy production using AWRs generally presents better environmental indicators than the reference systems, although some trade-offs exist. For instance, whereas the bioenergy system saves up to about 85% of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and about 95% of non-renewable resources, it is usually associated with higher toxicity impact potentials.

To anticipate these algal blooms, models to project future algal blooms worldwide are required. Here we present the state-of-the-art in algal projection modelling and explore the requirements of an ideal algal projection model. Based on this, we identify current challenges and opportunities for such model development. Since most building blocks are present, we foresee that algal projection models for any lake on earth can be developed in the near future. Finally, we think that algal bloom projection models at a global scale will provide a valuable contribution to global policymaking, in particular with respect to SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation).","[Janssen, Annette B.

To test this mechanism and potential factors influencing the downward wave coupling, three 145-yr sensitivity simulations with NCAR's Community Earth System Model [CESM1(WACCM)], a state-of-the-art high-top chemistry-climate model, are analyzed. The results show that the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) and SST variability significantly impact downward wave coupling. Without the QBO, the occurrence of downward wave coupling is significantly suppressed. In contrast, stronger and more persistent downward wave coupling occurs when SST variability is excluded. The above influence on the occurrence of downward wave coupling is mostly due to a direct influence of the QBO and SST variability on stratospheric planetary wave source and propagation. The strengths of the tropospheric circulation and surface responses to a given downward wave coupling event, however, behave differently. The surface anomaly is significantly weaker (stronger) in the experiment with fixed SSTs (without QBO), even though the statistical signal of downward wave coupling is strongest (weakest) in this experiment. This apparent mismatch is explained by the differences in the strength of the synoptic-scale eddy-mean flow feedback and the possible contribution of SST anomalies in the North Atlantic during the downward wave coupling event. The weaker synoptic-scale eddy-mean flow feedback and the absence of the positive NAO-related SST-tripole pattern in the fixed SST experiment are consistent with a weaker tropospheric response to downward wave coupling. The results highlight the importance of synoptic-scale eddies in setting the tropospheric response to downward wave coupling.","[Lubis, Sandro W.; Matthes, Katja; Omrani, Nour-Eddine; Wahl, Sebastian] GEOMAR Helmholtz Ctr Ocean Res Kiel, Dusternbrooker Weg 20, D-24105 Kiel, Germany; [Matthes, Katja] Univ Kiel, Kiel, Germany; [Omrani, Nour-Eddine] Univ Bergen, Inst Geophys, Bergen, Norway; [Omrani, Nour-Eddine] Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, Bergen, Norway; [Harnik, Nili] Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Geophys Atmospher & Planetary Sci, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Harnik, Nili] Stockholm Univ, Dept Meteorol, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden",Helmholtz Association; GEOMAR Helmholtz Center for Ocean Research Kiel; University of Kiel; University of Bergen; Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research; Tel Aviv University; Stockholm University,"Lubis, SW (corresponding author), GEOMAR Helmholtz Ctr Ocean Res Kiel, Dusternbrooker Weg 20, D-24105 Kiel, Germany.",slubis@geomar.de,"Wahl, Sebastian/AFI-1518-2022; Matthes, Katja/F-7361-2014; Wahl, Sebastian/AAF-3644-2022; Omrani, Noue-Eddine/GQQ-7245-2022","Matthes, Katja/0000-0003-1801-3072; Lubis, Sandro/0000-0001-6615-9880","German-Israeli Foundation for Scientific Research and Development [GIF1151-83.8/2011]; Helmholtz Association through President's Initiative and Networking Fund; GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel; International Meteorological Institute (IMI), Stockholm, Sweden; COST ACTION TOSCA [ES1005]","German-Israeli Foundation for Scientific Research and Development(German-Israeli Foundation for Scientific Research and Development); Helmholtz Association through President's Initiative and Networking Fund(Helmholtz Association); GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel(Helmholtz Association); International Meteorological Institute (IMI), Stockholm, Sweden; COST ACTION TOSCA","We acknowledge support received from the German-Israeli Foundation for Scientific Research and Development under Grant GIF1151-83.8/2011.

Yet, the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) has a tradition of steering that instrument towards more substantial environmental protections. Often inspired by the Aarhus Convention (AC), Strasbourg seems intent on infusing the ECHR with environmental concerns, but appears to view its role as secondary. Through an analysis of the Court's case-law, we argue that the ECtHR can and should stop playing second fiddle to Aarhus; it is time for it to embrace its crucial role in implementing the procedural rights enshrined in the AC. This article also outlines the different ways that the jurisprudence of the ECtHR already goes, in some respects, far beyond the AC. We will discuss whether the ECtHR is living up to its potential when it comes to promoting environmental rights - particularly the potential to establish substantive rights, e.g. in the field of clean air.","[Braig, Katharina Franziska] Zurich Univ Appl Sci ZHAW, Sch Management & Law, Winterthur, Switzerland",Zurich University of Applied Sciences,"Braig, KF (corresponding author), Zurich Univ Appl Sci ZHAW, Sch Management & Law, Winterthur, Switzerland.",katharinafranziska.braig@zhaw.ch; justuce.milady@gmail.com; vicky.vouleli@gmail.com,,,,,,,43,0,0,0,0,BRILL,LEIDEN,"PLANTIJNSTRAAT 2, P O BOX 9000, 2300 PA LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS",1613-7272,1876-0104,,J EUR ENVIRON PLAN L,J.

Given continuing large impacts of droughts and floods and the expectation for significant regional changes projected in the future, there is an urgent need to provide estimates of past events and their future risk, globally. However, current estimates of hydrological extremes are not robust and accurate enough, due to lack of long-term data records, standardized methods for event identification, geographical inconsistencies, and data uncertainties. To tackle these challenges, this article presents the development of the first Global Drought and Flood Catalogue (GDFC) for 1950-2016 by merging the latest in situ and remote sensing datasets with state-of-the-art land surface and hydrodynamic modeling to provide a continuous and consistent estimate of the terrestrial water cycle and its extremes. This GDFC also includes an unprecedented level of detailed analysis of drought and large-scale flood events using univariate and multivariate risk assessment frameworks, which incorporates regional spatial-temporal characteristics (i.e., duration, spatial extent, severity) and global hazard maps for different return periods. This Catalogue forms a basis for analyzing the changing risk of droughts and floods and can underscore national and international climate change assessments and provide a key reference for climate change studies and climate model evaluations. It also contributes to the growing interests in multivariate and compounding risk analysis.","[He, Xiaogang; Pan, Ming; Wood, Eric F.; Sheffield, Justin] Princeton Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [He, Xiaogang] Stanford Univ, Water West Woods Inst Environm, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Wei, Zhongwang] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Atmospher Sci, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Wei, Zhongwang] Univ Tokyo, Dept Civil Engn, Tokyo, Japan; [Sheffield, Justin] Univ Southampton, Geog & Environm, Southampton, Hants, England",Princeton University; Stanford University; Sun Yat Sen University; University of Tokyo; University of Southampton,"He, XG (corresponding author), Princeton Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.;He, XG (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Water West Woods Inst Environm, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",hexg@princeton.edu,,,NOAA [NA14OAR4310218]; Mary and Randall Hack '69 Research Fund from the Princeton Environmental Institute at Princeton University; 'Building REsearch Capacity for sustainable water and food security In drylands of sub-saharan Africa' (BRECcIA) - UK Research and Innovation as part of the Global Challenges Research Fund [NE/P021093/1],NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); Mary and Randall Hack '69 Research Fund from the Princeton Environmental Institute at Princeton University; 'Building REsearch Capacity for sustainable water and food security In drylands of sub-saharan Africa' (BRECcIA) - UK Research and Innovation as part of the Global Challenges Research Fund,"The authors gratefully acknowledge funding from NOAA Grant NA14OAR4310218, and the Mary and Randall Hack '69 Research Fund from the Princeton Environmental Institute at Princeton University, without which this study could not have taken place.

The 1970s are a period, which craft historians and theorists generally acknowledge as one of revival and reinvention of craft practice across Britain. Today, we find ourselves in the midst of what has also been described as a 'craft renaissance'. This article will explore some of the causal factors that led to the craft revival of the 1970s to examine whether parallels can be drawn with today's developments. The purpose of the article is to determine whether craft revivals share any common identifying characteristics, or whether each is unique to its particular period in time. Three key factors which contributed to the revival of the craft in the 1970s will be examined: the role of the state, the ideological relationship of craft to contemporary fine art, and the socioeconomic climate of the time. The comparison demonstrates that although today's craft revival shares many points of commonality with the 1970s, revivals are not simply a repetition of the past. Because craft is in a constant process of reinvention and reinvigoration, so-called 'revivals' are instead uniquely complex and historically changing, reflecting more about the present and the future than the past.","[Peach, Andrea] Robert Gordon Univ, Contextual & Crit Studies, Grays Sch Art, Aberdeen, Scotland",Robert Gordon University,"Peach, A (corresponding author), Robert Gordon Univ, Grays Sch Art, Aberdeen AB10 7QD, Scotland.",a.peach@rgu.ac.uk,,"Peach, Andrea/0000-0002-5730-5951",,,,,49,7,7,0,7,INTELLECT LTD,BRISTOL,"THE MILL, PARNALL RD, BRISTOL, BS16 3JG, ENGLAND",2040-4689,2040-4697,,CRAFT RES,Craft Res.,1-Oct,2013,2,,,,161,179,,10.1386/crre.4.2.161_1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1386/crre.4.2.161_1,,,19,Art,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Art,V2R2J,,Green Accepted,,,12/21/22,WOS:000217837600002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Identifying its performance in model prediction may provide us another viewpoint, from the perspective of upper-tropospheric circulation, to understand the predictability of summer climate anomalies in East Asia. This study presents a comprehensive assessment of year-to-year variability of the EAJ based on retrospective seasonal forecasts, initiated from 1 May, in the five state-of-the-art coupled models from ENSEMBLES during 1960-2005. It is found that the coupled models show certain capability in describing the interannual meridional displacement of the EAJ, which reflects the models' performance in the first leading empirical orthogonal function (EOF) mode. This capability is mainly shown over the region south of the EAJ axis. Additionally, the models generally capture well the main features of atmospheric circulation and SST anomalies related to the interannual meridional displacement of the EAJ. Further analysis suggests that the predicted warm SST anomalies in the concurrent summer over the tropical eastern Pacific and northern Indian Ocean are the two main sources of the potential prediction skill of the southward shift of the EAJ. In contrast, the models are powerless in describing the variation over the region north of the EAJ axis, associated with the meridional displacement, and interannual intensity change of the EAJ, the second leading EOF mode, meaning it still remains a challenge to better predict the EAJ and, subsequently, summer climate in East Asia, using current coupled models.","[Li Chaofan] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Ctr Monsoon Syst Res, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Lin Zhongda] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, State Key Lab Numer Modelling Atmospher Sci & Geo, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS","Lin, ZD (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, State Key Lab Numer Modelling Atmospher Sci & Geo, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.",zdlin@mail.iap.ac.cn,"Li, Chaofan/D-2735-2017","Li, Chaofan/0000-0001-5157-5427","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41375086, 41320104007, 41305067]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"We thank two anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments.

In this large-scale naturalistic experimental study we show how we can use behavioural science to find ways to promote the desired physical distancing behaviour. During seven days in a supermarket we implemented different behavioural interventions: (i) rewarding customers for keeping distance; (i) providing signage to guide customers; and (iii) altering shopping cart regulations. We asked customers to wear a tag that measured distances to other tags using ultra-wide band at 1Hz. In total N = 4, 232 customers participated in the study. We compared the number of contacts (< 1.5 m, corresponding to Dutch regulations) between customers using state-of-the-art contact network analyses. We found that rewarding customers and providing signage increased physical distancing, whereas shopping cart regulations did not impact physical distancing. Rewarding customers moreover reduced the duration of remaining contacts between customers. These results demonstrate the feasibility to conduct large-scale behavioural experiments that can provide guidelines for policy. While the COVID-19 crisis unequivocally demonstrates the importance of behaviour and behavioural change, behaviour is integral to many crises, like the trading of mortgages in the financial crisis or the consuming of goods in the climate crisis.

The Southern Ocean occupies 14% of the Earth's surface and plays a fundamental role in the global carbon cycle and climate. It provides a direct connection to the deep ocean carbon reservoir through biogeochemical processes that include surface primary productivity, remineralization at depth and the upwelling of carbon-rich water masses. However, the role of these different processes in modulating past and future air-sea carbon flux remains poorly understood. A key period in this regard is the Antarctic Cold Reversal (ACR, 14.6-12.7 kyrbp), when mid- to high-latitude Southern Hemisphere cooling coincided with a sustained plateau in the global deglacial increase in atmospheric CO2. Here we reconstruct high-latitude Southern Ocean surface productivity from marine-derived aerosols captured in a highly resolved horizontal ice core. Our multiproxy reconstruction reveals a sustained signal of enhanced marine productivity across the ACR. Transient climate modelling indicates this period coincided with maximum seasonal variability in sea-ice extent, implying that sea-ice biological feedbacks enhanced CO(2)sequestration and created a substantial regional marine carbon sink, which contributed to the plateau in CO(2)during the ACR. Our results highlight the role Antarctic sea ice plays in controlling global CO2, and demonstrate the need to incorporate such feedbacks into climate-carbon models.","[Fogwill, C.

In addition, contribution is also given to a preliminary evaluation of their state of conservation in consideration of the climate conditions to which the site is exposed. To accomplish the objectives, information on the climate and historical context have been acquired. A set of analytical methodologies has been applied on the seventeen samples collected: Polarized Light (PLM) and Scanning Electron Microscopy coupled with Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (SEM-EDX), X-Ray Diffraction (XRPD), Raman Spectroscopy and Ion Chromatography (IC). The data obtained allowed us to achieve a mineralogical and petrographic characterisation of the samples, underlining the nature of the binder in mortars and plasters, the type of clay used as raw material for bricks and tile, their hypothetical firing temperature and the aggregate composition. Moreover, it was also possible to identify the colouring coating typology in tiles and their process of production. Regarding the state of conservation, the principal deterioration phenomena affecting the site due to environmental impact can be also hypothesised, even though major studies are necessary for an exhaustive assessment.","[Sardella, Alessandro; Bonazza, Alessandra] Natl Res Council Italy, Inst Atmospher Sci & Climate, I-40129 Bologna, Italy; [Sardella, Alessandro; Canevarolo, Sonia] Univ Ferrara, Dept Phys & Earth Sci, I-44121 Ferrara, Italy; [Marrocchino, Elena] Univ Ferrara, Dept Chem Pharmaceut & Agr Sci, I-44121 Ferrara, Italy; [Tittarelli, Francesca] Univ Politecn Marche, Dept Mat Environm Sci & Urban Planning SIMAU, INSTM Res Unit, I-60131 Ancona, Italy",Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Scienze dell'Atmosfera e del Clima (ISAC-CNR); University of Ferrara; University of Ferrara; Marche Polytechnic University,"Sardella, A (corresponding author), Natl Res Council Italy, Inst Atmospher Sci & Climate, I-40129 Bologna, Italy.;Sardella, A (corresponding author), Univ Ferrara, Dept Phys & Earth Sci, I-44121 Ferrara, Italy.",a.sardella@isac.cnr.it; sonia.canevarolo@unife.it; mrrlne@unife.it; f.tittarelli@staff.univpm.it; a.bonazza@isac.cnr.it,"Marrocchino, Elena/AAJ-6316-2020","Marrocchino, Elena/0000-0001-7320-0327; Bonazza, Alessandra/0000-0002-9842-9731; Sardella, Alessandro/0000-0002-2194-4970",UNESCO/Monaco Funds-in-Trust Project,UNESCO/Monaco Funds-in-Trust Project,"This study was carried out in the framework of the UNESCO/Monaco Funds-in-Trust Project Capacity-Building and Awareness-Raising for the Preservation, Conservation, Visibility and Sustainable Management of the Archaeological Site of Shoroon Bumbagar of Mount Maikhan.

UniValve, UpValve and FlexValve are recognized, fully variable mechanical VVA upgrades for SIas well as for Diesel engines. This paper reports on layout and application of UpValve and highlights potentials to utilize its gas exchange advantages. The paper briefly recaps the UpValve principle, architecture and layout. The clearance between valve head and piston (pockets) limits the valve lift around TDC of overlap. Different possibilities to minimize the intake pumping work while meeting those constrains are discussed. Obviously VVA introduces additional parts into the valve train. Hence, VVA friction is often considered as an issue. However, UpValve test results reveal a very favorable torque to turn behaviour. A plain simulation is used to understand this outcome. Special attention must be given to the lift balance across the cylinder head, as the volumetric efficiency is significantly correlated to (early) IVC timing. It is demonstrated how this challenge is addressed during production and assembly. Finally dyno results are disclosed, which are acquired on a state-of-the-art SI engine with UpValve on the intake side. This concept engine also makes use of the inherent UpValve capability to shut down specific valves for cylinder deactivation. Initially, VVA was introduced to minimize the part load pumping losses. While part of this potential is also utilized by downsizing, the freedom of -variable inlet timings can be used as well to mitigate knock (Miller cycle) and to decrease transient AFR excursions due to the better air path controllability. The anti-knock effect allows for less overfueling and higher compression ratios associated with further efficiency gains, and the improved response reduces the need for spark retardation. Even the additional potential of exhaust side VVA was already demonstrated [1, 2].","[Breuer, Michael; Moormann, Stefan; Schmitt, Stephan] Pierburg GmbH, Neuss, Germany; [Freeland, Paul; Jones, Gareth] Cosworth Ltd, Northampton, England",,"Breuer, M (corresponding author), Pierburg GmbH, Neuss, Germany.",michael.breuer@de.rheinmetall.com,,,,,,,7,1,1,0,3,SPRINGER VIEWEG VERLAG,WIESBADEN,"ABRAHAM-LINCOLN-STR. 46, WIESBADEN, 65189, GERMANY",2198-7432,2198-7440,978-3-658-24984-7; 978-3-658-24983-0,PROC-SPR VIEWEG,,,2019,,,,,185,199,,10.1007/978-3-658-24984-7_12,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-658-24984-7_12,,,15,Transportation Science & Technology,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Transportation,BO1CR,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000494945400012,View Full Record in Web of Science

We further partition the responses between these two natural external factors, detecting both the solar and the volcanic signal in the observed early warming. A diagnosis of the sensitivity to solar forcing and a volcanic super-eruption simulation suggest that our model possesses larger climate sensitivities to solar forcing and longer relaxation times to volcanic forcing than HadCM3, enabling us to detect both the solar and volcanic forcing responses.","Natl Inst Environm Studies, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058506, Japan; Univ Oxford, Dept Phys, Oxford OX1 3PU, England",National Institute for Environmental Studies - Japan; University of Oxford,"Shiogama, H (corresponding author), Natl Inst Environm Studies, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058506, Japan.",shiogama.hideo@mies.go.jp,"Shiogama, Hideo/B-9598-2012; Yokohata, Tokuta/N-4540-2019","Shiogama, Hideo/0000-0001-5476-2148; Yokohata, Tokuta/0000-0001-7346-7988",,,,,20,24,24,0,14,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",0094-8276,1944-8007,,GEOPHYS RES LETT,Geophys.

The system is described here in detail, and results are presented from forecasts, climate equillibrium simulations, and data assimilation experiments. The climate or equillibrium state of the atmosphere and ocean showed a substantial reduction in bias relative to GEOS-S2S-1. The GEOS-S2S-2 coupled reanalysis also showed substantial improvements, attributed to the assimilation of along-track absolute dynamic topography. The forecast skill on subseasonal scales showed a much improved prediction of the Madden-Julian Oscillation in GEOS-S2S-2, and on a seasonal scale the tropical Pacific forecasts show substantial improvement in the east and comparable skill to GEOS-S2S-1 in the central Pacific. GEOS-S2S-2 anomaly correlations of both land surface temperature and precipitation were comparable to GEOS-S2S-1 and showed substantially reduced root-mean-square error of surface temperature. The remaining issues described here are being addressed in the development of GEOS-S2S Version 3, and with that system GMAO will continue its tradition of maintaining a state-of-the-art seasonal prediction system for use in evaluating the impact on seasonal and decadal forecasts of assimilating newly available satellite observations, as well as evaluating additional sources of predictability in the Earth system through the expanded coupling of the Earth system model and assimilation components.","[Molod, Andrea; Hackert, Eric; Vikhliaev, Yury; Zhao, Bin; Barahona, Donifan; Borovikov, Anna; Kovach, Robin M.; Marshak, Jelena; Schubert, Siegfried; Li, Zhao; Lim, Young-Kwon; Andrews, Lauren C.; Cullather, Richard; Koster, Randal; Achuthavarier, Deepthi; Coy, Lawrence; Friere, Julliana L.

These ecosystems, that are often maintained by direct or indirect groundwater supplies, are collectively known as groundwater dependent ecosystems (GDEs). The importance of groundwater supplies is greatly exacerbated in coastal Mediterranean regions where the lack of surface water and the over-development of anthropogenic activities critically threaten the sustainability of coastal GDEs and associated ecosystem services. Yet, coastal GDEs do not benefit from a legal or managerial recognition to take into account their specificity. Particular attention should be paid to the characterization of environmental and ecological water requirements. The hydrogeological knowledge about the management and behavior of coastal aquifers and GDEs must be strengthened. These investigations must be supplemented by a stronger assessment of potential contaminations to develop local land-uses and human activities according to the groundwater vulnerability. The quantitative management of water resources must also be better supervised and/or more constrained in order to ensure the water needs necessary to maintain coastal GDEs. The transdisciplinary approach between hydrogeology, hydrology, social sciences and law is essential to fully understand the socio-economic and environmental complexity of coastal GDEs. Priority must now be given to the development of an appropriate definition of coastal GDEs, based on a consensus between scientists and lawyers. It is a necessary first step to develop and implement specific protective legislation and to define an appropriate management scale. The investment and collaboration of local water users, stakeholders and decision-makers need to be strengthened through actions to favor exchanges and discussions. All water resources in the coastal areas should be managed collectively and strategically, in order to maximize use efficiency, reduce water use conflicts and avoid over-exploitation. It is important to continue to raise public awareness of coastal aquifers at the regional level and to integrate their specificities into coastal zone management strategies and plans. In the global context of unprecedented anthropogenic pressures, hydro-food crises and climate change, environmental protection and preservation of coastal GDEs represents a major challenge for the sustainable socio-economic and environmental development of Mediterranean coastal zones.

Vast gaps in buoy data, caused by false measurements or maintenance periods, require reconstruction and forecasting of ocean waves. Morphodynamic changes of the Ebb-Tidal Delta (ETD) sandbanks exert a huge impact on the local wave climate off the island of Norderney, Germany. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to develop a machine learning model based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks for reconstruction and short- and long-term prediction of nearshore significant wave height (SWH), integrating bathymetric data for the first time. Time series of sea state and weather data of adjacent buoys as well as bathymetric data of the ETD sandbanks from 2004 to 2017 were used and the networks were tuned with Bayesian hyperparameter optimization. Including the bathymetries improved the performance of the LSTM for SWH reconstruction, short-, and long-term predictions by 16.7%, 7.4-11.7%, and 8.8-9.1% in terms of RMSE, respectively. The LSTM outperformed deep feed-forward neural networks and other state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. With an RMSE of 0.069 m, a parallel LSTM structure (P-LSTM) is the proposed method for SWH reconstruction.","[Joerges, Christoph; Stumpe, Britta] Univ Wuppertal, Inst Geog, Dept Human Environm Res, Gaussstr 20, D-42119 Wuppertal, Germany; [Berkenbrink, Cordula] Coastal Def & Nat Conservat Agcy NLWKN, Coastal Res Stn, Lower Saxony Water Management, Norderney, Germany",University of Wuppertal,"Jorges, C (corresponding author), Univ Wuppertal, Inst Geog, Dept Human Environm Res, Gaussstr 20, D-42119 Wuppertal, Germany.",joerges@uni-wuppertal.de,,"Jorges, Christoph/0000-0001-9254-1848",,,,,85,21,21,15,59,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0029-8018,1873-5258,,OCEAN ENG,Ocean Eng.,15-Jul,2021,,,,,,,109046,10.1016/j.oceaneng.2021.109046,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.oceaneng.2021.109046,,21-May,18,"Engineering, Marine; Engineering, Civil; Engineering, Ocean; Oceanography",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Engineering; Oceanography,SL5AP,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000656930600006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Greater energy generation can be achieved by increased reliance on renewable energy, but the transmission of this energy to match supply with demand is a likely bottleneck in maximising renewable energy use. In this paper, we examine medium-voltage DC superconductors as a potential solution for low-loss, high-power transmission of offshore renewables. We look at what has been achieved to date in onshore superconducting cable deployment and what needs to be done for such superconductors to be deployed subsea, with the goals of exporting electricity from offshore wind farms and acting as grid interconnectors. The offshore oil and gas industry represents state of the art in terms of subsea pipe design. This paper explores how the experience of the offshore oil and gas industry can be applied to subsea superconductor cable design and identifies aspects of superconductor design likely to present a challenge to subsea deployment. The key areas identified as requiring research are the development of flexible pipes suitable for cryogenic usage that can withstand the dynamic loading encountered in the marine environment; robust and low-maintenance insulation systems suitable for subsea deployment; and cooling systems to enable pipelines greater than 100 km in length. Although the primary focus of this research is on superconductor cables, the information is also applicable to other subsea conduits requiring cryogenic cooling such as 'green' hydrogen.","[Cullinane, M.; Judge, F.; O'Shea, M.; Thandayutham, K.; Murphy, J.] Univ Coll Cork, MaREI Ctr, Environm Res Inst, Cork, Ireland",University College Cork,"Cullinane, M (corresponding author), Univ Coll Cork, MaREI Ctr, Environm Res Inst, Cork, Ireland.",margaretcullinane@ucc.ie,,,"Science Foundation Ireland through MaREI; SFI Research Centre for Energy, Climate, and Marine [12/RC/2302_P2]]; Super-Node Ltd.;  [12/RC/2302_P2]","Science Foundation Ireland through MaREI(Science Foundation Ireland); SFI Research Centre for Energy, Climate, and Marine; Super-Node Ltd.; ","This research was funded by Science Foundation Ireland through MaREI, the SFI Research Centre for Energy, Climate, and Marine [Grant No: 12/RC/2302_P2] , with supporting funding obtained from Super-Node Ltd.",,66,0,0,3,6,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",1364-0321,1879-0690,,RENEW SUST ENERG REV,Renew.

Th/U age estimates of cave drapery range from 9800 to 27,300 yr B.P. while conventional 14 C age is estimated between 9900 and 7610 yr B.P. depending on the dead carbon correction. The age discrepancy is attributed to a disturbance of Th/U and/or C-14 geochemical systems, showing the limits of the geochronological approach applied to this kind of material. For the Th/U system, the poor consistency of U data (U content, U-234/U-238 activity ratios) and apparent ages argue for open system conditions. For 14C System, variation of the dead carbon fraction (dcf) and a possible mixing of successive generations of calcite could account for age discrepancy. Nevertheless, one sample shows concordant ages for the two methods. Compatible ages through corrections for open system conditions are assumed for other samples. Then, the cross-dating suggests 9900 yr as the minimum age of the piece of drapery; the underlying painting must be older. This study of rock art demonstrates the presence of a Pleistocene population before 9900 yr in the southeast of Borneo, whereas previously the only population in evidence in this area was of Austronesian type from similar to5000 to 6000 yrs ago.

Here, we compare an improved simulation model for cascading failures with state-of-the-art simulation models for short-term grid dynamics. Random ensembles of realistic power grid topologies are generated using a recent model that allows for a tuning of global vs local redundancy. The former can be measured by the algebraic connectivity of the network, whereas the latter can be measured by the networks transitivity. We show that, while frequency stability of an electricity grid benefits from a global form of redundancy, resilience against cascading failures rather requires a more local form of redundancy and further analyse the corresponding trade-off.","[Plietzsch, A.; Schultz, P.; Kurths, J.] Humboldt Univ, Inst Phys, D-12489 Berlin, Germany; [Plietzsch, A.; Schultz, P.; Heitzig, J.; Kurths, J.] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany; [Kurths, J.] Univ Aberdeen, Inst Complex Syst & Math Biol, Aberdeen AB24 3FX, Scotland; [Kurths, J.] Nizhnii Novgorod State Univ, Dept Control Theory, Nizhnii Novgorod 606950, Russia",Humboldt University of Berlin; Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; University of Aberdeen; Lobachevsky State University of Nizhni Novgorod,"Plietzsch, A (corresponding author), Humboldt Univ, Inst Phys, D-12489 Berlin, Germany.;Plietzsch, A (corresponding author), Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany.",antonp@physik.hu-berlin.de; pschultz@pik-potsdam.de; heitzig@pik-potsdam.de,/AAD-2403-2020,"/0000-0002-1785-6476; Plietzsch, Anton/0000-0001-7480-2493",BMBF; CoNDyNet [FK. 03SF0472A]; EIT Climate-KIC project SWIPO,BMBF(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); CoNDyNet; EIT Climate-KIC project SWIPO,"We acknowledge gratefully the support of BMBF, CoNDyNet, FK. 03SF0472A (P.S., J.K.) and from the EIT Climate-KIC project SWIPO (J.H.).",,26,19,19,1,17,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1951-6355,1951-6401,,EUR PHYS J-SPEC TOP,Eur.

Typically, precipitating hydrometeors are treated diagnostically in most GCMs, and their radiative effects are ignored. Here, we quantify how the treatment of precipitation influences the simulated effective radiative forcing due to aerosol-cloud interactions (ERFaci) using a state-of-the-art GCM with a two-moment prognostic precipitation scheme that incorporates the radiative effect of precipitating particles, and we investigate how microphysical process representations are related to macroscopic climate effects. Prognostic precipitation substantially weakens the magnitude of ERFaci (by approximately 54 %) compared with the traditional diagnostic scheme, and this is the result of the increased longwave (warming) and weakened shortwave (cooling) components of ERFaci. The former is attributed to additional adjustment processes induced by falling snow, and the latter stems largely from riming of snow by collection of cloud droplets. The significant reduction in ERFaci does not occur without prognostic snow, which contributes mainly by buffering the cloud response to aerosol perturbations through depleting cloud water via collection. Prognostic precipitation also alters the regional pattern of ERFaci, particularly over northern midlatitudes where snow is abundant. The treatment of precipitation is thus a highly influential controlling factor of ERFaci, contributing more than other uncertain tunable processes related to aerosol-cloud-precipitation interactions. This change in ERFaci caused by the treatment of precipitation is large enough to explain the existing difference in ERFaci between GCMs and observations.","[Michibata, Takuro; Takemura, Toshihiko] Kyushu Univ, Res Inst Appl Mech, Fukuoka 8168580, Japan; [Suzuki, Kentaroh] Univ Tokyo, Atmosphere & Ocean Res Inst, Chiba 2778568, Japan",Kyushu University; University of Tokyo,"Michibata, T (corresponding author), Kyushu Univ, Res Inst Appl Mech, Fukuoka 8168580, Japan.",michibata@riam.kyushu-u.ac.jp,"Takemura, Toshihiko/C-2822-2009; Suzuki, Kentaroh/C-3624-2011","Takemura, Toshihiko/0000-0002-2859-6067; Michibata, Takuro/0000-0002-1491-0297","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science KAKENHI [JP18J00301, JP19K14795, JP19H05669]; Integrated Research Program for Advancing Climate Models (TOUGOU) from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology [JPMXD0717935457]; Environment Research and Technology Development Fund of the Environmental Restoration and Conservation Agency of Japan [JPMEERF20202R03]; JAXA EarthCARE project; Collaborative Research Program of the Research Institute for Applied Mechanics, Kyushu University","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Integrated Research Program for Advancing Climate Models (TOUGOU) from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology; Environment Research and Technology Development Fund of the Environmental Restoration and Conservation Agency of Japan; JAXA EarthCARE project; Collaborative Research Program of the Research Institute for Applied Mechanics, Kyushu University","This research has been supported by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science KAKENHI (grant nos.

External radiative forced simulations with the same model do not provide a significant relationship between the TNA surface and subsurface temperature variations. The observed detrended multidecadal TNA subsurface temperature anomaly may be taken as a proxy for the AMOC variability.

The use of renewable energy, especially solar energy, could significantly reduce the dependence on fossil fuels. This paper analyzes the relationship between urban morphology and solar availability under the semi-arid climate and environmental conditions of Batna city (Algeria). A Grasshopper-based automated morphology generation and simulation system for evaluating solar access has been developed. Morphological and solar analyses of ten representative residential fabrics of Banta's collective housing stock were performed to compare and identify the best configuration in terms of solar technology use. Four solar performance indicators have been assessed: (i) Building Integrated Photovoltaic Index (BIPVi), (ii) Active Solar Collector index (ASCi), (iii) Passive Solar Index for Heating (PSI_heating), and (vi) Passive Solar Index for Cooling (PSI_cooling). Findings suggest that roofs receive three times more annual solar irradiation than facades and about four times more in Summer. Moreover, Samples showing consistent building height, low volume-to-area ratio, low site coverage, low density, and detached configuration get the best results of solar performance indicators. Finally, active solar collectors appear to be the most effective solar technology in the studied context.","[Mahaya, Chafik; Zemmouri, Noureddine] Mohamed Khider Univ, Lab Design & Modeling Architectural Forms & Ambian, BP 145 RP, Biskra 07000, Algeria; [Benharra, Houda] Univ 8 Mai 1945 Guelma, Dept Architecture, BP 401, Guelma 24000, Algeria; [Elnokaly, Amira] Univ Lincoln, Sch Architecture & Built Environm, Lincoln, England",Universite Mohamed Khider Biskra; Universite 8 Mai 1945 de Guelma; University of Lincoln,"Mahaya, C (corresponding author), Mohamed Khider Univ, Lab Design & Modeling Architectural Forms & Ambian, BP 145 RP, Biskra 07000, Algeria.",c.mahaya@univ-biskra.dz,"Elnokaly, Amira/S-7655-2019","Elnokaly, Amira/0000-0002-9780-3779; mahaya, chafik/0000-0001-8617-9977",Grant of the Ministry of Higher Education of Algeria; Mohamed Khider University; University of Lincoln; Laboratory of design and modeling of architectural forms and ambiances (LACOMOFA),Grant of the Ministry of Higher Education of Algeria; Mohamed Khider University; University of Lincoln; Laboratory of design and modeling of architectural forms and ambiances (LACOMOFA),The authors gratefully acknowledge the Grant of the Ministry of Higher Education of Algeria and the support of both Mohamed Khider University and the University of Lincoln.

In many speleothems, this signal is classically interpreted via the amount effect. However, recent work has shown that precipitation delta O-18 (delta O-18(p)) is greatly influenced by convective processes distinct from precipitation amount, and new observations indicate that delta O-18(p) is negatively correlated with the fraction of stratiform precipitation. Isotope-enabled climate models have emerged as a key interpretive tool in water isotope systematics, and it is thus important to determine to what extent they can reproduce these relationships. Here seven isotope-enabled models, including the state-of-the-art model iCAM5, are evaluated to see whether they can simulate the impact of convective activity on delta O-18(p) in observations. The results show that, of these models, only iCAM5 can simulate the observed anticorrelation between stratiform fraction and delta O-18(p). Furthermore, while all models can simulate the observed relationship between outgoing longwave radiation and delta O-18(p), different models achieve this via different mechanisms-some getting the right answer for the wrong reasons. Because iCAM5 appears in various metrics to correctly simulate delta O-18(p) variability, we use it to examine long-standing interpretations of delta O-18(p) over Asia. We find that the contribution of convective processes is very site dependent, with local processes accounting for a very small amount of variance at the sites of most Chinese cave records (speleothems). The residual is attributed to source and transport effects. Our results imply that state-of-the-art models like iCAM5 can and should be used to guide the interpretation of delta O-18(p)-based proxies.","[Hu, Jun; Emile-Geay, Julien] Univ Southern Calif, Dept Earth Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA; [Nusbaumer, Jesse] NASA, Goddard Inst Space Studies, New York, NY 10025 USA; [Noone, David] Oregon State Univ, Coll Earth Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA",University of Southern California; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; Oregon State University,"Hu, J (corresponding author), Univ Southern Calif, Dept Earth Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA.",hujun@usc.edu,"Hu, Jun/K-8453-2019; Emile-Geay, Julien/B-1102-2010","Emile-Geay, Julien/0000-0001-5920-4751; NOONE, DAVID/0000-0002-8642-7843; Nusbaumer, Jesse/0000-0002-4370-3537; Hu, Jun/0000-0002-0458-5996",University of Southern California (USC),University of Southern California (USC),We thank Pradeep Aggarwal for helpful discussions.

This study introduces a global gridded monthly reconstruction of runoff covering the period from 1902 to 2014. In situ streamflow observations are used to train a machine learning algorithm that predicts monthly runoff rates based on antecedent precipitation and temperature from an atmospheric reanalysis. The accuracy of this reconstruction is assessed with cross-validation and compared with an independent set of discharge observations for large river basins. The presented dataset agrees on average better with the streamflow observations than an ensemble of 13 state-of-the art global hydrological model runoff simulations. We estimate a global long-term mean runoff of 38 452 km(3)yr(-1) in agreement with previous assessments. The temporal coverage of the reconstruction offers an unprecedented view on large-scale features of runoff variability in regions with limited data coverage, making it an ideal candidate for large-scale hydro-climatic process studies, water resource assessments, and evaluating and refining existing hydrological models. The paper closes with example applications fostering the understanding of global freshwater dynamics, interannual variability, drought propagation and the response of runoff to atmospheric teleconnections.

It will bring huge transportation benefits due to reduction in navigational time, fossil energy consumption and related carbon emissions. In this article, the authors comprehensively assessed the exploitation of trans-Arctic maritime transportation based upon the mining of big data. Because Arctic sea ice prone regions are a significant challenge for charting Arctic routes, state-of-the art remote sensing datasets can provide an accurate and reliable approach to monitoring near real-time large-scale variability of Arctic sea ice conditions. Large-sized datasets of weather/climate modeling can provide a short-term forecast and long-term prediction on changes of Arctic sea ice and related weather/climate conditions, which are indispensable for the exploitation of trans-Arctic maritime transportation. Based on these big data, the authors established the near real-time dynamic optimal trans-Arctic route system to guarantee safe, secure, and efficient trans-Arctic navigation. Such dynamic maps will help the pilots of vessels to maintain safe distances from icebergs and large-size ice floes and to save time, fuel and operational costs and risks.

An IOD event starts sometime in May-June, peaks in September-October and ends in November. Through atmospheric teleconnections, it affects the climate of many parts of the world, especially that of East Africa, Australia, India, Japan, and Europe. Owing to its large impacts, previous studies have addressed the predictability of the IOD using state of the art coupled climate models. Here, for the first-time, we predict the IOD using machine learning techniques, in particular artificial neural networks (ANNs). The IOD forecasts are generated for May to November from February-April conditions. The attributes for the ANNs are derived from sea surface temperature, 850 hPa and 200 hPa geopotential height anomalies, using a correlation analysis for the period 1949-2018. An ensemble of ANN forecasts is generated using 500 samples with replacement using jackknife approach. The ensemble mean of the IOD forecasts indicates the machine learning based ANN models to be capable of forecasting the IOD index well in advance with excellent skills. The forecast skills are much superior to the skills obtained from the persistence forecasts that one would guess from the observed data. The ANN models also perform far better than the models of the North American Multi-Model Ensemble (NMME) with higher correlation coefficients and lower root mean square errors (RMSE) for all the target months of May-November.","[Ratnam, J.

In 1961 Dora I was sold to private investors who put it to use as a warehouse. During the 1990s it became evident that postwar construction and adaptation had contributed to establishing a unique microclimate within Dora I. Without any use of artificial ventilation or heating systems, the temperature inside the building changes slowly from summer to winter and varies less than 10 C over the year. The relative humidity stays pretty much stable the year around. This fact, combined with the lack of any natural light inside the massive building, makes it very well suited for long time storage of any type of organic material collected by museums, archives and libraries. In 2006, a new archival centre opened next to Dora I, collocating four in principle independent archival institutions. This archive centre uses the former submarine pens as depositories, storing currently approximately 130 000 shelf meters of documents. In addition, a number of regional museums and art collections have established themselves with depositories in Dora I. At present Dora I is slowly turning into a multicultural regional centre hosting concerts, theatre plays and art exhibitions.","[Carstens, S.] Sor Trondelag Univ Coll, Social Sci Div, Fac Teacher & Interpreter Educ, Trondheim, Norway",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),,,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,0,WIT PRESS,SOUTHAMPTON,"ASHURST LODGE, SOUTHAMPTON SO40 7AA, ASHURST, ENGLAND",1746-4498,,978-1-84564-590-8,WIT TRANS BUILT ENV,,,2012,,,,,219,229,,10.2495/DSFH120181,http://dx.doi.org/10.2495/DSFH120181,,,11,History; Urban Studies,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH),History; Urban Studies,BA9GC,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000339353500018,View Full Record in Web of Science

Still, the impact of atmospheric pollutants, in particular that of aerosol particles, on weather and climate in this region is virtually unexplored. In this study, the regional-scale model framework COSMO-ART is applied to SWA for a summer monsoon process study on 2-3 July 2016 to assess the aerosol direct and indirect effect on clouds and atmospheric dynamics. The modeling study is supported by observational data obtained during the extensive field campaign of the project DACCIWA (Dynamics-Aerosol-Chemistry-Cloud Interactions in West Africa) in June-July 2016. As indicated in previous studies, a coastal front is observed that develops during daytime and propagates inland in the evening (Atlantic inflow). Increasing the aerosol amount in COSMO-ART leads to reduced propagation velocities with frontal displacements of 10-30 km and a weakening of the nocturnal low-level jet. This is related to a subtle balance of processes related to the decrease in near-surface heating: (1) flow deceleration due to reduced land-sea temperature contrast and thus local pressure gradient, (2) reduced turbulence favoring frontal advance inland and (3) delayed stratus-to-cumulus transition of 1-2 h via a later onset of the convective boundary layer. The spatial shift of the Atlantic inflow and the temporal shift of the stratus-to-cumulus transition are synergized in a new conceptual model. We hypothesize a negative feedback of the stratus-to-cumulus transition on the Atlantic inflow with increased aerosol. The results exhibit radiation as the key player governing the aerosol affects on SWA atmospheric dynamics via the aerosol direct effect and the Twomey effect, whereas impacts on precipitation are small.","[Deetz, Konrad; Vogel, Heike; Knippertz, Peter; Adler, Bianca; Kottmeier, Christoph; Vogel, Bernhard] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Karlsruhe, Germany; [Taylor, Jonathan; Coe, Hugh; Bower, Keith; Haslett, Sophie; Flynn, Michael; Dorsey, James; Crawford, Ian] Univ Manchester, Natl Ctr Atmospher Sci, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Taylor, Jonathan; Coe, Hugh; Bower, Keith; Haslett, Sophie; Flynn, Michael; Dorsey, James; Crawford, Ian] Univ Manchester, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Manchester, Lancs, England",Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); NERC National Centre for Atmospheric Science; University of Manchester; University of Manchester,"Deetz, K (corresponding author), Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Karlsruhe, Germany.",konrad.deetz@kit.edu,"Adler, Bianca/B-4406-2018; Haslett, Sophie/ABB-9845-2020; Vogel, Bernhard/A-9558-2013; Taylor, Jonathan/AAD-2004-2022; Knippertz, Peter/D-5861-2016; Kottmeier, Christoph/A-9553-2013","Adler, Bianca/0000-0002-0384-7456; Vogel, Bernhard/0000-0002-8894-0165; Taylor, Jonathan/0000-0002-2120-186X; Knippertz, Peter/0000-0001-9856-619X; Kottmeier, Christoph/0000-0002-2196-2052; Dorsey, James/0000-0002-1720-9412; Coe, Hugh/0000-0002-3264-1713; Crawford, Ian/0000-0003-4433-7310; Bower, Keith/0000-0002-9802-3264","European Union [603502]; NERC [ncas10003, NE/L013584/1] Funding Source: UKRI",European Union(European Commission); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),The research leading to these results received funding from the European Union 7th Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) under grant agreement no. 603502 (EU project DACCIWA: Dynamics-Aerosol-Chemistry-Cloud Interactions in West Africa).

The objective was to identify the maximum acreage potential with suitability for viniculture in Rhineland-Palatinate as a theoretical high-case scenario for liberalisation. For this purpose an acreage simulation model was developed and validated to capture and consolidate climate data, simulation runs of regional climate models, geodata, the automated land property map and actual measuring data on frost damage. Full account was taken of anthropogenic, climatic and pedological selection criteria. Finally a GIS-based data blending with the suitable areas yielded the potential acreage for viniculture in Rhineland-Palatinate. The model estimates an additional acreage potential with suitability for viniculture of 335,000 acres (135,000 ha) in Rhineland-Palatinate. The analyses further underline the potential for state-of-the art risk management and data based managerial decision making to counter climate induced challenges.","[Dressler, Marc] Ludwigshafen Univ, DLR Rheinpfalz Rhineland Palatinate Serv Ctr Rura, Prof Business & Entrepreneurship, D-67435 Neustadt, Germany; [Oberhofer, Juergen] DLR Rheinpfalz Rhineland Palatinate Serv Ctr Rura, D-67435 Neustadt, Germany",,"Dressler, M (corresponding author), Ludwigshafen Univ, DLR Rheinpfalz Rhineland Palatinate Serv Ctr Rura, Prof Business & Entrepreneurship, D-67435 Neustadt, Germany.",,"Dressler, Marc/X-3775-2019","Dressler, Marc/0000-0003-2362-0993",,,,,42,0,0,0,2,E D P SCIENCES,CEDEX A,"17 AVE DU HOGGAR PARC D ACTIVITES COUTABOEUF BP 112, F-91944 CEDEX A, FRANCE",2117-4458,,,BIO WEB CONF,,,2015,,,,,,,1001,10.1051/bioconf/20150501001,http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/bioconf/20150501001,,,5,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture; Plant Sciences,BD3NI,,"Green Submitted, gold, Green Published",,,12/21/22,WOS:000359945200001,View Full Record in Web of Science
