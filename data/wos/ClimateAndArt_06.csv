In past decades, state-of-the-art studies have been extensively conducted to achieve sustainable energy conversion and storage. However, the remaining challenges in the commercialization of energy conversion and storage devices are to develop novel materials and advanced manufacturing processes. Furthermore, the engineering of nanostructures and device-architectures is of great importance for the energy conversion and storage flat forms.

It makes a case why we should care about islands and their sustainability. Islands are hotspots of biocultural diversity, and home to 600 million people that depend on one-sixth of the earth's total area, including the surrounding oceans, for their subsistence. Today, they are on the frontlines of climate change and face an existential crisis. Islands are, however, potential hubs of innovation and are uniquely positioned to be leaders in sustainability and climate action. We argue that a full-fledged program on island industrial ecology is urgently needed with the aim to offer policy-relevant insights and strategies to sustain small islands in an era of global environmental change. We introduce key industrial ecology concepts, and the state-of-the-art in applying them to islands. Nine contributions in this Special Issue are briefly reviewed to highlight the metabolic risks inherent in the island cases. The contributors explore how reconfiguring patterns of resource use will allow island governments to build resilience and adapt to the challenges of climate change.","[Singh, Simron Jit.] Univ Waterloo Environm, Sch Environm Enterprise & Dev SEED, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; [Fischer-Kowalski, Marina] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci BOKU, Inst Social Ecol SEC, A-1190 Vienna, Austria; [Chertow, Marian] Yale Univ, Yale Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT 06511 USA","University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna; Yale University","Singh, SJ (corresponding author), Univ Waterloo Environm, Sch Environm Enterprise & Dev SEED, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.",simron.singh@uwaterloo.ca; marina.fischer-kowalski@boku.ac.at; marian.chertow@yale.edu,"Fischer-Kowalski, Marina/O-9646-2019","Fischer-Kowalski, Marina/0000-0003-3345-4538; Chertow, Marian/0000-0003-4176-6224; Singh, Simron/0000-0001-7012-893X",,,,,57,4,4,2,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,NOV,2020,22,,,,,,9516,10.3390/su12229516,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12229516,,,8,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,OZ0CW,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000594605400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Highly resolved and continuous sea-level records are essential for quantifying ice-volume changes. However, an unbiased study of the timing of past ice-volume changes, relative to polar climate change, has so far been impossible because available sea-level records either were dated by using orbital tuning or ice-core timescales, or were discontinuous in time. Here we present an independent dating of a continuous, high-resolution sea-level record(1,2) in millennial-scale detail throughout the past 150,000 years. We find that the timing of ice-volume fluctuations agrees well with that of variations in Antarctic climate and especially Greenland climate. Amplitudes of ice-volume fluctuations more closely match Antarctic (rather than Greenland) climate changes. Polar climate and ice-volume changes, and their rates of change, are found to covary within centennial response times. Finally, rates of sea-level rise reached at least 1.2 m per century during all major episodes of ice-volume reduction.","[Grant, K. M.; Rohling, E.

Motivated by challenges in simulating ARs with state-of-the-art global models, this paper diagnoses model errors with a focus on relative contributions of moisture convergence, evaporation, and precipitation to AR column-integrated water vapor (IWV) budget. Using 20-year simulations by 24 global weather/climate models, budget terms are calculated for four AR sectors: postfrontal, frontal, prefrontal, and pre-AR, with biases assessed against two reanalysis products. The results indicate that each sector is unique in terms of the dominant water vapor balance, and that the terms exhibiting the largest intermodel spread are the same terms dominating the water vapor balance in each sector. Overall, simulated bulk AR characteristics (e.g., geometry, frequency, and intensity) are more sensitive to biases in IVT convergence and IWV tendency than to biases in evaporation and precipitation, although evaporation/precipitation biases do affect key AR bulk characteristics in selected sectors. The large intermodel spread (particularly for precipitation) and, in certain cases, discrepancies between the reanalysis references themselves (particularly for precipitation types) highlight the need for observational efforts that target better constraining AR processes in weather/climate models and reanalyses.","[Guan, Bin; Waliser, Duane E.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Joint Inst Reg Earth Syst Sci & Engn, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Guan, Bin; Waliser, Duane E.] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, MS 233-300,4800 Oak Grove Dr, Pasadena, CA 91109 USA; [Ralph, F.

Super-cooled droplets within these clouds remain liquid until an INP immersed in or colliding with the droplet reaches its activation temperature. Only a few aerosol particles are acting as INPs and the freezing efficiency varies among them. Thus, the fraction of supercooled water in the cloud depends on the specific properties and concentrations of the INPs. Primary biological aerosol particles (PBAPs) have been identified as very efficient INPs at high subzero temperatures, but their very low atmospheric concentrations make it difficult to quantify their impact on clouds. Here we use the regional atmospheric model COSMO-ART to simulate the heterogeneous ice nucleation by PBAPs during a 1-week case study on a domain covering Europe. We focus on three highly ice-nucleation-active PBAP species, Pseudomonas syringae bacteria cells and spores from the fungi Cladosporium sp. and Mortierella alpina. PBAP emissions are parameterized in order to represent the entirety of bacteria and fungal spores in the atmosphere. Thus, only parts of the simulated PBAPs are assumed to act as INPs. The ice nucleation parameterizations are specific for the three selected species and are based on a deterministic approach. The PBAP concentrations simulated in this study are within the range of previously reported results from other modeling studies and atmospheric measurements. Two regimes of PBAP INP concentrations are identified: a temperature-limited and a PBAP-limited regime, which occur at temperatures above and below a maximal concentration at around -10 degrees C, respectively. In an ensemble of control and disturbed simulations, the change in the average ice crystal concentration by biological INPs is not statistically significant, suggesting that PBAPs have no significant influence on the average state of the cloud ice phase. However, if the cloud top temperature is below -15 degrees C, PBAP can influence the cloud ice phase and produce ice crystals in the absence of other INPs. Nevertheless, the number of produced ice crystals is very low and it has no influence on the modeled number of cloud droplets and hence the cloud structure.","[Hummel, Matthias; Hoose, Corinna; Schaupp, Caroline; Moehler, Ottmar] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Karlsruhe, Germany; [Pummer, Bernhard; Froehlich-Nowoisky, Janine] Max Planck Inst Chem, Dept Multiphase Chem, Mainz, Germany; [Hummel, Matthias] Univ Oslo, Dept Geosci, Oslo, Norway",Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; Max Planck Society; University of Oslo,"Hummel, M (corresponding author), Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Karlsruhe, Germany.;Hummel, M (corresponding author), Univ Oslo, Dept Geosci, Oslo, Norway.",matthias.hummel@alumni.kit.edu,"Möhler, Ottmar/J-9426-2012; Froehlich, Janine/D-6227-2015; Hoose, Corinna/A-4295-2009","Möhler, Ottmar/0000-0002-7551-9814; Froehlich, Janine/0000-0002-1278-0054; Hoose, Corinna/0000-0003-2827-5789","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [DFG FR3641/1-2, FOR 1525 INUIT]; Open Access Publishing Fund of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; DFG [HO 4612/1-1 (FOR 1525 INUIT)]; German Science Foundation (DFG) through the project BIOCLOUDS [MO 668/2-1]; Helmholtz Association",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Open Access Publishing Fund of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; DFG(German Research Foundation (DFG)); German Science Foundation (DFG) through the project BIOCLOUDS(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Helmholtz Association(Helmholtz Association),"The authors wish to thank Marco Paukert and Max Bangert for their help and support with the model and also Isabelle Steinke and Romy Fosig for their valuable discussions.

While there is a significant asymmetry between the political tensions on the northern and southern borders of the United States, there are remarkable parallels and relays between events that have taken place in major cities on these borders that indicate that generalized border anxiety has spread far beyond the localized territory of the southern borderlands. In this heightened climate of border insecurity, artists and community groups have seized on the geopolitical confusion that has emerged in mainstream American media where issues such as terrorism and illegal migration have often been folded into the same discourse. While border regions are tightly controlled spaces, these projects have served to highlight contradictory narratives of globalization and security, unmasking national insecurities that have been submerged through the bureaucratic discourses of the North American Free Trade Agreement and the more recent Smart Border agreements.","Univ Windsor, Sch Visual Arts, Windsor, ON N9B 3P4, Canada",University of Windsor,"Rodney, L (corresponding author), Univ Windsor, Sch Visual Arts, Sunset Ave, Windsor, ON N9B 3P4, Canada.",lrodney@uwindsor.ca,,,,,,,23,3,3,0,9,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1206-3312,,,SPACE CULT,Space Cult.,NOV,2011,4,,,,384,397,,10.1177/1206331211412250,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1206331211412250,,,14,Cultural Studies; Geography,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;HCI),Cultural Studies; Geography,890KW,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000300144500003,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this discursive climate, culture constitutes a crucial terrain of investment for European Muslims in their struggle for inclusion and recognition. Based on two different ethnographic research projects among European Muslims, this essay examines two distinct types of culture discourses. One employs an Islam-versus-culture trope that serves to disconnect Islam from certain patriarchal practices perceived to exist within Muslim communities. The other discourse defends the intrinsic and symbiotic link between Islam and culture, especially in order to elevate the place of artistic practices within Muslim communities. To make sense of these seeming contradictions, I explore the multivalent meanings contained in my interlocutors' uses of the culture concept by tracing the respective genealogies of these meanings. This includes an investigation of culture's conceptual histories, formulated successively by Enlightenment thinkers, Romanticists, and early anthropologists, as well as by Islamic reformers and their more recent successors. My investigation into these conceptual histories exposes broader concerns about individual freedom and agency on the part of cultural theorists, which have furthermore enabled various claims about modernity and backwardness. While European Muslims creatively integrate various articulations of the culture concept into their world-making projects, I argue that the ontological assumptions underpinning the culture concept continue to haunt and render precarious efforts to demonstrate Muslim belonging to Europe via culture.","[Jouili, Jeanette S.] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Religious Studies, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh,"Jouili, JS (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Religious Studies, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.",,,,,,,,75,11,11,0,6,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0010-4175,1475-2999,,COMP STUD SOC HIST,Comp.

J,"Rodriguez-Labajos, B",,,,"Rodriguez-Labajos, Beatriz",,,Artistic activism promotes three major forms of sustainability transformation,CURRENT OPINION IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,ART; PERFORMANCE; EXPERIENCES; ENVIRONMENT; ECOLOGY; TOURISM,"The far-reaching use of artworks (e.g. paintings, music, films) in environmental activism fosters cognitive processes and behavioural changes. At the margins of the environmental sustainability literature, the rising importance of environmental artivism is apparent with the surge of creativity after the conditions of isolation that started in 2020. There is an overall gap in literature on how different environmental claims and transformative initiatives are voiced and promoted through artistic media. This paper fills this gap by unfolding the foci, purposes and repertoire of artivists pursuing environmental sustainability. The synthesis of literature is conducted through lexicometry and illustrated with selected references. Artivism is a growing constituent of environmental activism, articulated around three major topics. The first one is the education of audiences through performative expressions of today's global environmental crises, especially climate change. The second one involves ecocritical reflections of environmental controversies and conflicts towards creative emancipatory practices. The third one positions art practice as an avenue for environmental improvement across different sectors (e.g. water, mining, urban) with involvement of citizens, governments, and corporate actors. The paper informs readers about the state and prospects of environmental artivism for expressing, communicating, and engaging with transformative politics.","[Rodriguez-Labajos, Beatriz] Pompeu Fabra Univ, UPF Publ Policy Ctr, Dept Polit & Social Sci, JHU, Barcelona, Spain; [Rodriguez-Labajos, Beatriz] Univ Calif Berkeley, Energy & Resources Grp, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",Pompeu Fabra University; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Rodriguez-Labajos, B (corresponding author), Pompeu Fabra Univ, UPF Publ Policy Ctr, Dept Polit & Social Sci, JHU, Barcelona, Spain.;Rodriguez-Labajos, B (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Energy & Resources Grp, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",beatriz.rodriguez@upf.edu,"Rodriguez-Labajos, Beatriz/I-6257-2015","Rodriguez-Labajos, Beatriz/0000-0002-0559-910X","European Unions Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Grant [797444]; Beatriu de Pinos Fellowship by the Agency for Management of University and Research Grants (AGAUR), Generalitat de Catalunya [2020-BP-00053]","European Unions Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Grant(SKA South Africa); Beatriu de Pinos Fellowship by the Agency for Management of University and Research Grants (AGAUR), Generalitat de Catalunya","The research received funding from the European Unions Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Grant Agreement No 797444, and from the Beatriu de Pinos Fellowship 2020-BP-00053 by the Agency for Management of University and Research Grants (AGAUR), Generalitat de Catalunya.

These states are vulnerable to multifarious natural hazards that often cause considerable socioeconomic dislocation. Such events inflict heavy losses on businesses and households, and significantly disrupt all aspects of government operations. After Hurricane Ivan devastated the economies of some islands in September 2004with estimated losses of as much as 200 per cent of gross domestic product in some casesregional governments, aided by the World Bank and international donors, approved the creation of a regional catastrophe insurance scheme. This parametric-based mechanism is underpinned by derivatives-based catastrophe modelling whose outputs determine policy triggers and pay outs. Hazard models, particularly catastrophe models, are not widely accepted as yet. Despite recent advancements, major concerns have rendered them peripheral tools for many establishments. This paper reviews the region's vulnerabilities and examines constraints on the application of these models and suggests a means of improving their efficacy and acceptability.","[Joyette, Antonio R.

The response of ecosystem carbon exchange to changes in temperature and the water balance is still very uncertain, a fact that highlights the need for research in order to understand the role of the biosphere in the future global carbon budget. South east Spain is on the borderline between the tropical and mid-latitude climate zones, with climates ranging from sub-humid to arid, and the majority representing the driest area in Europe. Initial predictions on climate change for this region point to decreases in total precipitation and the number of precipitation events, meaning a decrease in water availability underlining the vulnerability of the region to desertification. This region, due to these special climatic conditions, has been the subject of experimental carbon and water field research in recent years. This paper defines the state of the art of carbon and water balance measurement and modelling studies in this region, analyses the different processes involved in aggregate exchanges (vegetation and soil; net ecosystem carbon balance-evapotranspiration, photosynthesis-transpiration, soil respiration-evaporation), and identifies needs for future research.

Its significance is tied to the important upheavals that destabilised regional-scale economic systems, leading to the dislocation of mighty Empires and, finally, to the demise of a societal model (termed the Crisis Years). Recent studies have suggested that a centuries-long drought, of regional scale, termed the 3.2 ka BP event, could be one of the motors behind this spiral of decline. Here, we focus on this pivotal period, coupling new palaeoenvironmental data and radiocarbon dates from Syria (the site of Tell Tweini) and Cyprus (the site of Pyla-Kokkinokremnos), to probe whether climate change accelerated changes in the Eastern Mediterranean's Old World, by inducing crop failures/low harvests, possibly engendering severe food shortages and even famine. We show that the Late Bronze Age crisis and the following Dark Ages were framed by an 300-year drought episode that significantly impacted crop yields and may have led to famine. Our data underline the agro-productive sensitivity of ancient Mediterranean societies to environmental changes, as well as the potential link between adverse climate pressures and harvest/famine.","[Kaniewski, David; Otto, Thierry; Luce, Frederic; Van Campo, Elise] Univ Paul Sabatier, EcoLab, Lab Ecol Fonct Environm, Batiment 4R1,118 Route Narbonne, F-31062 Toulouse, France; [Kaniewski, David; Otto, Thierry; Luce, Frederic; Van Campo, Elise] CNRS, EcoLab, Lab Ecol Fonct Environm, F-31062 Toulouse, France; [Kaniewski, David] Inst Univ France, Sect Biol Med Sante, 103 Blvd St Michel, F-75005 Paris, France; [Marriner, Nick] Univ Franche Comte, CNRS, Lab Chronoenvironm, UMR6249,UFR ST, 16 Route Gray, F-25030 Besancon, France; [Bretschneider, Joachim] Univ Ghent, Fac Art & Philosophy, Dept Archeol Ancient Near East, St Pietersnieuwst 35, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Jans, Greta] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Fac Letteren, Near Eastern Studies, Blijde Inkomststr 21, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium; [Morhange, Christophe] Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, IRD, INRA,Coll France,CEREGE, Aix En Provence, France; [Morhange, Christophe] Univ Haifa, RIMS, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel; [Cheddadi, Rachid] Univ Montpellier II, CNRS, UM2, IRD,ISEM, Montpellier, France",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Federale Toulouse Midi-Pyrenees (ComUE); Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier; Institut National Polytechnique de Toulouse; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Toulouse; Universite Federale Toulouse Midi-Pyrenees (ComUE); Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier; Institut National Polytechnique de Toulouse; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut Universitaire de France; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Franche-Comte; Ghent University; KU Leuven; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); INRAE; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); UDICE-French Research Universities; Aix-Marseille Universite; PSL Research University Paris; College de France; University of Haifa; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite de Montpellier,"Kaniewski, D (corresponding author), Univ Paul Sabatier, EcoLab, Lab Ecol Fonct Environm, Batiment 4R1,118 Route Narbonne, F-31062 Toulouse, France.;Kaniewski, D (corresponding author), CNRS, EcoLab, Lab Ecol Fonct Environm, F-31062 Toulouse, France.;Kaniewski, D (corresponding author), Inst Univ France, Sect Biol Med Sante, 103 Blvd St Michel, F-75005 Paris, France.",david.kaniewski@univ-tlse3.fr,"Kaniewski, David/AAT-2607-2021; Cheddadi, Rachid/GXM-6391-2022; Marriner, Nick/AAA-3004-2019","Kaniewski, David/0000-0001-6569-3184; Marriner, Nick/0000-0002-7916-6059; Otto, Thierry/0000-0003-2854-6454",,,,,72,16,16,2,10,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1436-3798,1436-378X,,REG ENVIRON CHANGE,Reg.

The challenges of physical renovation or refurbishment are complex due to poor condition of the buildings, municipal ownership and governance, mixed management with community and low rents, which are insufficient to cover the costs. The paper discusses the proposed solutions of living standards, supported by the research in two directions: (i) available resources and reuse of materials, (ii) developing a renovation guidance for inhabitants from the building physics perspective, including indoor environment quality. Challenges related to energy efficiency are addressed from the decision-making perspective to overcome the barrier of lack of motivation to invest in energy-efficient measures at the individual and community level. The interdisciplinary approach complements engineering-focused studies with a focus on the comfort conditions and the influence of occupant habits in sustainable buildings. The methods used were literature review, case studies with observations and survey, looking to cover all technical, social, and historical aspects of sustainable renovation of cultural heritage buildings with the same level of importance. Results show that to keep a sustainable, low-cost urban living model, instructions for self-renovation are a valuable guidance for non-professional actors to make more sustainable choices. In conclusion, we can emphasize that inhabitants are accustomed to lower living standards, so the project is aimed to present the proper solutions for improvement as a balance between new sustainable technical solutions, personal self-renovation skills, habits, and health.","[Senior, Coline; Salaj, Alenka Temeljotov; Jowkar, Mina] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway; [Vukmirovic, Milena] Univ Belgrade, Dept Landscape Architecture & Hort, Belgrade 11000, Serbia; [Kristl, Ziva] New Univ, European Fac Law, Nova Gorica 5000, Slovenia",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); University of Belgrade,"Senior, C (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway.",coline.senior@ntnu.no; alenka.temeljotov-salaj@ntnu.no; milena.vukmirovic@sfb.bg.ac.rs; mina.jowkar@ntnu.no; ziva.kristl@epf.nova-uni.si,"Kristl, Živa/AAV-1273-2021; Vukmirovic, Milena/AAV-7201-2020; Salaj, Alenka Temeljotov/AAI-9208-2020","Vukmirovic, Milena/0000-0002-0239-3157; Salaj, Alenka Temeljotov/0000-0002-4139-5278; KRISTL, ZIVA/0000-0002-9706-2907",,,,,99,2,2,1,6,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1996-1073,,ENERGIES,Energies,JUL,2021,13,,,,,,4056,10.3390/en14134056,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en14134056,,,27,Energy & Fuels,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Energy & Fuels,TG4GF,,"Green Published, Green Submitted, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000671363500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Yet we know little about what this architecture looks like, why certain structures are observed, and how they are linked to the functioning of international institutions as well as the overall effectiveness of global governance. Over the past decade, network science has emerged as a promising and indispensable approach to unraveling structural nuances and complexities of the system of international institutions. This article presents a state-of-theart review of this emerging field of research and seeks to stimulate its further development. In this article, I draw connections between various network analyses of global governance that are found in different bodies of literature. In so doing, I integrate three separate but overlapping strands of work on institutional fragmentation, polycentricity, and complexity and bring much-needed conceptual clarity to the debate. Building on previous studies, I propose a framework for operationalizing fragmentation, polycentricity, and complexity in network terms in order to enable systematic and comparative analysis of global governance systems.

It was revealed that increases in total abundance were linked to metrics (both 1- and 3-year periods) that indicate greater water availability and the persistence of water in pools across the year, namely the average duration of zero-flow days over the low-flow season (negatively) and total duration of bankfull flows across the year (positively). The analysis identified 3-year metrics as being more important to the abundance of 0+ fish rather than annual ones. Taken together, these findings describing the flow requirements of a stream specialist will help to guide implementation of environmental flows, but will also highlight the need for continued exploration of flow-ecology relationships.","[Whiterod, Nick S.; Hammer, Michael] Aquasave Nat Glenelg Trust, Goolwa Beach, Australia; [Hammer, Michael] Museum & Art Gallery Northern Terr, Darwin, NT, Australia; [Vilizzi, Lorenzo] Univ Lodz, Fac Biol & Environm Protect, Dept Ecol & Vertebrate Zool, Lodz, Poland",University of Lodz,"Whiterod, NS (corresponding author), Aquasave Nat Glenelg Trust, Goolwa Beach, Australia.",nick.whiterod@aquasave.com.au,"; Vilizzi, Lorenzo/C-6263-2012","Hammer, Michael/0000-0002-0981-4647; Vilizzi, Lorenzo/0000-0001-8103-885X",South Australian Murray-Darling Basin Natural Resources Management Board,South Australian Murray-Darling Basin Natural Resources Management Board,"The present study draws on data from numerous research projects, which were predominantly funded (as was this study) by the South Australian Murray-Darling Basin Natural Resources Management Board.",,99,3,3,0,8,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0262-6667,2150-3435,,HYDROLOG SCI J,Hydrol.

However, more than 35% of the 300,000 railway bridges across Europe are over 100-years old, and their reliability directly impacts the reliability of the railway network. This increased demand may lead to higher risk associated with their unexpected failures, resulting safety hazards to passengers and increased whole life cycle cost of the asset. Consequently, one of the most important aspects of evaluation of the reliability of the overall railway transport system is bridge structural health monitoring, which can monitor the health state of the bridge by allowing an early detection of failures. Therefore, a fast, safe and cost-effective recovery of the optimal health state of the bridge, where the levels of element degradation or failure are maintained efficiently, can be achieved. In this article, after an introduction to the desired features of structural health monitoring, a review of the most commonly adopted bridge fault detection methods is presented. Mainly, the analysis focuses on model-based finite element updating strategies, non-model-based (data-driven) fault detection methods, such as artificial neural network, and Bayesian belief network-based structural health monitoring methods. A comparative study, which aims to discuss and compare the performance of the reviewed types of structural health monitoring methods, is then presented by analysing a short-span steel structure of a railway bridge. Opportunities and future challenges of the fault detection methods of railway bridges are highlighted.","[Vagnoli, Matteo; Remenyte-Prescott, Rasa; Andrews, John] Univ Nottingham, Resilience Engn Res Grp, Univ Pk, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England",University of Nottingham,"Vagnoli, M (corresponding author), Univ Nottingham, Resilience Engn Res Grp, Univ Pk, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",Matteo.vagnoli@nottingham.ac.uk,,"Andrews, John/0000-0002-2316-3959; Vagnoli, Matteo/0000-0002-2710-0808",,,,,185,57,61,17,191,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1475-9217,1741-3168,,STRUCT HEALTH MONIT,Struct.

The strategy is motivated by an arguable deficiency in most state-of-the-art land surface models, namely, the disproportionately higher emphasis given to the formulation of one-dimensional, vertical physics relative to the treatment of horizontal heterogeneity in surface properties, particularly subgrid soil moisture variability and its effects on runoff generation. The new strategy calls for the partitioning of the continental surface into a mosaic of hydrologic catchments, delineated through analysis of high-resolution surface elevation data. The effective grid used for the land surface is therefore not specified by the overlying atmospheric grid. Within each catchment, the variability of soil moisture is related to characteristics of the topography and to three bulk soil moisture variables through a well-established model of catchment processes. This modeled variability allows the partitioning of the catchment into several areas representing distinct hydrological regimes, wherein distinct (regime specific) evaporation and runoff parameterizations are applied. Care is taken to ensure that the deficiencies of the catchment model in regions of little to moderate topography are minimized.","NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Hydrol Sci Branch, Lab Hydrospher Proc, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Climate & Radiat Branch, Atmospheres Lab, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; Univ Paris 06, Lab Sisyphe, F-75252 Paris 05, France; Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, New York, NY 10027 USA; Univ Illinois, Dept Civil Engn, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Columbia University; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Koster, RD (corresponding author), NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Hydrol Sci Branch, Lab Hydrospher Proc, Code 974, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA.",randal.koster@gsfc.nasa.gov,"Kumar, Praveen/D-2036-2010; C, Praveen Kumar/AAA-8227-2019; Koster, Randal D/F-5881-2012","Kumar, Praveen/0000-0002-4787-0308; Koster, Randal D/0000-0001-6418-6383",,,,,47,584,595,2,62,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",2169-897X,,,J GEOPHYS RES-ATMOS,J.

Nine full-scale cartoons on paper - designed in 1910/1911 - are the result of Klimt's years of work on this project. He provided instructions for their transposition as a mosaic directly onto the paper. For the production of the frieze at the Wiener Werkst tte and at Leopold Forstner's Wiener Mosaikwerkstatte, Klimt gave numerous instructions regarding the materials to be used and the shades of color in the mosaic. He wrote these by hand directly onto the cartoons. The cartoons for the Stoclet Frieze, 1:1 in scale, have been the subject of extensive scholarly research and have been restored in the 1970ies. During the last eight years the cartoons were subjected to another invasive treatment. This second part deals with the de-restoration of earlier interventions, the consolidation of media and paper carrier and the mounting on acid free honeycomb cardboard panels so that the individual cartoons can be displayed side by side without interruption of frames to form a frieze.

The metabolic theory of ecology (MTE) hypothesizes the temperature-invariance of secondary production, driven by matched and opposed forces that reduce biomass of heterotrophs while increasing their biomass turnover rate (production : biomass, or P:B) with warming. To test this prediction at the whole community level, we used a geothermal heat exchanger to experimentally warm a stream in southwest Iceland by 3.8 degrees C for two years. We quantified invertebrate community biomass, production, and P:B in the experimental stream and a reference stream for one year prior to warming and two years during warming. As predicted, warming had a neutral effect on community production, but this result was not driven by opposing effects on community biomass and P:B. Instead, warming had a positive effect on both the biomass and production of larger-bodied, slower-growing taxa (e.g., larval black flies, dipteran predators, snails) and a negative effect on small-bodied taxa with relatively high growth rates (e.g., ostracods, larval chironomids). We attribute these divergent responses to differences in thermal preference between small-vs. large-bodied taxa. Although metabolic demand vs. resource supply must ultimately constrain community production, our results highlight the potential for idiosyncratic community responses to warming, driven by variation in thermal preference and body size within regional species pools.","[Nelson, Daniel; Benstead, Jonathan P.; Huryn, Alexander D.] Univ Alabama, Dept Biol Sci, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA; [Cross, Wyatt F.; Junker, James R.] Montana State Univ, Dept Ecol, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA; [Hood, James M.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Evolut Ecol & Organismal Biol, Aquat Ecol Lab, Columbus, OH 43212 USA; [Johnson, Philip W.] Univ Alabama, Dept Civil Construct & Environm Engn, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA; [Gislason, Gisli M.] Inst Life & Environm Sci, Sturlugata 7, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland; [Olafesson, Jon S.] Inst Freshwater Fisheries, IS-112 Reykjavik, Iceland",University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa; Montana State University System; Montana State University Bozeman; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa,"Nelson, D (corresponding author), Univ Alabama, Dept Biol Sci, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA.",dnelson12@crimson.ua.edu,"Gislason, Gunnar/B-7561-2009; Gíslason, Gísli Már/B-2109-2008; Junker, James/AGH-5787-2022","Gislason, Gunnar/0000-0002-0548-402X; Gíslason, Gísli Már/0000-0001-8507-1796; Junker, James/0000-0001-9713-2330","National Science Foundation [DEB-0949774, DEB-0949726]; Direct For Biological Sciences [1354624] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Division Of Environmental Biology [1354411] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Biological Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)); Division Of Environmental Biology(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)),"This work was supported by the: National Science Foundation (DEB-0949774 and DEB-0949726).

After the 1976-77 regime shift, a correlation analysis suggests that southern Indian Ocean SSTs observed during late boreal winter are a key precursor in predicting El Ni (n) over tildeo evolution as the traditional oceanic heat content anomalies in the equatorial Pacific or zonal wind anomalies over the equatorial western Pacific. The possible physical mechanisms underlying this highly significant statistical relationship are discussed. After the 1976-77 regime shift, southern Indian Ocean SST anomalies produced by Mascarene high pulses during boreal winter trigger coupled air-sea processes in the tropical eastern Indian Ocean during the following seasons. This produces a persistent remote forcing on the Pacific climate system, promoting wind anomalies over the western equatorial Pacific and modulating the regional Hadley cell in the southwest Pacific. These modulations, in turn, excite Rossby waves, which produce quasi-stationary circulation anomalies in the extratropical South Pacific, responsible for the development of the southern branch of the '' horseshoe '' El Nino pattern. The change of the background SST state that occurred in the late 1970s over the Indian Ocean may also explain why ENSO evolution is different before and after the 1976-77 regime shift. These results shed some light on the possible influence of global warming or decadal fluctuations on El Nino evolution through changes in teleconnection patterns between the Indian and Pacific Oceans.","Univ Paris 06, Lab Oceanog Dynam & Climatol, IPSL, F-75252 Paris, France; Univ Paris 07, Paris, France; IPSL, Lab Oceanog Dynam & Climatol, Paris, France",UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Universite Paris Cite; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Cite; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Cite,"Terray, P (corresponding author), Univ Paris 06, Lab Oceanog Dynam & Climatol, IPSL, 4 Pl Jussieu,BP 100, F-75252 Paris, France.",terray@lodyc.jussieu.fr,,"terray, Pascal/0000-0002-3982-6630",,,,,81,83,89,1,24,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0894-8755,1520-0442,,J CLIMATE,J.

Our investigation focuses particularly on the effects of two different representations of root water uptake and root profile on I simulated evapotranspiration (ET) and soil moisture by the integrated BIosphere Simulator (IBIS). For this purpose, multi-year eddy covariance measurements, collected at four flux-tower sites across North America, were used to gauge IBIS simulations with: (a) its standard version (IBIS2.1), in which static root water uptake (RWU) and root profile schemes are incorporated; and (b) a modified version in which dynamic RWU and root profile schemes replaces the static schemes used in the standard version. Overall, our results suggest that the modified version of the model performs more realistically than the standard version, particularly when high atmospheric demand for evaporation is combined with high atmospheric vapour pressure deficit and low soil water availability. The overall correlation between simulated and measured monthly ET rates at the simulated sites reached 0.87 and 0.91 for the standard and the modified versions, respectively. Our results also show that the incorporation of the dynamic RWU in IBIS yields improved simulations of ET under very dry conditions, when soil moisture falls down to very low levels. This suggests that adequate representations of vegetation responses to drought are needed in LSMs as many state of the art climate models projections of future climate indicate more frequent and/or more intense drought events occurring in some regions of the globe. Our analysis also highlighted the urgent need for adequate methodologies to correct field measurements that exhibit energy imbalances in order to provide rigorous assessments of land surface model simulations of heat and mass exchanges between the land surface and the atmosphere.

One pattern represents variability along the Gulf of Guinea, between the equator and 10 degrees N. It connects rainfall over Africa to the Atlantic marine Intertropical Convergence Zone, is controlled by local, i.e., eastern equatorial Atlantic, SSTs, and is interannual in time scale. The other represents variability in the semi-arid Sahel, between 10 degrees N and 20 degrees N. It is a continental pattern, capturing the essence of the African summer monsoon, while at the same time displaying high sensitivity to SSTs in the global tropics. A land-atmosphere feedback associated with this pattern translates precipitation anomalies into coherent surface temperature and evaporation anomalies, as highlighted by a simulation where soil moisture is held fixed to climatology. As a consequence of such feedback, it is shown that the recent positive trend in surface temperature is consistent with the ocean-forced negative trend in precipitation, without the need to invoke the direct effect of the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gases. We advance plausible mechanisms by which the balance between land-ocean temperature contrast and moisture availability that defines the monsoon could have been altered in recent decades, resulting in persistent drought. This discussion also serves to illustrate ways in which the monsoon may be perturbed, or may already have been perturbed, by anthropogenic climate change.","Columbia Univ, Earth Inst, Int Res Inst Climat Predict, Palisades, NY 10964 USA; Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; Texas AM Univ, Dept Oceanog, College Stn, TX USA",Columbia University; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Giannini, A (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Earth Inst, Int Res Inst Climat Predict, POB 1000, Palisades, NY 10964 USA.",alesall@iri.columbia.edu,"Giannini, Alessandra/H-4403-2013; Chang, Ping/A-1642-2013; Giannini, Alessandra/F-7163-2016; Saravanan, Ramalingam/G-8879-2012","Chang, Ping/0000-0002-9085-0759; Giannini, Alessandra/0000-0001-5425-4995; Saravanan, Ramalingam/0000-0002-0005-6907",,,,,97,47,48,0,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0930-7575,1432-0894,,CLIM DYNAM,Clim.

The Ningaloo Nino/Nina, which generally matures in austral summer, is found to be predictable two seasons ahead. In particular, the unprecedented extreme warm event in February 2011 was successfully predicted 9 months in advance. The successful prediction of the Ningaloo Nino is mainly due to the high prediction skill of La Nina in the Pacific. However, the model deficiency to underestimate its early evolution and peak amplitude needs to be improved. Since the Ningaloo Nino/Nina has potential impacts on regional societies and industries through extreme events, the present success of its prediction may encourage development of its early warning system.","[Doi, Takeshi; Behera, Swadhin K.] Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol JAMSTEC, RIGC, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan; [Doi, Takeshi; Behera, Swadhin K.; Yamagata, Toshio] JAMSTEC, Applicat Lab, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan",Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science & Technology (JAMSTEC); Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science & Technology (JAMSTEC),"Doi, T (corresponding author), Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol JAMSTEC, RIGC, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan.",takeshi.doi@jamstec.go.jp,"Yamagata, Toshio/A-1807-2009; Doi, Takeshi/C-1989-2013; Doi, Takeshi/GLS-9636-2022; Behera, Swadhin/B-7839-2009","Doi, Takeshi/0000-0002-7342-9145; Behera, Swadhin/0000-0001-8692-2388",,,,,36,38,39,1,23,NATURE RESEARCH,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",2045-2322,,,SCI REP-UK,Sci Rep,8-Oct,2013,,,,,,,2892,10.1038/srep02892,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep02892,,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,230PU,24100593,"Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000325355100003,View Full Record in Web of Science

By deriving the linear dynamic operators using the linear inverse modeling (LIM) approach, we propose a method to partly correct the errors in MJO linear dynamic operators to improve the MJO predictions of three operational dynamic S2S models. Correcting the deficiencies of the too-fast decay rates and the unrealistic propagating phase speeds lead to MJO prediction skills being extended by approximately 2-4 days. The improvements are more significant for the models with larger biases in MJO amplitude and propagation. This approach in principle may be extendable to predictions of other types of climate variability such as ENSO on one hand, and possible inclusions of nonlinear dynamics effects on the other hand. Plain Language Summary The Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO) is the dominant mode of intraseasonal variability in the tropics and can exert a significant influence on global circulation and extreme weather events. Most of the current generations of state-of-the-art operational dynamic models used in MJO predictions have yet to fully capture the essential features of the MJO. These deficiencies hinder the models' MJO prediction skills. By taking advantage of mass hindcast data, a method is proposed in this study to correct the effect of errors of the linear dynamics of each model on its MJO predictions by carrying out a dynamics-based postprocessing on the model predictions. This proposed approach is applied to three different operational dynamic models and shows improvements in MJO prediction skills. This kind of approach may be extended to improve the predictions of other types of climate variability such as ENSO and may be expanded to include nonlinear dynamics effects as well.","[Wu, Jie] China Meteorol Adm, Natl Climate Ctr, Lab Climate Studies & China Meteorol Adm Nanjing, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Jin, Fei-Fei] Univ Hawaii Manoa, SOEST, Dept Atmospher Sci, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA",China Meteorological Administration; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa,"Jin, FF (corresponding author), Univ Hawaii Manoa, SOEST, Dept Atmospher Sci, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",jff@hawaii.edu,,"Wu, Jie/0000-0002-7806-6718",National Key R&D Program of China [2018YFC1505906]; China National Science Foundation [41905067]; U.S. NSF [AGS-1813611]; Department of Energy [DE-SC0005110],National Key R&D Program of China; China National Science Foundation(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); U.S. NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)),"J.

Perforated peptic ulcer (PPU) carries a substantial morbidity and mortality. Surgical repair remains the treatment of choice for a PPU. This literature review includes the latest updates in laparoscopic repair techniques for a PPU and also focuses on its causation, clinical features, diagnostic workup, laparoscopic and open surgical techniques, outcomes, and future perspectives. An extensive review of the literature was performed, and the most recent meta-analyses and reviews concerning the topic were considered. No substantial differences were found in postoperative mortality between the open and laparoscopic approaches for patients with a PPU. Furthermore, a laparoscopic repair lead to statistically significantly less postoperative pain and carried a lower risk of wound infection. Hence, a laparoscopic repair is justified, where situationally appropriate, as the treatment of choice.","[Pansa, Andrea; Kurihara, Hayato] Humanitas Res Hosp, Rozzano, MI, Italy; [Memon, Muhammed Ashraf] Univ Queensland, Sch Med, Mayne Med Sch, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Memon, Muhammed Ashraf] Bond Univ, Fac Hlth Sci & Med, Gold Coast, Qld, Australia; [Memon, Muhammed Ashraf] Univ Southern Queensland, Int Ctr Appl Climate Sci, Sch Agr Comp & Environm Sci, Toowoomba, Qld, Australia; [Memon, Muhammed Ashraf] Univ Southern Queensland, Ctr Hlth Sci Res, Toowoomba, Qld, Australia; [Memon, Muhammed Ashraf] Bolton Univ, Fac Hlth & Social Sci, Bolton, Lancs, England; [Memon, Muhammed Ashraf] SEQS, Sunnybank, Qld, Australia; [Memon, Muhammed Ashraf] Sunnybank Obes Ctr, Sunnybank, Qld, Australia",IRCCS Humanitas Research Hospital; University of Queensland; Bond University; University of Southern Queensland; University of Southern Queensland; University of Bolton,"Kurihara, H (corresponding author), Humanitas Res Hosp, Dept Gen Surg, Via Manzoni 56, I-20089 Rozzano, MI, Italy.",Hayato.kurihara@humanitas.it,"Kurihara, Hayato/AAW-5550-2020","Kurihara, Hayato/0000-0002-8826-9631; Pansa, Andrea/0000-0002-7917-5617",,,,,44,1,1,0,2,AME PUBL CO,SHATIN,"FLAT-RM C 16F, KINGS WING PLAZA 1, NO 3 KWAN ST, SHATIN, HONG KONG 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA",2518-6973,,,ANN LAPAROSC ENDOSC,Ann.

Several state-of-the-art computing techniques, including computing graph and just-in-time compiling, are employed to parallelize the seemingly serial code and speed up the ocean models. These operator interfaces are designed using native Fortran programming language to smooth the learning curve. We further implement a highly readable and efficient ocean model that contains only 1860 lines of code but achieves a 91% parallel efficiency in strong scaling and 99% parallel efficiency in weak scaling with 4096 Intel CPU cores.

Additionally, some new challenges have arisen. To the best of the author's knowledge, most studies are concerned with the deterministic case; however, the effects of stochasticity encountered in practical flight environments on the nonlinear dynamical behaviors of the airfoil systems are neglected. Crucially, coupling interaction of the structure nonlinearities and uncertainty fluctuations can lead to some difficulties on the airfoil models, including accurate modeling, response solving, and vibration suppression. At the same time, most of the existing studies depend mainly on a mathematical model established by physical mechanisms. Unfortunately, it is challenging and even impossible to obtain an accurate physical model of the complex wing structure in engineering practice. The emergence of data science and machine learning provides new opportunities for understanding the aeroelastic airfoil systems from the data-driven point of view, such as data-driven modeling, prediction, and control from the recorded data. Nevertheless, relevant data-driven problems of the aeroelastic airfoil systems are not addressed well up to now. This survey contributes to conducting a comprehensive overview of recent developments toward understanding complex dynamical behaviors and vibration suppression, especially for stochastic dynamics, early warning, and data-driven problems, of the conceptual two-dimensional airfoil models with different structural nonlinearities. The results on the airfoil models are summarized and discussed. Besides, several potential development directions that are worth further exploration are also highlighted.

For cloud detection, the AGRI and MODIS cloud mask retrievals showed a fractional agreement of 0.93 for cloudy conditions and 0.73 for clear scenes. AGRI tended to miss lower CTH clouds due to the lack of thermal contrast between the clouds and the surface of the TP.

The atmosphere Simplified Parameterizations Primitive Equation Dynamics (SPEEDY) model has T30L7 resolution. The physical package consists of a set of simplified physical parameterization schemes, based on the same principles adopted in the schemes of state-of-the-art AGCMs. It is at least an order of magnitude faster, whereas the quality of the simulated climate compares well with those models. The hierarchy of ocean models consists of simple mixed layer models with an increasing number of physical processes involved such as Ekman transport, wind-induced mixing, and wind-driven barotropic transport. Finally, the atmosphere model is coupled to a regional version of the Miami Isopycnal Coordinate Ocean Model (MICOM) covering the South Atlantic with a horizontal resolution of 1 degrees and 16 vertical layers. The coupled modes of mean sea level pressure and sea surface temperature simulated by SPEEDY-MICOM strongly resemble the modes as analyzed from the NCEP-NCAR reanalysis, indicating that this model configuration possesses the required physical mechanisms for generating these modes of variability. Using the ocean model hierarchy the authors were able to show that turbulent heat fluxes, Ekman transport, and wind-induced mixing contribute to the generation of the dominant modes of coupled SST variability. The different roles of these terms in generating these modes are analyzed. Variations in the wind-driven barotropic transport mainly seem to affect the, SST variability in the Brazil-Malvinas confluence zone. The spectra of the mixed layer models appeared to be too red in comparison with the fully coupled SPEEDY-MICOM model due to the too strong coupling between SST and surface air temperatures (SATs), resulting from the inability to advect and subduct SST anomalies by the mixed layer models. In SPEEDY-MICOM anomalies in the southeastern corner of the South Atlantic are subducted and advected toward the north Brazilian coast on a time scale of about 6 yr.","Royal Netherlands Meteorol Inst, NL-3730 AE De Bilt, Netherlands; Univ Sao Paulo, Oceanog Inst, Sao Paulo, Brazil; Royal Netherlands Meteorol Inst, NL-3730 AE De Bilt, Netherlands; Serv Hidrografia Naval, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; Abdus Salam Int Ctr Theoret Phys, Trieste, Italy",Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute; Universidade de Sao Paulo; Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute; Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP),"Haarsma, RJ (corresponding author), Royal Netherlands Meteorol Inst, Wilhelminalaan 10, NL-3730 AE De Bilt, Netherlands.",haarsma@knmi.nl,"Campos, edmo/G-6995-2012; Piola, Alberto R/O-2280-2013; Haarsma, Reindert/D-1803-2013","Campos, edmo/0000-0001-6399-5496; Piola, Alberto R/0000-0002-5003-8926; Haarsma, Rein/0000-0001-7171-2687; Hazeleger, Wilco/0000-0002-4566-958X",,,,,50,46,47,0,8,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0894-8755,1520-0442,,J CLIMATE,J.

Realistic modeling of spring vegetation green-up is critical to improving process-based ecosystem models of the Tibetan Plateau (TP) and for better understanding of the coupling between TP terrestrial biophysical processes and the Asian monsoon system. However, no model is available for simulating the vegetation green-up date (VGD) across the entire TP. In this study, we first assessed the ability of several existing state-of-the-art phenological models to estimate VGD across the TP. We then modified the existing models by adding environmental constraints identified by partial least squares analyses. The modified models simulated VGDs with lower estimation errors than other models (Mean absolute error: 8.2 days vs. 8.7-12.9 days; P < 0.01, t-test). Moreover, although our model captured the inter annual variations in VGD better than any previous model, the correlation coefficient between predicted and remotely sensed VGDs was still low, especially in the western TP. This study revealed the necessity of considering multiple factors in VGD models and highlighted the challenge of developing models that will better represent phenology in future ecosystem models.","[Cao, Ruyin; Zhou, Ji] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Resources & Environm, 2006 Xiyuan Ave, Chengdu 611731, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Shen, Miaogen] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Key Lab Alpine Ecol & Biodivers, 16 Lincui Rd, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Shen, Miaogen] CAS Ctr Excellence Tibetan Plateau Earth Sci, 16 Lincui Rd, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Chen, Jin] Beijing Normal Univ, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China","University of Electronic Science & Technology of China; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research, CAS; Beijing Normal University","Cao, RY (corresponding author), Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Resources & Environm, 2006 Xiyuan Ave, Chengdu 611731, Sichuan, Peoples R China.;Shen, MG (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Key Lab Alpine Ecol & Biodivers, 16 Lincui Rd, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",cao.ruyin@uestc.edu.cn; shen.miaogen@gmail.com,"Chen, Jin/A-6417-2011; Shen, Miaogen/A-8374-2011","Chen, Jin/0000-0002-6497-4141; Shen, Miaogen/0000-0001-5742-8807; Cao, Ruyin/0000-0002-8122-9696; Shen, Mouquan/0000-0001-6448-4866","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41601381, 41571103, 91647104]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [ZYGX2015KYQD048]; Key Research Program of Frontier Sciences of Chinese Academy of Sciences [QYZDB-SSW-DQC025]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Key Research Program of Frontier Sciences of Chinese Academy of Sciences,"This work was funded by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41601381, No. 41571103 and No. 91647104), Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (No. ZYGX2015KYQD048) and the Key Research Program of Frontier Sciences of Chinese Academy of Sciences (No. QYZDB-SSW-DQC025).",,58,41,45,5,94,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0168-1923,1873-2240,,AGR FOREST METEOROL,Agric.

However, despite their rising relevance, a descriptive - and hence empirically applicable - definition is still lacking in the reference literature, currently dominated by normative studies. Therefore, building on a critical assessment of the state of the art, this article proposes a framework for conceptualising eco-social policies, calling for an output-based definition with policy integration as its core element. The article also proposes a typology to differentiate various eco-social policies along two dimensions: the direction of policy integration and the link to economic growth. This typology allows us to elaborate on the possible roles that the welfare state can play vis-a-vis environmental challenges and policies, for instance in the context of decarbonisation: reactive or preventive; protection- or investment-oriented.","[Mandelli, Matteo] Univ Milan, Via Conservatorio 7, I-20122 Milan, Italy",University of Milan,"Mandelli, M (corresponding author), Univ Milan, Via Conservatorio 7, I-20122 Milan, Italy.",matteo.mandelli@unimi.it,,,,,,,68,1,1,1,1,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1024-2589,1996-7284,,TRANSFER-LONDON,Transfer,AUG,2022,3,,,,333,348,,10.1177/10242589221125083,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/10242589221125083,,22-Sep,16,Industrial Relations & Labor,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,5Y1ML,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000857200900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

For preservation, relative humidity is the most important parameter, including its amplitude and change rate. To control the change rate of relative humidity at a heat-up event for an intermittently heated massive historic building with heavy masonry walls, a simplified model for heat and moisture transfer at the heat-up time is presented. A method to derive the time constants and hygrothermal parameters of the building from measurements taken during a step response test is proposed and validated. The model with its parameters can be used to predict both heat-up time to reach the target temperature as well as the amount of moisture gained from the walls. These predictions are in turn used to calculate the decrease in relative humidity during the heat-up event. The indoor air relative humidity is predictable as it is determined by the air temperature and air mixing ratio. A control algorithm that uses the model for predicting and controlling the change rate of relative humidity by shaping the heating power is presented and validated using simulation results.","[Wessberg, Magnus; Brostrom, Tor] Uppsala Univ, Dept Art Hist, Conservat, Cramergatan 3, S-62153 Visby, Sweden; [Wessberg, Magnus; Vyhlidal, Tomas] Czech Tech Univ, Dept Instrumentat & Control Engn, Fac Mech Engn, Tech 4, Prague 16607 6, Czech Republic; [Wessberg, Magnus; Vyhlidal, Tomas] Czech Tech Univ, Ctr Adv Aerosp Technol, Fac Mech Engn, Tech 4, Prague 16607 6, Czech Republic",Uppsala University; Czech Technical University Prague; Czech Technical University Prague,"Vyhlidal, T (corresponding author), Czech Tech Univ, Dept Instrumentat & Control Engn, Fac Mech Engn, Tech 4, Prague 16607 6, Czech Republic.;Vyhlidal, T (corresponding author), Czech Tech Univ, Ctr Adv Aerosp Technol, Fac Mech Engn, Tech 4, Prague 16607 6, Czech Republic.",tomas.vylilidal@fs.cvut.cz,"Vyhlidal, Tomas/G-5109-2010; Broström, Tor/AAG-5751-2021",,"Swedish Energy Agency through the national research program for energy efficiency in historic buildings; EU Operational Programme Research, Development and Education; Center of Advanced Aerospace Technology, Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, Czech Technical University in Prague [CZ.02.1.01/0.0/0.0/16_019/0000826]; Grant Agency of the Czech Technical University in Prague [SGS17/176/OHK2/3T/12]; ESIF","Swedish Energy Agency through the national research program for energy efficiency in historic buildings; EU Operational Programme Research, Development and Education; Center of Advanced Aerospace Technology, Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, Czech Technical University in Prague; Grant Agency of the Czech Technical University in Prague; ESIF","We gratefully acknowledge the support from the Swedish Energy Agency through the national research program for energy efficiency in historic buildings.

Yet, such a narrative appears to conceal more than it reveals. The seeming agentiality of the novel coronavirus is itself but one manifestation of the continuous destruction of biodiversity, climate change, socio-economic inequalities, neocolonialism, overconsumption and the anthropogenic degradation of nature. Furthermore, focusing on the virus - an entity that holds an ambiguous status between the 'living' and 'non-living' - brings into question the issue of the agentiality of non/living matter. While the story of viral potency seems to get centre stage, overshadowing the complex and perverseentanglement of processes and phenomena which activated these potentials in the first place, the Covid-19 pandemic also becomes a prism that sheds light on the issues of environmental violence; social and environmental injustices; more-than-human agentiality; and ethico-political responses that the present situation may mobilise. This article serves as a written record of joint conversations between artists and researchers in the working group 'Non/Living Queerings' that formed part of the online series of events 'Braiding Friction' organised by the research project Biofriction. The article strives to capture the collective effort of braiding and weaving a variety of situated perspectives, theoretical toolboxes, knowledges and experiences against the background of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. In particular, the text focuses on the issues of crisis, 'amplification effect', viral agency and the changing notions of humanity.","[Radomska, Marietta] Linkoping Univ, Dept Themat Studies, Unit Gender Studies, Environm Humanities, Linkoping, Sweden; [Pevere, Margherita] Aalto Univ, Helsinki, Finland; [Haapoja, Terike] Parsons Fine Arts, New York, NY USA; [Haapoja, Terike] NYU, New York, NY USA",Linkoping University; Aalto University; New York University,"Radomska, M (corresponding author), Linkoping Univ, Dept Themat Studies, Unit Gender Studies, Environm Humanities, Linkoping, Sweden.",marietta.radomska@liu.se; mayracitlally@gmail.com; margherita.pevere@aalto.fi; mail@terikehaapoja.net,"Radomska, Marietta/K-9599-2015","Radomska, Marietta/0000-0001-8520-6785; Pevere, Margherita/0000-0002-8853-5768",,,,,31,0,0,1,6,UNIV OBERTA CATALUNYA,BARCELONA,"AV TIBIDABO 39-43, BARCELONA, 08035, SPAIN",1695-5951,,,ARTNODES,Artnodes,,2021,27,,,,,,,10.7238/a.v0i27.374989,http://dx.doi.org/10.7238/a.v0i27.374989,,,10,"Humanities, Multidisciplinary",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Arts & Humanities - Other Topics,QR7WX,,"Green Submitted, Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000625426200002,View Full Record in Web of Science

If enough glaciers die, could they go extinct? Is there geologic extinction? Yes. This article develops three arguments to support this claim. The first revisits Georges Cuvier's original argument for extinction and its reli-ance on geology, especially glaciers. Retracing connections to glaciers and the narrowing of extinction to biological species in the nineteenth century, the author argues that anthropo-genic forcing on how the Earth system functions-the Anthropocene-warrants rethinking extinction geologically. The second argument examines the specificity of ice loss and multi-ple practices responding to this loss: from art exhibits at United Nations climate change meetings to anticolonial claims for the right to be cold. The third argument consolidates a theme built across the article regarding how Isabelle Stengers's notion of ecologies of prac-tices provides an approach to geologic extinction that recognizes both relational and nonre-lational loss.","[Schmidt, Jeremy J.] Univ Durham, Dept Geog, Durham, England",Durham University,"Schmidt, JJ (corresponding author), Univ Durham, Dept Geog, Durham, England.",,,,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"I thank Olafur Eliasson for permission to use an image of The Presence of Absence Pavilion installation.

Xylem phenology and growth rates of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) appeared to be less influenced by the 2018 drought, whereas beech reduced growth on the lowest elevation and fir seemed negatively affected in general. Background: The year 2018 was characterized by multiple drought periods and heat waves during the growing season. Our aim was to understand species-specific responses of xylem phenology and growth to drought and how this effect was modified along an elevational gradient. Materials and Methods: We sampled microcores and increment cores along an elevational gradient in the southwestern Black Forest (SW Germany) region and analyzed xylem phenology and growth response to drought. Results: Termination of cell enlargement and lignification occurred earliest in beech and latest in pine. Beech had the highest growth rates but shortest growth durations, fir achieved moderate rates and medium durations and pine had lowest growth rates despite long growth durations. In contrast to pine, onsets of cell differentiation phases of fir and beech did not show clear linear relationships with elevation. Cessation of cell production and lignification of beech and fir followed a parabolic elevational trend and occurred earliest on low elevations, whereas pine showed no changes with elevation. Tree-ring width, generally, depended 3-4 times more on the growth rate than on growth duration. Conclusions: The possibly drought-induced early cessation of cell differentiation and considerable growth reduction of beech appeared to be most severe on the lowest elevation. In comparison, growth reductions of fir were larger and seemed independent from elevation. We found evidence, that productivity might be severely affected at lower elevations, whereas at high elevations wood production might not equally benefit during global warming.","[Larysch, Elena; Stangler, Dominik Florian; Seifert, Thomas; Kahle, Hans-Peter] Albert Ludwigs Univ Freiburg, Chair Forest Growth & Dendroecol, Fac Environm & Nat Resources, Tennenbacher Str 4, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany; [Nazari, Mona] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Silviculture, Peter Jordan Str 82-1, A-1190 Vienna, Austria; [Seifert, Thomas] Stellenbosch Univ, Dept Forest & Wood Sci, Private Bag X1, ZA-7602 Matieland, South Africa","University of Freiburg; University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna; Stellenbosch University","Larysch, E (corresponding author), Albert Ludwigs Univ Freiburg, Chair Forest Growth & Dendroecol, Fac Environm & Nat Resources, Tennenbacher Str 4, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany.",elena.larysch@iww.uni-freiburg.de; dominik.stangler@iww.uni-freiburg.de; mona.nazari@boku.ac.at; Thomas.Seifert@iww.uni-freiburg.de; hans-peter.kahle@iww.uni-freiburg.de,"Larysch, Elena/HHM-3210-2022; Seifert, Thomas/AAW-1576-2021","Larysch, Elena/0000-0002-1191-5770; Seifert, Thomas/0000-0002-9611-6272; Kahle, Hans-Peter/0000-0001-9677-5094; Nazari, Mona/0000-0001-7679-7827","DBU Deutsche Bundesstiftung Umwelt [20017/501]; Baden-Wuerttemberg Ministry of Science, Research and Art; University of Freiburg","DBU Deutsche Bundesstiftung Umwelt; Baden-Wuerttemberg Ministry of Science, Research and Art; University of Freiburg","This research was funded by DBU Deutsche Bundesstiftung Umwelt, grant number 20017/501.

There have been several systems developed through the synthesis of biomimetics and ABS to reduce energy demand or improve comfort in buildings. This paper presents the definition, characterisation and a comparative analysis of existing applications in the field of biomimetic adaptive building skins (Bio-ABS). We evaluate current uptake in the field, present an overview of the state-of-the-art and undertake a meta-analysis of fifty-two Bio-ABS applications to determine performance trends, opportunities and challenges. We found that current development in the field of Bio-ABS is limited. 53.8% of all published Bio-ABS remain at a conceptual stage of development, resulting in a gap between theoretical and real-world uptake. In addition, there is little quantitative analysis in terms of environmental or energy performance measurements, with only 44.2% of the projects considering these performance metrics. Of those that do, 78.2% demonstrate either thermal or visual comfort analysis while only five, 21.7%, include energy analysis. A further conclusion drawn is that the majority of Bio-ABS are monofunctional, only controlling a single environmental parameter. Very little attention is paid to multifunctionality, with only 13.4% of the published projects controlling more than one parameter. Multifunctionality in Bio-ABS needs further study to address multiple contradictory functional requirements of buildings regarding energetic and environmental performance. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Few studies, however, have experimentally assessed the net effect of warming on energy flux and food web dynamics in natural intact communities. Here, we test how warming affects energy flux and the trophic basis of production in a natural invertebrate food web by experimentally heating a stream reach in southwest Iceland by similar to 4 degrees C for 2 yr and comparing its response to an unheated reference stream. Previous results from this experiment showed that warming led to shifts in the structure of the invertebrate assemblage, with estimated increases in total metabolic demand but no change in annual secondary production. We hypothesized that elevated metabolic demand and invariant secondary production would combine to increase total consumption of organic matter in the food web, if diet composition did not change appreciably with warming. Dietary composition of primary consumers indeed varied little between streams and among years, with gut contents primarily consisting of diatoms (72.9%) and amorphous detritus (19.5%). Diatoms dominated the trophic basis of production of primary consumers in both study streams, contributing 79-86% to secondary production. Although warming increased the flux of filamentous algae within the food web, total resource consumption did not increase as predicted. The neutral net effect of warming on total energy flow through the food web was a result of taxon-level variation in responses to warming, a neutral effect on total invertebrate production, and strong trophic redundancy within the invertebrate assemblage. Thus, food webs characterized by a high degree of trophic redundancy may be more resistant to the effects of climate warming than those with more diverse and specialized consumers.","[Nelson, Daniel; Benstead, Jonathan P.; Huryn, Alexander D.] Univ Alabama, Dept Biol Sci, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA; [Cross, Wyatt F.; Junker, Jim] Montana State Univ, Dept Ecol, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA; [Hood, James M.] Ohio State Univ, Aquat Ecol Lab, Dept Evolut Ecol & Organismal Biol, Columbus, OH 43212 USA; [Johnson, Philip W.] Univ Alabama, Dept Civil Construct & Environm Engn, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA; [Gislason, Gisli M.] Univ Iceland, Inst Life & Environm Sci, Reykjavik, Iceland; [Olafsson, Jon S.] Marine & Freshwater Res Inst, Reykjavik, Iceland; [Nelson, Daniel] Univ Oklahoma, Dept Biol, Norman, OK 73019 USA",University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa; Montana State University System; Montana State University Bozeman; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa; University of Iceland; Marine & Freshwater Research Institute (MFRI); University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma - Norman,"Nelson, D (corresponding author), Univ Alabama, Dept Biol Sci, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA.;Nelson, D (corresponding author), Univ Oklahoma, Dept Biol, Norman, OK 73019 USA.",daniel.nelson@ou.edu,"Gíslason, Gísli Már/B-2109-2008; Junker, James/AGH-5787-2022; Gislason, Gunnar/B-7561-2009","Gíslason, Gísli Már/0000-0001-8507-1796; Junker, James/0000-0001-9713-2330; Gislason, Gunnar/0000-0002-0548-402X; Nelson, Daniel/0000-0001-5263-6308","National Science Foundation [DEB-0949774, DEB-1354624, DEB-0949726]",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This study was supported by the National Science Foundation (DEB-0949774 and DEB-1354624 to JPB and ADH and DEB-0949726 to WFC).

We provide a synthesis of opportunities and challenges for advancing land and ocean research in Mexico in order to move toward a complete North American continental scale CCS. First, we provide the socio-ecological context of Mexico relevant to CCS. Second, we compare the existing relationships among scientific/governmental entities and funding agencies that contribute to CCS in the United States and Mexico. Third, we discuss Mexico's state-of-the-art CCS, and synthesize its recent advances with emphasis on land- and ocean-atmosphere interactions.

Previous studies attempting to examine the role of the diurnal cycle of the upper ocean and particularly of diurnal SST variability have used models unable to resolve the processes of interest. In part 1 of this study a high vertical resolution ocean GCM configuration with modified physics was developed that could resolve the diurnal cycle in the upper ocean. In this study it is coupled every 3 h to atmospheric GCM to examine the sensitivity of the mean climate simulation and aspects of its variability to the inclusion of diurnal ocean-atmosphere coupling. The inclusion of the diurnal cycle leads to a tropics wide increase in mean sea surface temperature (SST), with the strongest signal being across the equatorial Pacific where the warming increases from 0.2 degrees C in the central and western Pacific to over 0.3 degrees C in the eastern equatorial Pacific. Much of this warming is shown to be a direct consequence of the rectification of daily mean SST by the diurnal variability of SST. The warming of the equatorial Pacific leads to a redistribution of precipitation from the Inter tropical convergence zone (ITCZ) toward the equator. In the western Pacific there is an increase in precipitation between Papa new guinea and 170 degrees E of up to 1.2 mm/day, improving the simulation compared to climatology. Pacific sub tropical cells are increased in strength by about 10%, in line with results of part 1 of this study, due to the modification of the exchange of momentum between the equatorially divergent Ekman currents and the geostropic convergence at depth, effectively increasing the dynamical response of the tropical Pacific to zonal wind stresses. During the spring relaxation of the Pacific trade winds, a large diurnal cycle of SST increases the seasonal warming of the equatorial Pacific. When the trade winds then re-intensify, the increase in the dynamical response of the ocean leads to a stronger equatorial upwelling. These two processes both lead to stronger seasonal basin scale feedbacks in the coupled system, increasing the strength of the seasonal cycle of the tropical Pacific sector by around 10%. This means that the diurnal cycle in the upper ocean plays a part in the coupled feedbacks between ocean and atmosphere that maintain the basic state and the timing of the seasonal cycle of SST and trade winds in the tropical Pacific. The Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) is examined by use of a large scale MJO index, lag correlations and composites of events. The inclusion of the diurnal cycle leads to a reduction in overall MJO activity. Precipitation composites show that the MJO is stronger and more coherent when the diurnal cycle of coupling is resolved, with the propagation and different phases being far more distinct both locally and to larger lead times across the tropical Indo-Pacific. Part one of this study showed that that diurnal variability of SST is modulated by the MJO and therefore increases the intraseasonal SST response to the different phases of the MJO. Precipitation-based composites of SST variability confirm this increase in the coupled simulations. It is argued that including this has increased the thermodynamical coupling of the ocean and atmosphere on the timescale of the MJO (20-100 days), accounting for the improvement in the MJO strength and coherency seen in composites of precipitation and SST. These results show that the diurnal cycle of ocean-atmosphere interaction has profound impact on a range of up-scale variability in the tropical climate and as such, it is an important feature of the modelled climate system which is currently either neglected or poorly resolved in state of the art coupled models.","[Bernie, D.

The results of a multi-model ensemble (MME) analysis showed significant increases in surface soil moisture in one northwestern inland area, and significant decreases were projected in two inland areas in southern and northern China. Among three water flux variables, precipitation (P), evaporation (E), and total runoff (R), significant changes in E explained only 10% of the total area showing significant changes in surface soil moisture. Among three combinations of two water flux variables, (P - E), (E + R), and (P - R), significant changes in (P - E) were dominant in coastal northeastern China, but this area did not overlap with areas with significant changes in surface soil moisture. Individual analyses revealed that significant increases in E, (P - R), and (E + R) explained 26%, 13%, and 9%, respectively, of the total area showing a significant decrease in the MME mean surface soil moisture. This result indicates that reliance on the MME mean may hinder understanding of the geophysical mechanism linking water flux variables with surface soil moisture.","[Nakaegawa, Tosiyuki] Meteorol Res Inst, 1-1 Nagamine, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050052, Japan",Meteorological Research Institute - Japan,"Nakaegawa, T (corresponding author), Meteorol Res Inst, 1-1 Nagamine, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050052, Japan.",tnakaega@mri-jma.go.jp,,,JSPS [16H06291]; MOE [2-1503],"JSPS(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); MOE(Ministry of Higher Education & Scientific Research (MHESR))",This work was supported by JSPS Grant-in-Aid for Specially promoted Research Grant Number 16H06291 and by MOE the Environment Research and Technology Development Fund Grant Number 2-1503.

Output pulse shape and energy have been studied as a function of discharge triggering delay and gas mixture composition. Obtained results show that, in spite of the known differences of both spectral and temporal characteristics of non-chain and chain lasers, it is possible to create a high power HF MOPA system with pulse duration less than 100 ns, technical efficiency above 10% and energy close to the one of the amplifier in free lasing mode.","Russian Sci Ctr Appl Chem, St Petersburg 197198, Russia",Russian Scientific Center Applied Chemistry,"Burtsev, AP (corresponding author), Russian Sci Ctr Appl Chem, 14 Dobrobulov Ave, St Petersburg 197198, Russia.",,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,1,SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING,BELLINGHAM,"1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010 USA",0277-786X,,0-8194-6328-0,P SOC PHOTO-OPT INS,,,2005,,,,,26301,26301,626301,10.1117/12.677385,http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.677385,,,7,Optics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Optics,BEQ94,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000238988600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This method proposes detailed dynamic simulation approaches for large-scale thermal models. 2) Currently applied co-simulation frameworks are not applicable to large-scale models. In the present study, the dynamic building simulation tool IDA Indoor Climate and Energy, which uses parallelization methods for large-scale models, is coupled with a co-simulation platform. The methods are applied to a semi-virtual case study, which consists of 1561 buildings and a new development area. The building stock is analyzed using an automated method based on publicly available data. In contrast, the virtual urban development area is investigated using a co-simulation framework with three dynamic simulation tools: IDA Indoor Climate and Energy for buildings (256 thermal zones and 29 heating systems), TRNSYS for the energy supply unit and Dymola/Modelica for the district heating network. The influence of co-simulation on the accuracy and on the computation time are investigated. The major finding of this study is that the computation time can be significantly reduced by decoupling methods. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

However, dynamical coupled ocean-atmosphere models poorly simulate and predict equatorial Atlantic climate variability. Here we use multi-model numerical experiments to show that thermodynamic feedbacks excited by stochastic atmospheric perturbations can generate Atlantic Nino s.d. of similar to 0.28 +/- 0.07 K, explaining similar to 68 +/- 23% of the observed interannual variability. Thus, in state-of-the-art coupled models, Atlantic Nino variability strongly depends on the thermodynamic component (R-2 = 0.92). Coupled dynamics acts to improve the characteristic Nino-like spatial structure but not necessarily the variance. Perturbations of the equatorial Atlantic trade winds (similar to +/- 1.53ms(-1)) can drive changes in surface latent heat flux (similar to +/- 14.35 Wm(-2)) and thus in surface temperature consistent with a first-order autoregressive process. By challenging the dynamical paradigm of equatorial Atlantic variability, our findings suggest that the current theories on its modelling and predictability must be revised.","[Nnamchi, Hyacinth C.] Univ Nigeria, Dept Geog, Nsukka 410001, Nigeria; [Li, Jianping] Beijing Normal Univ, Coll Global Change & Earth Syst Sci, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Li, Jianping] Joint Ctr Global Change Studies, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Kucharski, Fred; Farneti, Riccardo] Abdus Salam Int Ctr Theoret Phys, Earth Syst Phys Sect, I-34151 Trieste, Italy; [Kang, In-Sik] Seoul Natl Univ, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Seoul 151742, South Korea; [Keenlyside, Noel S.] Univ Bergen, Inst Geophys, N-5007 Bergen, Norway; [Keenlyside, Noel S.] Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, N-5007 Bergen, Norway; [Chang, Ping] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Oceanog, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Chang, Ping] Ocean Univ China, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Marine Sci & Technol, Qingdao 266100, Peoples R China",University of Nigeria; Beijing Normal University; Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP); Seoul National University (SNU); University of Bergen; Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Ocean University of China,"Nnamchi, HC (corresponding author), Univ Nigeria, Dept Geog, Nsukka 410001, Nigeria.",hyacinth.nnamchi@unn.edu.ng; ljp@bnu.edu.cn,"Keenlyside, Noel S/E-8303-2013; Nnamchi, Hyacinth/A-7623-2012; Chang, Ping/A-1642-2013; Li, Jianping/I-2661-2012; Farneti, Riccardo/B-5183-2011","Keenlyside, Noel S/0000-0002-8708-6868; Nnamchi, Hyacinth/0000-0003-4188-9865; Chang, Ping/0000-0002-9085-0759; Li, Jianping/0000-0003-0625-1575; Farneti, Riccardo/0000-0001-7781-6436","EU FP7 PREFACE Project [603521]; China 973 Program [2010CB950400]; NSFC Key Project [41030961]; U.S. National Science Foundation [OCE-1334707, AGS-1462127]; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Grant [NA11OAR4310154]; China's National Basic Research Priorities Programme [2013CB956204]; Natural Science Foundation of China [41222037, 41221063]; Division Of Ocean Sciences [1334707] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",EU FP7 PREFACE Project; China 973 Program(National Basic Research Program of China); NSFC Key Project(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); U.S. National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Grant(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); China's National Basic Research Priorities Programme; Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Division Of Ocean Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)),"H.C.N. conducted parts of the study during research stays at the International Centre for Theoretical Physics, Trieste, Italy through the Junior Associateship Scheme and at the Geophysical Institute, University of Bergen, Norway through funding from the Strategic Partnership for International Research and Education (SPIRE) and the Research Council of Norway (233680/E10).

Recognising the role that the haar has played in literature, art, music, and folklore in Scottish history, two primary arguments are made: first, that it merits recognition as part of the country's (and region's) natural heritage, and second, that its unusual form of composition challenges the tangible/intangible divide. The haar is not a site that one can visit, but rather an atmospheric process that comes and goes when conditions permit, embodying transience and ephemerality - characteristics of intangible heritage.

By 2050, approximately 70% of the global population will be living in urban conglomerations, mainly in low-and middle-income countries. Mobility, poverty, different layers of inequalities as well as climate variability and change are some of the social and environmental factors that influence the exposure of human populations in urban settings to vector-borne diseases, which pose eminent public health threats. Accurate, consistent, and evidence-based interventions for prevention and control of vector-borne and other infectious diseases of poverty in urban settings are needed to implement innovative and cost-effective public policy and to promote inclusive and equitable urban health services. Main body: While there is growing awareness of vector-borne diseases epidemiology at the urban level, there is still a paucity of research and action being undertaken in this area, hindering evidence-based public health policy decisions and practice and strategies for active community engagement. This paper describes the collaboration and partnership of the Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases (TDR) hosted by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the VEctor boRne DiseAses Scoping reviews (VERDAS) Research Consortium as they joined efforts in response to filling this gap in knowledge and evidence by supporting the development of a series of scoping reviews that highlight priority research gaps and policy implications to address vector-borne and other infectious diseases at the urban level. Conclusions: The set of scoping reviews proposed in this special issue presents a critical analysis of the state-of-the-art of research on urban health interventions for the prevention and control of vector-borne and other infectious diseases of poverty. The authors of the 6 reviews highlighted severe gaps in knowledge and identified organizational and theoretical limitations that need to be urgently tackled to improve cities preparedness and vector control response. The more pressing need at present is to ensure that more implementation research on vector-borne diseases in urban settings is conducted, addressing policy and practice implications and calling for more political commitment and social mobilization through adequate citizen engagement strategies.","[del Barrio, Mariam Otmani] WHO, Vectors Environm & Soc Unit, Special Programme Res & Training Trop Dis TDR, 20 Ave Appia, CH-1211 Geneva 27, Switzerland; [Simard, Frederic] Univ Montpellier, CNRS, IRD, MIVEGEC, Montpellier, France; [Caprara, Andrea] Ceara State 639 Univ, Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil",World Health Organization; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite de Montpellier,"del Barrio, MO (corresponding author), WHO, Vectors Environm & Soc Unit, Special Programme Res & Training Trop Dis TDR, 20 Ave Appia, CH-1211 Geneva 27, Switzerland.",otmanidelbarriom@who.int,"SIMARD, Frederic/J-9489-2016; Caprara, Andrea/F-8399-2012","SIMARD, Frederic/0000-0002-2871-5329; Caprara, Andrea/0000-0003-1972-8205; Otmani del Barrio, Mariam/0000-0002-1990-8735","UNICEF/UNDP/World Bank/WHO Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases (TDR), Geneva, Switzerland","UNICEF/UNDP/World Bank/WHO Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases (TDR), Geneva, Switzerland","The scoping reviews received funding support from the UNICEF/UNDP/World Bank/WHO Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases (TDR), Geneva, Switzerland.",,27,7,8,2,13,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2095-5162,2049-9957,,INFECT DIS POVERTY,Infect.

Amphibians are highly influenced by the physical environment, such as temperature and rainfall. The first migrating newts were observed subsequently to the three first consecutive days with mean temperature close to or above4 degrees C. Further, migration of L. vulgaris was facilitated at lower temperatures compared to T. cristatus, but the migration was dependent on higher precipitation levels. Northern populations of T. cristatus and L. vulgaris may already benefit from a warmer climate due to increased recruitment and juvenile survival. However, an offset in the migration phenology due to climate change might further alter the recruitment and survival rates with either positive or negative outcome. Thus, variations in migration phenology for newts due to climate change may have implications for management and protection status in many systems. In a general context, we should increase emphasis on protecting newts and support increased populations and distribution.","[Dervo, Borre K.; Baerum, Kim Magnus; Skurdal, Jostein; Museth, Jon] Norwegian Inst Nat Res NINA, Human Dimens Dept, N-2624 Fakkelgarden, Lillehammer, Norway",Norwegian Institute Nature Research,"Dervo, BK (corresponding author), Norwegian Inst Nat Res NINA, Human Dimens Dept, N-2624 Fakkelgarden, Lillehammer, Norway.",borre.dervo@nina.no,,,Norwegian Institute for Nature Research,Norwegian Institute for Nature Research(Bioforsk),The animals were captured with permission from the Directorate for Nature Management (Ref. 2012/3515 ART-VI-ID).

Results indicate a significant difference between the scores on drawings from the Great Plains and those from the Pacific Northwest sites, suggesting that the typical precipitation pattern of a given region may influence how a person responds to the DAPR task.

The state-of-the-art models used are the fast Elementary Thermomechanical Ice Sheet model (f.ETISh) v1.7 (ice sheet), the Nucleus for European Modelling of the Ocean (NEMO) v3.6 (ocean), the Louvain-la-Neuve sea-ice model (LIM) v3.6 (sea ice), the COnsortium for Small-scale MOdeling (COSMO) model v5.0 (atmosphere) and its CLimate Mode (CLM) v4.5 (land), which are here run at a horizontal resolution close to 1/4 degrees. One key feature of this tool resides in a novel two-way coupling interface for representing ocean- ice-sheet interactions, through explicitly resolved ice-shelf cavities. The impact of atmospheric processes on the Antarctic ice sheet is also conveyed through computed COSMO-CLM-f.ETISh surface mass exchange. In this technical paper, we briefly introduce each model's configuration and document the developments that were carried out in order to establish PARASO. The new offline-based NEMO-f.ETISh coupling interface is thoroughly described. Our developments also include a new surface tiling approach to combine open-ocean and sea-ice-covered cells within COSMO, which was required to make this model relevant in the context of coupled simulations in polar regions. We present results from a 2000-2001 coupled 2-year experiment. PARASO is numerically stable and fully operational. The 2-year simulation conducted without fine tuning of the model reproduced the main expected features, although remaining systematic biases provide perspectives for further adjustment and development.","[Pelletier, Charles; Fichefet, Thierry; Goosse, Hugues; Huot, Pierre-Vincent; Klein, Francois; Massonnet, Francois; Van Achter, Guillian; Verfaillie, Deborah] UCLouvain, Earth & Life Inst ELI, Louvain La Neuve, Belgium; [Haubner, Konstanze; Pattyn, Frank; Zipf, Lars] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Lab Glaciol, Brussels, Belgium; [Helsen, Samuel; van Lipzig, Nicole P.

The outcome is often a perpetuation of vulnerability, as narrowly defined technical interventions fail to address or recognize the ethical, historical, political and structural complexities of real-world community vulnerability and its causes. The authors propose that addressing this does not require a rejection of technical practice, but its evolution into a critical technical practice - one which foregrounds interdisciplinarity, inclusion, creativity and reflexivity, as means to question the assumptions, ideologies and delimited solutions built into the technical tools for understanding risks. Design/methodology/approach The authors present findings from three events they designed and facilitated, aimed at rethinking the engineering pedagogy and technical practice of disaster risk management. The first was a 2-day artathon that brought together engineers, artists and scientists to collaborate on new works of art based on disaster and climate data. The second was the Understanding Risk Field Lab, a 1-month long arts and technology un-conference exploring critical design practices, collaborative technology production, hacking and art to address complex issues of urban flooding. The third was a 4-month long virtual workshop on responsible engineering, science and technology for disaster risk management. Findings Each of these events uncovered and highlighted the benefits of interdisciplinary collaboration and reflexivity in disaster risk modeling, communication and management. The authors conclude with a discussion of the key design elements that help promote the principles of a critical technical practice. Originality/value The authors propose critical technical practice which foregrounds principles of interdisciplinarity, inclusion, creativity and reflexivity, as a means to question the assumptions, ideologies and delimited solutions built into the technical tools for understanding climate and disaster risk.","[Lallemant, David] Nanyang Technol Univ, Earth Observ Singapore, Asian Sch Environm, Singapore, Singapore; [Bicksler, Rebecca; Bannister, Steph] Co Risk Labs, San Francisco, CA USA; [Barns, Karen] Arup San Francisco, San Francisco, CA USA; [Hamel, Perrine] Nanyang Technol Univ, Earth Observ Singapore, Asian Sch Environm, Singapore, Singapore; [Soden, Robert] Univ Toronto, Dept Comp Sci, Toronto, ON, Canada",Nanyang Technological University & National Institute of Education (NIE) Singapore; Nanyang Technological University; Nanyang Technological University & National Institute of Education (NIE) Singapore; Nanyang Technological University; University of Toronto,"Lallemant, D (corresponding author), Nanyang Technol Univ, Earth Observ Singapore, Asian Sch Environm, Singapore, Singapore.",dlallemant@ntu.edu.sg; becca@co-risk.org; Karen.Barns@arup.com; perrine.hamel@ntu.edu.sg; robert.soden@utoronto.ca; steph@co-risk.org,"Lallemant, David/AAK-1138-2020","Lallemant, David/0000-0001-5759-9972","World Bank; Understanding Risk Community; Facebook; National Research Foundation, Singapore [NRF-NRFF2018-06]","World Bank(The World Bank India); Understanding Risk Community; Facebook(Facebook Inc); National Research Foundation, Singapore(National Research Foundation, Singapore)","The authors and event organizers are part of Co-Risk Labs, a small worker-owned cooperative run by technical experts in disaster risk management and response.

We hypothesize that periods of reduced sea ice (increased open water) expose shorelines to more prolonged and higher wave energy, leading to better-developed beach ridges. Surveys of raised beach sequences on Lowther Island revealed the following patterns: a) high, wide, single- to multi-crested barriers backed by deep swales or lagoons characterize both the active and lowest relict shorelines; b) small, narrow, discontinuous ridges of poorly sorted gravel extend from 1.0 to 7.5 m asl, except from 4.5 to 5.0 m ask c) ridge morphology is similar to the active and first relict ridges between 7.5 and 11 m asl; d) a near-featureless zone with minor terraces and ridges above 11 m extends to above 30 m asl. These distinct morphological and sedimentary units are interpreted as a function of wave climate and thus of summer sea-ice conditions. This model suggests periods of greater wave activity from the present day back about 500 (14)C years (530 cal BP;.Unit A), during a short interval from 1750 to 1600 (14)C years BP (1750-1450 cal BP; Unit B'), and earlier from 2900 to 2300 (14)C years BP (3030-2340 cal BP; Unit C). Units B and D are interpreted as the result of more severe ice conditions with lower wave energy from 2300 to 500 (14)C years BP (2340-530 cal BP) and earlier from more than 5750 to 2900 (14)C years BP (6540-3030 cal BP). Discrepancies with previously published interpretations of regional sea-ice history may reflect the local nature of the beach proxy record, which implies occurrences of extensive open-water fetch east and west of Lowther Island but cannot be extrapolated to a regional scale. The beach record shows distinct variation through time and provides an alternative window on past summer ice extent in central Barrow Strait.","[St-Hilaire-Gravel, Dominique; Bell, Trevor J.; Forbes, Donald L.] Mem Univ Newfoundland, Dept Geog, St John, NF A1B 3X9, Canada; [Forbes, Donald L.] Geol Survey Canada, Bedford Inst Oceanog, Nat Resources Canada, Dartmouth, NS B2Y 4A2, Canada",Memorial University Newfoundland; Bedford Institute of Oceanography; Natural Resources Canada; Lands & Minerals Sector - Natural Resources Canada; Geological Survey of Canada,"St-Hilaire-Gravel, D (corresponding author), Mem Univ Newfoundland, Dept Geog, St John, NF A1B 3X9, Canada.",dsthilaire@mun.ca,,,Geological Survey of Canada; ArcticNet; Networks of Centres of Excellence; Natural Resources Canada; Earth Sciences Sector (ESS); Polar Continental Shelf Program (PCSP); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Association of Canadian Universities for Northern Studies,Geological Survey of Canada(Natural Resources Canada); ArcticNet; Networks of Centres of Excellence; Natural Resources Canada(Natural Resources Canada); Earth Sciences Sector (ESS); Polar Continental Shelf Program (PCSP)(Natural Resources Canada); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR); Association of Canadian Universities for Northern Studies,"We wish to thank Zack Bartlett for his unstinting help on Lowther Island under trying weather conditions.

An inaccurate simulation may lead to inadequate conclusions, which could result in inappropriate and dangerous actions for the preservation of the heritage buildings. Then calibration and validation of hygrothermal simulation models are essential steps to achieve more accurate and reliable results. Now, although some agencies have developed guidelines and methodologies to carry out the validation of building performance models, all of them are based on energy consumption only. However, since in some buildings the energy consumption data are not always available especially when no operating heating, ventilation and air conditioning system is installed, which is the case of many historical buildings, the microclimatic parameters are usually adopted in the validation process. In this case, neither protocols nor specific parameters have been officially recognised to perform the model validation. The present work reviewed the main approaches used by researchers for building performance model validation with special reference to historical buildings based on microclimatic parameters, highlighting the main advantages and drawbacks of the different methods reviewed. Finally, recommendations to properly carry out the model validation based on microclimatic parameters have been provided. The collected information may be useful to different subjects (e.g. designers, energy auditors, researchers, conservators, buildings' owners and policy makers) and can drive suitable and reliable retrofit and maintenance interventions.","[Huerto-Cardenas, H.

However, moving from studies carried out at worldwide level, the main focus of the paper is the Mediterranean farm which practices irrigated and/or rainfed cropping systems. On the basis of the state of the art on this matter, a lack of knowledge in some areas has come to light that calls for new policies and further research. Basically, the review provides feasible agro-technical solutions for using water in the most efficient and productive way. Alternative ways to use water resources rationally in growing crops are discussed. They are based mainly on progress due to agronomy (No-Till Conservation Agriculture), information technology (Decision Support System and Precision Irrigation) and genetics. Agronomic options are analysed taking into account recent European agricultural and environmental trends of policies which conjugate the issues related to sustainability and production intensification. In perspective, the review encourages discussion on how to relocate farming systems within natural cycles, specifically those of the water cycle, based on No-Till Conservation Agriculture principles and practices which apply to all land-based agro-ecologies in all continents where agriculture is practiced.","[Mastrorilli, Marcello] CREA AA, Via Ulpiani 5, I-70125 Bari, Italy; [Zucaro, Raffaella] CREA PB, Via Po 14, I-00198 Rome, Italy",,"Mastrorilli, M (corresponding author), CREA AA, Via Ulpiani 5, I-70125 Bari, Italy.",marcello.mastrorilli@crea.gov.it,"Zucaro, Raffaella/ABC-8764-2020; Mastrorilli, Marcello/AAJ-7234-2020","Zucaro, Raffaella/0000-0001-9386-7612; Mastrorilli, Marcello/0000-0002-7374-0902",,,,,61,3,4,2,16,AMER INST MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES-AIMS,SPRINGFIELD,"PO BOX 2604, SPRINGFIELD, MO 65801-2604 USA",2471-2086,,,AIMS AGRIC FOOD,AIMS AGRIC.

In the Arctic, climate is warming twice as fast as compared to the global average (known as 'Arctic amplification'), likely having stronger impacts on arctic tundra vegetation. In order to quantify these changes and assess their impacts on ecosystem structure and function, methods are needed to accurately characterize the canopy properties of tundra vegetation types. However, commonly used ground-based measurements are limited in spatial and temporal coverage, and differentiating low-lying tundra plant species is challenging with coarse-resolution satellite remote sensing. The collection and processing of multi-sensor data from unoccupied aerial systems (UASs) has the potential to fill the gap between ground-based and satellite observations. To address the critical need for such data in the Arctic, we developed a cost-effective multi-sensor UAS (the 'Osprey') using off-the-shelf instrumentation. TheOspreysimultaneously produces high-resolution optical, thermal, and structural images, as well as collecting point-based hyperspectral measurements, over vegetation canopies. In this paper, we describe the setup and deployment of theOspreysystem in the Arctic to a tundra study site located in the Seward Peninsula, Alaska. We present a case study demonstrating the processing and application ofOspreydata products for characterizing the key biophysical properties of tundra vegetation canopies. In this study, plant functional types (PFTs) representative of arctic tundra ecosystems were mapped with an overall accuracy of 87.4%. TheOspreyimage products identified significant differences in canopy-scale greenness, canopy height, and surface temperature among PFTs, with deciduous low to tall shrubs having the lowest canopy temperatures while non-vascular lichens had the warmest. The analysis of our hyperspectral data showed that variation in the fractional cover of deciduous low to tall shrubs was effectively characterized byOspreyreflectance measurements across the range of visible to near-infrared wavelengths. Therefore, the development and deployment of theOspreyUAS, as a state-of-the-art methodology, has the potential to be widely used for characterizing tundra vegetation composition and canopy properties to improve our understanding of ecosystem dynamics in the Arctic, and to address scale issues between ground-based and airborne/satellite observations.","[Yang, Dedi; Meng, Ran; Morrison, Bailey D.; McMahon, Andrew; Serbin, Shawn P.] Brookhaven Natl Lab, Environm & Climate Sci Dept, Upton, NY 11973 USA; [Yang, Dedi; Serbin, Shawn P.] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Meng, Ran] Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Nat Resources & Environm, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China; [Hantson, Wouter; Hayes, Daniel J.] Univ Maine, Sch Forest Resources, Orono, ME 04469 USA; [Breen, Amy L.] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Int Arctic Res Ctr, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA; [Salmon, Verity G.] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Climate Change Sci Inst, POB 2009, Oak Ridge, TN 37830 USA; [Salmon, Verity G.] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Environm Sci Div, POB 2009, Oak Ridge, TN 37830 USA",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Brookhaven National Laboratory; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook; Huazhong Agricultural University; University of Maine System; University of Maine Orono; University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Fairbanks; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Oak Ridge National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Oak Ridge National Laboratory,"Yang, DD (corresponding author), Brookhaven Natl Lab, Environm & Climate Sci Dept, Upton, NY 11973 USA.;Yang, DD (corresponding author), SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA.",dediyang@bnl.gov; mengran@mail.hzau.edu.cn; bmorrison@bnl.gov; amcmahon@bnl.gov; wouter.hantson@maine.edu; daniel.j.hayes@maine.edu; albreen@ALASKA.EDU; salmonvg@ornl.gov; sserbin@bnl.gov,"Serbin, Shawn Paul/B-6392-2009; Yang, Daryl/GLN-6410-2022; Meng, Ran/Q-9436-2016; Morrison, Bailey/C-2350-2019","Serbin, Shawn Paul/0000-0003-4136-8971; Yang, Daryl/0000-0003-1705-7823; Hantson, Wouter/0000-0002-2882-6897; Meng, Ran/0000-0003-4756-9934; Salmon, Verity G./0000-0002-2188-551X; Hayes, Daniel/0000-0002-3011-7934; Morrison, Bailey/0000-0001-5824-8605","Next-Generation Ecosystem Experiments (NGEE Arctic) project - Office of Biological and Environmental Research in the United States Department of Energy, Office of Science; Department of Energy [DE-SC0012704]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2662019PY057]","Next-Generation Ecosystem Experiments (NGEE Arctic) project - Office of Biological and Environmental Research in the United States Department of Energy, Office of Science; Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities)","This work was funded by the Next-Generation Ecosystem Experiments (NGEE Arctic) project that is supported by theOffice of Biological and Environmental Research in the United States Department of Energy, Office of Science, and through the Department of Energy contract No. DE-SC0012704 to Brookhaven National Laboratory.

To understand potential risks during extreme storm events, detailed post-overtopping processes are investigated using DualSPHysics and SWASH with a newly developed approach. It is a calibrated-based wave generation: a target incident wave is first obtained from the validated SWASH model, and DualSPHysics creates the target incident wave by adjusting the offshore wave and bathymetry conditions. This one-way coupling process makes the DualSPHysics computation efficient enough to apply 3D simulation. With a vertical wall at the end of a room located at the end of the promenade in a mild and shallow foreshore, the present model shows a good correspondence on the wave force with the literature. After confirming the efficiency and accuracy of the present model, the 3D simulation with furniture inside the room was conducted and visualized with the state-of-the-art visualization technique. Based on the visualization, the potential risks during the extreme storm event are further discussed in this paper. The present work shows a further capability of DualSPHysics to deal with wave-object-structure interaction based on the latest developments in an efficient way.

Between late August and mid-September 2019, the stratospheric circumpolar westerly jet weakened rapidly, and Antarctic stratospheric temperatures rose dramatically. The deceleration of the vortex at 10 hPa was as drastic as that of the first-ever-observed major sudden stratospheric warming in the SH during 2002, while the mean Antarctic warming over the course of spring 2019 broke the previous record of 2002 by similar to 50% in the midstratosphere. This event was preceded by a poleward shift of the SH polar night jet in the uppermost stratosphere in early winter, which was then followed by record-strong planetary wave-1 activity propagating upward from the troposphere in August that acted to dramatically weaken the polar vortex throughout the depth of the stratosphere. The weakened vortex winds and elevated temperatures moved downward to the surface from mid-October to December, promoting a record strong swing of the southern annular mode (SAM) to its negative phase. This record-negative SAM appeared to be a primary driver of the extreme hot and dry conditions over subtropical eastern Australia that accompanied the severe wildfires that occurred in late spring 2019. State-of-the-art dynamical seasonal forecast systems skillfully predicted the significant vortex weakening of spring 2019 and subsequent development of negative SAM from as early as late July.</p>","[Lim, Eun-Pa; Hendon, Harry H.; Dowdy, Andrew; Wang, Guomin] Bur Meteorol, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Butler, Amy H.] NOAA, Chem Sci Lab, Boulder, CO USA; [Thompson, David W.

With this research, we aimed to clarify the cooling performances of roof greening throughout the year and identify the optimum roof greening coverage for the indoor thermal environment in Chenzhou, a city in China with hot summers and cold winters. The layout of buildings, building materials, and local climate data of Chenzhou were collected. The ENVI-met model was applied as the analytical tool after its accuracy was confirmed by a field experiment. The Kriging model was employed to interpret the annual effects of roof greening. The analytical results revealed that in Chenzhou, roof greening reduced indoor temperatures throughout the year, and the higher the coverage of roof greening, the greater the performance of indoor cooling. Moreover, hot climates enhanced the indoor cooling performances of roof greening. From the view of annual thermal perception, the increase in roof greening coverage reduced the duration of warm perceptions throughout the year and extended the perceptions of slightly warm, slightly cool, and cool.

Recent research suggests that lateral transport of dissolved carbon could exceed vertical carbon releases to the atmosphere. However, the details of lateral subsurface flow in polygonal tundra have not been well studied. We incorporated a subsurface transport process into an existing state-of-the-art hydrothermal model. The model captures the physical effects of freeze-thaw cycles on lateral flow in polygonal tundra. The new modeling capability enables non-reactive tracer movement within subsurface. We utilized this new capability to investigate the impact of freeze-thaw cycles on lateral flow in the polygonal tundra. Our study indicates the important role of freeze-thaw cycles and the freeze-up effect in lateral tracer transport, suggesting that dissolved species could be transported from the middle of the polygon to the sides within a couple of thaw seasons. Introducing lateral carbon transport into the climate models could substantially reduce the uncertainty associated with the impact of thawing permafrost.","[Jafarov, Elchin E.; Newman, Brent; Harp, Dylan; Wilson, Cathy] Los Alamos Natl Lab, Div Earth & Environm Sci, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA; [Jafarov, Elchin E.] Woodwell Climate Res Ctr, Falmouth, MA 02540 USA; [Svyatsky, Daniil; Moulton, David] Los Alamos Natl Lab, Div Theoret, Appl Math & Plasma Phys Grp, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Los Alamos National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Los Alamos National Laboratory,"Jafarov, EE (corresponding author), Los Alamos Natl Lab, Div Earth & Environm Sci, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA.;Jafarov, EE (corresponding author), Woodwell Climate Res Ctr, Falmouth, MA 02540 USA.",ejafarov@woodwellclimate.org,"JAFAROV, ELCHIN/G-1616-2016","JAFAROV, ELCHIN/0000-0002-8310-3261",Office of Science (NGEE Arctic grant),Office of Science (NGEE Arctic grant),This research has been supported by the Office of Science (NGEE Arctic grant).,,35,0,0,5,6,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1994-0416,1994-0424,,CRYOSPHERE,Cryosphere,11-Mar,2022,3,,,,851,862,,10.5194/tc-16-851-2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-851-2022,,,12,"Geography, Physical; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Physical Geography; Geology,ZU4DW,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,12/21/22,WOS:000769793500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The implementation of an effective energy transition plan faces multiple challenges, spanning from the integration of the operations of different energy carriers and sectors to the consideration of multiple spatial and temporal resolutions. In this review, we outline these challenges and discuss how they have been tackled by the current literature, as well as pointing at directions for future research. Many of the existing reviews identify a list of challenges common to most models, but they tend to be grouped according to type or energy carrier. Here we take a new approach and structure both well-established models and solution approaches along with the main challenges that energy modelling will have to deal with in the near future. We focus on four main current challenges that energy system models face: time and space; uncertainty; multi-energy; energy behaviour and energy transition. The main findings suggest that: demand-side management applied to multi-carrier energy system models lacks; prosumers is explored only in a limited manner; general, multi-scale modelling frameworks should be established and considered both in the dimensions of time, space, technology and energy carrier; long term energy system models tend to address uncertainty scarcely; there is a lack of studies modelling uncertainties related to emerging technologies and; modelling of energy consumer behaviour is one of the major aspect of future research.","[Fodstad, Marte; Knudsen, Brage Rugstad; Bordin, Chiara; Schmidt, Sarah; Straus, Julian] SINTEF Energy Res, PO Box 4761, NO-7465 Trondheim, Norway; [del Granado, Pedro Crespo; Pisciella, Paolo] NTNU Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Ind Econ & Technol Management, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway; [Hellemo, Lars] SINTEF Ind, PO Box 4760, NO-7465 Trondheim, Norway; [Silvast, Antti] NTNU Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Interdisciplinary Studies Culture, NO-7491 Trondheim, Norway; [Silvast, Antti] DTU Tech Univ Denmark, Div Responsible Innovat & Design, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark",SINTEF; Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); SINTEF; Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); Technical University of Denmark,"Knudsen, BR (corresponding author), SINTEF Energy Res, PO Box 4761, NO-7465 Trondheim, Norway.",brage.knudsen@sintef.no,"bordin, chiara/ABD-7476-2022","bordin, chiara/0000-0002-9869-3276; Silvast, Antti/0000-0002-1026-6529; Knudsen, Brage/0000-0001-5981-9879; Straus, Julian/0000-0001-8622-1936; Hellemo, Lars/0000-0001-5958-9794; Crespo Del Granado, Pedro/0000-0001-6048-8376","Research Council of Norway; Agder Energi; Air Liquide; Equinor Energy; NEL Hydrogen Electrolyser; Gassco; TotalEnergies EP Norge [295078, 308811]",Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway); Agder Energi; Air Liquide; Equinor Energy; NEL Hydrogen Electrolyser; Gassco; TotalEnergies EP Norge,"The authors thank our colleague Dr. Rahul Anantharaman at SINTEF Energy Research for ideas and efforts in an early stage of this work.

The vulnerability analysis of infrastructure exposed to natural hazards has become a key area of research due to the critical role that infrastructure plays for society and this topic has been the subject of significant advances from new data and insights following recent disasters. Transport systems, in particular, are highly vulnerable to natural hazards, and the physical damage of transport assets may cause significant disruption and socioeconomic impact. More importantly, infrastructure assets comprise Systems of Assets (SoA), i.e. a combination of interdependent assets exposed not to one, but to multiple hazards, depending on the environment within which these reside. Thus, it is of paramount importance for their reliability and safety to enable fragility analysis of SoA subjected to a sequence of hazards. In this context, and after understanding the absence of a relevant study, the aim of this paper is to review the recent advances on fragility assessment of critical transport infrastructure subject to diverse geotechnical and climatic hazards. The effects of these hazards on the main transport assets are summarised and common damage modes are described. Frequently in practice, individual fragility functions for each transport asset are employed as part of a quantitative risk analysis (QRA) of the infrastructure. A comprehensive review of the available fragility functions is provided for different hazards. Engineering advances in the development of numerical fragility functions for individual assets are discussed including soil-structure interaction, deterioration, and multiple hazard effects. The concept of SoA in diverse ecosystems is introduced, where infrastructure is classified based on (i) the road capacity and speed limits and (ii) the geomorphological and topographical conditions. A methodological framework for the development of numerical fragility functions of SoA under multiple hazards is proposed and demonstrated. The paper concludes by detailing the opportunities for future developments in the fragility analysis of transport SoA under multiple hazards, which is of paramount importance in decision-making processes around adaptation, mitigation, and recovery planning in respect of geotechnical and climatic hazards.","[Argyroudis, Sotirios A.; Mitoulis, Stergios A.] Univ Surrey, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Guildford, Surrey, England; [Argyroudis, Sotirios A.] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Civil Engn, Thessaloniki, Greece; [Winter, Mike G.] TRL, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Winter, Mike G.] Winter Associates, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Winter, Mike G.] Univ Portsmouth, Portsmouth, Hants, England; [Kaynia, Amir M.] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Struct Engn, Trondheim, Norway; [Kaynia, Amir M.] NGI, Oslo, Norway","University of Surrey; Aristotle University of Thessaloniki; University of Portsmouth; Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); Norwegian Geotechnical Institute, NGI","Argyroudis, SA (corresponding author), Univ Surrey, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Guildford, Surrey, England.;Argyroudis, SA (corresponding author), Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Civil Engn, Thessaloniki, Greece.",s.argyroudis@surrey.ac.uk; s.mitoulis@surrey.ac.uk; mwinter@winterassociates.co.uk; amir.m.kaynia@ngi.no,"Argyroudis, Sotirios/AAE-8935-2021","MITOULIS, STERGIOS ARISTOTELES/0000-0001-7201-2703; Argyroudis, Sotirios/0000-0002-8131-3038; Winter, Mike/0000-0003-3148-619X",European Union H2020Marie Sklodowska-Curie Research Grants Scheme MSCA-IF-2016 [746298],European Union H2020Marie Sklodowska-Curie Research Grants Scheme MSCA-IF-2016,This study has received funding by the European Union H2020Marie Sklodowska-Curie Research Grants Scheme MSCA-IF-2016 (grant agreement no 746298: TRANSRISK-Vulnerability and risk assessment of transportation systems of assets exposed to geo-hazards).,,208,80,80,19,128,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0951-8320,1879-0836,,RELIAB ENG SYST SAFE,Reliab.

State-of-the-art paleoclimate simulations of this interval are typically forced with diverse spatial patterns of volcanic forcing, leading to different responses in tropical hydroclimate. Recently, theoretical considerations relating the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) position to the demands of global energy balance have emerged in the literature, allowing for a connection to be made between the paleoclimate simulations and recent developments in the understanding of ITCZ dynamics. These energetic considerations aid in explaining the well-known historical, paleoclimatic, and modeling evidence that the ITCZ migrates away from the hemisphere that is energetically deficient in response to asymmetric forcing. Here we use two separate general circulation model (GCM) suites of experiments for the last millennium to relate the ITCZ position to asymmetries in prescribed volcanic sulfate aerosols in the stratosphere and related asymmetric radiative forcing. We discuss the ITCZ shift in the context of atmospheric energetics and discuss the ramifications of transient ITCZ migrations for other sensitive indicators of changes in the tropical hydrologic cycle, including global streamflow. For the first time, we also offer insight into the large-scale fingerprint of water isotopologues in precipitation (delta O-18(p)) in response to asymmetries in radiative forcing. The ITCZ shifts away from the hemisphere with greater volcanic forcing. Since the isotopic composition of precipitation in the ITCZ is relatively depleted compared to areas outside this zone, this meridional precipitation migration results in a large-scale enrichment (depletion) in the isotopic composition of tropical precipitation in regions the ITCZ moves away from (toward). Our results highlight the need for careful consideration of the spatial structure of volcanic forcing for interpreting volcanic signals in proxy records and therefore in evaluating the skill of Common Era climate model output.","[Colose, Christopher M.; Vuille, Mathias] SUNY Albany, Dept Atmospher & Environm Sci, Albany, NY 12222 USA; [LeGrande, Allegra N.] NASA, Goddard Inst Space Studies, New York, NY 10025 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Albany; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center,"Colose, CM (corresponding author), SUNY Albany, Dept Atmospher & Environm Sci, Albany, NY 12222 USA.",ccolose@albany.edu,"LeGrande, Allegra N./D-8920-2012; Vuille, Mathias/S-3906-2019; Vuille, Mathias/O-8128-2019","LeGrande, Allegra N./0000-0002-5295-0062; Vuille, Mathias/0000-0002-9736-4518","NOAA [C2D2 NA10OAR4310126]; NSF [AGS-1003690, AGS-1303828]; NASA [GISS-E2]; NASA High-End Computing (HEC) Program through the NASA Center for Climate Simulation (NCCS) at Goddard Space Flight Center",NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); NASA High-End Computing (HEC) Program through the NASA Center for Climate Simulation (NCCS) at Goddard Space Flight Center,This study was funded by NOAA C2D2 NA10OAR4310126 and NSF awards AGS-1003690 and AGS-1303828.

The research strategies have invariably been to first conduct baseline simulations of current conditions to evaluate model performance. Then simulation of regional climate with land cover changes (LCC) implemented within the model allows differences with the baseline simulation to be used as evidence of global to regional-scale climate impacts of LCC. However, even state-of-the-art regional climate models require two data sets to conduct reasonable baseline simulations. These are representative current land cover and atmospheric information over the study region. In frontier and developing areas (where most of the rapid land-use conversion is taking place), these data sets are frequently unavailable and the errors in simulations are due to either inaccurate land cover, insufficient atmospheric information, nonrepresentative model physics, or a combination of one or more of the above. This study shows that in one frontier region, that surrounding the Cordillera de Tilaran of Costa Rica, the accuracy of simulating clouds decreases by 1% to 3% if default model land cover information is used. If the atmospheric data sets used are the ones usually available to researchers (with land cover information held constant), then the model accuracy is reduced by 21% to 25%. Model runs without updated land cover or atmospheric information reduce model accuracy slightly further. Precipitation comparisons also provide similar results. This study thus shows that the critically important data set for conducting accurate simulations is not land cover information but atmospheric information. Researchers may similarly get significant increase in the accuracy of their baseline simulations elsewhere by using radiosondes/rawinsondes over their study region. Finally, since atmospheric information is not available for different landscape scenarios, assessments of the relative role of LULC change will have to continue to rely on using the standard atmospheric data set and the acceptance that the use of more detailed atmospheric data to initialize and provide lateral boundary conditions would have reduced the uncertainties in such landscape sensitivity studies.","[Ray, Deepak K.] Purdue Univ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Pielke, Roger A., Sr.] Univ Colorado, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Nair, Udaysankar S.] Univ Alabama, Natl Space Sci & Technol Ctr, Ctr Earth Syst Sci, Huntsville, AL 35805 USA; [Welch, Ronald M.] Univ Alabama, Dept Atmospher Sci, Huntsville, AL 35805 USA; [Lawton, Robert O.] Univ Alabama, Dept Biol Sci, Huntsville, AL 35899 USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Huntsville; University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Huntsville; University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Huntsville,"Ray, DK (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",dkray@purdue.edu,"Pielke, Roger A/A-5015-2009; Ray, Deepak K/F-7720-2012","Ray, Deepak/0000-0002-2856-9608",NSF [ATM-0128924]; NASA [NNX06AG74G],NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)),"The LUCIE field campaign was conducted under NSF grant ATM-0128924.

With a current annual building refurbishment rate between 0,4 and 1,2% in the EU it will be impossible to reach this objective. For getting on track, efficient and particularly affordable solutions fulfilling future-proof requirements are needed. This paper introduces the concept of HVACC 4.0, which stands for Heating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning and Chilling. The system architecture differs from state of the art HVACR, where the R stands for Refrigeration, in at least three points: (1) The innovative thermal storage and collector concept allows to harvest and store low temperature heat and cold on a daily basis, (2) in heating applications, the disruptive refrigerant cycle allows to more than double the Coefficient of Performance (COP) compared to air-water heat pumps and (3) in cooling applications, the night-time harvesting of cold via unglazed PVT-collectors allows to boost the Energy Efficiency Ratio (EER) by a factor of >10 compared to split devices or cold water aggregates. HVACC 4.0 aims to provide a solution in form of an easy-to-install refurbishment kit. The design criteria for addressing the 4.0 in HVACC 4.0 have been (1) to exemplify the principle of efficiency 1st, (2) to maximize the share of Renewable Energies (RE) on total energy consumption, (3) to allow serving next generation low temperature District Grids (DG) and (4) to allow more sector coupling. As new and innovative RE sources with high collector yield, unglazed PVT-collectors (Photo Voltaic & Thermal) and thermally activated Sheet Pile Systems are discussed.","[Noll, Thomas] Easy Tnt, Muhlleite 2, D-85110 Kipfenberg, Germany",,"Noll, T (corresponding author), Easy Tnt, Muhlleite 2, D-85110 Kipfenberg, Germany.",tnoll1954@gmail.com,,,,,,,14,0,0,1,1,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2019,,,,,,,12083,10.1088/1742-6596/1343/1/012083,http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1742-6596/1343/1/012083,,,6,Construction & Building Technology; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Energy & Fuels,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Construction & Building Technology; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Energy & Fuels,BP7FB,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000561852800083,View Full Record in Web of Science

The results indicated an increased area with wetting trend since 1998, and the overall water availability reversed a drying tendency to a wetting trend around 2005. Also, the Northern Hemisphere became wetter and the Southern Hemisphere became dryer in 2016, demonstrating a transformation of favorable climate from the Southern Hemisphere to the Northern Hemisphere. Spatial patterns of the trend shape determined spatial distributions of the trend contributions, showing an opposite contribution between subtropics and tropics. Additionally, tropical rainforests and shrublands governed the overall trend reversely. This analysis helps to understand the non-uniform patterns of water availability trend and related ecosystem productivity over tropics and subtropics.","[Zhang, Anzhi; Jia, Gensuo] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, CAS Key Lab Reg Climate Environm Temperate East A, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS","Jia, GS (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, CAS Key Lab Reg Climate Environm Temperate East A, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.",jiong@tea.ac.cn,"Zhang, Anzhi/D-1080-2014; Jia, Gensuo/AAL-2681-2020","Jia, Gensuo/0000-0001-5950-9555","Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA19030401]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41590853, 41305106]",Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This work was jointly supported by the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Grant No. XDA19030401) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41590853 and 41305106).,,51,4,4,0,14,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1569-8432,1872-826X,,INT J APPL EARTH OBS,Int.

Temperature records observed at meteorological stations have been widely used, but there has been an increasing need for temperature data in grid for modeling especially those using remote sensing data. Although grid temperature can be estimated from in-situ temperature records using interpolation algorithm, low accuracy has been found in the estimation due to limited ground stations, especially when there were insufficient sites to represent all land cover types and terrain conditions in the area. NCEP/NCAR reanalysis project produced climate variables uses a frozen state-of-art global data assimilation system and a database as complete as possible. Although resolution of the NCEP data has a coarse resolution (0.5 degree), it provides global, consistent, and long term estimation of climate variables. This paper presents a downscaling approach for deriving monthly temperature at 1km resolution from the NCEP by utilizing derived relationships between monthly aggregated NCEP temperature and other ground elements, such as terrain, vegetation, and geographic locations. Regression tree model was chosen for detecting the possible relationships. Monthly temperature with 1km resolution for China land area has been produced using the approach. The final predicted temperatures were compared with observed records at 380 meteorological stations in China. The results indicated that the downscaled estimations can represent the spatial distribution and trends and the magnitude of temperature in inter-month, with R(2)ranging from 0.861 to 0.948, and RMSE from 1.88 degrees C to 2.681 degrees C.","[Jing, Wenlong; Lu, Heli] Minist Educ, Key Lab Geospatial Technol Middle & Lower Yellow, Kaifeng 475001, Peoples R China; [Jing, Wenlong; Lu, Heli] Henan Univ, Coll Environm & Planning, Kaifeng, Peoples R China",Henan University,"Feng, M (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing, Peoples R China.",feng.tank@gmail.com,,"LU, Heli/0000-0002-9443-4031",Natural Science Foundation of China [41101364]; Key Project for the Strategic Science Plan in IGSNRR; CAS [2012ZD010],Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Key Project for the Strategic Science Plan in IGSNRR; CAS(Chinese Academy of Sciences),"Supported by Natural Science Foundation of China (41101364), Key Project for the Strategic Science Plan in IGSNRR, CAS (2012ZD010)",,15,0,0,0,5,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2161-024X,,,INT CONF GEOINFORM,,,2013,,,,,,,,,,,,8,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Engineering; Geology,BA9GK,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000339361500175,View Full Record in Web of Science

Unexplained systematic discrepancies between measurements at low water vapor mixing ratios made by different instruments on airborne platforms have limited our ability to adequately address a number of relevant scientific questions on the humidity distribution, cloud formation and climate impact in that region. Therefore, during the past decade, the scientific community has undertaken substantial efforts to understand these discrepancies and improve the quality of water vapor measurements. This study presents a comprehensive intercomparison of airborne state-of-the-art in situ hygrometers deployed on board the DLR (German Aerospace Center) research aircraft HALO (High Altitude and LOng Range Research Aircraft) during the Midlatitude CIRRUS (ML-CIRRUS) campaign conducted in 2014 over central Europe. The instrument intercomparison shows that the hygrometer measurements agree within their combined accuracy (+/- 10% to 15 %, depending on the humidity regime); total mean values agree within 2.5 %. However, systematic differences on the order of 10% and up to a maximum of 15% are found for mixing ratios below 10 parts per million (ppm) H2O. A comparison of relative humidity within cirrus clouds does not indicate a systematic instrument bias in either water vapor or temperature measurements in the up-per troposphere. Furthermore, in situ measurements are compared to model data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) which are interpolated along the ML-CIRRUS flight tracks. We find a mean agreement within +/- 10% throughout the troposphere and a significant wet bias in the model on the order of 100% to 150% in the stratosphere close to the tropopause. Consistent with previous studies, this analysis indicates that the model deficit is mainly caused by too weak of a humidity gradient at the tropopause.","[Kaufmann, Stefan; Voigt, Christiane; Heller, Romy; Jurkat-Witschas, Tina; Schumann, Ulrich] Inst Phys Atmosphare, Deutsch Zentrum Luft & Raumfahrt, D-82234 Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany; [Voigt, Christiane] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Inst Phys Atmosphare, D-55128 Mainz, Germany; [Kraemer, Martina; Rolf, Christian] Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Energy & Climate Res IEK 7, D-52428 Julich, Germany; [Zoeger, Martin; Giez, Andreas] Deutsch Zentrum Luft & Raumfahrt, Flight Expt, D-822234 Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany; [Buchholz, Bernhard; Ebert, Volker] Phys Tech Bundesanstalt Braunschweig, D-38116 Braunschweig, Germany; [Thornberry, Troy] NOAA, Earth Syst Res Lab, Chem Sci Div, Boulder, CO USA; [Thornberry, Troy] Univ Colorado, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",Helmholtz Association; German Aerospace Centre (DLR); Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz; Helmholtz Association; Research Center Julich; Helmholtz Association; German Aerospace Centre (DLR); Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB); National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Kaufmann, S (corresponding author), Inst Phys Atmosphare, Deutsch Zentrum Luft & Raumfahrt, D-82234 Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany.",stefan.kaufmann@dlr.de,"Rolf, Christian/K-5275-2016; Ebert, Volker/I-6604-2019; 1294, HALO SPP/AAA-7658-2021; Ebert, Volker/E-7671-2011; Krämer, Martina/A-7482-2013; Voigt, Christiane/G-3279-2010","Rolf, Christian/0000-0001-5329-0054; Ebert, Volker/0000-0002-1394-3097; Ebert, Volker/0000-0002-1394-3097; Krämer, Martina/0000-0002-2888-1722; Voigt, Christiane/0000-0001-8925-7731; Zoger, Martin/0000-0001-8291-345X","Helmholtz Association [W2/W3-60]; German Science Foundation within the DFG-SPP HALO 1294 [VO1504/4-1, JU3059/1-1, KR 2957/1-1, SCHI-872/2-2]",Helmholtz Association(Helmholtz Association); German Science Foundation within the DFG-SPP HALO 1294,"We thank the DLR flight department and Andreas Minikin for great support during the campaign and Klaus Gierens for helpful comments on the manuscript.

Because general circulation models (GCMs) operate on a coarse scale, the output from a GCM has to be downscaled to obtain the information relevant to hydrologic studies. In this paper, downscaling models are developed using the state-of-the-art nonparametric method K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN) approach, with an emphasis on optimal choice in selection of nearest neighbors for obtaining simultaneous projections of mean monthly maximum and minimum temperatures (T-max and T-min) as well as monthly precipitation and pan evaporation to lake-basin scale in a semiarid region that is considered to be a climatically sensitive region in India. The performance of the K-NN approach was evaluated based on several statistical performance indicators. A comparison of K-NN has been made with a linear multiple regression (LMR)-based downscaling model. Also, the prevailing view in the literature regarding optimal choice of selection of nearest neighbors is checked with different perturbations. A simple multiplicative shift was used for correcting predictand values. The K-NN-based models are found to be superior to LMR-based models, and, subsequently, the K-NN-based model is applied to obtain future climate projections of the predictands. An increasing trend is observed for T-max and T-min for A1B, A2, and B1 scenarios, and the precipitation is projected to increase in the future for A2 and A1B scenarios, whereas no trend has been observed for pan evaporation in future.

Integral blinds can be operated regardless of the weather conditions and they can be automatized. The state of the art and the limitations of the systems are presented. Based on practical experience planning recommendations are formulated.

Recovery time (RT) of an ecosystem from drought is an important indicator of assessing drought impacts and ecosystem resilience, yet the spatiotemporal pattern of ecosystem postdrought RT remains controversial in existing studies. Here we investigate the spatiotemporal pattern of postdrought RT across global terrestrial ecosystems using two observation-based gross primary productivity (GPP) data sets: direct flux-site observations and gridded estimates by upscaling flux-site observations using machine-learning approach. For droughts that occur on average once every 5.2 years, the RT typically ranges between 2 and 8 months, with a global mean RT of similar to 6 months. Spatially, both GPP data sets show a significant bilinear relationship between RT and moisture gradient, and that ecosystems in arid and humid regions tend to recover from drought more rapidly than semi-arid/sub-humid ecosystems. Additionally, forests show an overall longer RT than shrublands and grasslands. Temporally, global ecosystem RT shows a slight yet significant increasing trend (0.032 months yr(-1)) during 1982-2010, which is partly caused by the increasing drought for the same period. However, the observed patterns of RT across global bio-climatic zones are not captured by the state-of-the-art land surface models, which exhibit a shorter RT in semi-arid/sub-humid ecosystems but longer RT in arid/humid regions, and a larger increasing trend of RT over time (0.069 months yr(-1)). Our findings provide crucial insights into ecosystem vulnerability to sub-decadal stress events and ecosystem recovery trajectories among diverse bio-climatic regions and highlight potential model deficiencies that should be accounted for in future model developments.","[Zhang, Shulei; Wu, Xiuchen; Li, Xiaoyan; Shi, Fangzhong] Beijing Normal Univ, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Sch Nat Resources, Fac Geog Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Shulei] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Atmospher Sci, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Climate Change & Nal Disas, Southern Marine Sci Engn Guangdong Lab Zhuhai, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Yang, Yuting] Tsinghua Univ, State Key Lab Hydrosci & Engn, Dept Hydraul Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China",Beijing Normal University; Southern Marine Science & Engineering Guangdong Laboratory; Sun Yat Sen University; Tsinghua University,"Yang, YT (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, State Key Lab Hydrosci & Engn, Dept Hydraul Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China.",yuting_yang@tsinghua.edu.cn,"yang, yuting/Y-7885-2018","yang, yuting/0000-0002-4573-1929; Shi, Fangzhong/0000-0002-8900-1637","Ministry of Science and Technology of China [2019YFC1510604]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41901024, 42071029]; Innovation Group Project of Southern Marine Science and Engineering Guangdong Laboratory (Zhuhai) [311021009]; Department of Science and Technology, Qinghai, China [2019-SF-A4]","Ministry of Science and Technology of China(Ministry of Science and Technology, China); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Innovation Group Project of Southern Marine Science and Engineering Guangdong Laboratory (Zhuhai); Department of Science and Technology, Qinghai, China","This research was supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China (Grant No. 2019YFC1510604), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41901024 & 42071029), the Innovation Group Project of Southern Marine Science and Engineering Guangdong Laboratory (Zhuhai) (No. 311021009), and the Department of Science and Technology, Qinghai, China (Grant No. 2019-SF-A4).

Based on hindcast records from 1998-2017, we find that probabilistic forecasts of sea-ice concentration (SIC) throughout the marginal ice zone of the Canadian Arctic in June and November are no more skillful than simple benchmark forecasts based on climatology and damped persistence. At short lead times, the lack of skill arises from overconfident ensemble spread and errors in forecast initial conditions. At longer lead times, the development of model drift also plays a role. To improve the forecasts, we develop the nonhomogeneous censored Gaussian regression for SIC (NCGR-sic) calibration procedure, which uses the forecast ensemble mean and ensemble standard deviation (both locally and from neighboring locations) as predictors in an ensemble model output statistics framework. Importantly, NCGR-sic incorporates observational uncertainty directly during model parameter fitting, leading to enhanced calibration. NCGR-sic improves the spatial probability score by similar to 60%$$ \sim 60\% $$, on average, half of which we infer results from the removal of climatological bias and half from the improvement of forecast uncertainty. Calibrated forecasts from SEAS5 (GEPS) exceed the skill of climatology throughout the marginal ice zone over at least the first 33 (26) days in June and the first 32 (15) days in November. Generally, better skill occurs outside the Canadian Archipelago and for low- to mid-range SIC compared with high SIC. While calibrated forecasts also outperform damped persistence after the first 3-10 days, we postulate that initial condition inconsistencies must be resolved in order to obtain skill at shorter timescales. Finally, the robustness of NCGR-sic is demonstrated by effectively improving an operational forecast from June 2020.","[Dirkson, Arlan; Peterson, K.

To tackle these problems often local infrastructural adaptation measures are proposed. In this study a chain of state-of-the-art models is presented that can be used to evaluate the benefits of such measures. Also, a method is presented to calculate the costs of not responding to a changing environment that is slowly aggravating floods. These methods are applied to a case study in the city of Colombo in Sri Lanka. Colombo faces problems with floods that are expected to get worse by further wetland reduction and climate change. Several local measures (infrastructural interventions) are proposed to tackle that problem. This paper shows a method to quantify the expected reduction in future flood damages resulting from the proposed measures, and compares the risk reduction to the proposed measure costs. This is done by creating probabilistic inundation depth maps using a 1D2D hydrodynamic model. A detailed flood damage model and socio-economic development scenarios are then applied to estimate damage with and without the measures. An economic analysis is done to demonstrate the benefits of the measures, which can be used by decision makers. Additionally, calculations are carried out of future flood risk increases when wetland reduction in Colombo continues. In this case, the effect of stopping wetland encroachment is found to be larger than the effect of the structural adaptation measures.","[Wagenaar, D. J.; Diermanse, F. L. M.; Gehrels, J.

Unfortunately, only a small proportion of the ocean floor with sufficiently high sediment accumulation rate (SAR) is suitable for such reconstructions using the long-standing age-depth model approach. We employ ultra-small radiocarbon (C-14) dating on single microscopic foraminifera to demonstrate that the long-standing age-depth model method conceals large age uncertainties caused by post-depositional sediment mixing, meaning that existing studies may underestimate total geochronological error. We find that the age-depth distribution of our C-14-dated single foraminifera is in good agreement with existing bioturbation models only after one takes the possibility of Zoophycos burrowing into account. To overcome the problems associated with the age-depth paradigm, we use the first ever dual C-14 and stable isotope (delta O-18 and delta C-13) analysis on single microscopic foraminifera to produce a palaeoclimate time series independent of the age-depth paradigm. This new state of the art essentially decouples single foraminifera from the age-depth paradigm to provide multiple floating, temporal snapshots of ocean chemistry, thus allowing for the successful extraction of temporally accurate palaeoclimate data from low-SAR deep-sea archives. This new method can address large geographical gaps in late-glacial benthic palaeoceanographic reconstructions by opening up vast areas of previously disregarded, low-SAR deep-sea archives to research, which will lead to an improved understanding of the global interaction between oceans and climate.","[Lougheed, Bryan C.] Uppsala Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Villavagen 16, S-75236 Uppsala, Sweden; [Lougheed, Bryan C.; Metcalfe, Brett] Univ Paris Saclay, IPSL, LSCE, CEA,CNRS,UVSQ, F-91190 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Metcalfe, Brett] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Earth Sci, Fac Sci, De Boelelaan 1085, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Ninnemann, Ulysses S.] Univ Bergen, Dept Earth Sci, Allegaten 41, N-5007 Bergen, Norway; [Wacker, Lukas] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Lab Ion Beam Phys, Otto Stern Weg 5, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland",Uppsala University; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Cite; Universite Paris Saclay; CEA; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; University of Bergen,"Lougheed, BC (corresponding author), Uppsala Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Villavagen 16, S-75236 Uppsala, Sweden.;Lougheed, BC (corresponding author), Univ Paris Saclay, IPSL, LSCE, CEA,CNRS,UVSQ, F-91190 Gif Sur Yvette, France.",bryan.lougheed@lsce.ipsl.fr,"Metcalfe, Brett/C-4928-2013","Metcalfe, Brett/0000-0002-5873-9815; Wacker, Lukas/0000-0002-8215-2678",Swedish Research Council (Vetenskapsradet) [637-2014-499]; Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) [822.01.0.19],Swedish Research Council (Vetenskapsradet)(Swedish Research Council); Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO)(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)),"Measurements and Bryan C.

We use an ensemble long-term retrospective forecast experiment covering 1880-2017 that utilizes the Community Earth System Model (CESM). We find that the decadal variation of the IOD prediction skill is significant and that it varies with the lead time. We also find that the decadal variation of the IOD prediction skill for the target season of boreal autumn determines that for all initial conditions, regardless of the lead months. For short lead times, the decadal variations of the IOD strength and of the IOD precursor in the initial month of July are the major factors influencing the IOD prediction skill. This occurs because the IOD events are in the developmental phase, and the stronger IOD signal in the initial conditions leads to better predictions. For long lead times, the decadal variation of remote forcing by El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the ENSO precursor signal in the IOD influence the IOD prediction skill more significantly than do the strengths of the ENSO or the IOD. In addition, the analysis also indicated that the period with a low ENSO-IOD relationship has low predictability, not only because the ENSO little influence on IOD but also because the model biasedly overestimates the ENSO-IOD relationship. Significance StatementThe Indian Ocean dipole (IOD) has strong climatic effects, both around the Indian Ocean and globally, which have strong impacts on human life and economic development. It is important to be able to predict IOD events accurately to mitigate those impacts. Here, we conducted a 138-yr prediction experiment using a state-of-the-art climate model to confirm the existence of a decadal variation in IOD predictability and to identify factors that influence the IOD prediction skill. The most important factors that influence the decadal variation of IOD prediction skill differ for 3-month and 6-month lead times, and additional studies will be necessary to clarify the specific factors responsible for these differences.","[Song, Xunshu; Li, Xiaojing; Liu, Ting] Minist Nat Resources, Inst Oceanog 2, State Key Lab Satellite Ocean Environm Dynam, Hangzhou, Peoples R China; [Song, Xunshu; Tang, Youmin; Li, Xiaojing; Liu, Ting] Southern Marine Sci & Engn Guangdong Lab Zhuhai, Zhuhai, Peoples R China; [Tang, Youmin] Univ Northern British Columbia, Prince George, BC, Canada; [Tang, Youmin] Hohai Univ, Coll Oceanog, Nanjing, Peoples R China",Ministry of Natural Resources of the People's Republic of China; Southern Marine Science & Engineering Guangdong Laboratory; University of Northern British Columbia; Hohai University,"Tang, YM (corresponding author), Southern Marine Sci & Engn Guangdong Lab Zhuhai, Zhuhai, Peoples R China.;Tang, YM (corresponding author), Univ Northern British Columbia, Prince George, BC, Canada.;Tang, YM (corresponding author), Hohai Univ, Coll Oceanog, Nanjing, Peoples R China.",youmin.tang@unbc.ca,,,"National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFA0604202]; Scientific Research Fund of the Second Institute of Oceanography, Ministry of Natural Resources [JG2007, JG2206]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [42006034, 41530961]; Innovation Group Project of Southern Marine Science and Engineering Guangdong Laboratory (Zhuhai) [311021009]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [B210201022]","National Key Research and Development Program of China; Scientific Research Fund of the Second Institute of Oceanography, Ministry of Natural Resources; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Innovation Group Project of Southern Marine Science and Engineering Guangdong Laboratory (Zhuhai); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities)","This study was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2017YFA0604202); the Scientific Research Fund of the Second Institute of Oceanography, Ministry of Natural Resources (JG2007, JG2206); the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grants 42006034 and 41530961); the Innovation Group Project of Southern Marine Science and Engineering Guangdong Laboratory (Zhuhai) (311021009); and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (B210201022).",,57,0,0,2,2,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693, UNITED STATES",0894-8755,1520-0442,,J CLIMATE,J.

Considering the effect these clouds have on the surface energy and radiation budgets as well as on the diurnal cycle of the ABL, they are undoubtedly important for the regional climate. However, an adequate representation of LLCs in the state-of-the-art weather and climate models is still a challenge, which is largely due to the lack of high-quality observations in this region and gaps in understanding of underlying processes. In several recent studies, a unique and comprehensive data set collected in summer 2016 during the DACCIWA (Dynamics-aerosol-chemistry-cloud interactions in West Africa) ground-based field campaign was used for the first observational analyses of the parameters and physical processes relevant for the LLC formation over SWA. However, occasionally stratus-free nights occur during the monsoon season as well. Using observations and ERA5 reanalysis, we investigate differences in the boundary-layer conditions during 6 stratus-free and 20 stratus nights observed during the DACCIWA campaign. Our results suggest that the interplay between three major mechanisms is crucial for the formation of LLCs during the monsoon season: (i) the onset time and strength of the nocturnal low-level jet (NLLJ), (ii) horizontal cold-air advection, and (iii) background moisture level. Namely, weaker or later onset of NLLJ leads to a reduced contribution from horizontal cold-air advection. This in turn results in weaker cooling, and thus saturation is not reached. Such deviation in the dynamics of the NLLJ is related to the arrival of a cold air mass propagating north-wards from the coast, called Gulf of Guinea maritime inflow. Additionally, stratus-free nights occur when the intrusions of dry air masses, originating from, for example, central or south Africa, reduce the background moisture over large parts of SWA. Backward-trajectory analysis suggests that another possible reason for clear nights is descending air, which originated from drier levels above the marine boundary layer.","[Babic, Karmen; Kalthoff, Norbert; Adler, Bianca; Quinting, Julian F.] KIT, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Karlsruhe, Germany; [Lohou, Fabienne; Lothon, Marie] Univ Toulouse, UPS, CNRS, Lab Aerol, Toulouse, France; [Dione, Cheikh] African Ctr Meteorol Applicat Dev, Niamey, Niger",Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Babic, K (corresponding author), KIT, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Karlsruhe, Germany.",karmen.babic@kit.edu,"Adler, Bianca/B-4406-2018; Quinting, Julian/AAC-3172-2019","Adler, Bianca/0000-0002-0384-7456; Quinting, Julian/0000-0002-8409-2541; DIONE, Cheikh/0000-0002-8457-6175; Babic, Karmen/0000-0002-4878-6167",European Commission (DACCIWA) [(603502)]; Helmholtz Association [VH-NG-1243],European Commission (DACCIWA); Helmholtz Association(Helmholtz Association),This research has been supported by the European Commission (DACCIWA (grant no. 603502)) and the Helmholtz Association (grant no.

One of the key inputs to these models is the emission of isoprene from forest ecosystems. Most models in current use rely on a scheme by which global change is coupled to changes in terrestrial net primary productivity (NPP) which, in turn, is coupled to changes in the magnitude of isoprene emissions. In this study, we conducted measurements of isoprene emissions at three prominent global change experiments in the United States. Our results showed that growth in art atmosphere of elevated CO2 inhibited the emission of isoprene at levels that completely compensate for possible increases in emission due to increases in aboveground NPP. Exposure to a prolonged drought caused leaves to increase their isoprene emissions despite reductions in photosynthesis, and presumably NPP. Thus, the current generation of models intended to predict the response of isoprene emission to future global change probably contain large errors. A framework is offered as a foundation for constructing new isoprene emission models based on the responses of leaf biochemistry to future climate change and elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations.","Univ Colorado, Dept Ecol & Evolut Biol, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; Univ Colorado, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; Univ Colorado, Dept Chem & Biochem, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Boulder, CO 80301 USA; Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Div Environm Sci, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA; Texas A&M Univ, Dept Hort Sci, College Stn, TX 77840 USA; Texas A&M Univ, Dept Rangeland Ecol & Management, College Stn, TX 77840 USA; Texas A&M Univ, Dept Forest Sci, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; Michigan Technol Univ, Sch Forest Resources & Environm Sci, Houghton, MI 49931 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Oak Ridge National Laboratory; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Michigan Technological University,"Monson, RK (corresponding author), Portland State Univ, Dept Biol, Portland, OR 97201 USA.",russell.monson@colorado.edu,"Tjoelker, Mark G/M-2413-2016; Moore, David JP/A-6268-2013; Veres, Patrick R/E-7441-2010; Norby, Richard J/C-1773-2012","Tjoelker, Mark G/0000-0003-4607-5238; Moore, David JP/0000-0002-6462-3288; Veres, Patrick R/0000-0001-7539-353X; Norby, Richard J/0000-0002-0238-9828; Volder, Astrid/0000-0001-7930-6579",,,,,57,104,107,0,47,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",1364-503X,1471-2962,,PHILOS T R SOC A,Philos.

Some themes in the pastoral harmony trope are arcadia, idyll, elegy, utopia, balance of nature, rootedness, locality, rurality, and natural health. Of particular focus in this piece is the celebration of agriculture and agricultural landscapes. By analyzing two case studies of contemporary artists who celebrate agriculture in their work, I explore the themes and tensions in modern pastoral art, which both sells the pastoral lifestyle and embraces progressive social and environmental ideals. The case studies include photographer and filmmaker Ben Stechschulte and music by Rising Appalachia. In a world of climate crisis and social injustice, these artists demonstrate a pastoral vision that prescribes a more nuanced understanding of rurality as the antidote to fractured relationships between human groups and the more-than-human world.","[Abatemarco, Tatiana] Bennington Coll, Food Studies, Bennington, VT 05201 USA",,"Abatemarco, T (corresponding author), Bennington Coll, Food Studies, Bennington, VT 05201 USA.",tatianaabatemarco@bennington.edu,,,,,,,25,0,0,1,1,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2373-566X,2373-5678,,GEOHUMANITIES,Geohumanities,2-Jan,2022,1,,,,287,300,,10.1080/2373566X.2021.1960878,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/2373566X.2021.1960878,,21-Aug,14,Geography,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Geography,2L0TB,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000692756700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Indoor concentrations of nitrogen oxides, determined at the same periods, also exhibited diurnal dependence on air exchange rate (AER) and on their indoor sources from the burning of candies and oil lamps. Indoor concentrations of ozone exhibited dependence on the AER and on the concentration of other indoor pollutants. On a large number of occasions these concentrations exceeded the proposed air quality standards for the preservation of works of art in both churches. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, simultaneous observations at two altitudes were conducted over the North China Plain. Despite a high aerosol loading during cold season, NPF is still frequently observed. The upper-air NPF is increasingly intensive and starts earlier as haze pollution deteriorated, and the onset time gap could exceed 3 hr. To understand the factors modulating NPF vertically, we updated the meteorology-chemistry model by incorporating state-of-the-art nucleation schemes and performed highly vertical-resolved simulations. It is revealed that vertical disparities in NPF are attributed to the pronounced stratification of sulfur dioxide, ozone, and particulate matter. As the evolution of the boundary layer, strong NPF in the upper air elevates the near-surface nucleation-mode particles. This work sheds more light on the vertical structure of NPF.","[Lai, Shiyi; Huang, Xin; Qi, Ximeng; Chen, Liangduo; Ren, Chuanhua; Wang, Zilin; Wang, Jinbo; Lou, Sijia; Chi, Xuguang; Ding, Aijun] Nanjing Univ, Sch Atmospher Sci, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Lai, Shiyi; Huang, Xin; Qi, Ximeng; Chen, Liangduo; Ren, Chuanhua; Wang, Zilin; Wang, Jinbo; Lou, Sijia; Chi, Xuguang; Ding, Aijun] Jiangsu Prov Collaborat Innovat Ctr Climate Chang, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Gao, Yang] Ocean Univ China, Frontiers Sci Ctr Deep Ocean Multispheres & Earth, Key Lab Marine Environm & Ecol, Minist Educ, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Hai, Shangfei] Ocean Univ China, Coll Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Petaja, Tuukka; Kerminen, Veli-Matti; Kulmala, Markku] Univ Helsinki, Fac Sci, Inst Atmospher & Earth Syst Res Phys, Helsinki, Finland",Nanjing University; Ocean University of China; Ocean University of China; University of Helsinki,"Huang, X; Qi, XM (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ, Sch Atmospher Sci, Nanjing, Peoples R China.;Huang, X; Qi, XM (corresponding author), Jiangsu Prov Collaborat Innovat Ctr Climate Chang, Nanjing, Peoples R China.",xinhuang@nju.edu.cn; qiximeng@nju.edu.cn,,"Gao, Yang/0000-0001-6444-6544; Lai, Shiyi/0000-0003-0049-8155",,,,,80,0,0,0,0,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",0094-8276,1944-8007,,GEOPHYS RES LETT,Geophys.

The Arctic-boreal natural environments play a crucial role in the global climate via albedo change, carbon sources and sinks as well as atmospheric aerosol production from biogenic volatile organic compounds. Furthermore, it is expected that global trade activities, demographic movement, and use of natural resources will be increasing in the Arctic regions. There is a need for a novel research approach, which not only identifies and tackles the relevant multi-disciplinary research questions, but also is able to make a holistic system analysis of the expected feedbacks. In this paper, we introduce the research agenda of the Pan-Eurasian Experiment (PEEX), a multi-scale, multi-disciplinary and international program started in 2012 (https://www.atm.helsinki.fi/peex/). PEEX sets a research approach by which large-scale research topics are investigated from a system perspective and which aims to fill the key gaps in our understanding of the feedbacks and interactions between the land-atmosphereaquatic-society continuum in the northern Eurasian region. We introduce here the state of the art for the key topics in the PEEX research agenda and present the future prospects of the research, which we see relevant in this context.","[Lappalainen, Hanna K.; Kerminen, Veli-Matti; Petaja, Tuukka; Alekseychik, Pavel; Jarvi, Leena; Jarvinen, Heikki; Kieloaho, Antti-Jussi; Kujansuu, Joni; Duplissy, Ella-Maria; Mazon, Stephany; Moisseev, Dmitri; Pihlatie, Mari; Sipila, Mikko; Vesala, Timo; Zilitinkevich, Sergej; Kulmala, Markku] Univ Helsinki, Dept Phys, Helsinki 00014, Finland; [Lappalainen, Hanna K.; Vihma, Timo; Asmi, Eija; Laaksonen, Ari; Laurila, Tuomas; Lihavainen, Heikki; Viisanen, Yrjo; Zilitinkevich, Sergej] Finnish Meteorol Inst, Res & Dev, Helsinki 00101, Finland; [Kurten, Theo] Univ Helsinki, Dept Chem, Helsinki 00014, Finland; [Baklanov, Aleksander] World Meteorol Org, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; [Baklanov, Aleksander; Mahura, Alexsander] Danish Meteorol Inst, Res & Dev Dept, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Shvidenko, Anatoly] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Ecosyst Serv & Management, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria; [Back, Jaana; Ojala, Anne; Hari, Pertti] Univ Helsinki, Dept Forest Sci, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Andreae, Meinrat O.; Cheng, Yafang; Su, Hang] Max Planck Inst Chem, Biogeochem Dept, D-55020 Mainz, Germany; [Andreae, Meinrat O.; Cheng, Yafang; Su, Hang] Max Planck Inst Chem, Multiphase Chem Dept, D-55020 Mainz, Germany; [Arnold, Stephen R.; Spracklen, Dominick V.] Univ Leeds, Inst Climate & Atmospher Sci, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Arshinov, Mikhail; Belan, Boris; Matvienko, Gennady G.] Russian Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Opt, Tomsk 634021, Russia; [Bobylev, Leonid] Nansen Int Environm & Remote Sensing Ctr, St Petersburg, Russia; [Chalov, Sergey; Chubarova, Natalia; de Leeuw, Gerrit; Dobrolyubov, Sergey; Konstantinov, Pavel; Kasimov, Nikolai S.; Zilitinkevich, Sergej] Lomonosov Moscow State Univ, Fac Geog, Moscow 119899, Russia; [Ding, Aijun; Fu, Congbin] Nanjing Univ, Inst Climate & Global Change Res, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Ding, Aijun; Fu, Congbin] Nanjing Univ, Sch Atmospher Sci, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Dubtsov, Sergei] Russian Acad Sci, Inst Chem Kinet & Combust, Novosibirsk 630090, Russia; [Dyukarev, Egor] RAS, SB, Inst Monitoring Climat & Ecol Syst, Tomsk 634055, Russia; [Elansky, Nikolai; Repina, Irina; Skorokhod, Andrey] Russian Acad Sci, AM Obukhov Inst Atmospher Phys, Moscow, Russia; [Eleftheriadis, Kostas] Natl Ctr Sci Res DEMOKRITOS, Athens, Greece; [Esau, Igor] Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, Nansen Environm & Remote Sensing Ctr, N-5006 Bergen, Norway; [Filatov, Nikolay; Regerand, Tatjana; Subetto, Dmitry A.; Terzhevik, Arkady Y.] Russian Acad Sci, Karelian Res Ctr, Northern Water Problems Inst, Petrozavodsk 185003, Russia; [Flint, Mikhail; Lisitzin, Alexander; Nigmatulin, Robert; Shevchenko, Vladimir] Russian Acad Sci, PP Shirshov Inst Oceanol, Moscow 117997, Russia; [Glezer, Olga] Russian Acad Sci, Inst Geog, Moscow, Russia; [Gliko, Aleksander; Zaytseva, Nina] Russian Acad Sci, Dept Earth Sci, Moscow 119991, Russia; [Heimann, Martin] Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, D-07745 Jena, Germany; [Holtslag, Albert A.

The abundance and often complex patterns of these missing values can be a barrier for combining different observational datasets and may cause biased estimates of derived statistics. To overcome this, missing values in geoscientific data are regularly infilled with estimates through univariate gap-filling techniques such as spatial or temporal interpolation or by upscaling approaches in which complete donor variables are used to infer missing values. However, these approaches typically do not account for information that may be present in other observed variables that also have missing values. Here we propose CLIMFILL (CLIMate data gapFILL), a multivariate gap-filling procedure that combines kriging interpolation with a statistical gap-filling method designed to account for the dependence across multiple gappy variables. In a first stage, an initial gap fill is constructed for each variable separately using state-of-the-art spatial interpolation. Subsequently, the initial gap fill for each variable is updated to recover the dependence across variables using an iterative procedure. Estimates for missing values are thus informed by knowledge of neighbouring observations, temporal processes, and dependent observations of other relevant variables. CLIMFILL is tested using gap-free ERA-5 reanalysis data of ground temperature, surface-layer soil moisture, precipitation, and terrestrial water storage to represent central interactions between soil moisture and climate. These variables were matched with corresponding remote sensing observations and masked where the observations have missing values. In this perfect dataset approach CLIMFILL can be evaluated against the original, usually not observed part of the data. We show that CLIMFILL successfully recovers the dependence structure among the variables across all land cover types and altitudes, thereby enabling subsequent mechanistic interpretations in the gap-filled dataset. Correlation between original ERA-5 data and gap-filled ERA-5 data is high in many regions, although it shows artefacts of the interpolation procedure in large gaps in high-latitude regions during winter. Bias and noise in gappy satellite-observable data is reduced in most regions. A case study of the European 2003 heatwave shows how CLIMFILL reduces biases in ground temperature and surface-layer soil moisture induced by the missing values. Furthermore, in idealized experiments we see the impact of fraction of missing values and the complexity of missing value patterns to the performance of CLIMFILL, showing that CLIMFILL for most variables operates at the upper limit of what is possible given the high fraction of missing values and the complexity of missingness patterns. Thus, the framework can be a tool for gap filling a large range of remote sensing observations commonly used in climate and environmental research.","[Bessenbacher, Verena; Seneviratne, Sonia Isabelle; Gudmundsson, Lukas] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, Ramistr 101, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Bessenbacher, V (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, Ramistr 101, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",verena.bessenbacher@env.ethz.ch,"Seneviratne, Sonia I./G-8761-2011; Gudmundsson, Lukas/I-9535-2014","Seneviratne, Sonia I./0000-0001-9528-2917; Bessenbacher, Verena/0000-0002-6012-5863; Gudmundsson, Lukas/0000-0003-3539-8621",Eidgenossische Technische Hochschule Zurich [ETH-08 19-1]; European Space Agency [4000126684/19/INB],Eidgenossische Technische Hochschule Zurich; European Space Agency(European Space AgencyEuropean Commission),This research has been supported by the Eidgenossische Technische Hochschule Zurich (grant no.

Sea surface height variability along the western boundary of the North Atlantic shows a particularly strong and coherent signal. Similar variability is also found in an ensemble of runs using a state-of-the-art climate model (GFDL CM2.1). This sea surface height variability is linked to variability of temperatures in the upper layers of the ocean and thence to the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation. The variability is consistent with the excited internal ocean mode mechanism of multidecadal variability derived from idealised models and the timescale is consistent with that derived from observations of sub-surface temperature variability.

This article connects McGrath's body of work to what I call cogency theory, an approach that rejects the thinking/feeling binary itself. It begins with a survey of how McGrath understands rationality-not only as multiple, but as defined, in meaningful ways, by feeling. This is illustrated by reexamining McGrath's controversy with Richard Dawkins, analyzing their debate in terms of how the argument itself comes to feel. This new paradigm allows us to supersede petty antagonisms built into contemporary culture-like the presumed science-religion conflict-and refocus on overarching concerns like the climate crisis. The article concludes with a question about the extent to which beliefs and worldviews define how we-either as groups or individuals-can make or unmake ecological disaster.","[Schaefer, Donovan O.] Univ Penn, Religious Studies, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Pennsylvania,"Schaefer, DO (corresponding author), Univ Penn, Religious Studies, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",doschaef@upenn.edu,,"Schaefer, Donovan/0000-0002-2385-1946",,,,,55,0,0,0,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0591-2385,1467-9744,,ZYGON,Zygon,MAR,2022,1,,,,200,222,,10.1111/zygo.12766,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/zygo.12766,,22-Jan,23,Social Issues; Religion,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;HCI),Social Issues; Religion,ZP1NB,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000741471400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Presently, making tall buildings is considered as a necessary requirement due to the succeeding reasons: the population increase, the tendency to live in urban centers, the land utilization in the most populated centers of the cities, the need to decrease the cost of horizontal development of cities and technological advances. During the last century, issues related to environmental pollution and high energy use have affected these tall buildings. So, it is crucial to apply appropriate methods and patterns in order to adjust their environmental impacts as much as possible. In addition, the building industry accounts for a significant amount of energy consumption in the world. Therefore, energy-saving and efficiency can be mentioned as a significant issue due to the limitation of fossil resources. The importance of this issue has been increased by eliminating subsidies and realizing the price of fuels in Iran. Efforts in the field of high-rise buildings in Iran are chiefly based on general criteria regarding the location and characteristics of urban imagery and the field of urban design knowledge. The efforts contributed to the energy consumption have not been carried out. The present study provides patterns for the aim of designing high-rise buildings with official use in Tabriz and Yazd. The solutions for the opening design of tall buildings with regular forms to reduce energy consumption are proposed in this study.","[Ghiai, Mohammad Mehdi] Islamic Azad Univ, Yadegar E Imam Khomeini RAH Shahre Rey Branch, Tehran, Iran; [Arjmand, Jamal Tabe] Univ Art, Fac Architecture & Urban Planning, Tehran, Iran; [Mohammadi, Omid] Sharif Univ Technol, Fac Mech Engn, Tehran, Iran; [Ahmadi, Mohammad Hossein] Shahrood Univ Technol, Fac Mech Engn, Shahrood, Iran; [Assad, Mamdouh El Haj] Univ Sharjah, Sustainable & Renewable Energy Engn Dept, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates",Islamic Azad University; Sharif University of Technology; Shahrood University of Technology; University of Sharjah,"Ahmadi, MH (corresponding author), Shahrood Univ Technol, Fac Mech Engn, Shahrood, Iran.",mohammadho-sein.ahmadi@gmail.com,"Ghiai, Mohammad Mehdi/L-8517-2016; Ahmadi, Mohammad H/ABF-2759-2020","Ghiai, Mohammad Mehdi/0000-0003-0826-6957; Ahmadi, Mohammad H/0000-0002-0097-2534; El Haj Assad, Mamdouh/0000-0001-6311-7925",,,,,31,3,3,3,10,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1748-1317,1748-1325,,INT J LOW-CARBON TEC,Int.

The impacts of the sensitivities to precipitation variability and temperature variability on NPP, soil carbon, and vegetation carbon are discussed. It is shown that increasing precipitation variability, representing the frequency of extreme precipitation events, leads to losses in NPP, soil carbon, and vegetation carbon over most of China, especially in North and Northeast China where the dominant plant functional types (i.e., those with the largest simulated areal cover) are grass and boreal needle-leaved forest. The responses of NPP, soil carbon, and vegetation carbon to decreasing precipitation variability are opposite to the responses to increasing precipitation variability. The variations in NPP, soil carbon, and vegetation carbon in response to increasing and decreasing precipitation variability show a nonlinear asymmetry. Increasing precipitation variability results in notable interannual variation of NPP. The sensitivities of NPP, soil carbon, and vegetation carbon to temperature variability, whether negative or positive, meaning frequent hot and cold days, are slight. The present study suggests, based on the LPJ model, that precipitation variability has a more severe impact than temperature variability on NPP, soil carbon, and vegetation carbon.","[Sun Guo-Dong] Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Numer Modeling Atmospher Sci & Geop, Inst Atmospher Phys, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS","Sun, GD (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Numer Modeling Atmospher Sci & Geop, Inst Atmospher Phys, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.",sungd@mail.iap.ac.cn,"Sun, Guodong/AAK-3355-2020",,National Basic Research Program of China [2012CB955202]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41375111]; LASG Free Exploration Fund; LASG State Key Laboratory Special Fund,National Basic Research Program of China(National Basic Research Program of China); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); LASG Free Exploration Fund; LASG State Key Laboratory Special Fund,"The authors thank the reviewers for their valuable suggestions.

In this article, the extensive literature on the routes of fluoride exposure, geographic regions with excess fluoride in water sources and various defluoridation techniques has been reviewed. It appears that important economic regions on all continents are affected by unsafe fluoride levels in fresh waters that are current or potential sources for drinking water supply. The widely accepted limit for fluoride in drinking water is 1.5 mg/L, though higher levels are also permitted, especially in low income, water scarce countries. We have discussed fluoride mobilization mechanisms in groundwater and soil environments which could be helpful in assessing the potential (long-term) potability of water from certain wells. Finally it is evident from the literature survey that no single fluoride removal technique fits for diverse technical and socioeconomic situations and there is a pressing need to develop suitable defluoridation techniques for household and community level water supply systems in order to prevent fluorosis.","[Kimambo, Vivian; Bhattacharya, Prosun; Ahmad, Arslan] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Dept Sustainable Dev Environm Sci & Engn, KTH Groundwater Arsen Res Grp, Teknikringen 10B, SE-10044 Stockholm, Sweden; [Kimambo, Vivian; Mtalo, Felix; Mtamba, Joseph] Univ Dar Es Salaam, Dept Water Resources Engn, DAFWAT Res Grp, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania; [Kimambo, Vivian] Univ Dodoma, Dept Chem, Dodoma, Tanzania; [Bhattacharya, Prosun] Univ Southern Queensland, Fac Hlth Engn & Sci, Sch Civil Engn & Surveying, Toowoomba, Qld 4350, Australia; [Bhattacharya, Prosun] Univ Southern Queensland, Fac Hlth Engn & Sci, Int Ctr Appl Climate Sci, Toowoomba, Qld 4350, Australia; [Ahmad, Arslan] KWR Water Cycle Res Inst, Groningenhaven 7, NL-3433 PE Nieuwegein, Netherlands",Royal Institute of Technology; University of Dar es Salaam; University of Southern Queensland; University of Southern Queensland; KWR Watercycle Research Institute,"Kimambo, V (corresponding author), KTH Royal Inst Technol, Dept Sustainable Dev Environm Sci & Engn, KTH Groundwater Arsen Res Grp, Teknikringen 10B, SE-10044 Stockholm, Sweden.",kimambo@kth.se,,,Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) [51170072],Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida),"This work was supported by Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) [Contribution number 51170072, 2015-2020].",,248,97,97,10,19,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2352-801X,,,GROUNDWATER SUST DEV,Groundwater Sustain.

Hence, there is a need to model dynamic interactions and feedbacks between the terrestrial biosphere and the water cycle. Here, the hydrological performance of the Lund-Potsdam-Jena model (LPJ), a prominent dynamic global vegetation model, is evaluated. Models of this type simulate the coupled terrestrial carbon and water cycle, thus they are well suited for investigating biosphere-hydrosphere interactions over large domains. We demonstrate that runoff and evapotranspiration computed by LPJ agree well with respective results from state-of-the-art global hydrological models, while in some regions, runoff is significantly over- or underestimated compared to observations. The direction and magnitude of these biases is largely similar to those from other macro-scale models, rather than specific to LPJ. They are attributable primarily to uncertainties in the climate input data, and to human interventions not considered by the model (e.g. water withdrawal, land cover conversions). Additional model development is required to perform integrated assessments of water exchanges among the biosphere, the hydrosphere, and the anthroposphere. Yet, the LPJ model can now be used to study inter-relations between the world's major vegetation types and the terrestrial water balance. As an example, it is shown that a doubling of atmospheric CO2 content alone would result in pronounced changes in evapotranspiration and runoff for many parts of the world. Although significant, these changes would remain unseen by stand-alone hydrological models, thereby emphasizing the importance of simulating the coupled carbon and water cycle. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

However, observation-based estimates of the global strength of this circulation are difficult to obtain. Here we present two calculations of the mean strength of the meridional overturning of the stratosphere. We analyse satellite data that document the global diabatic circulation between 2007-2011, and compare these to three reanalysis data sets and to simulations with a state-of-the-art chemistry-climate model. Using measurements of sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) and nitrous oxide, we calculate the global mean diabatic overturning mass flux throughout the stratosphere. In the lower stratosphere, these two estimates agree, and at a potential temperature level of 460 K (about 20 km or 60 hPa in tropics) the global circulation strength is 6.3-7.6 x 10(9) kg s(-1). Higher in the atmosphere, only the SF6-based estimate is available, and it diverges from the reanalysis data and simulations. Interpretation of the SF6-data-based estimate is limited because of a mesospheric sink of SF6; however, the reanalyses also differ substantially from each other. We conclude that the uncertainty in the mean meridional overturning circulation strength at upper levels of the stratosphere amounts to at least 100%.","[Linz, Marianna] MIT, Massachusetts Inst Technol Woods Hole Oceanog Joi, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Plumb, R.

A set of experiments performed with a state-of-the-art coupled general circulation model forced with increased atmospheric CO2 concentration (2, 4 and 16 times the present-day mean value) were analyzed and compared with a control experiment to evaluate the effect of increased CO2 levels on monsoons. Generally, the monsoon precipitation responses to CO2 forcing are largest if extreme concentrations of carbon dioxide are used, but they are not necessarly proportional to the forcing applied. In fact, despite a common response in terms of an atmospheric water vapor increase to the atmospheric warming, two out of the six monsoons studied simulate less or equal summer mean precipitation in the 16xCO(2) experiment compared to the intermediate sensitivity experiments. The precipitation differences between CO2 sensitivity experiments and CTRL have been investigated specifying the contribution of thermodynamic and purely dynamic processes. As a general rule, the differences depending on the atmospheric moisture content changes (thermodynamic component) are large and positive, and they tend to be damped by the dynamic component associated with the changes in the vertical velocity. However, differences are observed among monsoons in terms of the role played by other terms (like moisture advection and evaporation) in shaping the precipitation changes in warmer climates. The precipitation increase, even if weak, occurs despite a weakening of the mean circulation in the monsoon regions (precipitation-wind paradox). In particular, the tropical east-west Walker circulation is reduced, as found from velocity potential analysis. The meridional component of the monsoon circulation is changed as well, with larger (smaller) meridional (vertical) scales.","[Cherchi, Annalisa; Alessandri, Andrea; Masina, Simona; Navarra, Antonio] Ctr Euromediterraneo Cambiamenti Climat, Bologna, Italy; [Cherchi, Annalisa; Masina, Simona; Navarra, Antonio] Ist Nazl Geofis & Vulcanol, Bologna, Italy",Istituto Nazionale Geofisica e Vulcanologia (INGV),"Cherchi, A (corresponding author), Ctr Euromediterraneo Cambiamenti Climat, Bologna, Italy.",cherchi@bo.ingv.it,"Cherchi, Annalisa/Y-6684-2019; Alessandri, Andrea/I-9077-2014; Masina, Simona/B-4974-2012","Cherchi, Annalisa/0000-0002-0178-9264; Alessandri, Andrea/0000-0002-2153-7961; MASINA, Simona/0000-0001-6273-7065",,,,,50,79,80,1,28,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0930-7575,1432-0894,,CLIM DYNAM,Clim.

The distinct isotopic compositions of marine and terrestrial N2O sources can help disentangle the relative changes in marine and terrestrial N2O emissions during past climate variations(4,9,10). Here we present N2O concentration and isotopic data for the last deglaciation, from 16,000 to 10,000 years before present, retrieved from air bubbles trapped in polar ice at Taylor Glacier, Antarctica. With the help of our data and a box model of the N2O cycle, we find a 30 per cent increase in total N2O emissions from the late glacial to the interglacial, with terrestrial and marine emissions contributing equally to the overall increase and generally evolving in parallel over the last deglaciation, even though there is no a priori connection between the drivers of the two sources. However, we find that terrestrial emissions dominated on centennial timescales, consistent with a state-of-the-art dynamic global vegetation and land surface process model that suggests that during the last deglaciation emission changes were strongly influenced by temperature and precipitation patterns over land surfaces. The results improve our understanding of the drivers of natural N2O emissions and are consistent with the idea that natural N2O emissions will probably increase in response to anthropogenic warming(11).","[Schilt, Adrian; Brook, Edward J.; Bauska, Thomas K.] Oregon State Univ, Coll Earth Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Schilt, Adrian; Fischer, Hubertus; Joos, Fortunat; Schmitt, Jochen; Spahni, Renato; Stocker, Thomas F.] Univ Bern, Inst Phys, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Schilt, Adrian; Fischer, Hubertus; Joos, Fortunat; Schmitt, Jochen; Spahni, Renato; Stocker, Thomas F.] Univ Bern, Oeschger Ctr Climate Change Res, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Baggenstos, Daniel; Severinghaus, Jeffrey P.] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Petrenko, Vasilii V.] Univ Rochester, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Rochester, NY 14627 USA; [Schaefer, Hinrich] Natl Inst Water & Atmospher Res, Wellington 6021, New Zealand",Oregon State University; University of Bern; University of Bern; University of California System; University of California San Diego; Scripps Institution of Oceanography; University of Rochester; National Institute of Water & Atmospheric Research (NIWA) - New Zealand,"Schilt, A (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Coll Earth Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",adrian.schilt@gmail.com,"Joos, Fortunat/B-4118-2018; Schmitt, Jochen/B-7893-2009; Fischer, Hubertus/A-1211-2014; Brook, Edward/AAB-7807-2021; Baggenstos, Daniel/AAK-5751-2021","Joos, Fortunat/0000-0002-9483-6030; Schmitt, Jochen/0000-0003-4695-3029; Fischer, Hubertus/0000-0002-2787-4221; Baggenstos, Daniel/0000-0001-9756-6884; Petrenko, Vasilii/0000-0002-0263-8759; Schilt, Adrian/0000-0001-6312-7947; Bauska, Thomas/0000-0003-1901-0367; Schaefer, Hinrich/0000-0002-1163-2818","Swiss National Science Foundation (NSF); US NSF; Swiss NSF [139404]; US NSF [PLR08-38936, PLR08-39031]; Marsden Fund Council from New Zealand Government; US Department of Energy; National Center for Atmospheric Research Supercomputing Facility",Swiss National Science Foundation (NSF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); US NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Swiss NSF(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); US NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Marsden Fund Council from New Zealand Government(Royal Society of New ZealandMarsden Fund (NZ)); US Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); National Center for Atmospheric Research Supercomputing Facility,"Financial support was provided by the Swiss National Science Foundation (NSF) and the US NSF, including a Swiss NSF Fellowship for Prospective Researchers (139404) to A.S., US NSF Grant PLR08-38936 to E.J.B. and US NSF Grant PLR08-39031 to J.P.S.

This algorithm, over land, gives more accurate precipitation estimates than are obtained using the cloud-top temperature alone (i.e., GPI) and is as accurate as the state-of-the art multisatellite algorithm (MS) from GPCP. Over coastal and oceanic regions, this algorithm has a smaller bias in precipitation estimation than GPI but has the same correlation coefficient with gauge data as GPI. Compared with MS, it has a much smaller bias but larger mean absolute deviation. Evaluation using the Pacific atoll-island gauge data also shows that this algorithm can reproduce well the observed meridional distribution of precipitation across the ITCZ and SPCZ near the date line. This algorithm is then used to produce a five-year (January 1988-December 1992) 2.5 degrees X 2.5 degrees integrated dataset of precipitation and precipitable water between 40 degrees N and 40 degrees S for climate model evaluation. The small bias of this algorithm (particularly over ocean) also suggests that it would be a good data source for precipitation merging algorithms.","Univ Arizona, Dept Atmospher Sci, Inst Atmospher Sci, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA",University of Arizona,"Zeng, XB (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Dept Atmospher Sci, Inst Atmospher Sci, PAS Bldg, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",,,"Zeng, Xubin/0000-0001-7352-2764",,,,,22,27,27,0,7,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0894-8755,,,J CLIMATE,J.

Producing advanced fuels (such as biomethane) and bio-based valorised products (such as pyrochar) may offer a solution to significantly reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with energy and agricultural circular economy systems. Biological and thermochemical bioenergy technologies, together with power to gas (P2G) systems can generate green renewable gas, which is essential to reduce the GHG footprint of industry. However, each technology faces challenges with respect to sustainability and conversion efficiency. Here this study identifies an optimal pathway, leading to a sustainable bioenergy system where the carbon released in the fuel is offset by the GHG savings of the circular bio-based system. It provides a state-of-the-art review of individual technologies and proposes a bespoke circular cascading bio-based system with anaerobic digestion as the key platform, integrating electro-fuels via P2G systems and value-added pyrochar via pyrolysis of solid digestate. The mass and energy analysis suggests that a reduction of 11% in digestate mass flow with the production of pyrochar, bio-oil and syngas and an increase of 70% in biomethane production with the utilization of curtailed or constrained electricity can be achieved in the proposed bio-based system, enabling a 70% increase in net energy output as compared with a conventional biomethane system. However, the carbon footprint of the electricity from which the hydrogen is sourced is shown to be a critical parameter in assessing the GHG balance of the bespoke system.","[Wu, Benteng; Lin, Richen; O'Shea, Richard; Deng, Chen; Murphy, Jerry D.] Univ Coll Cork, Environm Res Inst, MaREI Ctr, Cork, Ireland; [Wu, Benteng; Lin, Richen; O'Shea, Richard; Deng, Chen; Murphy, Jerry D.] Univ Coll Cork, Sch Engn, Cork, Ireland; [Rajendran, Karthik] SRM Univ AP, Dept Environm Sci, Amaravati 522502, Andhra Pradesh, India",University College Cork; University College Cork; SRM University-AP,"Lin, RC (corresponding author), Univ Coll Cork, Environm Res Inst, MaREI Ctr, Cork, Ireland.",richen.lin@ucc.ie,"Murphy, Jerry D/ABH-3038-2020; Rajendran, Karthik/F-2446-2012","Murphy, Jerry D/0000-0003-2120-1357; O'Shea, Richard/0000-0003-0638-4001; Wu, Benteng/0000-0002-3856-6355; Rajendran, Karthik/0000-0002-3638-4347","Ireland Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Research Programme 2014-2020 [2018-RE-MS-13]; European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant [797259]; Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) through MaREI Centre for Energy, Climate and Marine [12/RC/2302_P2, 16/SP/3829]; IDL Pernod Ricard through MaREI centre; Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","Ireland Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Research Programme 2014-2020; European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant; Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) through MaREI Centre for Energy, Climate and Marine(Science Foundation Ireland); IDL Pernod Ricard through MaREI centre; Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","This work is funded under the Ireland Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Research Programme 2014-2020 (No. 2018-RE-MS-13), European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant (No. 797259), and Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) through the MaREI Centre for Energy, Climate and Marine under grant No. 12/RC/2302_P2 and 16/SP/3829.

This work first introduces FY-3C GNOS into tropopause research and gives the error evaluation results of long-term FY-3C atmosphere profiles. We compare FY-3C results with Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere and Climate (COSMIC) and radiosonde results and also present the FY-3C global seasonal tropopause patterns.

Also, the correlation coefficients between FY-3C GNOS tropopause parameters and each radiosonde counterpart are generally larger than 0.9 and the corresponding regression coefficients are close to 1.

However, large spatial scale estimates of their climate effects are mostly based on snapshots from low orbit satellites that may bias the mean estimate for daily, monthly, or annual timescales. In this study, an attempt is made to estimate the magnitude of such bias based on ground and satellite-based datasets. Using ground-based measurements, we show an apparent asymmetry (of the order of 10-50%) in the sub-daily variability of aerosol loading over the Indian region. For the first time, it is reported that this sub-daily variability has a spatial pattern with an increasing amplitude toward the east of the subcontinent. We also find this variability in aerosol loading is well-captured by the satellites but with a lower amplitude. Our study shows that such differences could alter the annual surface radiative forcing estimates by more than similar to 15 W m(-2) over this region. We find that NASA's Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications version 2 (MERRA-2), a state-of-the-art model-based chemical reanalysis, is unable to capture these sub-daily variabilities. This implies that both model and satellite-based radiative forcing estimates for large spatial scales should improve aerosol sub-daily information/variabilities for obtaining reliable radiative forcing estimates.","[Mukherjee, T.; Vinoj, V.] Indian Inst Technol Bhubaneswar, Sch Earth Ocean & Climate Sci, Bhubaneswar, India",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology Bhubaneswar,"Vinoj, V (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol Bhubaneswar, Sch Earth Ocean & Climate Sci, Bhubaneswar, India.",vinoj@iitbbs.ac.in,"Vinoj, V./C-3241-2008","Vinoj, V./0000-0001-8573-6073",Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO),Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO),"The authors acknowledge the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) for supporting this work through its Aerosol Radiative Forcing over India (ARFI) Project.

This study aims to explore how China addresses such challenges in the attainment of this more stringent warming-limit goal through sustainable transition. By using multi-model analysis, the robustness of findings is enhanced, while providing appropriate options based on model comparisons. The 1.5 degrees C limit means further reduction of emissions-up to 22%-and a ten-year earlier peak. From 2 degrees C to 1.5 degrees C, primary energy consumption will decrease by 22% to 28%, while policy costs will further increase by up to 37%. Greater technological progress facilitates larger contributions to CO2 emission reductions, given the shift from 2 degrees C to 1.5 degrees C. With diminishing marginal policy costs, the energy system can be reconstructed by initiating early actions on low-carbon and negative-emission technology development, and in the long term by coordinating state-of-the-art alternative technologies. This study provides reliable assessments of goal-strengthened achievements for China, including emission reductions, technology development, structural improvement, and economic performance for China. Furthermore, this study's multi-model comparisons show underlying implications for sustainable transition, which could also be conducive to the global practice of addressing climate change.","[Zheng, Jiali] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Management, Xian 710049, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Jiali; Duan, Hongbo; Wang, Shouyang] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Jiali; Wang, Shouyang] Chinese Acad Sci, Acad Math & Syst Sci, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Sheng] Tsinghua Univ, Inst Energy Environm & Econ, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Gao, Ji; Gao, Shuo] Environm Def Fund, Beijing 100007, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Kejun] Natl Dev & Reform Commiss, Energy Res Inst, Beijing 100038, Peoples R China","Xi'an Jiaotong University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Academy of Mathematics & System Sciences, CAS; Tsinghua University; Environmental Defense Fund","Duan, HB (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China.",hbduan@ucas.ac.cn,"zhou, sheng/GYJ-6012-2022","Duan, Hongbo/0000-0001-5143-4413; Gao, Shuo/0000-0002-1571-6429","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71874177, 72022019, 71874096, 71988101]; Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi [2021JQ-064]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2020YFA0608603]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi(Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province); National Key Research and Development Program of China,"This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71874177; 72022019; 71874096; 71988101), the Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi (2021JQ-064), and the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2020YFA0608603).

The numbers of installed ground source heat pump (GSHP) systems, for example, is continuously increasing worldwide. The objective of the current study is not only to discuss the net energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions or savings by GHP operation, but also to fully examine environmental burdens and benefits related to applications of such shallow geothermal systems by employing a state-of the-art life cycle assessment (LCA). The latter enables us to assess the entire energy flows and resources use for any product or service that is involved in the life cycle of such a technology. The applied life cycle impact assessment methodology (ReCiPe 2008) shows the relative contributions of resources depletion (34%), human health (43%) and ecosystem quality (23%) of such GSHP systems to the overall environmental damage. Climate change, as one impact category among 18 others, contributes 55.4% to the total environmental impacts. The life cycle impact assessment also demonstrates that the supplied electricity for the operation of the heat pump is the primary contributor to the environmental impact of GSHP systems, followed by the heat pump refrigerant, production of the heat pump, transport, heat carrier liquid, borehole and borehole heat exchanger (BHE). GHG emissions related to the use of such GSHP systems are carefully reviewed; an average of 63 t CO2 equivalent emissions is calculated for a life cycle of 20 years using the Continental European electricity mix with 0.599 kg CO2 eq/kWh. However, resulting CO2 eq savings for Europe, which are between -31% and 88% in comparison to conventional heating systems such as oil fired boilers and gas furnaces, largely depend on the primary resource of the supplied electricity for the heat pump, the climatic conditions and the inclusion of passive cooling capabilities. Factors such as degradation of coefficient of performance, as well as total leakage of the heat carrier fluid into the soil and aquifer are also carefully assessed, but show only minor environmental impacts.

Here we establish complementary estimates for the global mean energy budget specifically under cloud-free conditions. The energy fluxes under cloud-free conditions at the Top of Atmosphere (TOA) can be determined with high accuracy from satellite measurements (CERES-EBAF). For the estimation of their counterparts at the Earth's surface we follow the approach presented in our recent studies, based on an analysis of 39 state of the art global climate models from CMIP5 and their bias structure compared to a comprehensive set of high quality surface observations from the Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN). Thereby we infer a best estimate of 249 Wm(-2) for the global mean clear-sky downward shortwave radiation at the surface, and a corresponding clear-sky surface shortwave absorption of 216 Wm(-2), considering a global mean surface albedo of 13 %. Combined with a best estimate for the global mean net shortwave influx at the TOA under cloud-free skies from CERES-EBAF of 287 Wm(-2), this leaves an amount of 71 Wm(-2) absorbed shortwave radiation in the cloud-free atmosphere. The 71 Wm(-2) coincide with our earlier estimate for this quantity in Wild et al. (2006)(3) based on older models and fewer direct observations, suggesting that this estimate is fairly robust. For the clear-sky downward longwave radiation at the Earth surface we obtain a best estimate of 314 Wm(-2). A comparison of the clear-sky global energy balance diagram presented here with the corresponding all-sky diagram established in our previous studies enables a quantification of the global mean shortwave, longwave and net cloud-radiative effects at the TOA, within the atmosphere and at the surface, as well as an assessment of their representation in climate models.","[Wild, Martin; Hakuba, Maria Z.; Folini, Doris; Schar, Christoph] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Long, Charles] NOAA, ESRL, GMD, CIRES, Boulder, CO 80305 USA",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Wild, M (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",martin.wild@env.ethz.ch,"Hakuba, Maria/GLR-1621-2022; Schar, Christoph/A-1033-2008; Hakuba, Maria/AAM-7435-2021; Wild, Martin/J-8977-2012","Hakuba, Maria/0000-0001-9895-4053; Schar, Christoph/0000-0002-4171-1613; ",,,,,8,2,2,0,14,AMER INST PHYSICS,MELVILLE,"2 HUNTINGTON QUADRANGLE, STE 1NO1, MELVILLE, NY 11747-4501 USA",0094-243X,,978-0-7354-1478-5,AIP CONF PROC,,,2017,,,,,,,90012,10.1063/1.4975552,http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4975552,,,4,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,BI0WL,,Bronze,,,12/21/22,WOS:000405218500056,View Full Record in Web of Science

Therefore, correction of model forecast results is required. Analog correction is an effective way to reduce model forecast errors, but the key question is how to locate analogs. In this paper, we updated the local dynamical analog (LDA) algorithm to find analogs and depicted the process of model error correction as the LDA correction scheme. The LDA correction scheme was first applied to correct the operational seasonal forecasts of sea surface temperature (SST) over the period 1982-2018 from the state-of-the-art coupled climate model named NCEP Climate Forecast System, version 2. The results demonstrated that the LDA correction scheme improves forecast skill in many regions as measured by the correlation coefficient and root-mean-square error, especially over the extratropical eastern Pacific and tropical Pacific, where the model has high simulation ability. El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) as the focused physics process is also improved. The seasonal predictability barrier of ENSO is in remission, and the forecast skill of central Pacific ENSO also increases due to the LDA correction method. The intensity of the ENSO mature phases is improved. Meanwhile, the ensemble forecast results are corrected, which proves the positive influence from this LDA correction scheme on the probability forecast of cold and warm events. Overall, the LDA correction scheme, combining statistical and model dynamical information, is demonstrated to be readily integrable with other advanced operational models and has the capability to improve forecast results.","[Hou, Zhaolu; Li, Jianping; Zuo, Bin] Ocean Univ China, Frontiers Sci Ctr Deep Ocean Multispheres & Earth, Coll Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Inst Adv Ocean Studies,Key Lab Phys Oceanog, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Li, Jianping] Pilot Qingdao Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol, Lab Ocean Dynam & Climate, Qingdao, Peoples R China",Ocean University of China; Qingdao National Laboratory for Marine Science & Technology,"Li, JP (corresponding author), Ocean Univ China, Frontiers Sci Ctr Deep Ocean Multispheres & Earth, Coll Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Inst Adv Ocean Studies,Key Lab Phys Oceanog, Qingdao, Peoples R China.;Li, JP (corresponding author), Pilot Qingdao Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol, Lab Ocean Dynam & Climate, Qingdao, Peoples R China.",ljp@ouc.edu.cn,"Li, Jianping/I-2661-2012","Li, Jianping/0000-0003-0625-1575; Hou, Zhaolu/0000-0002-2112-7743","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [42005049]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [201962009]; Shandong Natural Science Foundation Project [ZR2019ZD12, ZR2020QD056]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2020M680094]; Center for High Performance Computing and System Simulation, Qingdao Pilot National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Shandong Natural Science Foundation Project; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); Center for High Performance Computing and System Simulation, Qingdao Pilot National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology","This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) Project (42005049) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (201962009), Shandong Natural Science Foundation Project (ZR2019ZD12, ZR2020QD056), and China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2020M680094).

Since the facade considerably contributes to heating and cooling in buildings, facade retrofit is presumed as an effective solution to minimize cooling and heating demand in existing buildings. In-depth scrutiny in facade retrofit actions reveals different Facade Retrofit Measures (FRMs) that aim to minimize cooling and heating demand in existing buildings. They include Energy Conservation Measures (ECMs), which prevent excessive heat transmittance, and Energy Modulation Measures (EMMs), which modulate energy consumption through passive heating and cooling strategies. A Combination of Measures (CoMs) is also the state-of-the-art in the face of retrofit actions. In this paper, a further analysis elaborates on the effectiveness of each measure in Cooling-Dominated (CD) and Heating-Dominated (HD) climates. This analysis showed that facade retrofit could reduce energy consumption for heating and cooling by up to 50% through architectural interventions. The study findings also revealed that ECMs effectively minimize energy consumption in a heating-dominated climate by lowering conductive and convective heat transfer. However, EMMs are more crucial in reducing energy consumption in a cooling-dominated climate by controlling radiative heat transfer.","[Sarihi, Soad; Saradj, Fatemeh Mehdizadeh; Faizi, Mohsen] Iran Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Architecture, Narmak St, Tehran 1684613114, Iran",Iran University Science & Technology,"Saradj, FM (corresponding author), Iran Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Architecture, Narmak St, Tehran 1684613114, Iran.",s_sarihi@arch.iust.ac.ir; mehdizadeh@iust.ac.ir; mfaizi@iust.ac.ir,"sarihi, soad/AAC-8269-2022; Faizi, Mohsen/AAU-3097-2021; Sarihi, Soad/AAC-8276-2022; Mehdizadeh Saradj, Fatemeh/S-8979-2018","Faizi, Mohsen/0000-0003-1022-0990; Sarihi, Soad/0000-0003-4455-7962; Mehdizadeh Saradj, Fatemeh/0000-0001-6103-5504",,,,,79,23,23,6,36,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2210-6707,2210-6715,,SUSTAIN CITIES SOC,Sust.

The fidelity of current-generation global chemistry-climate models (CCMs) in representing observed variations and extremes of troposphere ozone is an important aspect of model abilities to predict ozone but has not been comprehensively assessed. Here we evaluate multiple state-of-the-art CCMs participating in the Chemistry Climate Model Initiative phase 1 (CCMI-1) in simulating the interannual variability (IAV), decadal trends, and extremes of surface ozone during 1990-2010 at northern mid-latitudes. We find that current CCMs tend to underestimate observed ozone IAV over the U.S., Europe, and East Asia in both spring and summer and fail to capture the springtime ozone trends in the eastern U.S. (EUS) and Europe. Specified-dynamics simulations constrained by reanalysis data outperform the free-running simulations with CCMs in terms of IAV and decadal trends of surface ozone. Observations show large surface ozone IAV in summer over the EUS, Europe, and East Asia (standard deviation = 3-6 ppbv or relative standard deviation = 8-15%) while all models substantially underestimate observed IAV by a factor of 2-3. Analysis in these populous/polluted regions unveils that the models significantly underestimate ozone extreme anomalies during heatwaves/droughts by 2-9 ppbv (17-55%) over the EUS and by 7-10 ppbv (42-59%) over Europe during the past two decades. These underestimates in summertime extreme anomalies contribute to the model biases in surface ozone IAV. Future model developments are needed to improve the ability of current CCMs to predict ozone extremes during heatwaves and droughts.","[Zhang, Li] Penn State Univ, Dept Meteorol & Atmospher Sci, College Pk, MD USA; [Cui, Yu Yan] Calif Air Resources Board, Sacramento, CA 95814 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University,"Zhang, L (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Dept Meteorol & Atmospher Sci, College Pk, MD USA.",alex.zhang@psu.edu,"ZHANG, LI/AFW-4721-2022","ZHANG, LI/0000-0003-0343-9476",,,,,93,1,1,4,7,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",1352-2310,1873-2844,,ATMOS ENVIRON,Atmos.

This paper challenges that assumption by arguing that the insurance industry has responded by spreading risk through scaled and networked recovery schemes. We found that because of competitive strategies of risk-spreading and displacement arrangements, the industry has actually profited as a whole. Regional insurance companies have always relied on the higher financial scales of the reinsurance industry in Munich, Zurich, and London. But with claims reaching into the billions of dollars, the reinsurance industry itself has raised premiums, spread risk farther afield, and jumped scale by spreading risk to futures markets called Alternative Risk Transfers (ARTs). However, the recession beginning in 2008 has called into question the viability of using futures markets as insurance. It is shown through a media analysis of four major business publications (The Economist, The New York Times, The Financial Times and The Wall Street journal) how the industry responded to the costs of the 2004, 2005, and 2006 hurricane seasons. Because geography is rather new to this literature, this paper also offers a broad review of the insurance industry. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper's unique contribution is to investigate the economic performance of water conservation infrastructure combined with dynamically optimized use of saved water. We develop a state-of-the arts empirical dynamic optimization model to discover land and water use patterns that optimize sustained farm Income. Results from the upper watershed irrigation region of the Canadian Basin in the southwestern US show that canal and delivery system lining can raise the sustained economic value of water for crop irrigation. The saved water can see immediate use in dry years. It can also be stored in wet years to mitigate the most adverse impacts of future climate water stress. This double dividend is especially important in rain-fed watersheds for which surface water supplies for irrigation are difficult to forecast accurately. Findings light a path for water managers and other stakeholders who bear responsibility of finding economically responsible measures to improve irrigation water productivity in the world's dry regions.","[Habteyes, Befekadu Goraw] Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Ward, Frank A.] New Mexico State Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Agr Business, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; New Mexico State University,"Ward, FA (corresponding author), New Mexico State Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Agr Business, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA.",habteyesbg@gmail.com; fward@nmsu.edu,,,New Mexico Agricultural Experiment Station and New Mexico Water Resources Research Institute,New Mexico Agricultural Experiment Station and New Mexico Water Resources Research Institute,The authors acknowledge financial support from the New Mexico Agricultural Experiment Station and New Mexico Water Resources Research Institute.,,81,12,12,4,32,ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,LONDON,"24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON NW1 7DX, ENGLAND",0301-4797,1095-8630,,J ENVIRON MANAGE,J.

The southern region is located in the Far East monsoon sector, while the northern parts are affected by the Arctic Ocean and cold air masses penetrating far to the south. Growing economic activities and traffic connected to the China Belt and Road Initiative together with climate change are placing an increased pressure upon the Russian Far East environment. There is an urgent need to improve the capacity to measure the atmospheric and environmental pollution and analyze their sources and to quantify the relative roles of local and transported pollution emissions in the region. In the paper, we characterize the current environmental and socio-economical landscape of the Russian Far East and summarize the future climate scenarios and identify the key regional research questions. We discuss the research infrastructure concept, which is needed to answer the identified research questions. The integrated observations, filling in the critical observational gap at the Northern Eurasian context, are required to provide state-of-the-art observations and enable follow-up procedures that support local, regional, and global decision making in the environmental context.","[Petaja, Tuukka; Lappalainen, Hanna K.; Tabakova, Ksenia; Makkonen, Risto; Raisanen, Jouni; Kulmala, Markku; Zilitinkevich, Sergej] Univ Helsinki, Inst Atmospher & Earth Syst Res Phys, Fac Sci, Helsinki, Finland; [Petaja, Tuukka; Lappalainen, Hanna K.; Kulmala, Markku; Zilitinkevich, Sergej] Tyumen State Univ Tyumen, Dept Cryosphere, Tyumen, Russia; [Ganzei, Kirill S.; Baklanov, Petr Ya; Mishina, Natalia V.; Egidarev, Evgeny G.; Kondrat'ev, Igor I.] Russian Acad Sci, Far Eastern Branch, Pacific Geog Inst, Vladivostok, Russia; [Lappalainen, Hanna K.; Makkonen, Risto] Finnish Meteorol Inst, Helsinki, Finland; [Chalov, Sergey] Lomonosov Moscow State Univ, Fac Geog, Moscow, Russia; [Shakirov, Renat B.] Russian Acad Sci, Far Eastern Branch, VI Ilyichov Pacific Oceanol Inst, Vladivostok, Russia",University of Helsinki; Pacific Geographical Institute of the Far Eastern Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences; Russian Academy of Sciences; Finnish Meteorological Institute; Lomonosov Moscow State University; Russian Academy of Sciences,"Petaja, T (corresponding author), Inst Atmospher & Earth Syst Res INAR Phys, Gustaf Hallstrominkatu 2, FI-00560 Helsinki, Finland.",tuukka.petaja@helsinki.fi,"Ganzei, Kirill S/P-3262-2016; Petäjä, Tuukka/A-8009-2008; Räisänen, Jouni/A-8203-2011; Lappalainen, Hanna/GQZ-3399-2022; Chalov, Sergey R./K-1847-2012","Ganzei, Kirill S/0000-0002-4697-5255; Petäjä, Tuukka/0000-0002-1881-9044; Räisänen, Jouni/0000-0003-3657-1588; Chalov, Sergey R./0000-0002-6937-7020; Mishina, Natalia/0000-0002-5913-8149; Tabakova, Ksenia/0000-0001-6068-9450; Lappalainen, Hanna/0000-0003-3221-2318","RFBR [18-05-60219]; Academy of Finland [307537, 333397, 334792]; Belmont Forum (Academy of Finland) [334792]; University of Helsinki",RFBR(Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR)); Academy of Finland(Academy of Finland); Belmont Forum (Academy of Finland)(Academy of Finland); University of Helsinki,"LMSU was supported by RFBR project [18-05-60219].

It has a semi-enclosed surface area of about 2 x 10(7) km(2) and mean depth of nearly 5 km and includes a broad range of habitats from warm, light-saturated, nutrient-starved surface waters to the cold, nutrient-rich abyss. Microorganisms are found throughout the water column and are vertically stratified by their genetically determined metabolic capabilities that establish physiological tolerances to temperature, light, pressure, as well as organic and inorganic growth substrates. Despite the global significance of the NPSG for energy and matter transformations and its role in the oceanic carbon cycle, it is grossly undersampled and not well characterized with respect to ecosystem structure and dynamics. Since October 1988, interdisciplinary teams of scientists from the University of Hawaii and around the world have been investigating the NPSG ecosystem at Station ALOHA (A Long-term Oligotrophic Habitat Assessment), a site chosen to be representative of this expansive oligotrophic habitat, with a focus on microbial processes and biogeochemistry. At the start of this comprehensive field study, the NPSG was thought to be a Climax community with a relatively stable plankton community structure and relatively low variability in key microbiological rates and processes. Now, after nearly three decades of observations and experimentation we present a new view of this old ocean, one that highlights temporal variability in ecosystem processes across a broad range of scales from diel to decadal and beyond. Our revised paradigm is built on the strength of high-quality time-series observations, on insights from the application of state-of-the-art -omics techniques (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics) and, more recently, the discoveries of novel microorganisms and metabolic processes. Collectively, these efforts have led to a new understanding of trophic dynamics and population interactions in the NPSG. A comprehensive understanding of the environmental controls on microbial rates and processes, from genomes to biomes, will be required to inform the scientific community and the public at large about the potential impacts of human-induced climate change. The pace of new discovery, and the importance of integrating this new knowledge into conceptual paradigms and predictive models, is an enormous contemporary challenge with great scientific and societal relevance.","[Karl, David M.; Church, Matthew J.] Univ Hawaii, Ctr Microbial Oceanogr Res & Educ, C MORE Hale, 1950 East West Rd, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Karl, David M.; Church, Matthew J.] Univ Hawaii, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci & Technol, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Church, Matthew J.] Univ Montana, Flathead Lake Biol Stn, Polson, MT 59860 USA",University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii System; University of Montana System; University of Montana,"Karl, DM (corresponding author), Univ Hawaii, Ctr Microbial Oceanogr Res & Educ, C MORE Hale, 1950 East West Rd, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.;Karl, DM (corresponding author), Univ Hawaii, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci & Technol, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",dkarl@hawaii.edu,"Karl, David/AFP-3837-2022",,Simons Foundation; Agouron Institute; Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation; Balzan Foundation; Directorate For Geosciences [1260164] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,Simons Foundation; Agouron Institute(Pfizer); Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation(Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation); Balzan Foundation; Directorate For Geosciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)),"We thank the co-Editors in Chief of Ecosystems, Monica Turner and Steve Carpenter, for their excellent work over the past two decades in building and sustaining this important journal and for the cordial invitation to contribute this review article.

Larger-bodied bees with narrow phenological and dietary breadth are most prone to declines in body size over time. This may be especially true in solitary, desert-adapted species that are vulnerable to climate change such as Centris pallida (Hymenoptera: Apidae). In addition, body size changes in species with size-linked behaviours could threaten the prevalence of certain behavioural phenotypes long-term. C. pallida solitary bees are found in the Sonoran Desert. Males use alternative reproductive tactics (ARTs) and are dimorphic in both morphology and behaviour. C. pallida male body size has been studied since the 1970s in the same population. The authors collected body size data in 2022 and combined it with published records from 1974-2022. The authors find a persistent decline in the mean head width of patrolling males, and shifts towards smaller body sizes in the populations of males found foraging and hovering. Both morphs declined in average body size, and the proportion of large-morph males in the population decreased by 8%. Mating males did not decline in mean body size over the last five decades. The authors discuss hypotheses related to the decline in C. pallida male head width. Finally, the authors advocate for C. pallida as an excellent study system for understanding the stability of ARTs with size-linked behavioural phenotypes.","[Barrett, Meghan] Calif State Univ Dominguez Hills, Dept Biol, Carson, CA USA; [Johnson, Meredith G.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Life Sci, Tempe, AZ USA; [Barrett, Meghan] Calif State Univ Dominguez Hills, Dept Biol, Carson, CA 90747 USA",California State University System; California State University Dominguez Hills; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; California State University System; California State University Dominguez Hills,"Barrett, M (corresponding author), Calif State Univ Dominguez Hills, Dept Biol, Carson, CA 90747 USA.",mbarrett@csudh.edu,,,Friends of the Sonoran Desert; National Science Foundation;  [2109399],Friends of the Sonoran Desert; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); ,Friends of the Sonoran Desert ; National Science Foundation,,83,0,0,3,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-6946,1365-2311,,ECOL ENTOMOL,Ecol.

The aim of this paper was to explore the concept of expertise in nursing from the perspective of how it relates to current driving forces in health care in which it discusses the potential barriers to acceptance of nursing expertise in a climate in which quantification of value and cost containment run high on agendas. Background. Expert nursing practice can be argued to be central to high quality, holistic, individualized patient care. However, changes in government policy which have led to the inception of comprehensive guidelines or protocols of care are in danger of relegating the 'expert nurse' to being an icon of the past. Indeed, it could be argued that expert nurses are an expensive commodity within the nursing workforce. Consequently, with this change to the use of clinical guidelines, it calls into question how expert nursing practice will develop within this framework of care. Method. The article critically reviews the evidence related to the role of the Expert Nurse in an attempt to identify the key concepts and ideas, and how the inception of care protocols has implications for their role. Conclusion. Nursing expertise which focuses on the provision of individualized, holistic care and is based largely on intuitive decision making cannot, should not be reduced to being articulated in positivist terms. However, the dominant power and decision-making focus in health care means that nurses must be confident in articulating the value of a concept which may be outside the scope of knowledge of those with whom they are debating. Relevance to clinical practice. The principles of abduction or fuzzy logic may be useful in assisting nurses to explain in terms which others can comprehend, the value of nursing expertise.","Bournemouth Univ, Bournemouth BH1 3LT, Dorset, England",Bournemouth University,"Christensen, M (corresponding author), Bournemouth Univ, Royal London House,Christchurch Rd, Bournemouth BH1 3LT, Dorset, England.",mchristensen@bournemouth.ac.uk,"Christensen, Martin/AAU-2454-2020","Christensen, Martin/0000-0001-6820-020X",,,,,63,26,27,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0962-1067,1365-2702,,J CLIN NURS,J.

Several technological approaches have been proposed depending on the point of actuation (precombustion, postcombustion, or oxyfuel combustion), but absorption processes are still the most extended solution implemented in the industry. Alkanolamines are typical solvents used for CO2 capture, even though they have a noticeable negative impact on the environment. Amino acids and their salts have been appointed as alternative solvents since their functional group is similar to that of alkanolamines but presenting better properties. In addition, they show very good performance in CO2 capture.

However, a reliable forecast is difficult to achieve due to the complexity of the climate system and the huge set of available climatic data at nearby sites. Thus, in most existing precipitation prediction systems or methods, inevitable partial (selective) consideration of the types of climatic data has often led to less satisfactory prediction results. Thanks to the advent of modern sensor technology, various types of climatic data in time-series forms can be collected at observation sites or satellites. In this work, we reconstruct a climate dataset including more than 30 climatic variables measured by more than 103,473 observation sites covering the world surface from 1800 to 2017. Then, we apply state-of-the-art machine learning methods, including deep learning (CNN, RNN, and LSTM networks) and ensemble learning (Adaboost, GBDT, and XGBoost), to develop a short-term precipitation system. Experiments on real-world data show that incorporating multiple climate variables into a prediction system improves the prediction results.

J,"Chiari, S",,,,"Chiari, Sophie",,,Climatic issues in early modern England: Shakespeare's views of the sky,WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-CLIMATE CHANGE,,,English,Article,,,,,,early modern England; geo-humoralism; Little Ice Age; Shakespeare; sky,,"Climatic issues pervade early modern English drama, and three main reasons may be adduced for this. First, while in the first half of the 16th century Renaissance natural philosophers still felt compelled to acknowledge the accidental nature of weather-related phenomena, in the second part of the century, new beliefs emerged and the dramatization of celestial events allowed for a more immediate access to the natural world. Second, then as now, Shakespeare's sceptred isle (Richard II) was often exposed to the wind, the rain and the freezing air, and such characteristics were believed to have a lasting impact on the habits of the English nation. Third, people then had to struggle against the adverse weather conditions characterized by what is now referred to as the Little Ice Age. As actor and playwright, Shakespeare saw the sky as a theatrical element. While his so-called festive comedies appear far less festive if we pay attention to their climatic specificities, his tragedies offer interesting insights into the way the playwright associates heavens and humors on the one hand, climate and the planets on the other. I thus argue that climate was for Shakespeare a framing device giving coherence to his playtexts and providing the audience with a natural, elemental, and cosmic background. His interest in the way weather conditions affect human behavior prompted him to modify traditional points of view and, as a result, to foreground Man's ominous capacity to trigger climatic disorders.

Over Asia, a global aerosol hotspot, spatial patterns of aerosol emissions are changing mainly because of changes in anthropogenic emissions, producing a dipole in atmospheric aerosol loading between East (decrease in emissions) and South Asia (increase in emissions). The resultant aerosol radiative effects are expected to be different as compared to the last decades of the 20th century because of this emerging Asian aerosol dipole. The projection and assessments of radiative and climate impacts of aerosols rely on simulating accurately the aerosol properties, thus, making it imperative that current climate models involved in climate assessments including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Assessment Reports, simulate well the magnitude and trends in changing aerosol properties. For the first time, in this study we analyze trends in aerosol properties over Asia from satellite and ground-based observations, and simulations from climate models in Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) experiment with state-of-the-art treatment of aerosol chemistry, physics and meteorology. The results reveal large inter-model differences in model estimates, and discrepancies between model simulations and observations as most models are not able to capture the recent observed magnitudes and trends in aerosol optical depth (AOD) and single scattering albedo (SSA) over Asia. The absolute and the relative (percent) trends (positive and/or negative) in AOD are significantly higher than the trends in SSA. The aerosol-induced effective radiative forcing within the atmosphere simulated with three CMIP6 models show a positive (increasing) trend over Asia. A positive trend in atmospheric heating due to aerosols in model simulations is consistent with model simulated trends in AOD (positive) and SSA (negative). These results on model-observations comparison need to be taken into account while examining the projected/expected future climate impacts due to aerosols, and potential value of various mitigation measures, in particular on regional and decadal climate change in Asia which is largely uncertain.","[Ramachandran, S.] Phys Res Lab, Ahmadabad, Gujarat, India; [Ramachandran, S.; Rupakheti, Maheswar] Inst Adv Sustainabil Studies, Potsdam, Germany; [Cherian, R.] Univ Leipzig, Leipzig Inst Meteorol, Leipzig, Germany","Department of Space (DoS), Government of India; Physical Research Laboratory - India; Leipzig University","Ramachandran, S (corresponding author), Phys Res Lab, Ahmadabad, Gujarat, India.",ram@prl.res.in,"Cherian, Ribu/C-7188-2014","Cherian, Ribu/0000-0003-2581-4214","German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF); Brandenburg State Ministry for Science, Research and Culture (MWFK); German Research Foundation (DFG) [637230]","German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); Brandenburg State Ministry for Science, Research and Culture (MWFK); German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG))","The IASS is funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) and the Brandenburg State Ministry for Science, Research and Culture (MWFK).

Traditional architecture as applied in Iran is of a great value for its extensive capabilities to provide solutions for effective use of energy. So, by taking advantage of collective wisdom of the architects of precedent generations as well as historical experience, an Iranian architect has achieved to this capability and contemporary artists could be inspired by this achievement to design new and modern buildings. Since, Zavareh is one of ancient cities of Iran and comprehensive studies have not been made on this city, then desirable recognition of climatic aspect of this city may be valuable to know the Iranian local /domestic architecture. In the present paper, the residential architecture of this city is going to be studied to provide reasonable solutions for designing. Then, by application of these solutions, designing regulations, optimized materials and architectural regulations consistent with the climatic conditions of this city will be established and finally an effective measure to achieve a lasting architecture is taken. This paper will mainly focus on studying typology of residential constructions of it and checking its climatic features against sustainable architectural factors and those elements specific to sustainable and climatic architecture of it. The methodology applied in this research is based on a descriptive and analytical approach and the documents complied are documentary resulting from many field studies. To do this, many of the constructions built in this city have been visited. The theoretical framework of this research demonstrates that the conditions of traditional architecture in each region have been affected by climatic conditions.

Written when the interconnectedness of the globe is evident in the Coronavirus pandemic and extensive carbon footprints, this paper examines the role of ecocriticism in illuminating the condition of a city such as Hong Kong, which is susceptible to contagion because its success is based on its interconnectedness with the world through the flow of people, resources, finance, and tourism. How does ecocritical discourse help us to see the ways Hong Kong's success has contributed to its vulnerability? What are the tropes that defined the development of Hong Kong in the colonial period and how have they been re-imagined in the post-handover period? Will Hong Kong's post-handover reappropriation of nature encourage other former colonies to adopt a green agenda and lead to the cross-fertilization of ecocritcal, historical, cultural and social discourses? This paper adopts an ecocritical perspective and revisits some of the central natural symbols that have shaped the grand narrative of Hong Kong. It reconsiders the natural tropes- the barren rock - that were used to reinforce colonial superiority, the ways that geography has determined the city's destiny, and the role of the official flower in the creation of the city's identity. Citing developments in the post-handover period (the Save Choi Yuen Village movement, the rise of organic communities, and the tactics of protestors in the summer of 2019), the paper reveals how natural tropes have been liberated from their traditional associations. Hong Kong shows not only the ways in which the human and non-human can work together interdependently but also the processes of identity formation in the period after decolonization and in an age of globalism.","[Yee, Winnie L.

Though both aspects are given attention, the following investigation concentrates mainly on thematic issues: while black male artists tend to focus on public events and symbols (the flag, the cross, the slave-ship), women turn to the personal and private, i.e. to the body and the domestic sphere as a highly politicised space.

However, it is an ever-challenging task because temperature is affected by various climate factors. Research on temperature forecasting has taken one of two directions: time-series analysis and machine learning algorithms. Recently, a large amount of high-frequent climate data have been well-stored and become available. In this study, we apply three types of neural networks, multilayer perceptron, recurrent, and convolutional, to daily average, minimum, and maximum temperature forecasting with higher-frequency input features than researchers used in previous studies. Applying these neural networks to the observed data from three locations with different climate characteristics, we show that prediction performance with highly frequent hourly input data is better than forecasting performance with less-frequent daily inputs. We observe that a convolutional neural network, which has been mostly employed for processing satellite images rather than numeric weather data for temperature forecasting, outperforms the other models. In addition, we combine state of the art weather forecasting techniques with the convolutional neural network and evaluate their effects on the temperature forecasting performances.","[Lee, Sungjae; Son, Youngdoo] Dongguk Univ Seoul, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Seoul 04620, South Korea; [Lee, Yung-Seop] Dongguk Univ Seoul, Dept Stat, Seoul 04620, South Korea",Dongguk University; Dongguk University,"Son, Y (corresponding author), Dongguk Univ Seoul, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Seoul 04620, South Korea.",sungjaelee@dgu.ac.kr; yung@dongguk.edu; youngdoo@dongguk.edu,,"Lee, Sungjae/0000-0001-6142-2694; Son, Youngdoo/0000-0002-1912-5853",National Research Foundation of Korea [2017RIEIAIA03070102]; Dongguk University,National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea); Dongguk University,"The first and second authors (S.L. and Y-S.L.) of this research were supported by National Research Foundation of Korea, grant number 2017RIEIAIA03070102 and the third author (Y.S.) of this research was supported by the Dongguk University Research Fund of 2017.",,41,16,16,3,14,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3417,,APPL SCI-BASEL,Appl.

Considerable efforts to understand the origins of these biases and alleviate them have been undertaken, but state-of-the-art CGCMs still suffer from biases that are very similar to those of the generation of models before. In this study, we use a powerful combination of in situ moored buoy observations and a new coupled ocean-atmosphere single-column model (SCM) with parameterization that is identical to that of a three-dimensional CGCM to investigate the SST bias. We place the SCM at the location of a Prediction and Research Moored Array in the Tropical Atlantic (PIRATA) mooring in the southeastern tropical Atlantic, where large SST biases occur in CGCMs. The SCM version of the EC-Earth state-of-the-art coupled GCM performs well for the first five days of the simulation. Then, it develops an SST bias that is very similar to that of its three-dimensional counterpart. Through a series of sensitivity experiments we demonstrate that the SST bias can be reduced by 70%. We achieve this result by enhancing the turbulent vertical ocean mixing efficiency in the ocean parameterization scheme. The under-representation of vertical mixing in three-dimensional CGCMs is a candidate for causing the warm SST bias. We further show that surface shortwave radiation does not cause the SST bias at the location of the PIRATA mooring. Rather, a warm atmospheric near-surface temperature bias and a wet moisture bias contribute to it. Strongly nudging the atmosphere to profiles from reanalysis data reduces the SST bias by 40%.","[Deppenmeier, Anna-Lena; van Heerwaarden, Chiel] Wageningen Univ, Meteorol & Air Qual, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Deppenmeier, Anna-Lena; Haarsma, Rein J.] Royal Dutch Meteorol Inst, Res & Dev Weather & Climate Models, De Bilt, Netherlands; [Hazeleger, Wilco] Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, Utrecht, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research; Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute; Utrecht University,"Deppenmeier, AL (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ, Meteorol & Air Qual, Wageningen, Netherlands.;Deppenmeier, AL (corresponding author), Royal Dutch Meteorol Inst, Res & Dev Weather & Climate Models, De Bilt, Netherlands.",deppenme@ucar.edu,,"Hazeleger, Wilco/0000-0002-4566-958X; Deppenmeier, Anna-Lena/0000-0003-0549-7143; Haarsma, Rein/0000-0001-7171-2687",EU FP7/2007-2013 PREFACE Project [603521],EU FP7/2007-2013 PREFACE Project,This study was supported by the EU FP7/2007-2013 PREFACE Project under Grant Agreement 603521.

Hence, they are widely used in many fields, and an in-depth evaluation of the different variables provided by reanalyses is a necessary means to provide feedback on the quality to their users and the operational centres producing these data sets, and to help guide their development. Recently, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) released the new state-of-the-art climate reanalysis ERA5, following up on its popular predecessor ERA-Interim. Different sets of variables from ERA5 were already evaluated in a handful of studies, but so far, the quality of land-surface energy partitioning has not been assessed. Here, we evaluate the surface energy partitioning over land in ERA5 and concentrate on the appraisal of the surface latent heat flux, surface sensible heat flux, and Bowen ratio against different reference data sets and using different modelling tools. Most of our analyses point towards a better quality of surface energy partitioning in ERA5 than in ERA-Interim, which may be attributed to a better representation of land-surface processes in ERA5 and certainly to the better quality of near-surface meteorological variables. One of the key shortcomings of the reanalyses identified in our study is the overestimation of the surface latent heat flux over land, which - although substantially lower than in ERA-Interim - still remains in ERA5. Overall, our results indicate the high quality of the surface turbulent fluxes from ERA5 and the general improvement upon ERA-Interim, thereby endorsing the efforts of ECMWF to improve their climate reanalysis and to provide useful data to many scientific and operational fields.","[Martens, Brecht; Schumacher, Dominik L.; Wouters, Hendrik; Verhoest, Niko E.

We find that aerosols are likely responsible for the observed earlier onset, resulting in enhanced June precipitation over most of India. This shift is preceded by strong aerosol forcing over the Bay of Bengal and Indochina, mostly attributable to the direct effect, resulting in increased atmospheric stability that inhibits the monsoon migration in May. The adjusted atmospheric circulation leads to thermodynamic changes over the northwestern continental region, including increased surface temperature and near-surface moist static energy, which support a stronger June flow and, facilitated by a relative warming of the Indian Ocean, a vigorous northwestward precipitation shift. These findings underscore the importance of dynamical feedbacks and of regional land-surface processes for the aerosol-monsoon link.","[Bollasina, Massimo A.] Princeton Univ, Program Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Bollasina, Massimo A.; Ming, Yi; Ramaswamy, V.] NOAA, Geophys Fluid Dynam Lab, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA",National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Princeton University; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Bollasina, MA (corresponding author), NOAA, Geophys Fluid Dynam Lab, 201 Forrestal Rd, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA.",massimo.bollasina@noaa.gov,"Ming, Yi/F-3023-2012; Ramaswamy, Venkatachalam/AAJ-6265-2021","Ramaswamy, Venkatachalam/0000-0002-1984-6423; Bollasina, Massimo/0000-0001-7509-7650",Princeton Environmental Institute; BP,Princeton Environmental Institute; BP,"We thank David Paynter for the helpful discussions, Tim Merlis and David Paynter for reviewing an earlier version of the manuscript, and the two anonymous reviewers.

The predictive skill of the system was assessed with a set of retrospective seasonal predictions (reforecasts) covering 30 years (1981-2010). JMA/MRI-CPS1 showed reasonable predictive skill for the El Nio-Southern Oscillation, comparable to the skills of other state-of-the-art systems. The one-tiered approach adopted in JMA/MRI-CPS1 improved its overall predictive skills for atmospheric predictions over those of the two-tiered approach of the previous uncoupled system. For 3-month predictions with a 1-month lead, JMA/MRI-CPS1 showed statistically significant skills in predicting 500-hPa geopotential height and 2-m temperature in East Asia in most seasons; thus, it is capable of providing skillful seasonal predictions for that region. Furthermore, JMA/MRI-CPS1 was superior overall to the previous system for atmospheric predictions with longer (4-month) lead times. In particular, JMA/MRI-CPS1 was much better able to predict the Asian Summer Monsoon than the previous two-tiered system. This enhanced performance was attributed to the system's ability to represent atmosphere-ocean coupled variability over the Indian Ocean and the western North Pacific from boreal winter to summer following winter El Nio events, which in turn influences the East Asian summer climate through the Pacific-Japan teleconnection pattern. These substantial improvements obtained by using an atmosphere-ocean coupled general circulation model underpin its success in providing more skillful seasonal forecasts on an operational basis.","[Takaya, Yuhei; Yasuda, Tamaki; Mori, Hirotoshi; Hirai, Masayuki; Ishikawa, Ichiro; Sato, Hitoshi; Shimpo, Akihiko] Japan Meteorol Agcy, Chiyoda Ku, 1-3-4 Otemachi, Tokyo 1008122, Japan; [Fujii, Yosuke; Matsumoto, Satoshi; Kamachi, Masafumi; Ose, Tomoaki] Meteorol Res Inst, 1-1 Nagamine, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050052, Japan; [Soga, Taizo] Univ Tsukuba, Fac Med, 1-1-1 Tennodai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058575, Japan",Japan Meteorological Agency; Meteorological Research Institute - Japan; University of Tsukuba,"Takaya, Y (corresponding author), Japan Meteorol Agcy, Chiyoda Ku, 1-3-4 Otemachi, Tokyo 1008122, Japan.",ytakaya@met.kishou.go.jp,,"Ishikawa, Ichiro/0000-0002-0866-7315; Takaya, Yuhei/0000-0002-7359-8897; Fujii, Yosuke/0000-0002-9230-3134",,,,,105,15,16,2,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0930-7575,1432-0894,,CLIM DYNAM,Clim.

The historical simulations (1870-2005) include 10 models with ensemble member ranging from 3 to 10 that are forced with observed atmospheric composition changes reflecting both natural and anthropogenic forcings. It is shown that the majority of the CMIP5 models capture the relative large SST anomaly variance in the tropical central and eastern Pacific, as well as in North Pacific and North Atlantic. The frequency of ENSO is not well captured by almost all models, particularly for the period of 5-6 years. The low-frequency variations in SST caused by external forcings affect the SST variability and also modify the global teleconnection of ENSO. The models reproduce the global averaged SST low-frequency variations, particularly since 1970s. However, majority of the models are unable to correctly simulate the spatial pattern of the observed SST trends.

Interannual and intraseasonal precipitation variability in the region is related to ENSO and MJO tropical convection. The predictability of these tropical signals gives some expectation of skillful extended-range rainfall forecasts in the region. Here, the extent to which this predictability is realizable in the Climate Forecast System (CFS), version 2, a state-of-the-art coupled global ocean-atmosphere model, is assessed. While there are deficiencies in the forecast climatology likely related to orography and resolution, as well as lead-dependent biases, CFS represents the climatology of the region reasonably well. Forecasts of the areal average of rainfall over Saudi Arabia show that the CFS captures some features of a spring 2013 heavy rainfall event up to 10 days in advance and a transition from dry to wet conditions up to 20 days in advance. Analysis of a 12-yr (1999-2010) reforecast dataset shows that the CFS can skillfully predict the rainfall amount, the number of days exceeding a threshold, and the probability of heavy rainfall occurrence for forecast windows ranging from 1 to 30 days. While the probability forecasts show good discrimination, they are overconfident. Logistic regression based on the ensemble mean value improves forecast skill and reliability. Forecast probabilities have a clear relation with the MJO phase in the wet season, providing a physical basis for the observed forecast skill.","[Tippett, Michael K.] Columbia Univ, Dept Appl Phys & Appl Math, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Tippett, Michael K.; Almazroui, Mansour; Kang, In-Sik] King Abdulaziz Univ, Dept Meteorol, Ctr Excellence Climate Change Res, Jeddah 21413, Saudi Arabia; [Kang, In-Sik] Seoul Natl Univ, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Seoul, South Korea",Columbia University; King Abdulaziz University; Seoul National University (SNU),"Tippett, MK (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Dept Appl Phys & Appl Math, Mail Code 4701, New York, NY 10027 USA.",tippett@iri.columbia.edu,"Almazroui, Mansour/D-9708-2011","Almazroui, Mansour/0000-0002-3962-4588; Tippett, Michael/0000-0002-7790-5364","NOAA [NA12OAR4310091, NA14OAR4310184]; Office of Naval Research [N00014-12-1-091]",NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); Office of Naval Research(Office of Naval Research),This study was supported in part by NOAA Awards NA12OAR4310091 and NA14OAR4310184 and Office of Naval Research Award N00014-12-1-091.

This paper has therefore analyzed two promising concepts for higher supply temperatures and found technically and economically feasible solutions for process heat supply of up to 280 degrees C. These solutions are using large-scale equipment from oil and gas industries for applications in energy-intensive industries. The suggested systems benefitted from the economy of scale and access to low electricity prices. The concepts outperformed a biogas-based solution, and they were competitive with biomass or natural gas systems with respect to economic performance.

Viewing industrial organizations as cultural systems embedded in wider social contexts, I have developed a multilevel framework addressing institutional, organizational, and individual dimensions shaping decisions on energy efficiency. The Framework draws from neo-institutional theory, the attention-based view of the firm, a psychosocial conception of organizational culture and ethnographic fieldwork. I conclude that decisions on energy efficiency are results of problematization and theorization processes. These processes emerge between the institutional issue-field, the organization, and its members. The model explains decisions on energy efficiency shaped by the institutional environment, the organizational processes (energy-efficiency practices, climate and culture) and individuals' characteristics. The framework: introduces a meta-theory of decision making on energy efficiency in industrial organizations and provides a concept for empirical analysis.","[Koenig, Werner] Reutlingen Univ, Reutlingen Ctr Energy Syst & Energy Efficiency, Alteburgstr 150, D-72762 Reutlingen, Germany",,"Konig, W (corresponding author), Reutlingen Univ, Reutlingen Ctr Energy Syst & Energy Efficiency, Alteburgstr 150, D-72762 Reutlingen, Germany.",werner.koenig@reutlingen-university.de,,,"Ministry of Science, Research and Art of the German Federal State BadenWurttemberg within the scope of the research project Decisions for Energy Efficiency [2015.01-Lobbe]","Ministry of Science, Research and Art of the German Federal State BadenWurttemberg within the scope of the research project Decisions for Energy Efficiency","The author gratefully acknowledges the support of the Ministry of Science, Research and Art of the German Federal State BadenWurttemberg within the scope of the research project Decisions for Energy Efficiency (project 2015.01-Lobbe).

On the basis of the state-of-the-art decadal prediction models, we showed evidence that although the raw model outputs show low predicted ability for the summer Inner TP (ITP) rainfall due to low signal-to-noise ratios in models, we can produce realistic predictions by extracting the predictable signal from large ensemble predictions along with a postprocessing procedure of variance adjustment. The results indicate that the summer ITP rainfall is highly predictable on multiyear time scales. The predictability of ITP rainfall originates from the Silk Road pattern driven by sea surface temperature over the subpolar gyre region in North Atlantic.

We tested how the strategy used to choose predictors impacts the transferability of SDMs at a cross-continental scale. Location North America, Eurasia and Australia. Method We used a systematic approach including 50 Holarctic plant invaders and 27 initial predictor variables, considering 10 different strategies for variable selection, accounting for the proximality, multicollinearity and climate analogy of predictors. We compared the average performance of each strategy, some of which used a large number of predictor combinations. Next, we looked for the single best model for each species across all the predictor combinations retained in the analysis. Transferability was considered as the predictive success of SDMs calibrated in the native range and projected onto the invaded range. Results Two strategies showed better SDM transferability on average: a set of predictors known for their ecologically meaningful effects on plant distribution, and the two first axes of a principal component analysis calibrated on all predictor variables (S-pc2). From the more than 2000 combinations of predictors per species across strategies, the best set of predictors yielded SDMs with good transferability for 45 species (90%). These best combinations consisted of eight randomly assembled (39 species) or uncorrelated predictors (6 species) and S-pc2 (5 species). We also found that internal cross-validation was not sufficient to give full information about the transferability of a SDM to a distinct range. Main conclusion Transferring SDMs at the macroclimatic scale, and thus anticipating invasions, is possible for the large majority of invasive plants considered in this study, but the accuracy of the predictions relies strongly on the choice of predictors. From our results, we recommend including either proximal and state-of-the-art variables or a reduced and orthogonalized set to obtain robust SDM projections.","[Petitpierre, Blaise; Broennimann, Olivier; Guisan, Antoine] Univ Lausanne, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Biophore Bldg, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Kueffer, Christoph] Inst Integrat Biol, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Daehler, Curtis] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Bot, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Guisan, Antoine] Univ Lausanne, Inst Earth Surface Dynam, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland",University of Lausanne; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; University of Lausanne,"Petitpierre, B (corresponding author), Univ Lausanne, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Biophore Bldg, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",blaise.petitpierre@unil.ch,"Broennimann, Olivier/D-3495-2011; Guisan, Antoine/A-1057-2011; Kueffer, Christoph/H-6091-2013","Broennimann, Olivier/0000-0001-9913-3695; Guisan, Antoine/0000-0002-3998-4815; Kueffer, Christoph/0000-0001-6701-0703; Bronnimann, Olivier/0000-0001-5394-4564","Swiss National Science Project [31003A-1528661]; USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Biology of Weedy and Invasive Species Program [2006-35320-17360]","Swiss National Science Project(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Biology of Weedy and Invasive Species Program","We thank R.

Surprisingly, relatively few conservation studies have used physiology to make predictions about the performances of translocated individuals in their new environment. Tuatara Sphenodon punctatus are of international significance as the last rhynchocephalian reptile. Natural populations are now restricted to similar to 30 offshore islands in northern New Zealand, where survival of at least one population is threatened by climate change. Translocation to cooler regions (further south, but within the past latitudinal range of the genus) is an important option for future management. However, the genetic suitability of available source populations for environments that are currently cooler is unclear. To help predict the success of translocation, we examined the effects of cool temperature on juveniles sourced from one of the most southerly natural populations and compared these with three lizard species that inhabit southern New Zealand. We found that tuatara possess the same range of preferred body temperature, feeding responses to cool temperatures and critical thermal minimum as these three lizard species. However, tuatara did not digest at temperatures below 12 degrees C, suggesting that new reintroduction sites must offer enough basking opportunities to allow digestion of prey in winter. As tuatara showed responses to cold temperatures similar to lizards from southern New Zealand, we predict that tuatara will survive if translocated south of their current range, but whether they will be able to produce self-sustaining populations still needs investigation. Physiological predictions from the current study should now be combined with measurements of population performance in an experimental translocation.","[Besson, A.

Using mark-resighting statistical models, we analyzed 19 years of photo-identification data and detected significant annual variation in adult survival for a subpopulation in northwest Florida where human impact is low. That variation coincided with years when intense hurricanes (Category 3 or greater on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale) and a major winter storm occurred in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Mean survival probability during years with no or low intensity storms was 0.972 (approximate 95% confidence interval = 0.9.61-0.980) but dropped to 0.936 (0.864-0.971) in 1985 with Hurricanes Elena, Kate, and Juan; to 0.909 (0.837-0.951) in 1993 with the March Storm of the Century; and to 0.817 (0.735-0.878) in 1995 with Hurricanes Opal, Erin, and Allison. These drops in survival probability were not catastrophic in magnitude and were detected because of the use of state-of-the-art statistical techniques and the quality of the data. Because individuals of this small population range extensively along the north Gulf coast of Florida, it was possible to resolve storm effects on a regional scale rather than the site-specific local scale common to studies of more sedentary species. This is the first empirical evidence in support 4 storm effects on manatee survival and suggests a cause-effect relationship. The decreases in survival could be due to direct mortality, indirect mortality, and/or emigration from the region as a consequence of storms.-Future impacts to the population by a single catastrophic hurricane, or series of smaller hurricanes, could increase the probability of extinction. With the advent in 1995 of a new 25- to 50-yr cycle of greater hurricane activity, and longer term change possible with global climate change, it becomes all the more important to reduce mortality and injury from boats and other human causes and control the loss of foraging habitat to coastal development.","US Geol Survey, Florida Carribean Sci Ctr, Biol Resource Div, Gainesville, FL 32601 USA",United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey,"Langtimm, CA (corresponding author), US Geol Survey, Florida Carribean Sci Ctr, Biol Resource Div, 412 NE 16th Ave,Room 250, Gainesville, FL 32601 USA.",,,"Beck, Cathy/0000-0002-5388-5418",,,,,58,25,28,4,70,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",1051-0761,,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

The zero degree soil temperatures as well as induced permafrost index characteristics simulated by the model for present day conditions match well the observed permafrost zonation. For a future scenario of greenhouse gas emissions (SRES A2 issued by IPCC), we estimate the amounts that the permafrost zones moves poleward and how the thickness of the active layer deepens in response to the global warming by the end of the 21st century.

It is likely that the more vulnerable members of the community will be at risk during heat waves in the future from both health and financial perspectives. The trend towards fully air conditioned larger homes has already seen very large peaks in electricity demand during past heat waves. Electricity prices have increased substantially in recent years and will increase further due to greater peak demand and environmental levies. To manage the risks to dwelling occupants during heat waves, research has been carried out to determine methods of promoting adaptive behaviours through residential design. This paper describes the concept of a cool retreat within a dwelling which can provide comfort conditions with minimal cooling costs during heat wave periods. The cool retreat concept is shown to have its origins in the past in a number of locations around the world subject to hot conditions. Various cool retreat configurations have been analysed for thermal performance, demonstrating the viability of this approach for dealing with extreme conditions in the future.","[Palmer, Jasmine] Univ South Australia, Barbara Hardy Inst, Sch Art Architecture & Design, GPO Box 2471, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia; [Bennetts, Helen; Pullen, Stephen; Zuo, Jian; Ma, Tony; Chileshe, Nicholas] UniSA, BHI, Sch Nat & Built Environm, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia",University of South Australia; University of South Australia,"Palmer, J (corresponding author), Univ South Australia, Barbara Hardy Inst, Sch Art Architecture & Design, GPO Box 2471, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia.",jasmine.palmer@unisa.edu.au,"Chileshe, Nicholas/F-5482-2010; Ma, Tony/F-4491-2013","Chileshe, Nicholas/0000-0002-1981-7518; Palmer, Jasmine/0000-0001-6815-4792; Zuo, Jian/0000-0002-8279-9666; Ma, Tony/0000-0003-3629-8278",Australian Government's National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility (NCCARF),Australian Government's National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility (NCCARF)(Australian Government),The support of the Australian Government's National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility (NCCARF) is gratefully acknowledged in carrying out this research.

The study uses a set of standard extreme precipitation indices as defined by the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices constructed using CMIP6 models and observational datasets for comparison. Three observations; Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP), Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS), and Tropical Applications of Meteorology using SATellite and ground-based observation (TAMSAT) datasets are used for the validation of the model simulations. The results show that observed datasets present nearly the same spatial pattern but discrepancies in the magnitude of rainfall characteristics. The models show substantial discrepancies in comparison with the observations and among themselves. A number of the models depict the pattern of rainfall intensity as observed but some models overestimate the pattern over the coastal parts (FGOALS-f3-L and GFDL-ESM4) and western part (FGOALS-f3-L) of West Africa. All model simulations explicitly show the pattern of wet days but with large discrepancies in their frequencies. On extreme rainfall, half of the models express more intense extremes in the 95th percentiles while the other half simulate less intense extremes. All the models overestimate the mean maximum wet spell length except FGOALS-f3-L. The spatial patterns of the mean maximum dry spell length show a good general agreement across the different models, and the observations except for four models that show an overestimation in the Sahara subregion. INM-CM4-8 and INM-CM5-0 display smaller discrepancies from their long-term average rainfall characteristics, in terms of extreme rainfall estimates than the other CMIP6 datasets. For the frequency of heavy rainfall, TaiESM1 and IPSL-CMGA-LR perform better when compared with observational datasets. MIROC6 and GFDL-ESM4 displayed the largest error in representing the frequency of heavy rainfall and 95th percentile extremes, and therefore, cannot be reliable. The study has assessed how rainfall extremes are captured in both observation and the models. Though there are some discrepancies, it gives room for improvement of the models in the next version of CMIP.","[Klutse, Nana Ama Browne; Berkoh-Oforiwaa, Rebecca; Dzrobi, Joshua Fafanyo] Univ Ghana, Dept Phys, Accra, Ghana; [Klutse, Nana Ama Browne; Nkrumah, Francis; Berkoh-Oforiwaa, Rebecca; Dzrobi, Joshua Fafanyo; Sylla, Mouhamadou Bamba] African Inst Math Sci AIMS, Kigali, Rwanda; [Quagraine, Kwesi Akumenyi] Univ Cape Town, Dept Environm & Geog Sci, Climate Syst Anal Grp CSAG, Cape Town, South Africa; [Quagraine, Kwesi Akumenyi; Nkrumah, Francis] Univ Cape Coast, Dept Phys, Cape Coast, Ghana; [Quagraine, Kwesi Twentwewa] Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Phys, Kumasi, Ghana",University of Ghana; University of Cape Town; University of Cape Coast; Kwame Nkrumah University Science & Technology,"Klutse, NAB (corresponding author), Univ Ghana, Dept Phys, Accra, Ghana.;Klutse, NAB (corresponding author), African Inst Math Sci AIMS, Kigali, Rwanda.",nklutse@ug.edu.gh,"Quagraine, Kwesi A/GWZ-2782-2022; Nkrumah, Francis/S-4939-2017; NKRUMAH, FRANCIS/ABC-5305-2021; Nkrumah, Francis/AIC-2152-2022","Quagraine, Kwesi A/0000-0002-7887-6040; Nkrumah, Francis/0000-0002-4723-8062; Nkrumah, Francis/0000-0002-4723-8062; Klutse, Nana Ama Browne/0000-0001-5156-2765; Quagraine, Kwesi/0000-0002-6452-1847",African Institute for Mathematical Sciences; Government of Canada through Global Affairs Canada; International Development Research Centre,African Institute for Mathematical Sciences; Government of Canada through Global Affairs Canada(CGIAR); International Development Research Centre,"The authors thank the World Climate Research Program for making the CMIP6 dataset available through the Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF) archiving and free access for this research.

Architecture has been trying to response to weather conditions all the time. Wind catcher, mashrabiya, portico and iwan are some examples of climate designs in vernacular architecture which have shown the importance of natural ventilation since a long time ago. The efficiency scope of natural ventilation when used with other cooling techniques will be more widespread. Today, designing desirable buildings using natural ventilation requires knowing theoretical foundations and a detailed study based on new knowledge regarding the feasibility of the use of components design and equipment related to natural ventilation. The present research aims to offer architects some design solutions in order to take advantage of natural ventilation in buildings using the vernacular architecture. Through matching features of functional spaces in local houses with climatic characteristics of regions around the Caspian sea (Mazandaran province) and determining the pattern used in these spaces in housing areas, the present study seeks to answer this question:  Are types of local houses in regions with moderate and humid climate in Iran (Mazandaran) consistent with regional climate in terms of patterns applied in internal functional spaces? How do regional climate features affect physical form of houses? The results show that there is a direct and consistent relationship between vernacular architectural features of Mazandaran province and climate classification and regional climate. It also enhances home comfort in summer and finally, it can be concluded that local houses are built based on the climate classification and environment context, and natural ventilation is the most important factor affecting the conditions which improve environmental comfort. The present research provides some guidelines for the architectural design of residential buildings in regions with moderate and humid climate with the aim of achieving maximum level of natural ventilation. Also, in order to exploit the potential of natural ventilation, the results of the research will help architect select optimal designing parameters in harmony with the regional climate.","[Posht, Azadeh Mahmoudi Kohneh Rood] Islamic Azad Univ, Sci & Reasearch Branch, Dept Architecture, Tehran, Iran; [Daneshjoo, Khosro] Tarbiat Modares Univ, Dept Architecture, Tehran, Iran; [Shemirani, Seyed Majid Mofidi] Iran Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Art & Urban Studies, Tehran, Iran",Islamic Azad University; Tarbiat Modares University; Iran University Science & Technology,"Posht, AMKR (corresponding author), Islamic Azad Univ, Sci & Reasearch Branch, Dept Architecture, Tehran, Iran.",,"shemirani, majid mofidi/S-6243-2018",,,,,,10,0,0,2,10,KARABUK UNIV,KARABUK,"MAIN CAMPUS, BALIKLARKAYASI, KARABUK, 00000, TURKEY",2147-0626,,,TARIH KULT SANAT ARA,Tarih Kult.

We propose that the Venus representation relates to human adaptation to climate change. During this period, humans faced advancing glaciers and falling temperatures that led to nutritional stress, regional extinctions, and a reduction in the population. We analyzed Paleolithic figurines of women with obesity to test whether the more obese figurines are from sites during the height of the glacial advance and closer to the glacial fronts. Figurines are less obese as distance from the glaciers increases. Because survival required sufficient nutrition for child-bearing women, we hypothesize that the overnourished woman became an ideal symbol of survival and beauty during episodes of starvation and climate change in Paleolithic Europe.","[Johnson, Richard J.; Lanaspa, Miguel A.] Univ Colorado, Div Renal Dis & Hypertens, Aurora, CO 80045 USA; [Fox, John W.] Amer Univ Sharjah, Dept Anthropol, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus; American University of Sharjah,"Johnson, RJ (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Div Renal Dis & Hypertens, Aurora, CO 80045 USA.",richard.johnson@ucdenver.edu,,"Johnson, Richard/0000-0003-3312-8193",NIH [1RO1DK108408],NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA),This work was supported in part by NIH 1RO1DK108408.,,14,5,5,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1930-7381,1930-739X,,OBESITY,Obesity,JAN,2021,1,,,,11,15,,10.1002/oby.23028,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/oby.23028,,20-Dec,5,Endocrinology & Metabolism; Nutrition & Dietetics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Endocrinology & Metabolism; Nutrition & Dietetics,PH6PV,33258218,Green Accepted,,,12/21/22,WOS:000594369800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

But current state-of-the-art approaches to water planning make it difficult to craft flexible and robust plans to guide resource allocation and facilitate discussions with the agency's constituents and ratepayers. This paper describes an innovative effort by one agency, the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (termed Metropolitan), to begin to address these challenges. Metropolitan's year 2010 integrated resources plan (IRP) update specifies resource allocations over 25years and calls for an adaptive management approach to revisit these allocations over time. Using a quantitative decision support approach called robust decision-making (RDM), an enhanced version of Metropolitan's main planning model was run, over many thousands of cases representing different combinations of assumptions about future demand, conditions in the bay/delta, climate conditions, local resource yields, and implementation challenges. Statistical cluster analysis on the resulting database of model runs identifies scenarios that succinctly summarize the types of future conditions in which the IRP core resources strategy does and does not meet its goals. These scenarios inform early warning indicators that can guide the adaptive management component of the IRP. The robust decision methods presented in this paper should prove broadly useful for Metropolitan in addition to other water agencies seeking to develop robust and adaptive plans in the face of uncertain future conditions.","[Groves, David G.; Bloom, Evan; Lempert, Robert J.; Fischbach, Jordan R.] RAND Corp, Santa Monica, CA 90407 USA; [Nevills, Jennifer] Metropolitan Water Dist Southern Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90054 USA; [Goshi, Brandon] Metropolitan Water Dist Southern Calif, Water Policy & Strategy, Los Angeles, CA 90054 USA",RAND Corporation,"Groves, DG (corresponding author), RAND Corp, 1776 Main St,POB 2138, Santa Monica, CA 90407 USA.",groves@rand.org,,"Fischbach, Jordan/0000-0003-1302-3802",,,,,39,37,37,0,28,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9496,1943-5452,,J WATER RES PLAN MAN,J.

However, this assumption is flawed since it does not appreciate the extent of diversity among resource users; it risks that strategies will be irrelevant for many people and ignored, and that the grazing resource itself will remain unprotected. Understanding social heterogeneity is vital for effective natural resource management. Our aim was to understand the extent to which graziers in the northern Australian rangelands varied in their capacity to adapt to climate variability and recommended practices. Adaptive capacity was assessed according to four dimensions: 1) the perception of risk, 2) skills in planning, learning and reorganising, 3) financial and emotional flexibility, and 4) interest in adapting. We conducted 100 face-to-face interviews with graziers in their homes obtaining a 97% response rate. Of the 16 possible combinations that the four dimensions represent, we observed that all combinations were present in the Burdekin. Any single initiative to address grazing land management practices in the region is unlikely to address the needs of all graziers. Rather, policies could be tailored to type-specific needs based on adaptive capacity. Efforts to shift graziers from very low, low, or moderate levels of adaptive capacity are urgently needed. We suggest some strategies.","[Marshall, Nadine A.; Smajgl, Alex] CSIRO Ecosyst Sci, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Marshall, NA (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, CSIRO Ecosyst Sci, ATSIP Bldg, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.",nadine.marshall@csiro.au,"Marshall, Nadine/D-9339-2011; Smajgl, Alexander/G-5462-2010","Marshall, Nadine/0000-0003-4463-3558; Smajgl, Alex/0000-0003-1818-0698",,,,,68,38,40,0,54,SOC RANGE MANAGEMENT,LAKEWOOD,"445 UNION BLVD, STE 230, LAKEWOOD, CO 80228-1259 USA",1550-7424,1551-5028,,RANGELAND ECOL MANAG,Rangel.

Poor land management practices in the Ethiopian highlands have caused a significant amount of soil erosion, thereby threatening the productivity of the Ethiopian agricultural system, degrading the health of the aquatic ecosystem, and shortening the life of downstream reservoirs. The Upper Blue Nile basin, because of limited research and availability of data, has been considered as the great unknown. In the recent past, however, more research has been published. Nonetheless, there is no state-of-the-art review that presents research achievements, gaps and future directions. Hence, this paper aims to bridge this gap by reviewing the advances in water resources research in the basin while highlighting research needs and future directions. We report that there have been several research projects that try to understand the biogeochemical processes by collecting information on runoff, groundwater recharge, sediment transport, and tracers. Different types of hydrological models have been applied. Most of the earlier research used simple conceptual and statistical approaches for trend analysis and water balance estimations, mainly using rainfall and evapotranspiration data. More recent research has been using advanced semi-physically/physically based distributed hydrological models using high resolution temporal and spatial data for diverse applications. We identified several research gaps and provided recommendations to address them. While we have witnessed advances in water resources research in the basin, we also foresee opportunities for further advancement.

At the same time, the patent system is directly involved in the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly inventions. The paper analyses the level of attention given to IP rights and to transfer of environmentally sound technologies within international negotiations.

This paper investigated how market conditions affect the economics of flexible IG-CG facilities by analyzing several case studies. The IG-CG facilities used Eucalyptus wood pellets, torrefied wood pellets and Illinois #6 coal as feedstock and produced electricity, FT-liquids, methanol and urea. Results indicated that currently biomass is, compared to coal, too expansive. Therefore, feedstock flexibility is not attractive. Production flexibility between chemical and electricity production under current economic conditions reduces the profitability of the IG-CG facility. Therefore, with state-of-the-art technology and the current economic climate, introducing flexibility to IG-CG facilities is not economically profitable.

However, the majority does not have a formal heritage protection. Part of this building stock has already been renovated, notably through earlier energy saving programmes where additional exterior insulation, new facades and windows were frequently installed with little consideration for the original architecture. Now, 40 years later, these buildings face new renovations. This provides opportunities to improve the energy efficiency, indoor climate and user comfort. At the same time, the original architectural and historical characters lost in previous renovations could be recreated. In this paper, an inter-disciplinary research team illustrates the challenges met in practice to reach a sustainable renovation based on three cases. The case buildings are so-called Landshovdingehus, constructed in the 1930s and owned by a public housing company. The relations between building physics, energy efficiency, embodied energy, and the effect on heritage aspects in renovation are studied. The results demonstrate the potential to reach 30% calculated energy efficiency without investing in ventilation systems. When comparing embodied energy to savings in operational energy a short payback time is achieved. However, focusing on the replacement of windows, the cases illustrate difficulties to recreate heritage values at same time as achieving an air-tight and energy efficient construction. In order to improve the results from the heritage point of view, there is a need for quality assurance of the renovation and building permit process.","[Femenias, Paula; Thuvander, Liane; Johansson, Par; Wahlgren, Paula] Chalmers Univ Technol, Dept Architecture & Civil Engn, S-41296 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Eriksson, Petra] Uppsala Univ, Dept Art Hist, S-62167 Visby, Sweden",Chalmers University of Technology; Uppsala University,"Johansson, P (corresponding author), Chalmers Univ Technol, Dept Architecture & Civil Engn, S-41296 Gothenburg, Sweden.",paula.femenias@chalmers.se; par.johansson@chalmers.se,"Johansson, Pär/A-8305-2016; Femenias, Maria Paula/V-2406-2017","Johansson, Pär/0000-0003-0935-7703; Femenias, Maria Paula/0000-0003-0508-3602; Thuvander, Liane/0000-0002-9031-4323",Swedish Energy Agency within the Programme Save Preserve [40461-1],Swedish Energy Agency within the Programme Save Preserve,"This research has been funded by the Swedish Energy Agency within the Programme Save & Preserve, project number 40461-1.

Since its foundation, the State Theatre has attracted a considerable number of theatregoers, turning into a reliable and respectable brand of the country in terms of dramatic arts. In recent years, however, the brand of the State Theatre has started to be questioned increasingly and loudly by those already engaged in the art of theatre. Two basic duties of the State Theatre are to further the art of theatre to wider masses and to raise it to higher levels. In recent years, however, the only mission of the institution seems to have been reduced to making the art of theatre survive only. The State Theatre is criticized today mostly for failing to produce works that could further the art of theatre to higher levels. The State Theatre still preserves its foundation principles even though the economic and cultural climates of the Republic, out of which it was born, have undergone radical changes today. It has a conservative stand as far as the basic values and principles of the Republic are concerned. The social and cultural structures of Turkey are undergoing a rapid change along with the economic structure of the country. Maintaining its existence as an unchanged state institution in the changing Turkey, the State Theatre seeks to meet the demands of the society today; however, the extent to which it meets these demands is a debatable issue today.","[Goktas, Sema Erbil] Kocaeli Univ, Kocaeli, Turkey",Kocaeli University,"Goktas, ES (corresponding author), Kocaeli Univ, Kocaeli, Turkey.",,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,0,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-53-7,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2016,,,,,323,328,,,,,,6,"Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Social Sciences - Other Topics,BH0OI,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000395727500041,View Full Record in Web of Science

Most studies of seasonal forecast so far have focused on predicting the total amount of summer rainfall averaged over the entire India (i.e., all Indian rainfall index-AIRI). However, it is practically more useful to forecast anomalous seasonal rainfall distribution (anomaly pattern) across India. The unknown science question is to what extent the anomalous rainfall pattern is predictable. This study attempted to address this question. Assessment of the 46-year (1960-2005) hindcast made by the five state-of-the-art ENSEMBLE coupled dynamic models' multi-model ensemble (MME) prediction reveals that the temporal correlation coefficient (TCC) skill for prediction of AIRI is 0.43, while the area averaged TCC skill for prediction of anomalous rainfall pattern is only 0.16. The present study aims to estimate the predictability of ISMR on regional scales by using Predictable Mode Analysis method and to develop a set of physics-based empirical (P-E) models for prediction of ISMR anomaly pattern. We show that the first three observed empirical orthogonal function (EOF) patterns of the ISMR have their distinct dynamical origins rooted in an eastern Pacific-type La Nina, a central Pacific-type La Nina, and a cooling center near dateline, respectively. These equatorial Pacific sea surface temperature anomalies, while located in different longitudes, can all set up a specific teleconnection pattern that affects Indian monsoon and results in different rainfall EOF patterns. Furthermore, the dynamical models' skill for predicting ISMR distribution primarily comes primarily from these three modes. Therefore, these modes can be regarded as potentially predictable modes. If these modes are perfectly predicted, about 51 % of the total observed variability is potentially predictable. Based on understanding the lead-lag relationships between the lower boundary anomalies and the predictable modes, a set of P-E models is established to predict the principal component of each predictable mode, so that the ISMR anomaly pattern can be predicted by using the sum of the predictable modes. Three validation schemes are used to assess the performance of the P-E models' hindcast and independent forecast. The validated TCC skills of the P-E model here are more than doubled that of dynamical models' MME hindcast, suggesting a large room for improvement of the current dynamical prediction. The methodology proposed here can be applied to a wide range of climate prediction and predictability studies. The limitation and future improvement are also discussed.","[Li, Juan; Wang, Bin] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Earth Syst Modeling Ctr, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Li, Juan; Wang, Bin] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Atmospher Sci, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Li, Juan; Wang, Bin] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Int Pacific Res Ctr, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA",Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa,"Wang, B (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Earth Syst Modeling Ctr, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.;Wang, B (corresponding author), Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Atmospher Sci, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.;Wang, B (corresponding author), Univ Hawaii Manoa, Int Pacific Res Ctr, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",juanl@hawaii.edu; wangbin@hawaii.edu,,,NOAA/MAPP Project [NA10OAR4310247]; US National Science Foundation [AGS-1005599]; National Research Foundation (NRF) of Korea through a Global Research Laboratory grant (MEST) [2011-0021927]; APEC Climate Center; US-China Atmosphere-Ocean Research Center - Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology (NUIST),NOAA/MAPP Project; US National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); National Research Foundation (NRF) of Korea through a Global Research Laboratory grant (MEST); APEC Climate Center; US-China Atmosphere-Ocean Research Center - Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology (NUIST),"This work was jointly supported by NOAA/MAPP Project Award Number NA10OAR4310247, the US National Science Foundation awards #AGS-1005599, the National Research Foundation (NRF) of Korea through a Global Research Laboratory grant (MEST, #2011-0021927) and the APEC Climate Center.

They represent ecosystem dynamics by simulating fluxes occurring between the biosphere and atmosphere. However, for a correct flux simulation, it is critical to calibrate the model using robust and state-of-the-art calibration techniques. In this work, we optimize parameters of the Integrated Model of Land Surface Processes (INLAND) using the hierarchical multi-objective calibration method (AMALGAM) to improve the representation of surface processes in a natural ecosystem over the Pampa biome in South America. The calibration was performed using experimental data of energy and CO2 flux collected in a native field located in southern Brazil. We compared simulations using the default and calibrated parameter set. The results show that the calibration of the model significantly improved all fluxes analyzed. The mean errors and bias values were significantly reduced, and the seasonality of fluxes was better represented. This work is one of the first to apply a multi-objective calibration in an LSEM to represent surface fluxes in the Pampa biome, presenting a consistent set of parameters for future applications used in studies of biome land use and land cover.","[Goergen, Guilherme] Fed Univ Pampa UNIPAMPA, Dept Math Bage, BR-96460000 Bage, RS, Brazil; [Valdes, Roilan Hernandez; Degrazia, Gervasio Annes; Roberti, Debora Regina] Fed Univ Santa Maria UFSM, Dept Phys, BR-97105900 Santa Maria, RS, Brazil; [Gotuzzo, Ricardo Acosta] Natl Inst Space Res INPE, Earth Syst Sci Ctr CCST, BR-12200000 Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Herdies, Dirceu Luis; de Goncalves, Luis Gustavo Goncalves] Natl Inst Space Res INPE, Ctr Weather Forecasting & Climate Studies CPTEC, BR-12630000 Sao Paulo, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Pampa; Universidade Federal de Santa Maria (UFSM),"Goergen, G (corresponding author), Fed Univ Pampa UNIPAMPA, Dept Math Bage, BR-96460000 Bage, RS, Brazil.;Roberti, DR (corresponding author), Fed Univ Santa Maria UFSM, Dept Phys, BR-97105900 Santa Maria, RS, Brazil.",guilherme.goergen@gmail.com; roylanhv@gmail.com; gervasiodegrazia@gmail.com; ricardo.acosta@inpe.br; dherdies@gmail.com; gustavo.degoncalves@gmail.com; debora@ufsm.br,"Roberti, Debora Regina/AAA-9152-2020; Roberti, Débora R./D-3453-2014; Herdies, Dirceu/C-6675-2013","Roberti, Debora Regina/0000-0002-3902-0952; Herdies, Dirceu/0000-0002-2872-8453; Goergen, Guilherme/0000-0002-6781-8638; de Goncalves, Luis Gustavo/0000-0002-1571-0916",Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personal (CAPES-Brazil),Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personal (CAPES-Brazil),This study was financed in part by Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personal (CAPES-Brazil).,,59,0,0,0,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3263,,GEOSCIENCES,Geosciences,DEC,2020,12,,,,,,479,10.3390/geosciences10120479,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/geosciences10120479,,,26,"Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Geology,PJ9WQ,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000602108400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study therefore engages homeowners and various construction workers in a qualitative study to analyze how rainfall affects the building of houses. A total of 75 participants, comprising 20 homeowners and 55 construction workers were purposively selected to share their experiences about the impact of rainfall on the construction of houses using in-depth interviews. The narratives of the participants made several revelations to deepen knowledge on the effect of climatic conditions such as rainfall on housing construction. The study revealed that rainfall causes financial losses to homeowners and creates hazardous work environments for construction workers. Financial losses are encountered through the destruction of building materials, increases in the cost of building materials in the wet season and extra labour costs incurred in carrying out reworks. This challenge posed by extreme rainfall has implications of hindering many prospective homeowners in achieving their aspiration of becoming homeowners.","[Adu-Gyamfi, Albert; Poku-Boansi, Michael; Darpoh, Leonard; Asibey, Michael Osei; Owusu-Ansah, Justice Kufour] KNUST, Coll Art & Built Environm, Fac Built Environm, Dept Planning, Kumasi, Ghana",Kwame Nkrumah University Science & Technology,"Adu-Gyamfi, A (corresponding author), KNUST, Coll Art & Built Environm, Fac Built Environm, Dept Planning, Kumasi, Ghana.",adugyamfialbert@hotmail.com,"Asibey, Michael Osei/P-2396-2016; Poku-Boansi, Michael/AGZ-8640-2022","Asibey, Michael Osei/0000-0002-5534-2695; ",,,,,64,0,0,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0267-3037,1466-1810,,HOUSING STUD,Hous.

State-of-the-art haze removal methods generally work well with light haze conditions, however when haze gets heavier, the physical model tend to produce over-shadowed, noisy, and color distorted restorations. A new physical model has been proposed in this paper for heavy haze weathers. An airlight vector map has been proposed to address the problem caused by uneven aerosol distribution w.r.t. altitude variation. A Random Decision Forest model has been adopted to deal with the additional light attenuation and transmission map underestimation problem caused by heavy haze. Experiment shows the proposed model produces much better visual restoration for heavy haze weathers compared to state-of-the-art methods in terms of colour fidelity, noise reduction, and overall contrast.","[Chen, Jie; Chau, Lap-Pui] Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Elect & Elect Engn, Singapore 639798, Singapore",Nanyang Technological University & National Institute of Education (NIE) Singapore; Nanyang Technological University,"Chen, J (corresponding author), Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Elect & Elect Engn, Singapore 639798, Singapore.",JChen5@ntu.edu.sg; ELPChau@ntu.edu.sg,"Chau, Lap-Pui/A-5149-2011","Chen, Jie/0000-0001-8419-4620; Chau, Lap-Pui/0000-0003-4932-0593",,,,,8,2,2,0,0,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",0271-4302,,978-1-4799-8391-9,IEEE INT SYMP CIRC S,,,2015,,,,,1590,1593,,,,,,4,"Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Engineering,BE4BG,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000371471001218,View Full Record in Web of Science

Detailed intercomparisons are made with other datasets including 1) reduced observation reanalyses (RedObs) whose exclusion of satellite data renders them an important independent diagnostic tool; 2) a moisture budget residual LHF estimate using reanalysis moisture transport, atmospheric storage, and satellite precipitation; 3) the ECMWF Reanalysis 5 (ERA5); 4) Remote Sensing Systems (RSS) single-sensor passive microwave and scatterometer wind speed retrievals; and 5) several sea surface temperature (SST) datasets. Large disparities remain in near-global satellite LHF trends and their regional expression over the 1990-2010 period, during which time the interdecadal Pacific oscillation changed sign. The budget residual diagnostics support the smaller RedObs LHF trends. The satellites, ERA5, and RedObs are reasonably consistent in identifying contributions by the 10-m wind speed variations to the LHF trend patterns. However, contributions by the near-surface vertical humidity gradient from satellites and ERA5 trend upward in time with respect to the RedObs ensemble and show less agreement in trend patterns. Problems with wind speed retrievals from Special Sensor Microwave Imager/Sounder satellite sensors, excessive upward trends in trends in Optimal Interpolation Sea Surface Temperature (OISST AVHRR-Only) data used in most satellite LHF estimates, and uncertainties associated with poor satellite coverage before the mid-1990s are noted. Possibly erroneous trends are also identified in ERA5 LHF associated with the onset of scatterometer wind data assimilation in the early 1990s.","[Robertson, Franklin R.; Roberts, Jason B.] NASA, Marshall Space Flight Ctr, Huntsville, AL 35808 USA; [Bosilovich, Michael G.] NASA, GSFC Global Modeling & Assimilat Off, Greenbelt, MD USA; [Bentamy, Abderrahim] Inst Francais Rech & Exploitat Mer IFREMER, Lab Oceanog Spatiale, Brest, France; [Clayson, Carol Anne] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [Fennig, Karsten; Schroeder, Marc; Gutenstein, Marloes] Deutsch Wetterdienst, Satellite Based Climate Monitoring, Offenbach, Germany; [Tomita, Hiroyuki] Nagoya Univ, Inst Space Earth Environm Res, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan; [Compo, Gilbert P.; Sardeshmukh, Prashant; Slivinski, Laura C.] Univ Colorado, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Compo, Gilbert P.; Sardeshmukh, Prashant; Slivinski, Laura C.] NOAA, Phys Sci Lab, Boulder, CO USA; [Hersbach, Hans] European Ctr Medium Range Weather Forecasts, Reading, Berks, England; [Kobayashi, Chiaki] Meteorol Res Inst, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Ricciardulli, Lucrezia] Remote Sensing Syst, Santa Rosa, CA USA",National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); Ifremer; Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution; Deutscher Wetterdienst; Nagoya University; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF); Meteorological Research Institute - Japan,"Robertson, FR (corresponding author), NASA, Marshall Space Flight Ctr, Huntsville, AL 35808 USA.",pete.robertson@nasa.gov,"Tomita, Hiroyuki/AAA-3635-2019","Tomita, Hiroyuki/0000-0003-2693-2044","NASA Energy and Water Cycle Study (NEWS); EUMETSAT member states through CMSAF; Office of Science of the U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC0205CH11231]; U.S. DOE, Office of Science Biological and Environmental Research (BER); NOAA Climate Program Office; NOAA Physical Sciences Laboratory; NASA Earth Science Division; JSPS [JP18H03726, JP18H03737, JP19H05696]; JAXA Announcement EO-2","NASA Energy and Water Cycle Study (NEWS); EUMETSAT member states through CMSAF; Office of Science of the U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); U.S. DOE, Office of Science Biological and Environmental Research (BER)(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); NOAA Climate Program Office(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); NOAA Physical Sciences Laboratory; NASA Earth Science Division; JSPS(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); JAXA Announcement EO-2","FRR, JBR, and MGB acknowledge support for this investigation through the NASA Energy and Water Cycle Study (NEWS), Dr. Jared Entin, Program Manager.

The present study investigates further potential benefits with respect to precipitation, based on a small ensemble of high-resolution simulations with WRF with grid spacings up to 1 km. The skill of each experiment is evaluated regarding the temporal and spatial performance of the simulation of precipitation of one year over both a mountainous region in southwestern Germany and a mainly flat region in northern Germany. This study allows us to differentiate between the impact of grid spacing, topography, and convection parameterization. Furthermore, the performance of a state-of-the-art convection parameterization scheme in the gray zone of convection is evaluated against an explicit calculation of convection only. Our evaluation demonstrates the following: high-resolution simulations (5 and 1 km) are generally able to represent the diurnal cycle, structure, and intensity distribution of precipitation, when compared to observational datasets such as radar data and interpolated station data. The influence of the improved representation of the topography at higher resolution (1 km) becomes apparent in complex terrain, where the localization of precipitation maxima is more accurate, although these maxima are overestimated. In flat areas, differences in spatial evaluations arise between simulations with parameterized and explicitly calculated convection, whereas smaller grid spacings (1 km vs 5 km) show hardly any impact on precipitation results.","[Wagner, Andreas] Univ Augsburg, Inst Geog, Augsburg, Germany; [Heinzeller, Dominikus] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res IMK IFU, KIT Campus Alpin, Garmisch Partenkirchen, Germany; [Wagner, Sven; Rummler, Thomas] Univ Augsburg, Inst Geog, Augsburg, Germany; [Kunstmann, Harald] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res IMK IFU, KIT Campus Alpin, Garmisch Partenkirchen, Germany; [Kunstmann, Harald] Univ Augsburg, Inst Geog, Augsburg, Germany; [Heinzeller, Dominikus] Univ Colorado Boulder, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Boulder, CO USA; [Heinzeller, Dominikus] NOAA, OAR, ESRL, Global Syst Div, Boulder, CO USA; [Wagner, Sven] Fraunhofer IAO, Stuttgart, Germany",University of Augsburg; Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; University of Augsburg; Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; University of Augsburg; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Wagner, A (corresponding author), Univ Augsburg, Inst Geog, Augsburg, Germany.",wagner@geo.uni-augsburg.de,"Kunstmann, Harald/A-7071-2013; Wagner, Sven/HHD-1329-2022; Heinzeller, Dominikus/AAQ-3008-2020","Kunstmann, Harald/0000-0001-9573-1743; Heinzeller, Dominikus/0000-0003-2962-1049; Wagner, Sven/0000-0002-2223-8082","BMBF (Federal Ministry of Education and Research, Germany)","BMBF (Federal Ministry of Education and Research, Germany)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF))","The research was conducted in the framework of the SYNOPSE project, with the financial support of the BMBF (Federal Ministry of Education and Research, Germany).

Here, we update state of knowledge regarding proboscideans in South America subsequent to the publication of Simpson and Paula Couto (1957). The taxonomy of South American proboscideans is now stable and two species are recognized, Notiomastodon platensis and Cuvieronius hyodon. The former had a wide distribution in South America (from lowlands to highlands and from east to west coasts), while the latter was restricted to Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia. Although records of Notiomastodon are abundant and occur in almost overlapping geographic distribution with Cuvieronius, they have never been recorded in the same locality. Here, we evaluated over 500 South American localities with proboscidean remains, although only cranial and dental specimens show recognizable diagnostic features. As both proboscideans in South America had a generalist-opportunist alimentary strategy, a competitive exclusion probably precluded their sympatry. Their origin is most probably related to independent migrations from Central America during the Great American Biotic Interchange. They are not sister-taxa - Cuvieronius hyodon is sister-taxon of Rhynchotherium, and this clade is closer to Notiomastodon platensis than to the other proboscideans, supporting the hypothesis of independent origins. Notiomastodon platensis has a continuous record from the Early Pleistocene to Early Holocene, when it became extinct, probably due to synergy of human impact and climatic changes during the Pleistocene/Holocene transition. In contrast, extinction of Cuvieronius hyodon happened much earlier, and it was not related to the terminal Pleistocene event that lead the extinction of selected megafauna in South America, including Notiomastodon.

However, the current energy-saving design is usually carried out after the layout design of buildings, which limits the energy-saving effect. This study supposes to improve the integrated energy performance of urban complex before the architectural design. Based on the operating characteristics of distributed energy resource system, we study the reasonable building area ratios of urban complex in different cli-mate zones in China by the energy simulation, scenario analysis and multi-criteria assessment methods. Primary energy consumption saving rate, carbon dioxide emission reduction rate and operating cost sav -ing rate are selected to assess the integrated energy performance of urban complex. The results indicate that (1) building area ratios have an appreciable impact on the integrated energy benefits of urban com-plex, while the climatic conditions have less impact on the optimization of its building area ratio scheme; (2) area ratio scheme with more residence and balanced ratio of other basic functions show the optimal integrated energy benefits of the urban complex with DER system; (3) optimal building area ratio scheme of urban complexes in different types and different climate conditions achieve an integrated saving rate of 22.2%-46.5%. The main findings of this study could be a useful quantitative reference for the pre-planning of urban complex, which also contribute to the energy conservation and pollution reduction of urban area in the future.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

We argue here that Rhythmic Buildings incorporate many aspects of adaptation through an integrated approach. Rhythmic buildings react to the various parameters of the sustainability context. This conceptual paper develops a framework for adaptable architecture that includes the sustainability context based on the three pillars of sustainability and incorporates systems thinking. Building on a qualitative literature review the research categorises themes by considering practice examples and illustrates the drivers that motivate the research of adaptable architecture. We present a timeline of adaptability strategies demonstrating how the field has shifted and focussed on specific challenges such as climate change. Our research shows that current practices mainly consider buildings and building components that are responsive to the changing requirements for user comfort and energy reduction. This manuscript proposes a structured framework that considers adaptability and recommends a strategy of Rhythmic Buildings for future adaptable design. The framework uses a systems approach to identify the rhythms of the sustainability context which guides future adaptable concepts as input and output for a balanced design. Finally, we present our vision for Rhythmic Buildings and how this can be taken forward by researcher and practitioner alike.","[van Ellen, L. A.; Bridgens, B.

For simplicity reasons, the different functions (heating, cooling, hot water) are managed on the water side and therefore no inversion between the evaporator and gas cooler role is required. The climate typical of North Italy is considered. The analysis of the R744 chiller/heat pump is based on an original simplified method, which is able to predict the energy performance of the unit based only on its performance data at the nominal rating conditions. The method was validated against experimental data. A comparison with a state-of-the-art R410A unit is presented. The monthly analysis shows that the CO2 unit is very efficient in hot water production, but penalised in heating and cooling service, so that the total energy consumption in the year is 20% lower for the R410A.","[Brignoli, R.; Cecchinato, L.; Fornasieri, E.; Minetto, S.] Univ Padua, Dipartimento Fis Tecn, Via Venezia 1, I-35131 Padua, Italy; [Girotto, S.] Enex S r l, Ponzano, Italy",University of Padua,"Brignoli, R (corresponding author), Univ Padua, Dipartimento Fis Tecn, Via Venezia 1, I-35131 Padua, Italy.",silvia.minetto@unipd.it,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,4,INT INST REFRIGERATION,PARIS,"177 BLVD MALESHERBES, F-75017 PARIS, FRANCE",1025-9031,,978-2-913149-88-5,CONGRES INT FROID,,,2011,,,,,2504,+,,,,,,2,Thermodynamics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Thermodynamics,BCK65,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000310485801061,View Full Record in Web of Science

We assessed how the shift of the high-altitude treeline ecotone might affect soil organic matter (SOM) dynamics. On the gentle slopes of Mali Iremel in the Southern Urals, we (1) determined the differences in SOM stocks and properties from the tundra at 1360 m above sea level (a.s.l.) to the subalpine forest at 1260 m a.s.l., and (2) measured carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) mineralization from tundra and forest soils at 7 and 20 degrees C in a 6-month incubation experiment. C stocks of organic layers were 3.6 +/- 0.3 kg C m(-2) in the tundra and 1.9 +/- 0.2 kg C m(-2) in the forest. Mineral soils down to the bedrock stored significantly more C in the forest, and thus, total soil C stocks were slightly but insignificantly greater in the forest (+3 kg C m(-2)). Assuming a space for time approach based on tree ages suggests that the soil C sink due to the forest expansion during the last century was at most 30 g C m(-2) yr(-1). Diffuse reflective infrared spectroscopy and scanning calorimetry revealed that SOM under forest was less humified in both organic and mineral horizons and, therefore, contained more available substrate. Consistent with this result, C mineralization rates of organic layers and A horizons of the forest were two to four times greater than those of tundra soils. This difference was similar in magnitude to the effect of increasing the incubation temperature from 7 to 20 degrees C. Hence, indirect climate change effects through an upward expansion of forests can be much larger than direct warming effects (Delta 0.3 K across the treeline). Net N mineralization was 2.5 to six times greater in forest than in tundra soils, suggesting that an advancing treeline likely increases N availability. This may provide a nutritional basis for the fivefold increase in plant biomass and a tripling in productivity from the tundra to the forest. In summary, our results suggest that an upward expansion of forest has small net effects on C storage in soils but leads to changes in SOM quality, accelerates C cycling and increases net N mineralization, which in turn might stimulate plant growth and thus C sequestration in tree biomass.","[Kammer, Adrian; Hagedorn, Frank; Rigling, Andreas] Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res WSL, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Shevchenko, Ilya] Ural State Forest Engn Univ, Fac Forestry, Ekaterinburg, Russia; [Leifeld, Jens] Res Stn Agroscope Reckenholz Tanikon ART, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland; [Guggenberger, Georg] Inst Soil Sci, D-30419 Hannover, Germany; [Goryacheva, Tamara; Moiseev, Pavel] Russian Acad Sci, Inst Plant & Anim Ecol, Ekaterinburg, Russia","Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape Research; Ural State Forest Engineering University; Swiss Federal Research Station Agroscope; Swiss Federal Research Station for Agroecology & Agriculture; Russian Academy of Sciences; Institute of Plant & Animal Ecology of the Russian Academy of Sciences","Hagedorn, F (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res WSL, Zurcherstr 111, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland.",hagedorn@wsl.ch,"Moiseev, Pavel A/M-9132-2013; Leifeld, Jens/GYR-0349-2022; Leifeld, Jens/A-3298-2014; Rigling, Andreas/B-9665-2013; Guggenberger, Georg/C-8423-2013","Moiseev, Pavel A/0000-0003-4808-295X; Leifeld, Jens/0000-0002-7245-9852; Leifeld, Jens/0000-0002-7245-9852; Rigling, Andreas/0000-0003-1944-4042; Guggenberger, Georg/0000-0002-6962-8264; Hagedorn, Frank/0000-0001-5218-7776",INTAS [01-0052],INTAS(INTASEuropean Commission),"This work was supported by the INTAS grant no. 01-0052.

In the future, flood events during storms are expected to occur more frequently and to be more severe due to sea-level rise, changes in wind and weather patterns, and the deterioration of coral reefs. Hence, disaster managers and coastal planners are in urgent need of decision-support tools. In the short-term, these tools can be applied in Early Warning Systems (EWS) that can help to prepare for and respond to impending storm-driven flood events. In the long-term, future scenarios of flooding events enable coastal communities and managers to plan and implement adequate risk-reduction strategies. Modeling tools that are used in currently available coastal flood EWS and future scenarios have been developed for open-coast sandy shorelines, which have only limited applicability for coral reef-lined shorelines. The tools need to be able to predict local sea levels, offshore waves, as well as their nearshore transformation over the reefs, and translate this information to onshore flood levels. In addition, future scenarios require long-term projections of coral reef growth, reef composition, and shoreline change. To address these challenges, we have formed the UFORiC (Understanding Flooding of Reef-lined Coasts) working group that outlines its perspectives on data and model requirements to develop EWS for storms and scenarios specific to coral reef-lined coastlines. It reviews the state-of-the-art methods that can currently be incorporated in such systems and provides an outlook on future improvements as new data sources and enhanced methods become available.","[Winter, Gundula; van Dongeren, Ap; McCall, Robert; Reyns, Johan] Deltares, Unit Marine & Coastal Syst, Delft, Netherlands; [Storlazzi, Curt; Vitousek, Sean] US Geol Survey, Pacific Coastal & Marine Sci Ctr, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA; [Hoeke, Ron] CSIRO, Sea Level Waves & Coastal Extremes Grp, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Skirving, William] NOAA, NESDIS, Ctr Satellite Applicat & Res, Cranbrook, Qld, Australia; [Marra, John] NOAA, NESDIS, Natl Ctr Environm Informat, Honolulu, HI USA; [Aucan, Jerome] Res Inst Dev, Lab Studies Geophys & Spatial Oceanog, Noumea, New Caledonia; [Widlansky, Matthew] Univ Hawaii, Int Pacific Res Ctr, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Becker, Janet] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Mech & Aerosp Engn, San Diego, CA 92103 USA; [Perry, Chris] Univ Exeter, Dept Geog, Exeter, Devon, England; [Masselink, Gerd] Univ Pymouth, Sch Biol & Marine Sci, Plymouth, Devon, England; [Lowe, Ryan; Pomeroy, Andrew] Univ Western Australia, UWA Oceans Inst, Perth, WA, Australia; [Lowe, Ryan; Pomeroy, Andrew] Univ Western Australia, Oceans Grad Sch, Perth, WA, Australia; [Ford, Murray] Univ Auckland, Sch Environm, Auckland, New Zealand; [Mendez, Fernando; Rueda, Ana] Univ Cantabria, Dept Sci & Tech Water & Environm, Santander, Spain; [Wandres, Moritz] Pacific Community SPC, Geosci Energy & Maritime Div, Suva, Fiji",Deltares; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Hawaii System; University of California System; University of California San Diego; University of Exeter; University of Western Australia; University of Western Australia; University of Auckland; Universidad de Cantabria,"Storlazzi, C (corresponding author), US Geol Survey, Pacific Coastal & Marine Sci Ctr, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA.",cstorlazzi@usgs.gov,"; Masselink, Gerd/B-6743-2015; Skirving, William/E-7927-2011; Lowe, Ryan/A-5032-2012","Wandres, Moritz/0000-0002-3063-4448; Masselink, Gerd/0000-0001-6079-7611; Skirving, William/0000-0003-0167-6427; Lowe, Ryan/0000-0002-7080-8406; Perry, Chris/0000-0001-9398-2418",National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA); U.S. Geological Survey (USGS); Deltares; Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Group on Earth Observations (GEO) Blue Planet initiative,National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)(United States Geological Survey); Deltares; Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)(Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)); Group on Earth Observations (GEO) Blue Planet initiative,"This research is a product of the UFORiC working group, which was supported by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Deltares, and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), and under the auspices of the Group on Earth Observations (GEO) Blue Planet initiative.

The state-of-art of key technologies for PtL fuel production as well as the environmental and techno-economic performance of the resulting fuel in comparison with fossil and biomass-derived jet fuel are reviewed.","[Schmidt, Patrick; Weindorf, Werner; Raksha, Tetyana] Ludwig Bolkow Syst Tech GmbH LBST, Daimlerstr 15, D-85521 Ottobrunn, Germany; [Batteiger, Valentin; Roth, Arne] Bauhaus Luftfahrt eV, Willy Messerschmitt Str 1, D-82024 Taufkirchen, Germany",,"Schmidt, P (corresponding author), Ludwig Bolkow Syst Tech GmbH LBST, Daimlerstr 15, D-85521 Ottobrunn, Germany.",patrick.schmidt@lbst.de,,"Batteiger, Valentin/0000-0001-6246-8256",German Ministry for Transport and Digital Infrastructure (BMVI) of the Mobility and Fuel Strategy of the German Government; German Environment Agency (UBA); Research Association for Combustion Engines (FVV); German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA),German Ministry for Transport and Digital Infrastructure (BMVI) of the Mobility and Fuel Strategy of the German Government; German Environment Agency (UBA); Research Association for Combustion Engines (FVV); German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA),"This paper builds on results from several research studies financed by the German Ministry for Transport and Digital Infrastructure (BMVI) in the context of the Mobility and Fuel Strategy of the German Government, the German Environment Agency (UBA), the Research Association for Combustion Engines (FVV), and the German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA).",,16,83,83,9,74,WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH,WEINHEIM,"POSTFACH 101161, 69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY",0009-286X,1522-2640,,CHEM-ING-TECH,Chem.

However, these models were predominantly based on projection of an El Nino-like warming pattern. Recent studies suggested that a La Nina-like warming pattern is also possible. Here we compare the responses of TC track density (TCTD) over the western North Pacific and North Atlantic to the two distinct global warming patterns. We find that the La Nina-like warming pattern reduces western North Pacific TCTD except in the South China Sea and along China coast and increases NA TCTD, while the El Nino-like warming pattern generally reduces TCTD in both basins. This is due to different responses of large-scale dynamic/thermodynamic conditions to the distinct zonal sea surface temperature gradients associated with the two warming patterns. These results help better understand potential future change in TC tracks.","[Zhao, Jiuwei; Zhan, Ruifen] Fudan Univ, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Jiuwei; Zhan, Ruifen] Fudan Univ, Inst Atmospher Sci, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Jiuwei; Zhan, Ruifen; Wang, Yuqing] Chinese Acad Meteorol Sci, State Key Lab Severe Weather, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yuqing] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Int Pacific Res Ctr, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci & Technol, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Wang, Yuqing] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci & Technol, Dept Atmospher Sci, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Zhao, Jiuwei] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol NUSIT, Minist Educ KLME, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster, Nanjing, Peoples R China",Fudan University; Fudan University; Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences (CAMS); Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa,"Zhan, RF (corresponding author), Fudan Univ, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Shanghai, Peoples R China.;Zhan, RF (corresponding author), Fudan Univ, Inst Atmospher Sci, Shanghai, Peoples R China.;Zhan, RF (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Meteorol Sci, State Key Lab Severe Weather, Beijing, Peoples R China.",zhanrf@fudan.edu.cn,"Wang, Yuqing/H-4515-2014","Wang, Yuqing/0000-0002-1691-8161; Zhan, Ruifen/0000-0001-7209-0904; zhao, jiuwei/0000-0001-9146-7500","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41875114, 41775060, 41875057, 41575052]; Open Research Fund of the State Key Laboratory of Severe Weather, Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences [2017Z017]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Open Research Fund of the State Key Laboratory of Severe Weather, Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences","We are grateful to Prof. Li Tao and Prof. Lin Chen for their help in conducting model experiments.

We address these uncertainties through a two-pronged approach by compiling a state of the art database of the emissions potentials for 80 European forest species, and by a model assessment and inter-comparison, both at the local and regional scale, under present and projected future climatic conditions. We coupled three contrasting isoprenoid models with the ecophysiological forest model GOTILWA+ to evaluate leaf and ecosystem isoprenoid emissions, build an emissions inventory for European forests, and to consider model behaviour in present climate and under projected future climate change conditions. Hourly, daily and annual isoprene emissions as simulated by the models were evaluated against flux measurements. The validation highlighted a general model capacity to capture gross fluxes but inefficiencies in capturing short term variability. A regional inventory of isoprenoid emissions for European forests was created using each of the three modelling approaches. The models agreed on an average European emissions budget of 1.03 TgC a(-1) for isoprene and 0.97 TgC a(-1) for monoterpenes for the period 1960-1990, which was dominated by a few species with largest aerial coverage. Species contribution to total emissions depended both on species emission potential and geographical distribution. For projected future climate conditions, however, emissions budgets proved highly model dependent, illustrating the current uncertainty associated with isoprenoid emissions responses to potential future conditions. These results suggest that current model estimates of isoprenoid emissions concur well, but future estimates are highly uncertain. We conclude that development of reliable models is highly urgent, but for the time being, future BVOC emission scenario estimates should consider results from an ensemble of available emission models.","[Keenan, T.; Sabate, S.; Gracia, C.; Penuelas, J.] Autonomous Univ Barcelona, CREAF, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain; [Niinemets, Ue.] Estonian Univ Life Sci, Inst Agr & Environm Sci, EE-51014 Tartu, Estonia; [Sabate, S.; Gracia, C.] Univ Barcelona, Dept Ecol, E-08007 Barcelona, Spain; [Penuelas, J.] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, CSIC, CREAF, CEAB,Global Ecol Unit, Bellaterra 08193, Spain",Autonomous University of Barcelona; Centro de Investigacion Ecologica y Aplicaciones Forestales (CREAF); University of Barcelona; Estonian University of Life Sciences; University of Barcelona; Autonomous University of Barcelona; Centro de Investigacion Ecologica y Aplicaciones Forestales (CREAF); Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Centre d'Estudis Avancats de Blanes (CEAB),"Keenan, T (corresponding author), Autonomous Univ Barcelona, CREAF, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain.",t.keenan@creaf.uab.es,"Keenan, Trevor F./B-2744-2010; Keenan, Trevor/AAY-7786-2020; Penuelas, Josep/D-9704-2011; Niinemets, Ülo/A-3816-2008; Sabaté, Santiago/I-3395-2016","Keenan, Trevor F./0000-0002-3347-0258; Keenan, Trevor/0000-0002-3347-0258; Penuelas, Josep/0000-0002-7215-0150; Niinemets, Ülo/0000-0002-3078-2192; Sabaté, Santiago/0000-0003-1854-0761",GREEN-CYCLES [MRTN-CT-2004-512464]; European Commission's Sixth Framework program [GOCECT2003-506675]; Spanish Ministry of Education and Science [CGL2006-04025]; Consolider Montes [CSD2008-00040]; Catalan Government [SGR2008-00312]; Estonian Science Foundation [7645]; Estonian Ministry of Education and Science [SF1090065s07],"GREEN-CYCLES; European Commission's Sixth Framework program(European Commission); Spanish Ministry of Education and Science(Spanish Government); Consolider Montes; Catalan Government; Estonian Science Foundation; Estonian Ministry of Education and Science(Ministry of Education and Research, Estonia)","This study was funded through the GREEN-CYCLES Marie-Curie Biogeochemistry and Climate Change Research and Training Network (MRTN-CT-2004-512464) supported by the European Commission's Sixth Framework program.

The models art, tested at 657 stations representing the wide range of climate variability across the country. It is found that the simple first-order Markov chain (SMC) model is capable of reproducing the statistics of dry and wet spell durations reasonably well. However, the SMC model also yields a substantial over-dispersion problem, resulting in a considerable reduction of interannual variability in monthly total precipitation. This is mainly attributable to smaller variability in the frequency of wet days. This inadequacy is improved by adding a separate model to simulate the number of wet days in a year. The modification to the SMC model has all advantage over alternative approaches using higher order Markov chains since it requires the estimation of fewer parameters. The generation of daily precipitation amounts is tested using the exponential, gamma, skewed normal, and mixed exponential probability distributions, with one to three parameters. Results indicate that the mixed exponential distribution is superior in general, especially during warmer months, while the gamma distribution is adequate for winter months.","Meteorol Serv Canada, Climate Res Branch, Downsview, ON M3H 5T4, Canada; Meteorol Serv Canada, Adaptat & Impact Res Grp, Downsview, ON M3H 5T4, Canada",Environment & Climate Change Canada; Meteorological Service of Canada; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Meteorological Service of Canada,"Wan, H (corresponding author), Meteorol Serv Canada, Climate Res Branch, 4905 Dufferin St, Downsview, ON M3H 5T4, Canada.",hui.wan@ec.gc.ca,,,,,,,20,41,41,0,7,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0705-5900,1480-9214,,ATMOS OCEAN,Atmos.-Ocean,MAR,2005,1,,,,23,32,,10.3137/ao.430102,http://dx.doi.org/10.3137/ao.430102,,,10,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences; Oceanography,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences; Oceanography,914ZX,,Bronze,,,12/21/22,WOS:000228268500002,View Full Record in Web of Science

The stateof-the-art methods in SD-QPF include radar extrapolations, numerical weather prediction (NWP) models, and hybrid methods that combine the two. Despite the diversity of methods that have been used, SD-QPF remains difficult: even sophisticated methods may not be able to consistently outperform relatively simple baselines such as Persistence. Methods in Deep Learning (DL) have demonstrated significant and often unexpected improvements across a wide variety of domains ranging from image and video processing to machine translation and speech recognition. Emerging research has suggested that that DL may improve point predictions in the context of very short-term - 0-2 hours - distributed QPF (VSD-QPF) by taking advantage of growing data from in-situ weather sensors as well as remote sensors such as radar and satellites, along with advances in computing. Here we examine the hypothesis that DL can improve VSD-QPF, specifically point predictions, based on observed hourly precipitation data over the contiguous United States, by leveraging a Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network for 1-hour precipitation nowcasting. We find the DL approach performs better than the baseline method of Persistence and a state-of-the-art method using Optical Flow.","[Yadav, Nishant; Ganguly, Auroop R.] Northeastern Univ, Sustainabil & Data Sci SDS Lab, Boston, MA 02115 USA",Northeastern University,"Yadav, N (corresponding author), Northeastern Univ, Sustainabil & Data Sci SDS Lab, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",yaday.ni@northeastern.edu; a.ganguly@northeastern.edu,,,US National Science Foundation's BIGDATAAward [1447587]; US National Science Foundation's INQUIREAward [1735505]; US National Science Foundation's CyberSEES Award [1442728],US National Science Foundation's BIGDATAAward; US National Science Foundation's INQUIREAward; US National Science Foundation's CyberSEES Award,"Funding for this work was provided by the US National Science Foundation's BIGDATAAward (1447587), INQUIREAward (1735505) and CyberSEES Award (1442728).

We examine oceanic contribution to polar motion using estimates from a data-assimilating ocean general circulation model and satellite radar altimeter observations. The data include model estimates of variations in oceanic mass (OBP) and meridional and zonal velocities. Sea level anomalies from TOPEX/Poseidon (T/P) satellite altimeter measurements and steric sea surface height changes deduced from the model are also used to estimate OBP effects. Estimated oceanic contributions from both the model and T/P show considerably better agreement with polar motion observations compared with results from previous studies. The improvement is particularly significant at intraseasonal timescales. Both OBP and ocean current variations provide important contributions to polar motion. At intraseasonal timescales the oceans appear to be a dominant contributor to residual polar motion not accounted for by the atmosphere. The oceans also play an important role in seasonal excitation. Combined OBP and ocean current contributions explain much of the residual semiannual variability.","Univ Texas, Space Res Ctr, Austin, TX 78759 USA; Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Astron Observ, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China; Univ Texas, Dept Geol Sci, Austin, TX 78759 USA","University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Shanghai Astronomical Observatory, CAS; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin","Chen, JL (corresponding author), Univ Texas, Space Res Ctr, 3925 W Braker Lane,Suite 200, Austin, TX 78759 USA.",chen@csr.utexas.edu; crwilson@mail.utexas.edu; hxg@center.shao.ac.cn; yhzhou@center.shaso.ac.cn; tapley@csr.utexas.edu,,"Chen, Jianli/0000-0001-5405-8441; Tapley, Byron/0000-0003-3689-5750",,,,,30,19,20,0,6,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",2169-9313,2169-9356,,J GEOPHYS RES-SOL EA,J.

Understanding the sensitivity of respiratory processes to temperature is central for quantifying the climate-carbon cycle feedback. We approximated the sensitivity of terrestrial ecosystem respiration to air temperature (Q(10)) across 60 FLUXNET sites with the use of a methodology that circumvents confounding effects. Contrary to previous findings, our results suggest that Q(10) is independent of mean annual temperature, does not differ among biomes, and is confined to values around 1.4 +/- 0.1. The strong relation between photosynthesis and respiration, by contrast, is highly variable among sites. The results may partly explain a less pronounced climate-carbon cycle feedback than suggested by current carbon cycle climate models.","[Mahecha, Miguel D.; Reichstein, Markus; Carvalhais, Nuno; Lasslop, Gitta] Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, D-07745 Jena, Germany; [Mahecha, Miguel D.; Seneviratne, Sonia I.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Carvalhais, Nuno] Univ Nova Lisboa, FCT, P-2829516 Caparica, Portugal; [Lange, Holger] Norsk Inst Skog Landskap, N-1431 As, Norway; [Vargas, Rodrigo] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Ammann, Christof] Agroscope ART, Fed Res Stn, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland; [Arain, M.

The MSU/AMSU-observed tropical T-LS trend is first empirically separated into a dynamic component associated with the BDC changes and a radiative component due to the atmospheric composition changes. The derived change in the dynamic component suggests that the annual mean BDC has accelerated in the last 30 years (at the 90% confidence interval), with most of the change coming from the Southern Hemisphere. The annual mean Northern Hemisphere contribution to the acceleration is not statistically significant. The radiative component of tropical T-LS trends is independently checked using observed changes in stratospheric composition. It is shown that the changes in ozone, stratospheric aerosols, well-mixed greenhouse gases, and water vapor make important contributions to the radiative component of tropical T-LS trends. Despite large uncertainties in lower stratospheric cooling associated with uncertainties in observed ozone and water vapor changes, this derived radiative component agrees with the empirically inferred radiative component, both in terms of its average value and small seasonal dependence. By establishing a relationship between tropical residual vertical velocity at 70 hPa and T-LS, we show that the relative strengthening of the annual mean BDC is about 2.1% per decade for 1980-2009, supporting the results from state-of-the-art chemistry-climate model simulations.","[Fu, Q.; Hartmann, D.

The analysis of the 70 selected papers revealed that, in the first place, the literature has not yet reached a consensus about the definitions and the main dimensions surrounding the process of IMP for sustainable development. In the second place, findings concerning the extent to what and how city international partnering can be drivers for sustainable urban development have also been dispersal. By integrating the results from previous studies on IMP in the area of sustainable development, this paper provides a conceptual framework that synthesizes and structures the main aspects of the research area and based on it, a holistic analysis of its state of the art.

This approach to AmI extends the connotations of AmI along social, spatial, and temporal dimensions.","[Fisher, Douglas H.] Vanderbilt Univ, Nashville, TN 37235 USA; [Maher, Mary Lou] Univ Maryland, Baltimore, MD USA",Vanderbilt University; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland Baltimore,"Fisher, DH (corresponding author), Vanderbilt Univ, Nashville, TN 37235 USA.",douglas.h.fisher@Vanderbilt.Edu; mlmaher@umd.edu,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,3,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",0302-9743,1611-3349,978-3-642-25166-5,LECT NOTES COMPUT SC,,,2011,,,,,243,+,,,,,,2,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Software Engineering; Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BBC73,,Green Submitted,,,12/21/22,WOS:000306457200032,View Full Record in Web of Science

We find that in the near-term period an increase in warming by 0.5 degrees C will strengthen the monsoon circulation and precipitation over the Indian landmass and east Asia. Under the 1.5 degrees C warming scenario, the ISM circulation will weaken, and precipitation will exhibit a decreasing trend, while the ISM precipitation and circulation will strengthen under the 2.0 degrees C warming scenario. The strengthening of ISM under the 2.0 degrees C warming scenario is due to the strengthening of the South China Sea (SCS) anticyclone and a high-pressure center near the Philippine Island. This high-pressure center over the SCS will facilitate a cross-basin strengthening of the easterly wind from the western Pacific Ocean/SCS to the equatorial Indian Ocean, which will, in turn, strengthen the transport of the Pacific-origin moisture to the Indian subcontinent and East Asia. This increase in moisture content over the Indian subcontinent will strengthen the monsoonal circulation and precipitation under the 2.0 degrees C warming scenario.","[Choudhury, Devanil; Chen, Wen] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Monsoon Syst Res, Inst Atmospher Phys, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Choudhury, Devanil; Chen, Wen] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 101408, Peoples R China; [Nath, Debashis] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Atmospher Sci, Zhuhai 510275, Peoples R China; [Nath, Debashis] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Atmospher Sci, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Climate Change, Zhuhai 519082, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Sun Yat Sen University; Sun Yat Sen University","Choudhury, D (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Monsoon Syst Res, Inst Atmospher Phys, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.;Choudhury, D (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 101408, Peoples R China.",idevnil@gmail.com; nathd@mail.sysu.edu.cn; chenw@mail.iap.ac.cn,"Choudhury, Devanil/AAU-9427-2021; Chen, Wen/G-6058-2011","Choudhury, Devanil/0000-0002-4505-6388; Chen, Wen/0000-0001-9327-9079",National Natural Science Foundation of China [41961144016],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),Thiswork is supported by theNationalNatural Science Foundation ofChina (Grant 41961144016).,,36,0,0,3,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4433,,ATMOSPHERE-BASEL,Atmosphere,JUL,2022,7,,,,,,1081,10.3390/atmos13071081,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos13071081,,,12,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,3H8QS,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000832295800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Despite their analytical strengths to conceive low-carbon futures, their co-evolution with the transnational science-policy interface of climate politics has also led to a focus on a specific set of techno-economic futures that are typically based on a relatively narrow set of assumptions. This deviates attention from alternatives that are hardly studied by IAMs, but might be more desirable from a societal perspective. We argue that research-based models and scenarios should support rather than narrow down deliberations on possible and desirable futures and provide an impetus to enact socially desirable change. Accordingly, we propose three future directions regarding the development and use of IAMs: 1) incorporate a plurality of perspectives on plausibility and desirability through iterative participatory engagement and worldview-based scenario exploration, 2) seek collaboration with the arts and humanities to expand the range of imagined futures beyond the status quo and 3) make projected futures more tangible and experiential so that diverse societal actor groups can understand and genuinely engage with them. By deploying the indisputable analytical strengths of IAMs optimally within these suggestions, we believe they can facilitate broader societal debates about transformative pathways to low-carbon futures.","[Braunreiter, Lukas] ZHAW Zurich Univ Appl Sci, Inst Innovat & Entrepreneurship, Theaterstr 17, CH-8401 Winterthur, Switzerland; [van Beek, Lisette; Hajer, Maarten; van Vuuren, Detlef] Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Utrecht, Netherlands; [van Beek, Lisette; Hajer, Maarten] Univ Utrecht, Urban Futures Studio, Utrecht, Netherlands; [van Vuuren, Detlef] PBL Netherlands Environm Assessment Agcy, The Hague, Netherlands",Zurich University of Applied Sciences; Utrecht University; Utrecht University,"Braunreiter, L (corresponding author), ZHAW Zurich Univ Appl Sci, Inst Innovat & Entrepreneurship, Theaterstr 17, CH-8401 Winterthur, Switzerland.",lukas.braunreiter@zhaw.ch,,,,,,,127,4,4,3,9,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2214-6296,2214-6326,,ENERGY RES SOC SCI,Energy Res.

The robustness of spatio-temporal features is determined by comparing the two state-of-the art reanalyses: NCEP Climate Forecast System reanalysis and Modern ERA Retrospective Analysis. The inter-comparison is based on a study period of 26 years (1984-2009). The study confirms the development of deep heating over the CTCZ region during the active phase and is consistent between the two datasets. However, the detailed temporal evolution of the vertical structure (e.g., vertical tilts) of heating differs at times. The most important common feature from both the datasets is the significant vertical redistribution of heating with the development of shallow (low level) heating and circulation over the CTCZ region 3-7 days after the peak active phase. The shallow circulation is found to be associated with increased vertical shear and relative vorticity over certain regions in the subcontinent. This increased vertical shear and relative vorticity in the lower levels could be crucial in the sustenance of rainfall after the peak active phase. Model experiments with linear dynamics affirm the role of shallow convection in increasing the lower level circulation as observed.","[Chattopadhyay, Rajib; Sur, Sharmila; Joseph, Susmitha; Sahai, A.

Based on evidence from Hungarian panel apartment blocks connected to district heating, this paper introduces a new variant of fuel poverty that may not be properly captured by existing fuel poverty indicators. This newly defined variant can be largely attributed to post-communist legacies - though it might also exist in other contexts - and assumes that consumers living in poor-efficiency, district-heated buildings are trapped in dwellings with adequate indoor temperatures but disproportionately high heating costs because (a) changing supplier or fuel is difficult because of the existing technical and institutional constraints, and (b) they do not realistically have the option to reduce individually their heating costs through individual efficiency improvements. This situation often translates into payment arrears, indebtedness, risk of disconnection, or reduced consumption of other basic goods and services. State-supported policy responses to date have favoured symptomatic solutions (direct consumer support) combined with superficial retrofits, though it is argued that only state-of-the-art retrofits such as the passive house-based SOLANOVA pilot project in Dunaujvaros can fully eradicate fuel poverty in this consumer group.

Of particular importance is the role of methane (CH4) for the budget of stratospheric water vapour (SWV), which has an important climate impact. However, simulations with CCMs are, due to the large number of involved chemical species, computationally demanding, which limits the simulation of sensitivity studies. To allow for sensitivity studies and ensemble simulations with a reduced demand for computational resources, we introduce a simplified approach to simulate the core of methane chemistry in form of the new Modular Earth Submodel System (MESSy) submodel CH4. It involves an atmospheric chemistry mechanism reduced to the sink reactions of CH4 with predefined fields of the hydroxyl radical (OH), excited oxygen (O(D-1)), and chlorine (Cl), as well as photolysis and the reaction products limited to water vapour (H2O). This chemical production of H2O is optionally fed back onto the specific humidity (q) of the connected general circulation model (GCM), to account for the impact onto SWV and its effect on radiation and stratospheric dynamics. The submodel CH4 is further capable of simulating the four most prevalent CH4 isotopologues for carbon and hydrogen (CH4 and CH3D, as well as (CH4)-C-12 and (CH4)-C-13). Furthermore, the production of deuterated water vapour (HDO) is, similar to the production of H2O in the CH4 oxidation, optionally passed back to the isotopological hydrological cycle simulated by the submodel H2OISO, using the newly developed auxiliary submodel TRSYNC. Moreover, the simulation of a user-defined number of diagnostic CH4 age and emission classes is possible, the output of which can be used for offline inverse optimization techniques. The presented approach combines the most important chemical hydrological feedback including the isotopic signatures with the advantages concerning the computational simplicity of a GCM, in comparison to a full-featured CCM.","[Winterstein, Franziska; Jockel, Patrick] Deutsch Zentrum Luft & Raumfahrt DLR, Inst Phys Atmosphare, Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany",Helmholtz Association; German Aerospace Centre (DLR),"Winterstein, F (corresponding author), Deutsch Zentrum Luft & Raumfahrt DLR, Inst Phys Atmosphare, Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany.",franziska.winterstein@dlr.de,"Jöckel, Patrick/AAN-1285-2020; Jöckel, Patrick/C-3687-2009","Jöckel, Patrick/0000-0002-8964-1394; Jöckel, Patrick/0000-0002-8964-1394","DLR project KliSAW (Klimarelevanz von atmospharischen Spurengasen, Aerosolen und Wolken); Helmholtz-Gemeinschaft e.V.

J,"Maathuis, M",,,,"Maathuis, Marieke",,,An aesthetic of devotion: Ary Scheffer and the Dutch Reveil,OUD HOLLAND,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"The subject of religious painting in the nineteenth-century Netherlands has been largely neglected in art historical research. The persisting misconception that art and Protestantism are irreconcilable has become an all too easy explanation for the apparent lack or scarcity of religious painting in the Protestant Netherlands in this period and a consequent disinterest in the subject. Nonetheless, religious art continued to exist in the nineteenth-century Netherlands and took on new forms which corresponded to people's more personal experience of faith. Notwithstanding the critical and doubtful attitude towards religion that arose around this time, not everyone gave up on Christianity and its teachings. In fact, the nineteenth century witnessed a range of religious revivalist movements throughout all of Europe and America. The Netherlands saw the rise of the Reveil movement, a revivalist movement within the Dutch Reformed Church, whose protagonists largely coincided with a cultural elite including many writers, poets and art lovers. They can be linked to numerous religious art works, especially those by the French-Dutch painter Ary Scheffer (1795-1858). This article aims to understand the reception of the religious paintings of Ary Scheffer in the light of the Dutch Reveil. By providing a cultural context, bringing together religious, literary and artistic elements, it will become apparent how Scheffer's paintings resonated with this specific audience. The aesthetic for religious painting that Scheffer brought forward can be characterized as strongly devotional images, in which traditional biblical narrative is consciously evoked, but rendered with minimum means. The focus on the psychological state and emotion of protagonists that comes forward resonated with the religious climate in the Netherlands at the time, focusing on piety and a personal experience of faith. Though Scheffer's art is nowadays often regarded as too sentimental, this study helps to understand their value to the nineteenth-century religious beholder.","[Maathuis, Marieke] Univ Utrecht, Hist, Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University,"Maathuis, M (corresponding author), Univ Utrecht, Hist, Utrecht, Netherlands.",,,,,,,,61,0,0,0,0,BRILL,LEIDEN,"PLANTIJNSTRAAT 2, P O BOX 9000, 2300 PA LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS",,1875-0176,,OUD HOLLAND,Oud Holl.,AUG,2021,3-Feb,,,,151,168,,,,,,18,Art,Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;HCI),Art,UL0MV,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000692356100003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Adding thermal insulation to the building envelope is the most common and well-known measure, but existing strategies for energy-efficient retrofits do not consider the life-cycle energy consumption and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions of the insulation materials. This paper introduces a new approach for selecting the optimum insulation material and thickness based on life-cycle energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions. The approach was applied to a multi-storey residential building located in I. zmir, Turkey, which has a Mediterranean climate, and the results are compared with the same building in Erzurum, Turkey, which has a cold climate. The comparison reveals the effect of thermal insulation on energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions. The results show that increasing thermal insulation thickness provides less energy efficiency in the Mediterranean climate than in the cold climate. In addition, if the thickness is not optimised according to the insulation material, the life-cycle carbon dioxide emissions and energy consumption may increase contrary to expectations. Extruded polystyrene insulation with 3 cm thickness for the Mediterranean climate and rock wool insulation with 9 cm thickness in cold climate have the optimum life-cycle energy and carbon dioxide emission performance for the case-study building.","[Cetintas, Kemal Ferit; Yilmaz, Zerrin] Istanbul Arel Univ, Dept Architecture, Istanbul, Turkey",Istanbul Arel University,"Cetintas, KF (corresponding author), Istanbul Arel Univ, Dept Architecture, Istanbul, Turkey.",kemalcetintas@arel.edu.tr,"cetintas, kemal ferit/AAT-5034-2021","cetintas, kemal ferit/0000-0002-9724-7864",,,,,39,4,4,0,25,ICE PUBLISHING,WESTMINISTER,"INST CIVIL ENGINEERS, 1 GREAT GEORGE ST, WESTMINISTER SW 1P 3AA, ENGLAND",1751-4223,1751-4231,,P I CIVIL ENG-ENERGY,Proc.

We review the state-of-the-art for trade-off analysis, assessing different techniques by exploring a concrete example of trade-offs around the use of crop residues in smallholder farming systems. The techniques for performing trade-off analyses have developed substantially in recent years aided by mathematical advancement, increased computing power, and emerging insights into systems behaviour. Combining different techniques allows the assessment of aspects of system behaviour via various perspectives, thereby generating complementary knowledge. However, this does not solve the fundamental challenge: trade-off analyses without substantial stakeholder engagement often have limited practical utility for informing practical decision-making. We suggest ways to integrate approaches and improve the potential for societal impact of future trade-off analyses.","[Klapwijk, C. J.; Giller, K.

Part I: Climatology,JOURNAL OF CLIMATE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,MULTIMODEL SUPERENSEMBLE; SYSTEMATIC-ERRORS; SUMMER MONSOON; EL-NINO; PREDICTABILITY; PREDICTION; VARIABILITY; ANOMALIES; INDIA; GCM,"The goal of this study is to utilize several recent developments on rainfall data collection, downscaling of available climate models, training and forecasts from such models within the framework of a multimodel superensemble, and first a detailed examination of the seasonal climatology. The unique aspect of this study is that it became possible to use the forecast results from as many as 16 state-of-the-art coupled climate models. A downscaling component, with respect to observed rainfall estimates, uses a very dense Asian rain gauge network. This feature enables the forecasts of each model to be bias corrected to a common 25-km resolution. The downscaling statistics for each model, at each grid location, are developed during a training phase of the model forecasts. This is done wherever the observed rainfall estimates are available. In the forecast phase, the forecasts from all of the member models use the downscaling coefficients of the training phase. The downscaling and the extraction of the superensemble weights are done during the training phase. This makes use of the cross-validation principle. This means that the season to be forecasted is left out of the entire forecast dataset. Thus all of the statistics for downscaling and the superensemble construction are done separately for the forecasts of each season for all the years. The forecast phase is the season that is being forecast, where the aforementioned statistics are deployed for constructing the final downscaled superensemble. These forecasts are next used for the construction of a multimodel superenscmble. The geographical distributions of the downscaling coefficients provide a first look at the systematic errors of the member model forecasts. This combination of multimodels, the vast rain gauge dataset, the downscaling, and the superensemble provides a major improvement for the rainfall climatology and anomalies for the forecast phase. One of the main results of this paper is on the improvement of rainfall climatology of the member models. The downscaled multimodel superensemble shows a correlation of nearly 1.0 with respect to the observed climatology. This high skill is important for addressing the rainfall anomaly forecasts, which are defined in terms of departures from the observed (rather than a model based) climatology. This first part of the paper provides a description of the member models, the length of the training and forecast phases, the sensitivity of results as the numbers of forecast models are increased, and the skills of the downscaled climatology forecasts.","[Kumar, Vinay; Krishnamurti, T.

The most of QTP regions in particular have experienced significant warming and wetting over the past 50 years, and this warming trend is projected to intensify in the future. Such climate change will likely alter the soil freeze-thaw pattern in permafrost active layer and toward significant greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O) release. However, the interaction effect of warming and altered soil moisture on N2O emission during freezing and thawing is unclear. Here, we used simulation experiments to test how changes in N2O flux relate to different thawing temperatures (T-5-5 degrees C, T-10-10 degrees C, and T-20-20 degrees C) and soil volumetric water contents (VWCs, W-15-15%, W-30-30%, and W-45-45%) under 165 F-T cycles in topsoil (0-20 cm) of an alpine meadow with discontinuous permafrost in the QTP. First, in contrast to the prevailing view, soil moisture but not thawing temperature dominated the large N2O pulses during F-T events. The maximum emissions, 1,123.16-5,849.54 mu g m(-2) h(-1), appeared in the range of soil VWC from 17% to 38%. However, the mean N2O fluxes had no significant difference between different thawing temperatures when soil was dry or waterlogged. Second, in medium soil moisture, low thawing temperature is more able to promote soil N2O emission than high temperature. For example, the peak value (5,849.54 mu g m(-2) h(-1)) and cumulative emissions (366.6 mg m(-2)) of (WT5)-T-30 treatment were five times and two to four times higher than (WT10)-T-30 and (WT20)-T-30, respectively. Third, during long-term freeze-thaw cycles, the patterns of cumulative N2O emissions were related to soil moisture. treatments; on the contrary, the cumulative emissions of W-45 treatments slowly increased until more than 80 cycles. Finally, long-term freeze-thaw cycles could improve nitrogen availability, prolong N2O release time, and increase N2O cumulative emission in permafrost active layer. Particularly, the high emission was concentrated in the first 27 and 48 cycles in W-15 and W-30, respectively. Overall, our study highlighted that large emissions of N2O in F-T events tend to occur in medium moisture soil at lower thawing temperature; the increased number of F-T cycles may enhance N2O emission and nitrogen mineralization in permafrost active layer.","[Chen, Zhe; Xie, Huichun; Liu, Pan; Zhang, Yufang; Wang, Wenying] Qinghai Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Xining, Peoples R China; [Chen, Zhe; Xie, Huichun; Wang, Wenying] Acad Plateau Sci & Sustainabil, Xining, Peoples R China; [Chen, Zhe; Zhang, Zhenhua; Du, Yangong; Yao, Buqing; Xie, Huichun; Wang, Wenying; Zhou, Huakun] Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Plateau Biol, Qinghai Prov Key Lab Restorat Ecol Cold Reg, Xining, Peoples R China; [Chen, Zhe; Xie, Huichun; Wang, Wenying] Qinghai Normal Univ, Qinghai Prov Key Lab Med Anim & Plants Resources, Xining, Peoples R China; [Ge, Shidong] Henan Agr Univ, Coll Landscape Architecture & Art, Zhengzhou, Peoples R China",Qinghai Normal University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Qinghai Normal University; Henan Agricultural University,"Wang, WY (corresponding author), Qinghai Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Xining, Peoples R China.;Wang, WY (corresponding author), Acad Plateau Sci & Sustainabil, Xining, Peoples R China.;Wang, WY; Zhou, HK (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Plateau Biol, Qinghai Prov Key Lab Restorat Ecol Cold Reg, Xining, Peoples R China.;Wang, WY (corresponding author), Qinghai Normal Univ, Qinghai Prov Key Lab Med Anim & Plants Resources, Xining, Peoples R China.",wangwy0106@163.com; hkzhou@nwipb.cas.cn,,,Natural Science Foundation of Qinghai Provincial [2018-ZJ-935Q]; Joint Research Project of Three-River-Resource National Park - Chinese Academy of Sciences and Qinghai Provincial People's Government [LHZX-2020-08]; Chunhui Program of the Ministry of Education (2018); second Tibetan Plateau scientific expedition and research [2019QZKK0302],Natural Science Foundation of Qinghai Provincial; Joint Research Project of Three-River-Resource National Park - Chinese Academy of Sciences and Qinghai Provincial People's Government; Chunhui Program of the Ministry of Education (2018); second Tibetan Plateau scientific expedition and research,"This study was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of Qinghai Provincial (2018-ZJ-935Q), Joint Research Project of Three-River-Resource National Park funded by Chinese Academy of Sciences and Qinghai Provincial People's Government (LHZX-2020-08), Chunhui Program of the Ministry of Education (2018), and the second Tibetan Plateau scientific expedition and research (2019QZKK0302).",,55,3,3,23,64,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",2296-701X,,,FRONT ECOL EVOL,Front.

The Baltic Sea offers an outstanding ecosystem for interpreting causes and consequences of bacterioplankton community composition shifts resulting from environmental disturbance. Yet, a systematic synthesis of the composition of Baltic Sea bacterioplankton and their responses to natural or human-induced environmental perturbations is lacking. We review current research on Baltic Sea bacterioplankton dynamics in situ (48 articles) and in laboratory experiments (38 articles) carried out at a variety of spatiotemporal scales. In situ studies indicate that the salinity gradient sets the boundaries for bacterioplankton composition, whereas, regional environmental conditions at a within-basin scale, including the level of hypoxia and phytoplankton succession stages, may significantly tune the composition of bacterial communities. Also the experiments show that Baltic Sea bacteria are highly responsive to environmental conditions, with general influences of e.g. salinity, temperature and nutrients. Importantly, nine out of ten experiments that measured both bacterial community composition and some metabolic activities showed empirical support for the sensitivity scenario of bacteria - i.e., that environmental disturbance caused concomitant change in both community composition and community functioning. The lack of studies empirically testing the resilience scenario, i.e., experimental studies that incorporate the long-term temporal dimension, precludes conclusions about the potential prevalence of resilience of Baltic Sea bacterioplankton. We also outline outstanding questions emphasizing promising applications in incorporating bacterioplankton community dynamics into biogeochemical and food-web models and the lack of knowledge for deep-sea assemblages, particularly bacterioplankton structure-function relationships. This review emphasizes that bacterioplankton communities rapidly respond to natural and predicted human-induced environmental disturbance by altering their composition and metabolic activity. Unless bacterioplankton are resilient, such changes could have severe consequences for the regulation of microbial ecosystem services.","[Lindh, Markus V.; Pinhassi, Jarone] Linnaeus Univ, Ctr Ecol & Evolut Microbial Model Syst EEMiS, Kalmar, Sweden; [Lindh, Markus V.] Swedish Meteorol & Hydrol Inst, Gothenburg, Sweden",Linnaeus University; Swedish Meteorological & Hydrological Institute,"Pinhassi, J (corresponding author), Linnaeus Univ, Ctr Ecol & Evolut Microbial Model Syst EEMiS, Kalmar, Sweden.",jarone.pinhassi@lnu.se,,,Swedish Research Council FORMAS strong research programme EcoChange; Linnaeus University Center for Ecology and Evolution in Microbial model Systems (EEMiS); Swedish Research Council VR; BONUS (Art 185) - EU; BONUS (Art 185) - FORMAS,Swedish Research Council FORMAS strong research programme EcoChange; Linnaeus University Center for Ecology and Evolution in Microbial model Systems (EEMiS); Swedish Research Council VR(Swedish Research Council); BONUS (Art 185) - EU; BONUS (Art 185) - FORMAS,"The research was supported by the Swedish Research Council FORMAS strong research programme EcoChange, the Linnaeus University Center for Ecology and Evolution in Microbial model Systems (EEMiS), and by grants from the Swedish Research Council VR.

This family of methodologies relies on strong social networks among flood practitioners and the public to support careful definition of stakeholder-relevant thresholds and vulnerabilities to hazards. In parallel, flood researchers are directly considering distinct atmospheric mechanisms that induce flooding to readily incorporate information on future climate projections. We perform a case study of flood professionals actively engaged in flood risk mitigation within Tompkins County, New York, USA, a community dealing with moderate flooding, to gage how much variance exists among professionals from the perspective of establishing a bottom-up flood mitigation study from an atmospheric perspective. Results of this case study indicate disagreement among flooding professionals as to which socioeconomic losses constitute a flood, disagreement on anticipated community needs, weak understanding of climate-weather-flood linkages, and some disagreement on community perceptions of climate adaptation. In aggregate, the knowledge base of the Tompkins County flood practitioners provides a well-defined picture of community vulnerability and perceptions.

Although recognizing the importance of such specialist support for individual students, within the current climate in UK education with more students from diverse educational experiences, the responsibility for facilitating study must lie with all tutors. This, it is argued, can be achieved through providing more inclusive participation in learning activities where students are encouraged to undertake responsibilities with the tutors acting as facilitators or guides. Such activities as writing project briefs, organizing learning activities and assessing are normally undertaken by tutors and many students fail to develop an understanding about the work they are required to do in art and design. By viewing learning activities as a community of practice, where more experienced practitioner tutors enable students to participate, they are more likely to develop an identity of belonging, with an associated sense of the meaning of activities within the community of practice in education. This is illustrated through a case study where students organized a project to participate in an international textiles trade fair. The case study is analysed through Wenger's (1998) ideas about the identity of participation.","[Shreeve, Alison] Univ Arts London, Creat Learning Practice CETL, London, England",University of Arts London,"Shreeve, A (corresponding author), Univ Arts London, Creat Learning Practice CETL, London, England.",a.shreeve@fashion.arts.ac.uk,,,,,,,16,7,7,0,1,INTELLECT LTD,BRISTOL,"THE MILL, PARNALL RD, BRISTOL, BS16 3JG, ENGLAND",1474-273X,2040-0896,,ART DES COMMUN HIGH,Art Des.

For example, waves drive the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) in equatorial stratospheric winds and modulate occurrences of cirrus clouds. However, the QBO in the lower stratosphere and thin cirrus have continued to elude accurate simulation in state-of-the-art climate models and seasonal forecast systems. We use first-of-their-kind profile measurements deployed beneath a long-duration balloon to provide new insights into impacts of fine-scale waves on equatorial cirrus clouds and the QBO just above the tropopause. Analysis of these balloon-borne measurements reveals previously uncharacterized fine-vertical-scale waves (<1 km) with large horizontal extent (>1000 km) and multiday periods. These waves affect cirrus clouds and QBO winds in ways that could explain current climate model shortcomings in representing these stratospheric influences on climate. Accurately simulating these fine-vertical-scale processes thus has the potential to improve sub-seasonal to near-term climate prediction. Plain Language Summary Instruments measuring temperature, water vapor, and ice particles were deployed on a 2-km-long string reeled up and down below a long-duration balloon drifting at 19 km in the lower stratosphere. The measurements reveal climate influences of very difficult-to-observe atmospheric waves with extreme aspect ratios: large horizontal scales (>1000 km) but very short vertical scales (<1 km). The waves are seen actively modifying properties of thin ice clouds that collectively influence tropical surface temperatures. An inverted Z-shape in the temperature profiles suggests these waves are intermittently breaking, like waves on a beach, leading to forces that drive zonal wind accelerations. The magnitude of these forces is strong, enough to drive the dominant zonal wind pattern called the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO), at least for the month-long period we observe. At these altitudes, the wave forces driving the QBO have been mysterious, despite world-wide efforts to simulate the QBO in climate models aiming to improve seasonal predictions.","[Bramberger, Martina; Alexander, M.

We apply two discretization methods of the dust size distribution keeping the total mass constant: (1) the default RegCM4 4-bin approach, where the size range of each bin is calculated using an equal, logarithmic separation of the total size range of dust, using the diameter of dust particles, and (2) a newly implemented 12-bin approach with each bin defined according to an isogradient method where the size ranges are dependent on the dry deposition velocity of dust particles. Increasing the number of transported dust size bins theoretically improves the representation of the physical properties of dust particles within the same size bin. Thus, more size bins improve the simulation of atmospheric processes. The radiative effects of dust over the area are discussed and evaluated with the CALIPSO dust optical depth (DOD). This study is among the first studies evaluating the vertical profile of simulated dust with a pure dust product. Reanalysis winds from ERA-Interim and the total precipitation flux from the Climate Research Unit (CRU) observational gridded database are used to evaluate and explain the discrepancies between model and observations. The new dust binning approach increases the dust column burden by 4 and 3% for fine and coarse particles, respectively, which increases DOD by 10% over the desert and the Mediterranean. Consequently, negative shortwave radiative forcing (RF) is enhanced by more than 10% at the top of the atmosphere and by 1 to 5% on the surface. Positive longwave RF locally increases by more than 0.1Wm(-2) in a large portion of the Sahara, the northern part of the Arabian Peninsula and the Middle East. The four-bin isolog method is to some extent numerically efficient, nevertheless our work highlights that the simplified representation of the four-bin approach produces less dust optical depth and RF, a fact that should be taken into account by future studies of the same region.","[Tsikerdekis, Athanasios; Zanis, Prodromos; Katragkou, Eleni; Karacostas, Theodoros] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Meteorol & Climatol, Sch Geol, Thessaloniki 54124, Greece; [Steiner, Allison L.] Univ Michigan, Atmospher Ocean & Space Sci, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Solmon, Fabien] Abdus Salam Int Ctr Theoret Phys, Earth Syst Phys Sect, I-34100 Trieste, Italy; [Amiridis, Vassilis; Marinou, Eleni] Natl Observ Athens, Inst Astron Astrophys Space Applicat & Remote Sen, Athens 15236, Greece; [Marinou, Eleni] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Phys, Thessaloniki 54124, Greece; [Foret, Gilles] Univ Paris Est Creteil & Paris Diderot, CNRS, LISA, UMR7583, Creteil, France",Aristotle University of Thessaloniki; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP); National Observatory of Athens; Aristotle University of Thessaloniki; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Earth Sciences & Astronomy (INSU); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Cite; Universite Gustave-Eiffel; Universite Paris-Est-Creteil-Val-de-Marne (UPEC),"Tsikerdekis, A (corresponding author), Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Meteorol & Climatol, Sch Geol, Thessaloniki 54124, Greece.",tsike@geo.auth.gr,"Amiridis, Vassilis/AAD-8081-2020; Zanis, Prodromos/B-5598-2015; Steiner, Allison/AAC-7029-2020; Marinou, Eleni/K-5793-2013; Steiner, Allison L/F-4942-2011; Amiridis, Vassilis/G-6769-2012","Zanis, Prodromos/0000-0002-3496-2692; Steiner, Allison/0000-0002-3823-1512; Marinou, Eleni/0000-0003-2631-6057; Steiner, Allison L/0000-0002-3823-1512; Amiridis, Vassilis/0000-0002-1544-7812; Katragkou, Eleni/0000-0003-0863-3411; Tsikerdekis, Athanasios/0000-0002-4694-2015","GEOCRADLE (Coordinating and integRating state-of-the-art Earth [690133, SC5-18b-2015]; FP7-PEOPLE-IRSES-Marie Curie Action [PIRSES-GA-2013-612671]; ACTRIS-2 project through the European Union's Horizon 2020 programme [654109]",GEOCRADLE (Coordinating and integRating state-of-the-art Earth; FP7-PEOPLE-IRSES-Marie Curie Action; ACTRIS-2 project through the European Union's Horizon 2020 programme,"This work is supported by the project GEOCRADLE (Coordinating and integRating state-of-the-art Earth Observation Activities in the regions of North Africa, Middle East, and Balkans and Developing Links with GEO related initiatives towards GEOSS), grant agreement no. 690133, funded through the European Union Horizon 2020 Programme -Topic: SC5-18b-2015, Integrating North African, Middle East and Balkan Earth Observation capacities in GEOSS.

Studies have identified enhanced poleward atmospheric transport of moisture and heat during spring, leading to increased emission of longwave radiation to the surface. Simultaneously, these studies ruled out the role of shortwave radiation as an effective preconditioning mechanism because of relatively weak incident solar radiation, high surface albedo from sea ice and snow, and increased clouds during spring. These conclusions are derived primarily from atmospheric reanalysis, which may not always accurately represent the Arctic climate system. Here, top-of-atmosphere shortwave radiation observations from a state-of-the-art satellite sensor are compared with ERA-Interim reanalysis to examine similarities and differences in the springtime absorbed shortwave radiation (ASR) over the Arctic Ocean. Distinct biases in regional location and absolute magnitude of ASR anomalies are found between satellite-based measurements and reanalysis. Observations indicate separability between ASR anomalies in spring corresponding to anomalously low and high ice extents in September; the reanalysis fails to capture the full extent of this separability. The causes for the difference in ASR anomalies between observations and reanalysis are considered in terms of the variability in surface albedo and cloud presence. Additionally, biases in reanalysis cloud water during spring are presented and are considered for their impact on overestimating spring downwelling longwave anomalies. Taken together, shortwave radiation should not be overlooked as a contributing mechanism to springtime Arctic atmospheric preconditioning.","[Sedlar, Joseph] Stockholm Univ, Dept Meteorol, Stockholm, Sweden; [Sedlar, Joseph] Univ Colorado Boulder, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",Stockholm University; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Sedlar, J (corresponding author), Stockholm Univ, Dept Meteorol, Stockholm, Sweden.;Sedlar, J (corresponding author), Univ Colorado Boulder, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",joseph.sedlar@misu.su.se,"Keyes, Dennis/AAZ-9285-2021; Sedlar, Joseph/AAD-1060-2022","Sedlar, Joseph/0000-0003-3101-9401",European Union,European Union(European Commission),This work has been supported financially by the European Union Horizon 2020 INTAROS research project.

Reef corals provide an excellent source of high resolution climate records, and importantly represent the tropical marine environment where palaeoclimate data are urgently required. Recent decades have seen significant improvement in our understanding of coral biomineralisation, the associated uptake of geochemical proxies and methods of identifying and understanding the effects of both early and late, post depositional diagenetic alteration. These processes all have significant implications for interpreting geochemical proxies relevant to palaeoclimatic reconstructions. This paper reviews the current 'state of the art' in terms of coral based palaeoclimate reconstructions and highlights a key remaining problem. The majority of coral based palaeoclimate research has been derived from massive colonies of Porites. However, massive Porites are not globally abundant and may not provide material of a particular age of interest in those regions where they are present Therefore, there is great potential for alternate coral genera to act as complimentary climate archives. While it remains critical to consider five key factors - vital effects, differential growth morphologies, geochemical heterogeneity in the skeletal ultrastructure, transfer equation selection and diagenetic screening of skeletal material - in order to allow the highest level of accuracy in coral palaeoclimate reconstructions, it is also important to develop alternate taxa for palaeoclimate studies in regions where Porites colonies are absent or rare. Currently as many as nine genera other than Porites have proven at least limited utility in palaeothermometry, most of which are found in the Atlantic/Caribbean region where massive Porites do not exist. Even branching taxa such as Acropora have significant potential to preserve environmental archives. Increasing this capability will greatly expand the number of potential geochemical archives available for longer term temporal records of palaeoclimate. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

It builds up on more than a decade of model development and tuning efforts, which led to major updates of its moist physics. The vertical resolution has also been significantly increased, both in the boundary layer and in the stratosphere. ARPEGE-Climat 6.3 is now coupled to the new version (8.0) of the SURFace EXternalisee (SURFEX) surface model, in which several new features (e.g., floodplains, aquifers, and snow processes) improve the water cycle realism. The model calibration is discussed in depth. Anamip-type experiment, in which the sea surface temperatures and sea ice concentrations are prescribed, and following the CMIP6 protocol, is extensively evaluated, in terms of climate mean state and variability. ARPEGE-Climat 6.3 is shown to improve over its previous version (5.1) by many climate features. Major improvements include the top-of-atmosphere and surface energy budgets in their various components (shortwave and longwave, total and clear sky), cloud cover, near-surface temperature, precipitation climatology and daily-mean distribution, and water discharges at the outlet of major rivers. In contrast, clouds over subtropical stratocumulus decks, several dynamical variables (sea level pressure, 500-hPa geopotential height), are still significantly biased. The tropical intraseasonal variability and diurnal cycle of precipitation, though improved, remained area of concerns for further model improvement. New biases also emerge, such as a lack of precipitation over several tropical continental areas. Within the CMIP6 context, ARPEGE-Climat 6.3 is the atmospheric component of CNRM-CM6-1 and CNRM-ESM2-1. Plain Language Summary Since the early 1990s, the Centre National de Recherches Meteorologiques (CNRM) has been developing a global atmosphere model for climate applications. The present work presents its latest version, ARPEGE-Climat 6.3, as prepared for the sixth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). It builds up on more than a decade of model development and tuning efforts. A CMIP6 amip-type numerical experiment, in which the sea surface temperatures and sea ice concentrations are prescribed, is evaluated, in terms of climate mean state and variability. ARPEGE-Climat 6.3 is shown to have better or similar skills compared to its previous version and to rank rather high among CMIP5 state-of-the-art models by many mean-state metrics. Major improvements include the top-ofatmosphere and surface energy budgets, cloud cover, near-surface temperature, precipitation climatology and daily-mean distribution, and water discharges at the outlet of major rivers. In contrast, clouds over the eastern part of ocean basins, and a few dynamical variables, such as sea level pressure, are still significantly biased. New biases also emerge, such as a lack of precipitation over several tropical continental areas. The remaining and new biases call for further understanding, especially whether they arise from calibration issues or model structural limits.","[Roehrig, Romain; Beau, Isabelle; Saint-Martin, David; Alias, Antoinette; Decharme, Bertrand; Gueremy, Jean-Francois; Voldoire, Aurore; Abdel-Lathif, Ahmat Younous; Bazile, Eric; Belamari, Sophie; Blein, Sebastien; Bouniol, Dominique; Bouteloup, Yves; Cattiaux, Julien; Chauvin, Fabrice; Chevallier, Matthieu; Colin, Jeanne; Douville, Herve; Marquet, Pascal; Michou, Martine; Nabat, Pierre; Oudar, Thomas; Peyrille, Philippe; Piriou, Jean-Marcel; Melia, David Salas Y.; Seferian, Roland; Senesi, Stephane] Univ Toulouse, Meteo France, CNRS, CNRM, Toulouse, France; [Abdel-Lathif, Ahmat Younous] United Nat World Food Programme, Rome, Italy",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Meteo France; Universite de Toulouse,"Roehrig, R (corresponding author), Univ Toulouse, Meteo France, CNRS, CNRM, Toulouse, France.",romain.roehrig@meteo.fr,"Keyes, Dennis/AAZ-9285-2021; Decharme, Bertrand/Z-4563-2019; Séférian, Roland/ABD-5465-2021; Saint-Martin, David/P-7006-2018","Decharme, Bertrand/0000-0002-8661-1464; Séférian, Roland/0000-0002-2571-2114; Saint-Martin, David/0000-0002-8478-6914; Cattiaux, Julien/0000-0001-8630-5574; Voldoire, Aurore/0000-0001-9585-7792; Senesi, Stephane/0000-0003-0892-5967; bazile, eric/0000-0001-8120-9970",DEPHY2 project - French national program LEFE/INSU; EECLAT project - CNES; French national program LEFE/INSU,DEPHY2 project - French national program LEFE/INSU; EECLAT project - CNES; French national program LEFE/INSU,"We are grateful for helpful comments and suggestions from two anonymous reviewers.

Urbanization without resilient and sustainable planning and execution could lead to undesirable changes in landscapes and stormwater regulation capacity. These changes have exacerbated the effects of extreme climatic events with disastrous consequences in many cities worldwide. Unfortunately, the major storm in Zhengzhou, China on 20 July 2021 was one of these examples. This event provided a rare opportunity to study the key roles of green infrastructures (GI) in mitigating flooding risks in a major urban center after a devasting flood event. Using the data from high-resolution images collected via two satellites, a comprehensive study of the Jialu System in Greater Zhengzhou was conducted to systematically compare how far the river water had reached before and after the 20 July 2021 major storm in order to identify the main weak links in the city's GI and stormwater management system. A flood inundation intensity index (FI) in the Upper (UJLR), Middle (MJLR), and Lower (LJLR) Regions of the Jialu River System was generated. Bivariate Moran's I, a correlation coefficient between FI and landscape characteristics, was calculated and used to identify problem areas for future improvements. Our results showed that the MJLR had the severest flooding impacts. LJLR had the biggest change in how far the river water reached after flooding, ranging from 4.59 m to 706.28 m. In UJLR, the percentages of mine, crop land, and green space had the highest global bivariate Moran's I correlation coefficients. In MJLR, the percentages of vacant land, impervious surfaces, and water body had the highest global bivariate Moran's I correlation coefficients. In LJLR, the percentages of vacant land, water body, and crop land had the highest global bivariate Moran's I correlation coefficients. The total percentages of both high landscape characteristics indices-high flood inundation intensity indices and low landscape characteristics indices-high flood inundation intensity indices areas are 12.96%, 13.47%, and 13.80% in UJLR, MJLR, and LJLR, respectively. These land cover composition types identified for each region can be treated as areas of primary focus. However, GeoDector Model (GDM) analyses showed that our eight variables of landscape characteristics were not independent. Hence, a more comprehensive approach integrating all eight variables is still necessary in future flood mitigation efforts.","[Duan, Yanbo; Zhang, Yusen; Li, Huawei; Zhou, Ziying; Tian, Guohang; Lei, Yakai] Henan Agr Univ, Coll Landscape Architecture & Art, Zhengzhou 450002, Peoples R China; [Gao, Yu Gary] Ohio State Univ, Coll Food Agr & Environm Sci Sputh Ctr, 1864 Shyville Rd, Piketon, OH 45661 USA; [Li, Zhonghui] Henan Water & Power Engn Consulting Co Ltd, Zhengzhou 450017, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Ziying] Hungarian Univ Agr & Life Sci, Inst Landscape Architecture, Urban Planning & Garden Art, 29-43 Villanyiut, H-1118 Budapest, Hungary",Henan Agricultural University; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; Hungarian University of Agriculture & Life Sciences,"Tian, GH; Lei, YK (corresponding author), Henan Agr Univ, Coll Landscape Architecture & Art, Zhengzhou 450002, Peoples R China.",tgh@henau.edu.cn; lykfjyl@henau.edu.cn,,"Duan, Yanbo/0000-0003-0978-9151","Landscape Architecture in Middle China Disciplinary Innovation and Talents Introduction Centre Program [CXJD2021004]; Urban-Rural Green Space Resources Control and Landscape Ecological Design Disciplinary Innovation and Talents Introduction Centre Program [GXJD006]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [31600579, 41501481]; Key Technology Program of Henan Province [162102310093]; International Cooperation Research Program of Henan Province [HNGD2021035]",Landscape Architecture in Middle China Disciplinary Innovation and Talents Introduction Centre Program; Urban-Rural Green Space Resources Control and Landscape Ecological Design Disciplinary Innovation and Talents Introduction Centre Program; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Key Technology Program of Henan Province; International Cooperation Research Program of Henan Province,"This research was funded by the Landscape Architecture in Middle China Disciplinary Innovation and Talents Introduction Centre Program (grant number: CXJD2021004), Urban-Rural Green Space Resources Control and Landscape Ecological Design Disciplinary Innovation and Talents Introduction Centre Program (grant number: GXJD006), National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant number:31600579), Key Technology Program of Henan Province (grant number: 162102310093), National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant number:41501481), and International Cooperation Research Program of Henan Province (grant number: HNGD2021035).",,103,0,0,4,4,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-445X,,LAND-BASEL,Land,NOV,2022,11,,,,,,1921,10.3390/land11111921,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land11111921,,,23,Environmental Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,6B3XV,,"Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000881270800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The atmospheric behavior is found to be different between the two model configurations, and it is shown that the differences in the two simulations can be attributed to differences in the behavior of the zonal mean state of the stratosphere, where reflection of quasi-stationary resolved planetary waves from the lid of the low-top model is prominent; the more realistic physics in the high-top model is not relevant. It is also shown that downward propagation of zonal wind anomalies during weak stratospheric vortex events is substantially different in the two model configurations. These findings extend earlier results that a poorly resolved stratosphere can influence simulations throughout the troposphere.","[Sassi, Fabrizio] USN, Res Lab, Div Space Sci, Washington, DC 20375 USA; [Garcia, R.

Given these imperfect models, predictions might be improved by combining them dynamically into a so-called supermodel. In this paper a new training scheme to construct such a supermodel is explored using a technique called cross pollination in time (CPT). In the CPT approach the models exchange states during the prediction. The number of possible predictions grows quickly with time, and a strategy to retain only a small number of predictions, called pruning, needs to be developed. The method is explored using low-order dynamical systems and applied to a global atmospheric model. The results indicate that the CPT training is efficient and leads to a supermodel with improved forecast quality as compared to the individual models. Due to its computational efficiency, the technique is suited for application to state-of-the art high-dimensional weather and climate models.","[Schevenhoven, Francine J.; Selten, Frank M.] Royal Netherlands Meteorol Inst, De Bilt, Netherlands; [Schevenhoven, Francine J.] Univ Bergen, Inst Geophys, Bergen, Norway",Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute; University of Bergen,"Schevenhoven, FJ (corresponding author), Royal Netherlands Meteorol Inst, De Bilt, Netherlands.;Schevenhoven, FJ (corresponding author), Univ Bergen, Inst Geophys, Bergen, Norway.",francine.schevenhoven@uib.no,,,,,,,12,7,7,0,0,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",2190-4979,2190-4987,,EARTH SYST DYNAM,Earth Syst.

However, greenhouse farms persist many challenges for efficient operation and management. The evolving Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, which encompass the smart sensors, devices, network topologies, big data analytics, and intelligent decision is believed to be the solution in addressing the key challenges facing the greenhouse farming, such as greenhouse local climate control, crop growth monitoring, crop harvesting and etc. This paper reviews the current greenhouse cultivation technologies as well as the state-of-the-art of IoT technologies for smart greenhouse farms.

The error patterns were coherent in offline land-surface and coupled land-atmosphere simulations, and in ECMWF's latest generation reanalysis (ERA5). Subsequently, we updated the ECMWF model's land cover characterization leveraging on state-of-the-art EOs-the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative land cover data set and the Copernicus Global Land Services leaf area index. Additionally, we tested a clumping parameterization, introducing seasonality to the effective low vegetation coverage. The updates reduced the overall daily maximum LST bias and unbiased root-mean-squared errors. In contrast, the implemented updates had a neutral impact on daily minimum LST. Our results also highlighted the complex regional heterogeneities in the atmospheric sensitivity to land cover and vegetation changes, particularly with issues emerging over eastern Brazil and northeastern Asia. These issues called for a re-calibration of model parameters (e.g., minimum stomatal resistance, roughness length, rooting depth), along with a revision of several model assumptions (e.g., snow shading by high vegetation).","[Nogueira, Miguel; Trigo, Isabel F.; Johannsen, Frederico; Dutra, Emanuel] Univ Lisbon, Inst Dom Luiz, IDL, Fac Sci, Lisbon, Portugal; [Boussetta, Souhail; Balsamo, Gianpaolo] ECMWF, Reading, Berks, England; [Albergel, Clement] ECSAT, European Space Agcy Climate Off, Didcot, Oxon, England; [Trigo, Isabel F.; Dutra, Emanuel] Inst Portugues Mar & Atmosfera, Lisbon, Portugal; [Miralles, Diego G.] Univ Ghent, Hydroclimate Extremes Lab H CEL, Ghent, Belgium",Universidade de Lisboa; European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF); Instituto Portugues do Mar e da Atmosfera; Ghent University,"Nogueira, M (corresponding author), Univ Lisbon, Inst Dom Luiz, IDL, Fac Sci, Lisbon, Portugal.",mdnogueira@fc.ul.pt,"Trigo, Isabel/H-1630-2011; Balsamo, Gianpaolo/I-3362-2013; Dutra, Emanuel/A-3774-2010; Miralles, Diego G/K-8857-2013; Nogueira, Miguel/L-3164-2015","Trigo, Isabel/0000-0001-8640-9170; Balsamo, Gianpaolo/0000-0002-1745-3634; Dutra, Emanuel/0000-0002-0643-2643; Miralles, Diego G/0000-0001-6186-5751; Albergel, Clement/0000-0003-1095-2702; Nogueira, Miguel/0000-0003-4587-875X","Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT) [PTDC/CTA-MET/28946/2017, UIDB/50019/2020-IDL]; European Research Council (ERC) [715254]; Belgian Science Policy Office (BELSPO) [SR/00/373]; CDIAC",Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)(Portuguese Foundation for Science and TechnologyEuropean Commission); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)European Commission); Belgian Science Policy Office (BELSPO)(Belgian Federal Science Policy Office); CDIAC,"This research was funded by the FundacAo para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT) grant number PTDC/CTA-MET/28946/2017 (CONTROL).

Ovid's narrative technique, his particular manner of using poetic images to evoke sympathetic responses that are concurrent inner recognitions, offers a valuable and enduring contribution to a psychology of myth. Ovid's story of Alcyone creates a climate within which the mingling of physical sensual details and imaginal perceptions becomes a poetry of events at hand, where nature and the human being interpenetrate. Orpheus's love, on the other hand, illustrates the power to captivate the psyche in a spiritual longing for another world and union that is found only in the underworld. Unlike Orpheus's love, that celebrates love's evanescence, Alcyone's love defies that kind of Orphic spiritualizing and removal from the world.","[Lendvay, Gregory Charles] Dallas ISD, Dept Social Studies, Dallas, TX 75204 USA",,"Lendvay, GC (corresponding author), Dallas ISD, Dept Social Studies, Dallas, TX 75204 USA.",,,,,,,,23,0,0,0,2,PENN STATE UNIV PRESS,UNIVERSITY PK,"820 NORTH UNIV DRIVE, U S B 1, STE C, UNIVERSITY PK, PA 16802 USA",1524-8429,2161-427X,,INTERDISCIP LIT STUD,Interdiscip.

By using stacked generalization, the individual machine learning models can be combined to improve the forecasting accuracy further. To appropriately design and implement these models in intra-day solar irradiance forecasting, input features are carefully prepared and processed. After proper feature selection, the machine learning models are implemented and optimized specifically for our application.

PSR is to embed a one-dimensional time series sequence in a high-dimension phase space as the input of the ESN. Specifically, the method PSR-ESN can capture seasonal characteristics of the climate data and reduce the lag of prediction as much as possible.

Highly oxygenated organic molecules (HOMs) are essential to grow the newly formed particles and have been evidenced to initiate ion-induced nucleation in chamber experiments in the absence of sulfuric acid. We investigate this phenomenon in the real atmosphere using an extensive set of state-of-the-art ion and mass spectrometers deployed in a boreal forest environment. We show that within a few hours around sunset, HOMs resulting from the oxidation of monoterpenes are capable of forming and growing ion clusters even under low sulfuric acid levels. In these conditions, we hypothesize that the lack of photochemistry and essential vapors prevents the organic clusters from growing past 6 nm.

Most of the reanalyses reproduce a reasonable global spatial distribution of observed TCs and temporal interannual variation of total TC frequency. Of the six reanalysis data sets, JRA-55 appears to be the best in terms of the following: the highest skill for spatial and temporal distribution of TC frequency of occurrence, highest TC hitting rate, lower false alarm rate, reasonable TC structure in terms of the relationship between maximum surface wind speed and sea level pressure, and higher correlation coefficients for interannual variations of TC frequency.

Here, we theoretically compare five possible tandem module architectures with multiple material combinations by modeling their outdoor performance ratios around the globe. This framework aids in evaluating future module designs and technology pathways by relating lab-based efficiency to field performance and even project financing. We find that tandem performance ratios depend notably on climate conditions. In general, three-terminal and mechanically voltage-matched modules show exceptionally good outdoor performance. Furthermore, we investigate the implications of technical performance on manufacturing cost globally and find that tandems are promising in high-value markets in arid climates, where a three to five times increase in the current silicon module manufacturing cost is allowed under art optimistic scenario.","[Liu, Haohui; Rodriguez-Gallegos, Carlos D.; Reindl, Thomas] Natl Univ Singapore, Solar Energy Res Inst Singapore, Singapore, Singapore; [Liu, Zhe; Buonassisi, Tonio; Peters, Ian Marius] MIT, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",National University of Singapore; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Liu, HH (corresponding author), Natl Univ Singapore, Solar Energy Res Inst Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.",liu.haohui@u.nus.edu,"Liu, Zhe/T-9004-2019","Liu, Zhe/0000-0001-7268-6214; Peters, Ian Marius/0000-0002-1725-0909",SERIS; Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology (SMART); National University of Singapore (NUS); Singapore's National Research Foundation Singapore (NRF) through the Singapore Economic Development Board (EDB),SERIS; Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology (SMART)(Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research & Technology Centre (SMART)); National University of Singapore (NUS)(National University of Singapore); Singapore's National Research Foundation Singapore (NRF) through the Singapore Economic Development Board (EDB),This work was supported by SERIS and the Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology (SMART).

Measuring this magnitude in time and space is crucial to obtain a general overview of the thermal environment at a mul- tiscale level ranging from the district scale to the city scale including its outskirts areas. These measure- ments allow the detection of black spots that can be used as a reference to fight against thermal anomalies resulting from anthropogenic causes and then to develop metropolitan areas more resilient to microclimate modifications, thus ensuring a real sustainable development of the environment and the territory. The main purpose of this paper is to provide the state of the art of different techniques and methods that have been developed to retrieve the spatial distribution of different types of urban heat island implemented in the urban climatology field. These different techniques are regrouped into three main categories namely In -Situ measurements, Remote Sensing observation methods and the modeling approach and allow to provide two types of urban heat island: the atmospheric urban heat island that includes the canopy and boundary layers; and the surface urban heat island. This paper provides also a detailed benchmarking of the different approaches of urban heat island modeling and gives a general overview of the strengths and weaknesses of each technique.

This is a particularly important topic given that climate change can alter plantherbivore interactions. We explored short-term responses of small mammal communities to recent exclusion of Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus elaphus) in high-elevation riparian drainages in northern Arizona, where elk impacts on vegetation have increased over the past quarter century associated with climate change. We used 10-ha elk exclosures paired with unfenced control drainages to examine how browsing influenced the habitat use, relative abundance, richness and diversity of a small mammal assemblage. We found that the small mammal assemblage changed significantly after 5years of elk exclusion. Relative abundance of voles (Microtus mexicanus) increased in exclosure drainages, likely due to an increase in habitat quality. The relative abundances of woodrats (Neotoma neomexicana) and two species of mice (Peromyscus maniculatus and P.boylii) decreased in the controls, while remaining stable in exclosures. The decline of mice in control drainages was likely due to the decline in shrub cover that they use. Thus, elk exclusion may have maintained or improved habitat for mice inside the exclosures while habitat quality and mouse abundance both declined outside the fences. Finally, small mammal species richness increased in the exclosures relative to the controls while species diversity showed no significant trends. Together, our results show that relaxation of heavy herbivore pressure by a widespread native ungulate can lead to rapid changes in small mammal assemblages. Moreover, exclusion of large herbivores can yield rapid responses by vegetation that may enhance or maintain habitat quality for small mammal populations.","[Parsons, Elliott W.

This review is a synthesis of the recent developments in pedology of vertisols achieved via high-resolution micro-morphology, mineralogy, and age-control data along with their geomorphologic and climatic history. This knowledge has contributed to our understanding of how the climate change-related pedogenic processes during the Holocene altered soil properties in the presence or absence of soil modifiers (Ca-zeolites and gypsum), calcium carbonate and palygorskite minerals. These state-of-the-art methods have established an organic link between pedogenic processes and bulk soil properties: the review also considers the need to modify the classification of vertisols at the subgroup level. We hope this review will fulfil the need for a handbook on vertisols to facilitate their better management for optimising their productivity in the 21st century. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The focus is on the development and long-term assessment of socio-technical pathways to create a multifunctional stormwater system at the city scale. The innovation is to identify and represent the socio-technical pathways by means of adoption curves for such transition processes. We combine urban planning policies and state-of-the-art urban engineering approaches with societal aspects and analyze them with traditional biophysical models (hydrologic-hydraulic sewer modeling). In doing so, different pathways from a current to a future system state are investigated under a variety of political, population and climate scenarios. Results allow for strategy screening by addressing the spatial and temporal implementation of decentralized stormwater control measures, to enable a successful transition to a sustainable future city. The model is applied to an ongoing transition of Kiruna, a city in Sweden, considering 36 different future trajectories over a transition period of 23 years. Results show that the trajectory of raingarden implementation under a sustainability policy can alleviate the adverse effects of urbanization (growth scenario). While this trajectory resulted in, for example, nearly the same sewer surcharge performance as that characterized by declining urbanization (stagnation) and a business-as-usual policy (with expected raingarden uptake rates approximately one-third lower), significantly better ecological performances (e.g. runoff treatment ratios up to 50%) are achieved.

We find statistically significant effects of GCRs on tropospheric and stratospheric NOx, HOx, ozone, temperature and zonal wind, whereas NOx, HOx and ozone are annually averaged and the temperature and the zonal wind are monthly averaged. In the Southern Hemisphere, the model suggests the GCR-induced NOx increase to exceed 10% in the tropopause region (peaking with 20% at the pole), whereas HOx is showing a decrease of about 3% caused by enhanced conversion into HNO3. As a consequence, ozone is increasing by up to 3% in the relatively unpolluted southern troposphere, where its production is sensitive to additional NOx from GCRs. Conversely, in the northern polar lower stratosphere, GCRs are found to decrease O-3 by up to 3 %, caused by the additional heterogeneous chlorine activation via ClONO2 + HCl following GCR-induced production of ClONO2. There is an apparent GCR-induced acceleration of the zonal wind of up to 5 m s(-1) in the Northern Hemisphere below 40 km in February, and a deceleration at higher altitudes with peak values of 3 m s(-1) around 70 km altitude. The model also indentifies GCR-induced changes in the surface air, with warming in the eastern part of Europe and in Russia (up to 2.25 K for March values) and cooling in Siberia and Greenland (by almost 2 K). We show that these surface temperature changes develop even when the GCR-induced ionization is taken into account only above 18 km, suggesting that the stratospherically driven strengthening of the polar night jet extends all the way down to the Earth's surface.","[Calisto, M.; Rozanov, E.; Peter, T.] Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci ETH, Zurich, Switzerland; [Usoskin, I.] Univ Oulu, Sodankyla Geophys Observ, Oulu 90014, Finland; [Rozanov, E.] World Radiat Ctr, Phys Meteorol Observ, Davos, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; University of Oulu,"Calisto, M (corresponding author), Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci ETH, Zurich, Switzerland.",marco.calisto@env.ethz.ch,"Usoskin, Ilya G./E-5089-2014; Rozanov, Eugene/V-1881-2018; Rozanov, Eugene/A-9857-2012; Peter, Thomas/B-2529-2018","Usoskin, Ilya G./0000-0001-8227-9081; Rozanov, Eugene/0000-0003-0479-4488; Rozanov, Eugene/0000-0003-0479-4488; Peter, Thomas/0000-0002-7218-7156",Swiss National Science Foundation [CRSI122-130642(FUPSOL)],Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission),IU and ER acknowledge useful discussions within the ISSI Team on Study of Cosmic Ray Influence upon Atmospheric Processes.

Methods: The system is based on two single-point laser triangulation sensors, a planar robot and a suite of software for driving the sensors, acquiring and post-processing the collected data. As a demonstration of the developed system we monitored three artifacts with the different aims to monitor the elastic properties of the artworks and the effectiveness of support frames in compensating the micro-climate fluctuations: the Annunciazione Antonello da Messina, the Paliotto di San Domenico, and the Portiera Oddi-Montesperelli. Results: In the Annunciazione case, the canvas response to tensioning trials was analyzed. The collected data permitted to quantify a maximum displacement of 0.9 and 1.5 mm for the tensioning tests at 1 and 2 mm, respectively. In the Portiera case, the displacement difference between the left and right canvas sides was (1.0 +/- 0.13)%, due to the inherent anisotropy of the material and by the structure of the artifact. In the Paliotto case, instead, minor displacement variations of the gilt leather due to the environment were observed, due to the analysis conducted prior of the restoration. Conclusions: The overall obtained results demonstrated that the system is able to provide useful data for the art conservation field, with a max inaccuracy less than 100 mu m.","[Del Sette, Fausto; Cappa, Paolo] Sapienza Univ Roma, Dept Mech & Aerosp Engn, DIMA, Via Eudossiana, Rome, Italy; [Patane, Fabrizio] Niccolo Cusano Univ, Via Don Gnocchi, Rome, Italy; [Rossi, Stefano] Tuscia Univ, DEIM, Largo Univ, Viterbo, Italy; [Torre, Mauro] ISCR, MiBACT, Rome, Italy",Sapienza University Rome; Niccolo Cusano Online University; Tuscia University,"Del Sette, F (corresponding author), Sapienza Univ Roma, Dept Mech & Aerosp Engn, DIMA, Via Eudossiana, Rome, Italy.",fausto.delsette@uniroma1.it,"Patane, Fabrizio/A-1613-2009","Patane, Fabrizio/0000-0003-0488-6139; DEL SETTE, FAUSTO/0000-0003-1179-0530",,,,,29,1,1,0,4,SPRINGEROPEN,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2050-7445,,,HERIT SCI,Herit.

Virtual landscapes are important for applications ranging from games to simulation. This paper extends work done on the auto generation of virtual landscapes for climate change visualisation, by adding an aesthetic measure based fitness function to the evolutionary algorithm, thus reducing the reliance of the method on user based evaluation. A genetic algorithm that uses an aesthetic measure of fitness based on information theory is defined. This GA is used to explore a multi-dimensional parameter space that defines how 3D virtual landscapes are created. The utility of this fitness measure is assessed by evaluating the solutions generated by the system with real users. Results indicate that genetic algorithms that use information theory based fitness measures do indeed generate virtual artefacts that match user preferences. Moreover the images generated are visually appealing enough to be curated for public exhibition along side human artists in art galleries by professional art critics.","[Walsh, Paul; Gade, Prasad] Cork Inst Technol, Dept Comp, Cork, Ireland",Cork Institute of Technology,"Walsh, P (corresponding author), Cork Inst Technol, Dept Comp, Cork, Ireland.",paul.walsh@cit.ie; prasad.gade@mycit.ie,,,,,,,17,4,4,0,2,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-1-4244-7835-4,IEEE C EVOL COMPUTAT,,,2011,,,,,1613,1619,,,,,,7,"Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Mathematical & Computational Biology",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Engineering; Mathematical & Computational Biology,BDE13,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000312932600218,View Full Record in Web of Science

For the first-time, the accumulated errors of precipitation and temperature of prior months are found to be crucial for explaining why CMIP6 models failed to capture trends and hotspots of snow depth change and notable time lags of the peak month. The worst snow depth performance of CMIP6 was on the Tibetan Plateau and resulted from more serious precipitation overestimates and temperature underestimates than in other regions.","[Zhang, Hongbo] China Agr Univ, Coll Water Resources & Civil Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Hongbo] China Agr Univ, Yantai Res Inst, Yantai, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Fan; Zhang, Guoqing] Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Tibetan Plateau Earth Syst Resource, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Fan; Zhang, Guoqing] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Yan, Wei] Xinyang Normal Univ, Sch Geog Sci, Xinyang, Peoples R China","China Agricultural University; China Agricultural University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Xinyang Normal University","Zhang, F (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Tibetan Plateau Earth Syst Resource, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Zhang, F (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.",Zhangfan@itpcas.ac.cn,"YAN, WEI/GOK-0597-2022; Yan, Wei/GPW-7906-2022; Zhang, Guoqing/F-1438-2019; zhang, fan/E-2398-2018","YAN, WEI/0000-0003-1391-1252; Yan, Wei/0000-0003-1391-1252; Zhang, Guoqing/0000-0003-2090-2813; zhang, fan/0000-0002-6714-9534","Shandong Provincial Natural Science Foundation [ZR2021MD029]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [42125104, 41701079]; Key Scientific Research Project in Colleges and Universities of Henan Province;  [22A170019]",Shandong Provincial Natural Science Foundation(Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Key Scientific Research Project in Colleges and Universities of Henan Province; ,"This study is supported by the project ZR2021MD029 supported by Shandong Provincial Natural Science Foundation, the National Natural Science Foundation of China (42125104, and 41701079), and the Key Scientific Research Project in Colleges and Universities of Henan Province (Grant No. 22A170019).",,44,1,1,14,14,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",0094-8276,1944-8007,,GEOPHYS RES LETT,Geophys.

Calculation of the tidal energy flux depends on high-resolution topographic datasets, not available for paleoclimate simulations. In this study we demonstrate that changes in the tidal mixing may have significant impacts on ocean circulation, sea surface temperatures, and hence climate. Using a coupled climate model, we test the system's sensitivity to perturbations in the tidal mixing surrounding the Maritime continent and show that an increase in such mixing could cause significant changes in the ocean thermal structure, including a similar to 1 degrees C warming of the ocean surface in the eastern equatorial Pacific and a similar cooling in the west. The mechanism of these changes involves mixing the relatively cold waters of the Equatorial undercurrent with warmer surface waters. The reduction of the zonal temperature gradient is amplified by ocean-atmosphere interactions associated with a weakening of the atmospheric Walker circulation. Potential implications of this study concern the Pliocene (an epoch characterized by a reduced zonal temperature contrast along the equator) and other past climates. While the actual strength of tidal mixing during the Pliocene is uncertain, our study assesses the bounds on how much tidal mixing may have contributed to maintaining its climate state. We conclude that, on geological timescales, changes in tidal mixing may be an important dynamical factor together with ocean bathymetry and continental configuration. Citation: Brierley, C.

EC windows were combined with overhangs since opaque overhangs provide protection from direct sun which EC windows are unable to do alone. The window wall was divided into an upper and lower aperture so that various combinations of overhang position and control strategies could be considered. The overhang was positioned either at the top of the upper window aperture or between the upper and lower apertures. Overhang depth was varied. EC control strategies were fully bleached at all times, modulated based on incident vertical solar radiation limits, or modulated to meet the design work plane illuminance with daylight. The EC performance was compared to a state-of-the-art spectrally selective low-e window with the same divided window wall, window size, and overhang as the EC configuration. The reference window was also combined with an interior shade which was manually deployed to control glare and direct sun. Both systems had the same daylighting control system to dim the electric lighting. Results were given for south-facing private offices in a typical commercial building. In hot and cold climates such as Houston and Chicago, EC windows with overhangs can significantly reduce the average annual daylight glare index (DGI) and deliver significant annual energy use savings if the window area is large. Total primary annual energy use was increased by 2-5% for moderate-area windows in either climate but decreased by 10% in Chicago and 5% in Houston for large-area windows. Peak electric demand can be reduced by 7-8%) for rnoderate-area windows and by 14-16% for large-area windows in either climate. Energy and peak demand reductions can be significantly greater if the reference case does not have exterior shading or state-ofthe-art static glass.

Yet the works that have been recovered in recent years show clearly that Chini's symbolist component was not casual or experimental, but-in parallel to his adaptation to the cultural climate of Europe-took on substance at particular moments in the artist's life and during traumatic or alarming historical events: at the time of his first brushes with the difficulties of existence, in the uncertain atmosphere of the First and Second World War and in the years in which the progressive loss of his vision inexorably frustrated all his hopes and expectations. Some of Chini's symbolist works are intended to represent the feeling of human failure in a climate colored by an excessive optimism, but others constitute a profound reflection on the part of the artist, who returns to questioning himself above and beyond the happier occasions of life, in yet others, he does not hesitate to give expression to the misgivings and anxieties that have beset men of every time and every condition, notwithstanding their grandiose dreams and overweening ambitions. Chini's peculiar brand of symbolism deviates, therefore,from a sacred climate that was very widespread amongst the European spiritualist tendencies of the late 19th century and even in the years of the Belle Epoque, but takes on progressive substance in the conscious pauses of his troubled existence, as well as in the human endurance with Which he faced the unexpected and inevitable events that brought his life to an end.",,,,,,,,,,,28,0,0,0,0,CASA EDITRICE LE LETTERE,FLORENCE,"COSTA S GIORGIO, 28, 50125 FLORENCE, ITALY",0011-1511,,,CRITICA ARTE,Crit.

Important questions are how reliable and consistent are atmospheric longwave radiation measurements and calculations and what are the uncertainties? The First International Pyrgeometer and Absolute Sky-scanning Radiometer Comparison, which was held at the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement program's Southern Great Plains site in Oklahoma, answers these questions at least for midlatitude summer conditions and reflects the state of the art for atmospheric longwave radiation measurements and calculations. The 15 participating pyrgeometers were all calibration-traced standard instruments chosen from a broad international community. Two new chopped pyrgeometers also took part in the comparison. An absolute sky-scanning radiometer (ASR), which includes a pyroelectric detector and a reference blackbody source, was used for the first time as a reference standard instrument to field calibrate pyrgeometers during clear-sky nighttime measurements. Owner-provided and uniformly determined blackbody calibration factors were compared. Remarkable improvements and higher pyrgeometer precision were achieved with field calibration factors. Results of nighttime and daytime pyrgeometer precision and absolute uncertainty are presented for eight consecutive days of measurements, during which period downward longwave irradiance varied between 260 and 420 W m(-2). Comparisons between pyrgeometers and the absolute ASR, the atmospheric emitted radiance interferometer, and radiative transfer models LBLRTM and MODTRAN show a surprisingly good agreement of <2 W m(-2) for nighttime atmospheric longwave irradiance measurements and calculations.","Phys Meteorol Observatorium Davos, World Radiat Ctr, CH-7260 Davos, Switzerland; NOAA, Climate Monitoring & Diagnost Lab, Boulder, CO 80303 USA; Natl Renewable Energy Lab, Golden, CO 80401 USA; SUNY Albany, Atmospher Sci Res Ctr, Albany, NY 12203 USA; DLR, Inst Atmospher Phys, D-82234 Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany; Univ Colorado, NOAA, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; Atmospher & Environm Res Inc, Lexington, MA 02421 USA; Univ Wisconsin, Ctr Space Sci & Engn, Madison, WI 53706 USA; Pacific NW Natl Lab, Richland, WA 99352 USA; Univ Colorado, CIRES, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; United States Department of Energy (DOE); National Renewable Energy Laboratory - USA; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Albany; Helmholtz Association; German Aerospace Centre (DLR); National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; Atmospheric & Environmental Research; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Pacific Northwest National Laboratory; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Philipona, R (corresponding author), Phys Meteorol Observatorium Davos, World Radiat Ctr, Dorfstr 33, CH-7260 Davos, Switzerland.",rphilipona@pmodwrc.ch; edutton@cmdl.noaa.gov; thomas_stoffel@nrel.gov; joe@asrc.cestm.albany.edu; ibrahim_reda@nrel.gov; peter.wendling@dlr.de; nwood@cwdl.noaa.gov; clough@aer.com; mlawer@aer.com; ganderson@plh.af.mil; hankr@ssec.wisc.edu; timothy.shippert@pnl.gov,,"Philipona, Rolf/0000-0001-8419-7610; Wood, Norman/0000-0001-8228-3910",,,,,22,82,83,0,17,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",2169-897X,2169-8996,,J GEOPHYS RES-ATMOS,J.

Its atmospheric mixing ratios have been increasing since 2005. Therefore, quantification of CH4 sources is essential for effective climate change mitigation. Here we report observations of the CH4 mixing ratios measured at the Zeppelin Observatory (Svalbard) in the Arctic and aboard the research vessel (RV) Helmer Hanssen over the Arctic Ocean from June 2014 to December 2016, as well as the long-term CH4 trend measured at the Zeppelin Observatory from 2001 to 2017. We investigated areas over the European Arctic Ocean to identify possible hotspot regions emitting CH4 from the ocean to the atmosphere, and used state-of-the-art modelling (FLEXPART) combined with updated emission inventories to identify CH4 sources. Furthermore, we collected air samples in the region as well as samples of gas hydrates, obtained from the sea floor, which we analysed using a new technique whereby hydrate gases are sampled directly into evacuated canisters. Using this new methodology, we evaluated the suitability of ethane and isotopic signatures (delta C-13 in CH4) as tracers for ocean-to-atmosphere CH4 emission. We found that the average methane / light hydrocarbon (ethane and propane) ratio is an order of magnitude higher for the same sediment samples using our new methodology compared to previously reported values, 2379.95 vs. 460.06, respectively. Meanwhile, we show that the mean atmospheric CH4 mixing ratio in the Arctic increased by 5.9 +/- 0.38 parts per billion by volume (ppb) per year (yr(-1)) from 2001 to 2017 and similar to 8 pbb yr(-1) since 2008, similar to the global trend of similar to 7 similar to 8 ppb yr(-1) . Most large excursions from the baseline CH4 mixing ratio over the European Arctic Ocean are due to long- range transport from land-based sources, lending confidence to the present inventories for high-latitude CH4 emissions. However, we also identify a potential hotspot region with ocean-atmosphere CH4 flux north of Svalbard (80.4 degrees N, 12.8 degrees E) of up to 26 nmol M-2 S-1 from a large mixing ratio increase at the location of 30 ppb. Since this flux is consistent with previous constraints (both spatially and temporally), there is no evidence that the area of interest north of Svalbard is unique in the context of the wider Arctic. Rather, because the meteorology at the time of the observation was unique in the context of the measurement time series, we obtained over the short course of the episode measurements highly sensitive to emissions over an active seep site, without sensitivity to land-based emissions.","[Platt, Stephen M.; Eckhardt, Sabine; Hermansen, Ove; Pisso, Ignacio; Schmidbauer, Norbert; Stohl, Andreas; Svendby, Tove M.; Myhre, Cathrine Lund] NILU Norwegian Inst Air Res, POB 100, N-2027 Kjeller, Norway; [Ferre, Benedicte; Jansson, Par; Silyakova, Anna; Vadakkepuliyambatta, Sunil; Mienert, Jurgen] UiT Arctic Univ Norway, Dept Geosci, CAGE Ctr Arctic Gas Hydrate Environm & Climate, N-9037 Tromso, Norway; [Fisher, Rebecca E.; Lowry, David; Nisbet, Euan G.] Royal Holloway Univ London, Dept Earth Sci, Egham, Surrey, England",Norwegian Institute for Air Research; UiT The Arctic University of Tromso; University of London; Royal Holloway University London,"Platt, SM (corresponding author), NILU Norwegian Inst Air Res, POB 100, N-2027 Kjeller, Norway.",sp@nilu.no,"Stohl, Andreas/A-7535-2008; Vadakkepuliyambatta, Sunil/ABA-4417-2021; Myhre, Cathrine L Lund/M-4508-2014; Lowry, David/GXG-1235-2022; Platt, Stephen M/G-1678-2019; Eckhardt, Sabine/I-4001-2012; Fisher, Rebecca/AAA-5352-2022; Pisso, Ignacio/B-1357-2017","Stohl, Andreas/0000-0002-2524-5755; Myhre, Cathrine L Lund/0000-0003-3587-5926; Platt, Stephen M/0000-0002-8439-6633; Eckhardt, Sabine/0000-0001-6958-5375; Vadakkepuliyambatta, Sunil/0000-0003-1118-1321; Ferre, Benedicte/0000-0003-1646-9287; Jansson, Par/0000-0002-6729-9428; Pisso, Ignacio/0000-0002-0056-7897; Hermansen, Ove/0000-0001-7353-057X; LOWRY, DAVID/0000-0002-8535-0346",Research Council of Norway; Research Council of Norway [225814]; Research Council of Norway through its Centres of Excellence funding scheme [223259],Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway); Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway); Research Council of Norway through its Centres of Excellence funding scheme,"SOCA (Signals from the Arctic OCean to the Atmosphere), NILU's strategic initiative (SIS) project funded by the Research Council of Norway.

Consequently, the atmospheric, hydrological and geomorphic controls on these hydrogeomorphic processes are poorly understood, leading to highly uncertain warning and risk management. On the other hand, remote sensing of precipitation and numerical weather predictions have become the basis of several flood forecasting systems, enabling increasingly accurate detection of hazardous events. The objective of this paper is to provide a review on current European and international research on early warning systems for flash floods and debris flows. We expand upon these themes by identifying: (a) the state of the art; (b) knowledge gaps; and (c) suggested research directions to advance warning capabilities for extreme hydrogeomorphic processes. We also suggest three areas in which advancements in science will have immediate and important practical consequence, namely development of rainfall estimation and nowcasting schemes suited to the specific space-time scales, consolidating physical, engineering and social datasets of flash floods and debris-flows, integration of methods for multiple hydrogeomorphic hazard warning.

Here, we compile data on satellite observation of vegetation greenness and spring onset date, satellite-based soil moisture, passive microwave snow water equivalent (SWE) and climate data to show that winter SWE can significantly influence vegetation greenness during the early growing season (the period between spring onset date and peak photosynthesis timing) over nearly one-fifth of the land surface in the region north of 30 degrees, but the magnitude and sign of correlation exhibits large spatial heterogeneity. We then apply an assembled path model to disentangle the two main processes (via changing early growing-season soil moisture, and via changing the growth period) in controlling the impact of winter SWE on vegetation greenness, and suggest that the moisture and growth period effect, to a larger extent, result in positive and negative snow-productivity associations, respectively. The magnitude and sign of snow-productivity association is then dependent upon the relative dominance of these two processes, with the moisture effect and positive association predominating in Central, western North America and Greater Himalaya, and the growth period effect and negative association in Central Europe. We also indicate that current state-of-the-art models in general reproduce satellite-based snow-productivity relationship in the region north of 30 degrees, and do a relatively better job of capturing the moisture effect than the growth period effect. Our results therefore work towards an improved understanding of winter snow impact on vegetation greenness in northern ecosystems, and provide a mechanistic basis for more realistic terrestrial carbon cycle models that consider the impacts of winter snow processes.","[Wang, Xiaoyi; Wang, Tao; Guo, Hui; Liu, Dan; Zhao, Yutong; Zhang, Taotao; Piao, Shilong] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Key Lab Alpine Ecol & Biodivers, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Tao; Piao, Shilong] Chinese Acad Sci, CAS Ctr Excellence Tibetan Plateau Earth Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Liu, Qiang; Piao, Shilong] Peking Univ, Sino French Inst Earth Syst Sci, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Peking University","Wang, T (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Beijing, Peoples R China.",twang@itpcas.ac.cn,"Wang, Tao/ABE-7107-2020","Wang, Tao/0000-0002-1323-8697; Qiang, Liu/0000-0003-2332-2873",Key Research and Development Programs for Global Change and Adaptation [2017YFA0603604]; International Partnership Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences [131C11KYSB20160061]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41530528]; Thousand Youth Talents Plan project in China,Key Research and Development Programs for Global Change and Adaptation; International Partnership Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Thousand Youth Talents Plan project in China,"Key Research and Development Programs for Global Change and Adaptation, Grant/Award Number: 2017YFA0603604; International Partnership Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Grant/Award Number: 131C11KYSB20160061; National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 41530528; Thousand Youth Talents Plan project in China",,66,51,54,14,149,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

One strategy for securing wildlife populations into the future is to preserve biomaterials in genome resource banks (GRB; or 'biobanks'). However, for GRBs to be successful we must understand the fundamental reproductive biology of species, along with developing assisted reproductive techniques (ARTs), including AI and semen cryopreservation. ART has been successfully used for several taxa, from amphibians to mammals, including ungulates, carnivores and primates. Not all these success stories implemented the use of a biobank, but one example that discussed herein is the black-footed ferret (Mustela nigripes) GRB. From a founder population of seven individuals, this species has been breeding in a managed setting for nearly 30 years. The goal of the breeding program is to maintain genetic integrity by ensuring each individual has the opportunity to pass his/her genes onto the next generation, while simultaneously providing animals for release into the wild. Scientists have used ART (e.g. AI) in the recovery program. Recently, semen from an individual of the founder population that was cryopreserved for up to 20 years was used successfully for AI, which improved the genetic diversity of the population. The black-footed ferret recovery program can serve as a model for other endangered species and demonstrates the usefulness of ART and GRBs to maintain highly endangered species into the future.","[Santymire, Rachel] Lincoln Pk Zoo, Davee Ctr Epidemiol & Endocrinol, 2001 North Clark St, Chicago, IL 60614 USA",,"Santymire, R (corresponding author), Lincoln Pk Zoo, Davee Ctr Epidemiol & Endocrinol, 2001 North Clark St, Chicago, IL 60614 USA.",rsantymire@lpzoo.org,,,Lincoln Park Zoo; Davee Foundation; National Fish and Wildlife Foundation; Smithsonian's National Zoological Park; Friends of the National Zoo; USA Forest Service; National Park Service; USA Fish and Wildlife Service; Prairie Wildlife Research; Phoenix Zoo Conservation and Science Fund; AZA Conservation Grant Fund,Lincoln Park Zoo; Davee Foundation; National Fish and Wildlife Foundation; Smithsonian's National Zoological Park(Smithsonian InstitutionSmithsonian National Zoological Park & Conservation Biology Institute); Friends of the National Zoo(Smithsonian InstitutionSmithsonian National Zoological Park & Conservation Biology Institute); USA Forest Service; National Park Service; USA Fish and Wildlife Service(US Fish & Wildlife Service); Prairie Wildlife Research; Phoenix Zoo Conservation and Science Fund; AZA Conservation Grant Fund,"The author acknowledges Dr JoGayle Howard's life effort to save imperilled species, including the black-footed ferret.

In the mesosphere, both H2O and CO are sensitive to solar irradiance (SI) variability because of their destruction/production by solar radiation. This enables us to analyze the solar signal in both models and observed data. Here, we evaluate the mesospheric H2O and CO response to solar irradiance variability using the Chemistry-Climate Model Initiative (CCMI-1) simulations and satellite observations. We analyzed the results of four CCMI models (CMAM, EMAC-L90MA, SOCOLv3, and CESM1-WACCM 3.5) operated in CCMI reference simulation REF-C1SD in specified dynamics mode, covering the period from 1984-2017. Multiple linear regression analyses show a pronounced and statistically robust response of H2O and CO to solar irradiance variability and to the annual and semiannual cycles. For periods with available satellite data, we compared the simulated solar signal against satellite observations, namely the GOZCARDS composite for 1992-2017 for H2O and Aura/MLS measurements for 2005-2017 for CO. The model results generally agree with observations and reproduce an expected negative and positive correlation for H2O and CO, respectively, with solar irradiance. However, the magnitude of the response and patterns of the solar signal varies among the considered models, indicating differences in the applied chemical reaction and dynamical schemes, including the representation of photolyzes. We suggest that there is no dominating thermospheric influence of solar irradiance in CO, as reported in previous studies, because the response to solar variability is comparable with observations in both low-top and high-top models. We stress the importance of this work for improving our understanding of the current ability and limitations of state-of-the-art models to simulate a solar signal in the chemistry and dynamics of the middle atmosphere.","[Karagodin-Doyennel, Arseniy; Rozanov, Eugene; Stenke, Andrea; Peter, Thomas] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci IAC, Zurich, Switzerland; [Karagodin-Doyennel, Arseniy; Rozanov, Eugene] Phys Meteorol Observ Davos, World Radiat Ctr PMOD WRC, Davos, Switzerland; [Kuchar, Ales] Leipzig Inst Meteorol LIM, Fac Phys & Earth Sci, Leipzig, Germany; [Ball, William] Delft Univ Technol, Dept Geosci & Remote Sensing, Delft, Netherlands; [Arsenovic, Pavle] Swiss Fed Labs Mat Sci & Technol EMPA, Dubendorf, Switzerland; [Remsberg, Ellis] NASA, Langley Res Ctr, Sci Directorate, Hampton, VA 23665 USA; [Joeckel, Patrick] Deutsch Zentrum Luft & Raumfahrt DLR, Inst Phys Atmosphare, Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany; [Kunze, Markus] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Meteorol, D-12165 Berlin, Germany; [Plummer, David A.] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Climate Res Div, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Marsh, Daniel; Kinnison, Doug] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [Marsh, Daniel] Univ Leeds, Priestley Int Ctr Climate, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Delft University of Technology; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science & Technology (EMPA); National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Langley Research Center; Helmholtz Association; German Aerospace Centre (DLR); Free University of Berlin; Environment & Climate Change Canada; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; University of Leeds,"Karagodin-Doyennel, A (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci IAC, Zurich, Switzerland.",darseni@student.ethz.ch,"Jöckel, Patrick/C-3687-2009; Karagodin, Arseniy/AAI-1535-2021; Stenke, Andrea/GYJ-6299-2022; Peter, Thomas/B-2529-2018; Arsenovic, Pavle/M-8919-2018; Jöckel, Patrick/AAN-1285-2020; Rozanov, Eugene/V-1881-2018","Jöckel, Patrick/0000-0002-8964-1394; Karagodin, Arseniy/0000-0001-6934-2787; Peter, Thomas/0000-0002-7218-7156; Arsenovic, Pavle/0000-0001-8844-7007; Jöckel, Patrick/0000-0002-8964-1394; Remsberg, Ellis/0000-0002-6452-2794; Kunze, Markus/0000-0002-9608-1823; Kuchar, Ales/0000-0002-3672-6626; Stenke, Andrea/0000-0002-5916-4013; Rozanov, Eugene/0000-0003-0479-4488; Plummer, David/0000-0001-8087-3976; Ball, William/0000-0002-1005-3670",Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Forderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung [200020_182239]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [JA836/431]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) [KU 3632/2-1]; National Science Foundation [1852977],Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Forderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This research has been supported by the Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Forderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung (grant no. 200020_182239), the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (VACILT; grant no.

In recent decades, rapid social and economic development has led to increased land use/land cover (LULC) changes in the Dongting Lake area, which affect the surface energy balance and hydrological processes. Its contemporary variability under climate change remains highly uncertain. Therefore, we retrieved the Land surface temperature (LST) from the Landsat 7 data and explored its relationship with the LULC types. The results showed that LST is significantly affected by surface type. LST varied significantly across LULC types, with higher LSTs in built-up land, reed beach land, forest land, and paddy fields than in water bodies, mud beaches, marshlands, and riparian forests. Water bodies play an important regulatory role in reducing LST and mitigating thermal effects on the ground. The winter LST in the study area increased by approximately 3.5 degrees C, which may be related to the decrease in the area of Dongting Lake water bodies, water fields and reed flats after the Three Gorges Reservoir was impounded. Compared with the relationship between the NDVI, DEM, and distance from the water body, the negative correlation between the NDMI and LST was stronger and more stable and had the greatest effect on LST. These insights improve the understanding of the land change consequences on the temporal dynamics of LST.","[Tan, Jie] Hunan Agr Univ, Coll Landscape Architecture & Art Design, Changsha 410128, Peoples R China; [Yu, De] China Univ Geosci, Sch Publ Adm, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China; [Li, Qiang] Hunan Hydro & Power Design Inst, Changsha 410007, Peoples R China; [Tan, Xuelan; Zhou, Weijun] Hunan Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm, Changsha 410128, Peoples R China",Hunan Agricultural University; China University of Geosciences; Hunan Agricultural University,"Tan, J (corresponding author), Hunan Agr Univ, Coll Landscape Architecture & Art Design, Changsha 410128, Peoples R China.",37080689@qq.com,,"Tan, Jie/0000-0001-8491-5651",Nationa Natural Science Foundation of China [41971219]; project of outstanding youth science in Hunan province Education Department [15B107],Nationa Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); project of outstanding youth science in Hunan province Education Department,"This research was financially supported by the Nationa Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41971219), The project of outstanding youth science in Hunan province Education Department (Grant No. 15B107).

In Germany, landscape plans assess and organize the spatial allocation of land use as an environmental contribution to general spatial planning. Collaborative planning processes are important to develop sustainable and ecosystem-based strategies to make coastal landscapes climate proof. However, there is little experience with collaborative processes in practical planning in Germany, and probably in other countries as well. This paper conducts an empirical case study in the low-lying coastal areas of northwest Germany. During a collaborative landscape planning process, four different ecosystem-based land management scenarios have been co-designed by regional experts and researchers. The participatory and iterative process included the development of scenario narratives to define planning goals, the use of land use elements and their relations to ecosystem services as planning entities in terms of indicators, the art-based illustrations of the different scenarios, and an evaluation and monitoring of the outcomes by regional experts. The decision-maker group decided on the so-called actor-based scenario, which contained freshwater retention areas (polders) to prevent potential uncontrolled flooding of the hinterland. This climate adaptation strategy has been implemented in the regional development plan of the county.","[Karrasch, Leena] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Ecol Econ Grp, Dept Business Adm Econ & Law, D-26111 Oldenburg, Germany; [Maier, Martin; Kleyer, Michael] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Landscape Ecol Grp, Inst Biol & Environm Sci, D-26111 Oldenburg, Germany; [Karrasch, Leena; Klenke, Thomas] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, COAST Ctr Environm & Sustainabil Res, D-26111 Oldenburg, Germany",Carl von Ossietzky Universitat Oldenburg; Carl von Ossietzky Universitat Oldenburg; Carl von Ossietzky Universitat Oldenburg,"Karrasch, L (corresponding author), Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Ecol Econ Grp, Dept Business Adm Econ & Law, D-26111 Oldenburg, Germany.;Karrasch, L (corresponding author), Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, COAST Ctr Environm & Sustainabil Res, D-26111 Oldenburg, Germany.",leena.karrasch@uni-oldenburg.de; Martin.maier@uni-oldenburg.de; Michael.kleyer@uni-oldenburg.de; Thomas.klenke@uni-oldenburg.de,"Maier, Martin/AFS-5352-2022; Maier, Martin/F-5642-2010","Maier, Martin/0000-0002-3782-6370; Maier, Martin/0000-0002-3782-6370; Kleyer, Michael/0000-0002-0824-2974; Klenke, Thomas/0000-0001-7190-8495",German Federal Ministry of Education and Research [01LL0911],German Federal Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"The development of the actor-based scenario was only possible with the active participation of the experts.

The models included in the comparison are the 3-D chemistry transport model 3dCTM, the ECHAM5/MESSy Atmospheric Chemistry (EMAC) model, FinROSE, the Hamburg Model of the Neutral and Ionized Atmosphere (HAMMO-NIA), the Karlsruhe Simulation Model of the Middle Atmosphere (KASIMA), the modelling tools for SOlar Climate Ozone Links studies (SOCOL and CAO-SOCOL), and the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM4). The comparison focuses on the energetic particle precipitation (EPP) indirect effect, that is, the polar winter descent of NOx largely produced by EPP in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere. A particular emphasis is given to the impact of the sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) in January 2009 and the subsequent elevated stratopause (ES) event associated with enhanced descent of mesospheric air. The chemistry climate model simulations have been nudged toward reanalysis data in the troposphere and stratosphere while being unconstrained above. An odd nitrogen upper boundary condition obtained from MIPAS observations has further been applied to medium-top models. Most models provide a good representation of the mesospheric tracer descent in general, and the EPP indirect effect in particular, during the unperturbed (pre-SSW) period of the NH winter 2008/2009. The observed NOx descent into the lower mesosphere and stratosphere is generally reproduced within 20 %. Larger discrepancies of a few model simulations could be traced back either to the impact of the models' gravity wave drag scheme on the polar wintertime meridional circulation or to a combination of prescribed NOx mixing ratio at the uppermost model layer and low vertical resolution. In March-April, after the ES event, however, modelled mesospheric and stratospheric NOx distributions deviate significantly from the observations. The too-fast and early downward propagation of the NO x tongue, encountered in most simulations, coincides with a temperature high bias in the lower mesosphere (0.2-0.05 hPa), likely caused by an overestimation of descent velocities. In contrast, upper-mesospheric temperatures (at 0.05-0.001 hPa) are generally underestimated by the high-top models after the onset of the ES event, being indicative for too-slow descent and hence too-low NOx fluxes. As a consequence, the magnitude of the simulated NOx tongue is generally underestimated by these models. Descending NOx amounts simulated with mediumtop models are on average closer to the observations but show a large spread of up to several hundred percent. This is primarily attributed to the different vertical model domains in which the NOx upper boundary condition is applied. In general, the intercomparison demonstrates the ability of state-of- the-art atmospheric models to reproduce the EPP indirect effect in dynamically and geomagnetically quiescent NH winter conditions. The encountered differences between observed and simulated NOx, CO, and temperature distributions during the perturbed phase of the 2009 NH winter, however, emphasize the need for model improvements in the dynamical representation of elevated stratopause events in order to allow for a better description of the EPP indirect effect under these particular conditions.","[Funke, Bernd; Gardini, Angela; Lopez-Puertas, Manuel] Inst Astrofis Andalucia, CSIC, Apdo 3004, Granada 18008, Spain; [Ball, William; Rozanov, Eugene; Sukhodolov, Timofei] World Radiat Ctr, Physikalisch Meteorolog Observatorium, Davos, Switzerland; [Seppala, Annika; Verronen, Pekka T.] Finnish Meteorol Inst, Earth Observat Unit, Helsinki, Finland; [Bender, Stefan; Nieder, Holger; Reddmann, Thomas; Sinnhuber, Miriam; Stiller, Gabriele P.; Versick, Stefan; von Clarmann, Thomas] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res IMK ASF, PoB 3640, D-76021 Karlsruhe, Germany; [Harvey, V.

This approach combines information from historical temperature data and state-of-the-art historical climate model simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). We find that this sequence of record-breaking temperatures had a negligible (< 0.03%) likelihood of occurrence in the absence of anthropogenic warming. It was still a rare but not implausible event (roughly 1-3% likelihood) taking anthropogenic warming into effect. The probability that three consecutive records would have been observed at some point since 2000 is estimated as similar to 30-50% given anthropogenic warming and < 0.7% in its absence. The likelihood of observing the specific level of record warmth recorded during 2016 is no more than similar to one-in-a-million neglecting anthropogenic warming, but as high as 27%, i.e., a nearly one-in-three chance of occurrence taking anthropogenic warming into account.","[Mann, Michael E.; Miller, Sonya K.; Tingley, Martin] Penn State Univ, Dept Meteorol, 503 Walker Bldg, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Rahmstorf, Stefan] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Earth Syst Anal, Potsdam, Germany; [Steinman, Byron A.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Duluth, MN 55812 USA; [Steinman, Byron A.] Univ Minnesota, Large Lakes Observ, Duluth, MN 55812 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Duluth; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Duluth,"Mann, ME (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Dept Meteorol, 503 Walker Bldg, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",mann@psu.edu,"Rahmstorf, Stefan/A-8465-2010; Mann, Michael E/B-8472-2017","Rahmstorf, Stefan/0000-0001-6786-7723; Mann, Michael E/0000-0003-3067-296X",,,,,11,17,17,0,11,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",0094-8276,1944-8007,,GEOPHYS RES LETT,Geophys.

We introduce a non-linear, multiscale approach, based on wavelets and event synchronization, for unravelling teleconnection influences on precipitation. We consider those climate patterns with the highest relevance for Indian precipitation. Our results suggest significant influences which are not well captured by only the wavelet coherence analysis, the state-of-the-art method in understanding linkages at multiple timescales. We find substantial variation across India and across timescales. In particular, El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) mainly influence precipitation in the south-east at interannual and decadal scales, respectively, whereas the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) has a strong connection to precipitation, particularly in the northern regions. The effect of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) stretches across the whole country, whereas the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) influences precipitation particularly in the central arid and semi-arid regions. The proposed method provides a powerful approach for capturing the dynamics of precipitation and, hence, helps improve precipitation forecasting.","[Kurths, Juergen; Agarwal, Ankit; Shukla, Roopam; Marwan, Norbert; Caesar, Levke] Leibniz Assoc, Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res PIK, Potsdam, Germany; [Kurths, Juergen; Agarwal, Ankit; Merz, Bruno] Univ Potsdam, Inst Earth & Environm Sci, Potsdam, Germany; [Kurths, Juergen] Humboldt Univ, Inst Phys, Berlin, Germany; [Agarwal, Ankit; Merz, Bruno] GFZ German Res Ctr Geosci, Sect 5 4, Potsdam, Germany; [Rathinasamy, Maheswaran] MVGR Coll Engn, Dept Civil Engn, Vizianagaram, India; [Caesar, Levke] Univ Potsdam, Inst Phys & Astron, Potsdam, Germany; [Krishnan, Raghavan] Indian Inst Trop Meteorol, Pune, Maharashtra, India",Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; University of Potsdam; Humboldt University of Berlin; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Center Potsdam GFZ German Research Center for Geosciences; University of Potsdam; Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) - India; Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM),"Agarwal, A (corresponding author), Leibniz Assoc, Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res PIK, Potsdam, Germany.;Agarwal, A (corresponding author), Univ Potsdam, Inst Earth & Environm Sci, Potsdam, Germany.;Agarwal, A (corresponding author), GFZ German Res Ctr Geosci, Sect 5 4, Potsdam, Germany.",agarwal.10891.ankit@gmail.com,"AGARWAL, ANKIT/X-6301-2018; Caesar, Levke/AEB-5340-2022; Marwan, Norbert/D-9576-2011; Shukla, Roopam/AAR-2215-2020","AGARWAL, ANKIT/0000-0001-8572-7046; Caesar, Levke/0000-0002-5626-0392; Marwan, Norbert/0000-0003-1437-7039; Merz, Bruno/0000-0002-5992-1440; Rathinasamy, Maheswaran/0000-0002-8124-3092",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [2043/1],Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)),This research has been supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (grant no. 2043/1).,,76,32,32,1,10,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1023-5809,1607-7946,,NONLINEAR PROC GEOPH,Nonlinear Process Geophys.,15-Aug,2019,3,,,,251,266,,10.5194/npg-26-251-2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/npg-26-251-2019,,,16,"Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences; Physics, Fluids & Plasmas",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Geology; Mathematics; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences; Physics,IR8ZG,,"Green Submitted, Green Accepted, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000481731600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Since 2011, almost fifty small-scale biomass gasification plants have been authorized and built in the South Tyrolean region (Italy), and most of them are currently operating. Within this framework, an extensive survey was performed by means of questionnaires to the plant owners for assessing the biomass and char flows in the region. Moreover, a comprehensive monitoring campaign was carried out onsite on representative plants of almost all the available operating technologies. For each of the monitored plants, the feedstock and the gasification products were characterized and their fluxes quantified, leading to energy and mass balances. This allowed collecting an extended set of data and drawing up a unique overview of the reference values for the ranges of operation of small-scale biomass gasification systems currently available in the European market, in terms of equivalence ratio, dry gas composition and heating value, specific electricity production, and conversion efficiencies. Moreover, samples of chars were deeply characterized, providing an insight into possible utilization pathways for the valorization of this by-product that is currently disposed of, representing an economical and environmental burden. ? 2021 The Authors.

The results showed that increases in SST and the SST meridional gradient could intensify the subtropical westerly jets and significantly weaken the northern polar vortex. In the model runs, global uniform SST increases produced a more significant impact on the southern stratosphere than the northern stratosphere, while SST gradient increases produced a more significant impact on the northern stratosphere. The asymmetric responses of the northern and southern polar stratosphere to SST meridional gradient changes were found to be mainly due to different wave properties and transmissions in the northern and southern atmosphere. Although SST increases may give rise to stronger waves, the results showed that the effect of SST increases on the vertical propagation of tropospheric waves into the stratosphere will vary with height and latitude and be sensitive to SST meridional gradient changes. Both uniform and non-uniform SST increases accelerated the large-scale Brewer-Dobson circulation (BDC), but the gradient increases of SST between 60A degrees S and 60A degrees N resulted in younger mean age-of-air in the stratosphere and a larger increase in tropical upwelling, with a much higher tropopause than from a global uniform 1.0 K SST increase.","[Hu Dingzhu; Tian Wenshou] Lanzhou Univ, Coll Atmospher Sci, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China; [Xie Fei] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Shu Jianchuan] China Meteorol Adm, Inst Plateau Meteorol, Chengdu 610000, Peoples R China; [Dhomse, Sandip] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Inst Climate & Atmospher Sci, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England","Lanzhou University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; China Meteorological Administration; University of Leeds","Tian, WS (corresponding author), Lanzhou Univ, Coll Atmospher Sci, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China.",wstian@lzu.edu.cn,"Dhomse, Sandip/AAM-1119-2021; Xie, Fei/I-9766-2016; Dhomse, Sandip/C-8198-2011","Xie, Fei/0000-0003-2891-3883; Dhomse, Sandip/0000-0003-3854-5383","National Basic Research Program of China [2010CB428604]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41175042, 41225018]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China [lzujbky-2012-k04]",National Basic Research Program of China(National Basic Research Program of China); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),This work was supported by the National Basic Research Program of China (Grant No. 2010CB428604) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 41175042 and 41225018).

Results indicate that tree canopy and surface water covers had the least surface temperature variations in mesoscale. The average minimum surface temperature of tree canopy cover was 2.79 degrees C lower than asphalt and 4.74 degrees C lower than paved areas.

There is some evidence that better weather forecasts can be produced by introducing big data mining and neural networks into the weather prediction workflow. Here, we discuss the question of whether it is possible to completely replace the current numerical weather models and data assimilation systems with DL approaches. This discussion entails a review of state-of-the-art machine learning concepts and their applicability to weather data with its pertinent statistical properties.

As a contribution to filling this knowledge gap, we investigated the major pathways through which two interlinked environmental drivers, eutrophication and climate, affect the biomass and community composition of fish and benthic macrofauna. For this aim, we conducted a systematic sensitivity analysis using two models simulating the dynamics of benthic and pelagic food webs in the Baltic Sea. We varied environmental forcing representing primary productivity, oxygen conditions and water temperature in all possible combinations, over a range representative of expected changes during the 21st century. Both models indicated that increased primary productivity leads to biomass increase in all parts of the system, however, counteracted by expanding hypoxia. Effects of temperature were complex, but generally small compared to the other drivers. Similarities across models give confidence in the main results, but we also found differences due to different representations of the food web in the two models. While both models predicted a shift in benthic community composition toward an increased abundance of Limecola (Macoma) balthica with increasing productivity, the effects on deposit-feeding and predatory benthic groups depended on the presence of fish predators in the model. The model results indicate that nutrient loads are a stronger driver of change for ecosystem functions in the Baltic Sea than climate change, but it is important to consider the combined effects of these drivers for proper management of the marine environment.","[Ehrnsten, Eva; Gustafsson, Bo G.] Univ Helsinki, Tvarminne Zool Stn, Hango, Finland; [Ehrnsten, Eva; Bauer, Barbara; Gustafsson, Bo G.] Stockholm Univ, Baltic Sea Ctr, Stockholm, Sweden; [Bauer, Barbara] Friedrich Schiller Univ Jena, Inst Ecol, Jena, Germany; [Bauer, Barbara] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Leipzig, Germany",University of Helsinki; Stockholm University; Friedrich Schiller University of Jena,"Ehrnsten, E (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Tvarminne Zool Stn, Hango, Finland.;Ehrnsten, E (corresponding author), Stockholm Univ, Baltic Sea Ctr, Stockholm, Sweden.",eva.ehrnsten@su.se,"Ehrnsten, Eva/GWU-7048-2022; Gustafsson, Bo/GQH-3048-2022; Bauer, Barbara/AAH-2454-2019; Bauer, Barbara/ABD-8980-2020","Ehrnsten, Eva/0000-0002-8960-8252; ",EU; Academy of Finland; Swedish Research Council Formas through BONUS (Art 185) as part of the BONUS BALTICAPP project; Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management through their grant 1.11 - Measure for Marine and Water Environment,EU(European Commission); Academy of Finland(Academy of Finland); Swedish Research Council Formas through BONUS (Art 185) as part of the BONUS BALTICAPP project; Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management through their grant 1.11 - Measure for Marine and Water Environment,"This study received funding from the EU, the Academy of Finland, and the Swedish Research Council Formas through BONUS (Art 185) as part of the BONUS BALTICAPP project, and from the Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management through their grant 1.11 - Measure for Marine and Water Environment.",,105,15,15,1,28,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-7745,,FRONT MAR SCI,Front.

It possibly sustained the Harappan civilization in the Indian subcontinent. This river has been studied as a part of the Ghaggar-Satluj-Hakra-Nara channel system in India and Pakistan. This study investigated its independent existence and evolution in the Himalayan foothill terrain and the proximal alluvial plains. Use of satellite imagery, shuttle radar topography mission data, accelerator mass spectrometry C-14 dating and optically stimulated luminescence chronology is being made to identify the possible palaeo-path of this ancient river and to characterize the trench sediment log architecture of the Saraswati River palaeochannels in northern India (Haryana). Our investigations reveal that this river formed a dense web of interconnecting channels which are continuously networked for more than 2,984 km in Haryana and their individual floodplain width varies from 1.5 to 13 km. The Harappan settlements in Haryana and Rajasthan nucleated and prospered in the fertile channel bars and interfluves of this river system. Majority of these habitation sites were located within a radius of less than 500 m from these palaeo-water channel networks. Enormous amount of water was flowing through this channel network until BC 11,147. Sediment characteristics and their chronology reveal that flow of water in the river channel decreased with time as the glacial cover diminished. The varying thickness of clay beds in sediment logs is indicative of the fluctuations in water flow possibly as a consequence of terrain slope modifications and consequent gradual channel avulsion, climate change, and global drought events. The flow of water continued through the Himalayan foothill input channels of the palaeo-Saraswati River in Haryana until AD 1402.","[Chaudhri, Akshey Rajan; Ranga, Rajesh; Rajput, Subhash; Verma, Veerendra Kumar] Kurukshetra Univ, Ctr Excellence Res Saraswati River, Kurukshetra 136119, Haryana, India; [Chaudhri, Akshey Rajan; Singh, Yoginder; Sharma, Vikram] Kurukshetra Univ, Dept Geol, Kurukshetra, Haryana, India; [Chopra, Sundeep; Kumar, Pankaj; Sharma, Rajveer] Inter Univ Accelerator Ctr, Delhi, India",Kurukshetra University; Kurukshetra University; Inter-University Accelerator Centre,"Chaudhri, AR (corresponding author), Kurukshetra Univ, Ctr Excellence Res Saraswati River, Kurukshetra 136119, Haryana, India.",archaudhri@gmail.com,,,Government of Haryana (Haryana Saraswati Heritage Development Board); Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH),Government of Haryana (Haryana Saraswati Heritage Development Board); Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH),Government of Haryana (Haryana Saraswati Heritage Development Board); Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH),,87,2,2,5,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1075-2196,1099-0763,,ARCHAEOL PROSPECT,Archaeol.

However, it requires large areas of land. At the same time, food security is threatened by the impacts of climate change and a growing world population. This has led to increasing competition for limited land resources. In this context, the combination of photovoltaics and plant production often referred to as agrophotovoltaic (APV) or agrivoltaic systems has been suggested as an opportunity for the synergistic combination of renewable energy and food production. Although this technology has already been applied in various commercial projects, its practicability and impact on crop production have hardly been investigated. In this review, we give a short summary of the current state of the art and prospective opportunities for the application of APV systems. In addition, we discuss microclimatic alterations and the resulting impacts of APV on crop production. Our main findings are that (1) crop cultivation underneath APV can lead to declining crop yields as solar radiation is expected to be reduced by about one third underneath the panels. However, microclimatic heterogeneities and their impact on crop yields are missing reference and thus, remain uncertain. (2) Through combined energy and crop production, APV can increase land productivity by up to 70%. (3) Given the impacts of climate change and conditions in arid climates, potential benefits are likely for crop production through additional shading and observed improvements of water productivity. (4) In addition, APV enhances the economic value of farming and can contribute to decentralized, off-grid electrification in developing and rural areas, thus further improving agricultural productivity. As such, APV can be a valuable technical approach for more sustainable agriculture, helping to meet current and prospective needs of energy and food production and simultaneously sparing land resources.","[Weselek, Axel; Ehmann, Andrea; Hoegy, Petra] Univ Hohenheim, Inst Landscape & Plant Ecol, Dept Plant Ecol & Ecotoxicol, Stuttgart, Germany; [Ehmann, Andrea; Lewandowski, Iris] Univ Hohenheim, Inst Crop Sci, Dept Biobased Prod & Energy Crops, Stuttgart, Germany; [Zikeli, Sabine] Univ Hohenheim, Ctr Organ Farming, Stuttgart, Germany; [Schindele, Stephan] Fraunhofer Inst Solar Energy Syst ISE, Div Photovolta, Grp PV Power Plants, Freiburg, Germany",University Hohenheim; University Hohenheim; University Hohenheim; Fraunhofer Gesellschaft,"Weselek, A (corresponding author), Univ Hohenheim, Inst Landscape & Plant Ecol, Dept Plant Ecol & Ecotoxicol, Stuttgart, Germany.",a.weselek@uni-hohenheim.de,,"Bauerle, Andrea/0000-0003-2777-4092; Schindele, Stephan/0000-0001-9863-739X; Lewandowski, Iris/0000-0002-0388-4521; Hogy, Petra/0000-0002-4833-1381",German Federal Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF) [033L098G],German Federal Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),Manuscript was written within the APV-RESOLA project that received funding from the German Federal Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF) under grant no. 033L098G.

Whilst a combination of long-term monitoring programmes and intensive Arctic field campaigns have improved our knowledge of glacier-ocean interactions in recent years, especially with respect to fjord/ocean circulation, there are extensive knowledge gaps concerning how glaciers affect marine biogeochemistry and productivity. Following two cross-cutting disciplinary International Arctic Science Committee (IASC) workshops addressing the importance of glaciers for the marine ecosystem, here we review the state of the art concerning how freshwater discharge affects the marine environment with a specific focus on marine biogeochemistry and biological productivity. Using a series of Arc- tic case studies (Nuup Kangerlua/Godthabsfjord, Kongsfjorden, Kangerluarsuup Sermia/Bowdoin Fjord, Young Sound and Sermilik Fjord), the interconnected effects of freshwater discharge on fjord-shelf exchange, nutrient availability, the carbonate system, the carbon cycle and the microbial food web are investigated. Key findings are that whether the effect of glacier discharge on marine primary production is positive or negative is highly dependent on a combination of factors. These include glacier type (marineor land-terminating), fjord-glacier geometry and the limiting resource(s) for phytoplankton growth in a specific spatio-temporal region (light, macronutrients or micronutrients). Arctic glacier fjords therefore often exhibit distinct discharge-productivity relationships, and multiple case-studies must be considered in order to understand the net effects of glacier discharge on Arctic marine ecosystems.","[Hopwood, Mark J.; Achterberg, Eric P.; Clarke, Jennifer S.] GEOMAR Helmholtz Ctr Ocean Res Kiel, Kiel, Germany; [Carroll, Dustin] San Jose State Univ, Moss Landing Marine Labs, Moss Landing, CA USA; [Dunse, Thorben; Hodson, Andy] Western Norway Univ Appl Sci, Sogndal, Norway; [Dunse, Thorben] Univ Oslo, Oslo, Norway; [Hodson, Andy; Chierici, Melissa] Univ Ctr Svalbard, Longyearbyen, Svalbard; [Holding, Johnna M.] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, Silkeborg, Denmark; [Iriarte, Jose L.] Univ Austral Chile, Inst Acuicultura, Puerto Montt, Chile; [Iriarte, Jose L.] Univ Austral Chile, Ctr Dinam Ecosistemas Marinos Altas Latitudes Ide, Puerto Montt, Chile; [Ribeiro, Sofia] Geol Survey Denmark & Greenland, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Cantoni, Carolina; Cozzi, Stefano] CNR ISMAR Ist Sci Marine, Trieste, Italy; [Chierici, Melissa] Inst Marine Res, Fram Ctr, Tromso, Norway; [Fransson, Agneta] Norwegian Polar Res Inst, Fram Ctr, Tromso, Norway; [Juul-Pedersen, Thomas; Winding, Mie H.

The Western Basin and the nearshore areas are most susceptible to the wave-induced bottom orbital oscillations on the seasonal mean scale, and the offshore Central Basin is sensitive to them as well during episodic events. Profound seasonality was found in both mean and extreme wave dynamics during ice-free cycles. Mean significant wave height (SWH) is highest during fall with more occurrences of extreme events (SWH > 3.1 m) and is lowest during summer, which is controlled by wind speed and direction collectively. Besides, swells generated in the Central and Eastern Basins could interact with each other under various wind directions, whereas wave generated in the Central Basin could hardly propagate into the Western Basin. In addition, the regression analysis of surrounding meteorological stations indicates increasing SWH in the Western Basin and decreasing SWH in the Eastern Basin.","[Niu, Qianru; Xia, Meng] Univ Maryland Eastern Shore, Dept Nat Sci, Princess Anne, MD 21853 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland Eastern Shore,"Xia, M (corresponding author), Univ Maryland Eastern Shore, Dept Nat Sci, Princess Anne, MD 21853 USA.",mxia@umes.edu,"Niu, Qian/G-9908-2013","Niu, Qianru/0000-0002-5840-5655",Great Lakes Fishery Commission,Great Lakes Fishery Commission,"This project is funded by the Great Lakes Fishery Commission.

The Community Earth System Model (CESM) is one of the state-of-the-art and the most widely-used coupled models for simulating the earth system. Although considerable effort has been put to improve the scalability of single component, CESM is still struggling with the poor performance due to load balance across components. To solve this problem, an easy-used and easy-ported auto-tuning framework named CESMTuner is proposed in this paper. It targets to reduce the time consumed of CESM as much as possible by looking for the optimal process configuration. In which, a novel process layout searching algorithm is presented that can look for the optimal process count of each component as well as the best process layout across components simultaneously. Moreover, a lightweight and accurate performance model is built to reduce searching overhead effectively. With the evaluation over TianHe-1A, CESMTuner can achieve 58.49% performance improvement compared to the widely-used sequential process layout and achieve 38.23% performance improvement compared to the heuristic branch and bound algorithm based on the performance model of simply fitting each component's runtime.","[Ding Nan; Xue Wei; Ji Xu; Xu Haoyu] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Technol, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Ding Nan; Xue Wei; Ji Xu; Xu Haoyu] Tsinghua Univ, Tsinghua Natl Lab Informat Sci & Technol, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Ding Nan; Xue Wei; Ji Xu] Tsinghua Univ, Key Lab Earth Syst Modeling, Minist Educ, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Ding Nan; Xue Wei; Ji Xu] Tsinghua Univ, Ctr Earth Syst Sci, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Song Zhenya] SOA, Inst Oceanog 1, Qingdao 266061, Peoples R China",Tsinghua University; Tsinghua University; Tsinghua University; Tsinghua University; State Oceanic Administration,"Ding, N (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Technol, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",,"Song, Zhenya/AAC-2044-2019; Song, Zhenya/F-9819-2013","Song, Zhenya/0000-0002-8098-5529; Song, Zhenya/0000-0002-8098-5529",,,,,22,6,6,0,1,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"SARA BURGERHARTSTRAAT 25, PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",,,978-1-4799-6123-8,,,,2014,,,,,282,289,,10.1109/HPCC.2014.51,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/HPCC.2014.51,,,8,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Software Engineering; Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BF3NX,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000380560600045,View Full Record in Web of Science

Likewise, buildings consume 35% of the energy and emit 38% of global greenhouse gases. Cities can aggravate such problems further by generating the phenomenon of urban heat islands (UHI). Few studies have evaluated the state of the art in UHIs' influence on buildings' energy performance, so the present research aims to analyze the main studies evaluating the thermo-energy behavior of buildings subjected to UHI. This was done with a systematic literature review and a scientific mapping of the publications present in Web of Science until 2021. 100 articles were selected for analysis in this review. The results point to an important evolution in the study of parameters affecting urban buildings' performance, in addition to the analysis of different urban land uses as a strategy to sectorize UHI. Such scientific evolution is analyzed and discussed in four-time segments. Fragmentation on building cooling loads and the energy penalty index derived from UHI are discussed, resulting in an average cooling penalty of 6.63 kWh/m2/y/degrees C and 3.81 kWh/m2/y/degrees C, for residential and office use respectively.

Gold and silver first adorned the inside and outside of purple or indigo covers of sutra scrolls, signifying their great value and nobility. In tenth-century Japan combined gold and silver pigments were applied to the decoration of secular manuscripts as well as sacred works. By the twelfth century a variety of alternative materials was also employed to achieve nuances in gold and silver tints. Ocher as a substitute, mixtures of silver pigment and yellow dye, or silver pigment coated with yellow or orange translucent colorants were introduced to create gold tints, while silver leaf or a mixture of mica dust and pale ink were employed for silver. These developments, previously unrecorded, have recently been detected using modern techniques such as x-radiography and close-up photography. This paper discusses instances of these innovations, particularly those belonging to the first half of the twelfth century, which were analyzed in the context of art-historical evolution. The author suggests that these innovations correspond to the beginning of the so-called Age of the Retired Emperors, which occurred around 1100, when parallel attitudes toward diversity and new aesthetics in lacquerware and in the literary world were also introduced. Retired Emperor Shirakawa, who occupied this position for more than forty years after reigning as emperor from 1072 to 1086, was an influential figure in this climate of political and cultural change.","Natl Res Inst Cultural Properties, Tokyo, Japan",,,,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,1,ARCHETYPE PUBL LTD,LONDON,"6 FITZROY SQUARE, LONDON, W1T 5HJ, ENGLAND",,,978-1-873132-74-6,,,,2005,,,,,10,15,,,,,,6,Art,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Art,BGE76,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000246349100002,View Full Record in Web of Science

We conduct an intermodel singular value decomposition analysis and find that the DSL uncertainties in these two oceans are both intrinsically connected to the uncertainty in the change of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC). We further conduct a freshwater hosing experiment to show that the AMOC decline not only accounts for the dipole pattern in the DSL change in the North Atlantic but also remotely induces a poleward shift in the Southern Hemisphere westerlies that helps build a belted pattern of DSL change in the Southern Ocean. Our results suggest that reducing the intermodel spread in the change of the AMOC can greatly improve the consistency of DSL projection among models not only in individual basins but over the global ocean. Plain Language Summary State-of-art climate models project distinct patterns of regional sea level change. Most of these patterns arise from a dynamic change in the ocean, which has been named the dynamic sea level (DSL) change. However, climate models project different regional DSL changes in the 21st century, especially those in the North Atlantic and Southern Oceans. Any connection between intermodel uncertainties in the DSL projections in different basins has largely been ignored. We argue here that the change in the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) is a key factor that controls the intermodel uncertainty of regional DSL projections on a global scale. A weakening AMOC alters the DSL pattern in the North Atlantic and concurrently remotely affects the DSL over the Southern Ocean. In particular, we find that a decline in the AMOC could cause a poleward shift of the Southern Hemisphere westerly winds and thereby lead to a zonal belt-like change of the DSL in the Southern Ocean. These results imply that improving the intermodel consistency of the projected changes in the AMOC will greatly improve the reliability of future sea level projections on a global scale.","[Chen, Changlin; Wang, Guihua] Fudan Univ, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Chen, Changlin; Wang, Guihua] Fudan Univ, Inst Atmospher Sci, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Chen, Changlin; Liu, Wei] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Earth Sci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA",Fudan University; Fudan University; University of California System; University of California Riverside,"Chen, CL (corresponding author), Fudan Univ, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Shanghai, Peoples R China.;Chen, CL (corresponding author), Fudan Univ, Inst Atmospher Sci, Shanghai, Peoples R China.;Chen, CL; Liu, W (corresponding author), Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Earth Sci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.",chencl@fudan.edu.cn; wei.liu@ucr.edu,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [41576022, 91428206]; Program of Shanghai Academic/Technology Research Leader [17XD1400600]; National Science Foundation [OPP-1741841]; Department of Earth Sciences, University of California, Riverside; Regents' Faculty Fellowship","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Program of Shanghai Academic/Technology Research Leader; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Department of Earth Sciences, University of California, Riverside; Regents' Faculty Fellowship","This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41576022 and 91428206) and the Program of Shanghai Academic/Technology Research Leader (17XD1400600).

The study employs the state-of-the-art National Water Model (NWM) and compares the effects of initial soil moisture condition with those of seasonal climate anomalies on streamflow and soil moisture forecast skills. We have designed and implemented seasonal streamflow forecast ensemble experiments following the methodology suggested by Dirmeyer et al. The study also compares the soil moisture variability in the NWM with in situ measurements and remote sensing data from the Soil Moisture Active and Passive (SMAP) satellite. The NWM skillfully simulates the observed streamflow in the ACT basin. The soil moisture variability is 46% smaller in the NWM compared with the SMAP data, mainly due to a weaker amplitude of the seasonal cycle. This study finds that initial soil moisture condition is a major source of predictability for the seasonal streamflow forecast. The contribution of the initial soil moisture condition is comparable or even higher than that of seasonal climate anomaly effects in dry seasons. In the boreal summer season, the initial soil moisture condition contributes to 65% and 48% improvements in the seasonal streamflow and soil moisture forecast skills, respectively. This study attributes a greater improvement in the streamflow forecast skill to the lag effects between the soil moisture and streamflow anomalies. The results of this study can inform the development and improvement of the operational streamflow forecasting system.","[Duan, Yanan; Kumar, Sanjiv] Auburn Univ, Earth Syst Sci Program, Sch Forestry & Wildlife Sci, Auburn, AL 36849 USA",Auburn University System; Auburn University,"Kumar, S (corresponding author), Auburn Univ, Earth Syst Sci Program, Sch Forestry & Wildlife Sci, Auburn, AL 36849 USA.",szk0139@auburn.edu,,,Auburn University Intramural Grant funding (IGPVPRProject) [180286-2018]; Auburn University Hopper Cluster,Auburn University Intramural Grant funding (IGPVPRProject); Auburn University Hopper Cluster,Auburn University Intramural Grant funding (IGPVPRProject 180286-2018) supported this research.

The analysis is based on a set of 600 years long experiments performed with a state-of-the-art coupled general circulation model (CGCM) with the 1990 reference value of atmospheric CO2 multiplied by 4, 8 and 16. Extreme increases in atmospheric CO2 concentration have been applied to force the climate system towards stable states with different thermo-dynamical properties and analyze how the different resulting oceanic stratification and diffusion affect the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). The AMOC weakens in response to the induced warming with distinctive features in the extreme case: a southward shift of convective sites and the formation of a density front at mid-latitudes. The analysis of the density fluxes reveals that NA loses density at high latitudes and gains it southward of 40 degrees N mainly due to the haline contribution. Our results indicate that the most important processes that control the AMOC are active in the high latitudes and are related to the stability of the water column. The increased ocean stratification stabilizes the ocean interior leading to a decreased vertical diffusivity, a reduction in the formation of deep water and a weaker circulation. In particular, the deep convection collapses mainly in the Labrador Sea as a consequence of the water column stratification under high latitudes freshening.","[Lecci, Rita] Fdn Ctr Euro Mediterraneo Cambiamenti Climatici, Lecce, Italy; [Masina, Simona; Cherchi, Annalisa] Fdn Ctr Euro Mediterraneo Cambiamenti Climatici, Bologna, Italy; [Masina, Simona; Cherchi, Annalisa] Ist Nazl Geofis & Vulcanol, Sez Bologna, Bologna, Italy; [Barreiro, Marcelo] Univ Republica, Fac Ciencias, Montevideo, Uruguay","Centro Euro-Mediterraneo sui Cambiamenti Climatici (CMCC); Istituto Nazionale Geofisica e Vulcanologia (INGV); Universidad de la Republica, Uruguay","Lecci, R (corresponding author), Fdn Ctr Euro Mediterraneo Cambiamenti Climatici, Lecce, Italy.",rita.lecci@cmcc.it,"Barreiro, Marcelo/AAT-7377-2020; Cherchi, Annalisa/Y-6684-2019","Cherchi, Annalisa/0000-0002-0178-9264; Barreiro, Marcelo/0000-0002-7819-1607; LECCI, Rita/0000-0003-2996-4295; MASINA, Simona/0000-0001-6273-7065","Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research; Ministry for Environment, Land and Sea through the project GEMINA","Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR)); Ministry for Environment, Land and Sea through the project GEMINA","We gratefully acknowledge the support of Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research and Ministry for Environment, Land and Sea through the project GEMINA.

In a political climate beleaguered by efforts to delegitimize expertise, what are the implications for a research tradition that seeks to understand cultural value from a range of diverse perspectives? In light of visibility generated by the 2009 publication of Helen Freshwater's Theatre & Audience and the subsequent launch in January 2017 of the international Network for Audience Research in the Performing Arts (iNARPA), the time seems ripe for a detailed critical overview of the audience studies discipline as it has been applied to theatre. In providing that survey, this article contends that the early decades of the new millennium have seen research into arts participation becoming trapped between two colliding agendas. Whereas on the one hand there is a growing pressure to celebrate cultural engagement in all its contradictory forms, there has on the other hand been a simultaneous imperative within the arts to push back against the encroaching de-hierarchization of cultural value beyond critical and scholarly perspectives.

This study comprehensively evaluates several newly released precipitation products, i.e., MSWEP-V2.2, IMERG-V05B, IMERG-V06A, IMERG-V05-RT, ERA5, and SM2RAIN-ASCAT, at daily and monthly time-scales over Austria. We show that all the examined products are able to reproduce the spatial precipitation distribution over the country. MSWEP, followed by IMERG-V05B and -V06A, show the strongest agreement with in situ observations and perform better than other products with respect to spatial patterns and statistical metrics. Both IMERG and ERA5 products seem to have systematic precipitation overestimation at the monthly time-scale. IMERG-V06A performs slightly better than IMERG-V05B. With respect to heavy precipitation (P > 10 mm/day), MSWEP compare to other products demonstrate advantages in detecting precipitation events with a higher spatial average of probability of detection (POD) and lower false alarm ratio (FAR) scores skill (0.74 and 0.28), while SM2RAIN and ERA5 reveal lower POD (0.35) and higher FAR (0.56) in this precipitation range in comparison with other products. However, the ERA5 and MSWEP indicate robust average POD and FAR values with respect to light/moderate precipitation (10 mm > P >= 0.1 mm) with 0.94 and 0.11, respectively. Such robustness of MSWEP may be rooted in applying the daily rain gauges in calibration processes. Moreover, although all products accurately map the spatial precipitation distribution they still have difficulty capturing the effects of topography on precipitation. The overall performance of the precipitation products was lower in the peripheries of the study area where most stations are situated in the mountainous area and was higher over the low altitude regions. However, according to our analysis of the considered products, MSWEP-V2.2, followed by IMERG-V06S and -V05B, are the most suitable for driving hydro-meteorological, agricultural, and other models over mountainous terrain.","[Sharifi, Ehsan; Eitzinger, Josef] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci BOKU, Inst Meteorol & Climatol, A-1180 Vienna, Austria; [Sharifi, Ehsan] Univ Vienna, Dept Meteorol & Geophys, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Dorigo, Wouter] Vienna Univ Technol TU Wien, Dept Geodesy & Geoinformat, A-1040 Vienna, Austria","University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna; University of Vienna; Technische Universitat Wien","Sharifi, E (corresponding author), Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci BOKU, Inst Meteorol & Climatol, A-1180 Vienna, Austria.;Sharifi, E (corresponding author), Univ Vienna, Dept Meteorol & Geophys, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.",ehsan.sharifi@boku.ac.at,"Dorigo, Wouter A/C-7794-2014; Sharifi, Ehsan/M-9763-2018; Eitzinger, Josef/E-2150-2015","Dorigo, Wouter A/0000-0001-8054-7572; Sharifi, Ehsan/0000-0001-7181-8406; ",BOKU Vienna Open Access Publishing Fund,BOKU Vienna Open Access Publishing Fund,"We gratefully acknowledge the NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center's and PPS for IMERG data, the ERA5 datasets from the Climate Data Store (CDS) of the European Centre for Medium RangeWeather Forecasts (ECMWF), Hylke Beck, the developer of the MSWEP data (https://doi.org/10.1175/BAMS-D-17-0138.1), and Luca Brocca, the developer of SM2RAIN data from https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2591215, for providing the data used in this study, freely to public.

Two deseasonalized and detrended monthly time series of anomalous CO2 fluxes were generated: (1) modeled terrestrial biospheric CO2 flux anomalies calculated by the High Resolution Biosphere Model (HRBM) driven by realistic temperature and precipitation data but without considering radiation effects and (2) anomalous CO2 fluxes deduced from atmospheric measurements. While comparing the two time series, three types of periods could be distinguished: a'' periods with a phase shift close to zero between the two series, b'' periods with a phase shift of up to 11 months, and c'' periods with the two curves completely out of phase. During the c'' periods the modeled data show carbon release by the biosphere while the observed data show carbon uptake. The periods of type c'' are accompanied by major volcanic eruptions with considerable aerosol production. Enhanced atmospheric aerosol loading can increase the diffuse fraction of the solar radiation. Diffuse radiation in many cases penetrates better into plant canopies thus potentially enhancing photosynthesis. The resulting additional uptake of carbon may have overcompensated the carbon release caused by ENSO effects thus possibly bringing about a net uptake of CO2. The length variations of the time lags (b'' periods) may be attributed to impacts of vegetation fires. The influence of the NAO remained unclear.","Univ Giessen, Interdisciplinary Res Ctr, Inst Plant Ecol, D-35392 Giessen, Germany",Justus Liebig University Giessen,"Reichenau, TG (corresponding author), Univ Giessen, Interdisciplinary Res Ctr, Inst Plant Ecol, Heinrich Buff Ring 26-32, D-35392 Giessen, Germany.",tim.reichenau@bio.uni-giessen.de; gerd.esser@bot2.bio.uni-giessen.de,,"Reichenau, Tim/0000-0002-5062-6218",,,,,97,19,19,0,6,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",0886-6236,1944-9224,,GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEM CY,Glob.

Loy's creative efforts were heterogeneous, spanning multiple media: a poet and painter, she was also a designer, actor and inventor. Seeking to instantiate herself in a cultural climate which tended to objectify the female body, Loy's multisensual art aimed to make the viewer/listener/reader sense as she did, and, in so doing, made important advances in the cultural configuration of women as whole, complex beings worthy of intellectual, physical, artistic and spiritual presence in the world. Loy's assemblage art of the 1950s is shown to be a radical attempt to push the medium of collage into a more complex dimensionality in an effort to represent emerging understandings of perception and consciousness, positioning her as a major contributor to a defining art form of modernism. Bolstered by an appreciation of her own body as sensually charged and relational, Loy ascertained the simultaneity of present absence, connectivity and juxtaposition characterizing collage. This article articulates how, by troubling normative conceptions of dimensionality Loy's assemblages underscore the material and textual aspects of language explored in her collage-inflected poetry.","Ryerson Univ, Modern Literature & Culture Res Ctr, Toronto, ON, Canada",Toronto Metropolitan University,"Zelazo, S (corresponding author), Ryerson Univ, Modern Literature & Culture Res Ctr, Toronto, ON, Canada.",,,,,,,,40,3,3,0,1,BERG PUBL,LONDON,"BLOOMSBURY PLC, 50 BEDFORD SQ, LONDON, WC1B 3DP, ENGLAND",1745-8927,,,SENSES SOC,Senses Soc.,MAR,2009,1,,,,47,73,,10.2752/174589309X388564,http://dx.doi.org/10.2752/174589309X388564,,,27,"Humanities, Multidisciplinary",Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;HCI),Arts & Humanities - Other Topics,686FZ,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000284683500003,View Full Record in Web of Science

The new model system aims to fill the gap between cloud resolving models and global scale models. It represents the very complex microscale aerosol and cloud physics as detailed as possible, whereas the continental domain size and efficient codes will allow for both studying weather and regional climate. The model system is applied in a first extended case study for Europe for a cloudy five day period in August 2005. The model results show that the mean cloud droplet number concentration of clouds is correlated with the structure of the terrain, and we present a terrain slope parameter TS to classify this dependency. We propose to use this relationship to parameterize the probability density function, PDF, of subgrid-scale cloud updraft velocity in the activation parameterizations of climate models. The simulations show that the presence of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and clouds are closely related spatially. We find high aerosol and CCN number concentrations in the vicinity of clouds at high altitudes. The nucleation of secondary particles is enhanced above the clouds. This is caused by an efficient formation of gaseous aerosol precursors above the cloud due to more available radiation, transport of gases in clean air above the cloud, and humid conditions. Therefore the treatment of complex photochemistry is crucial in atmospheric models to simulate the distribution of CCN. The mean cloud droplet number concentration and droplet diameter showed a close link to the change in the aerosol. To quantify the net impact of an aerosol change on the precipitation we calculated the precipitation susceptibility beta for the whole model domain over a period of two days with an hourly resolution. The distribution function of beta is slightly skewed to positive values and has a mean of 0.23. Clouds with a liquid water path LWP of approximately 0.85 kg m(-2) are on average most susceptible to aerosol changes in our simulations with an absolute value of beta of 1. The average beta for LWP between 0.5 kg m(-2) and 1 kg m(-2) is approximately 0.4.","[Bangert, M.; Kottmeier, C.; Vogel, B.; Vogel, H.] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Karlsruhe, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology,"Bangert, M (corresponding author), Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Karlsruhe, Germany.",max.bangert@kit.edu,"Vogel, Bernhard/A-9558-2013; Kottmeier, Christoph/A-9553-2013; Bangert, Max/H-2393-2013; Vogel, Heike/A-3196-2013","Vogel, Bernhard/0000-0002-8894-0165; Kottmeier, Christoph/0000-0002-2196-2052; Bangert, Max/0000-0003-1832-6730; ",,,,,50,49,50,1,22,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1680-7316,1680-7324,,ATMOS CHEM PHYS,Atmos.

The results show a general positive trend both in local storminess and storm surge heights over the last century. These tendencies are probably associated with increased westerly circulation and cyclonic activity in the Northern Atlantic. While in Estonian tide gauges, the mean sea level rise (1.5-2.7 mm/yr) is roughly equal to or insignificantly higher than the recent global sea level rise estimates (1.5-1.7 mm/yr), the trend estimates for annual maximum sea levels vary between 3 and 10 mm/yr for different tide gauges and study periods. Maximum value analysis revealed that, in general, the empirical data of both annual maximum wind speeds and sea levels follow the Gumbel distribution. However, in some windward bays of western Estonia two storm surge events (in 1967 and 2005) are inconsistent with the theoretical distributions, which indicate that, in these locations, the most extreme sea level events are hardly predictable by means of return statistics.","Univ Tartu, Estonian Marine Inst, EE-50090 Tartu, Estonia",University of Tartu; Estonian Marine Institute,"Suursaar, U (corresponding author), Univ Tartu, Estonian Marine Inst, Ulikooli 18, EE-50090 Tartu, Estonia.",,"Suursaar, Ülo/E-6481-2012","Suursaar, Ülo/0000-0002-3474-8151",,,,,11,3,3,0,5,WIT PRESS/COMPUTATIONAL MECHANICS PUBLICATIONS,SOUTHAMPTON,"ASHURST LODGE, ASHURST, SOUTHAMPTON SO40 7AA, ENGLAND",1746-4471,,978-1-84564-086-6,WIT TRANS ENG SCI,,,2007,,,,,41,50,,10.2495/EN070051,http://dx.doi.org/10.2495/EN070051,,,10,"Engineering, Civil",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Engineering,BGL94,,Bronze,,,12/21/22,WOS:000248253300005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Examining her creative strategies to explore the colonial photographic archive of the Hamburg Museum am Rothenbaum elucidates how her practice relates to critical scholarly investigations of the ambivalences of photographs from the colonial era. Ndjiharine's artistic practice not only critiques German institutions, colonial modes of representation and knowledge production, but also conjures up alternative ways to reimagine obscured and entangled colonial histories.

This paper extends the analysis of processes that led to convection initiation (CI), i.e. the transition from shallow to deep convection, on this day with the data from several COPS instruments that have not been considered in previous studies. In particular, the boundary-layer structure, lids and the water-vapour field in the pre-convective environment of the event are discussed. For this purpose, we investigated measurements of water-vapour lidars, temperature lidars and wind lidars, profiles from radiosondes, in situ aircraft data and gridded data of weather stations as well as GPS integrated-water-vapour data and satellite imagery. Thermally driven circulation systems formed over both the Black Forest and the Vosges mountain ranges which resulted in local convergence zones. These superimposed with the large-scale convergence in the Black Forest area. In the presence of sufficient moisture and updraught, clouds formed close to the mountain crests. The related latent-heat release allowed larger thermals to be produced, which may have had a positive feedback on stabilizing these convergence zones as a whole. We believe that differences in the moisture field explain why convection remained shallow and sparse over the Vosges mountains because these differences were responsible for differences in convective inhibition (CIN). The stationary location of the convergence zone over the southern Black Forest was probably decisive for CI because it constantly transported sensible and latent heat into the area in which CI took place.

The reasons for this increase and range expansion remain largely unknown due to the complexity of the transmission pathways and underlying disease drivers. In a first, we use advanced artificial intelligence to disentangle the contribution of eco-climatic drivers to WNV-outbreaks across Europe using decade long (2010-2019) data at high spatial resolution. Methods We use a high-performance machine learning classifier, XGBoost (eXtreme gradient boosting) combined with state-of-the-art XAI (eXplainable artificial intelligence) methodology to describe the predictive ability and contribution of different drivers of the emergence and transmission of WNV-outbreaks in Europe, respectively. Findings Our model, trained on 2010-2017 data achieved an AUC (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) score of 0.97 and 0.93 when tested with 2018 and 2019 data, respectively, showing a high discriminatory power to classify a WNV-endemic area. Overall, positive summer/spring temperatures anomalies, lower water availability index (NDWI), and drier winter conditions were found to be the main determinants of WNV-outbreaks across Europe. The climate trends of the preceding year in combination with eco-climatic predictors of the first half of the year provided a robust predictive ability of the entire transmission season ahead of time. For the extraordinary 2018 outbreak year, relatively higher spring temperatures and the abundance of Culex mosquitoes were the strongest predictors, in addition to past climatic trends. Interpretation Our AI-based framework can be deployed to trigger rapid and timely alerts for active surveillance and vector control measures in order to intercept an imminent WNV-outbreak in Europe.

However, the complexities of the seawater Fe cycle, which impact its speciation and bioavailability, are simplified in such OGCBMs due to gaps in understanding and to avoid high computational costs. In a similar fashion to inorganic carbon speciation, we outline a means by which the complex speciation of Fe can be included in global OGCBMs in a reasonably cost-effective manner. We construct an Fe speciation model based on hypothesised relationships between rate constants and environmental variables (temperature, light, oxygen, pH, salinity) and assumptions regarding the binding strengths of Fe complexing organic ligands and test hypotheses regarding their distributions. As a result, we find that the global distribution of different Fe species is tightly controlled by spatio-temporal environmental variability and the distribution of Fe binding ligands. Impacts on bioavailable Fe are highly sensitive to assumptions regarding which Fe species are bioavailable and how those species vary in space and time. When forced by representations of future ocean circulation and climate we find large changes to the speciation of Fe governed by pH mediated changes to redox kinetics. We speculate that these changes may exert selective pressure on phytoplankton Fe uptake strategies in the future ocean. In future work, more information on the sources and sinks of ocean Fe ligands, their bioavailability, the cycling of colloidal Fe species and kinetics of Fe-surface coordination reactions would be invaluable. We hope our modeling approach can provide a means by which new observations of Fe speciation can be tested against hypotheses of the processes present in governing the ocean Fe cycle in an integrated sense","[Tagliabue, A.] IPSL CEA CNRS UVSQ Orme Merisiers, Lab Sci Climat & Environm, F-91198 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Tagliabue, A.] Council Sci & Ind Res CSIR, So Ocean Carbon & Climate Observ, ZA-7599 Stellenbosch, South Africa; [Tagliabue, A.] Univ Cape Town, Dept Oceanog, ZA-7925 Cape Town, South Africa; [Voelker, C.] Alfred Wegener Inst Polar & Marine Res, D-27570 Bremerhaven, Germany","UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; CEA; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); University of Cape Town; Helmholtz Association; Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar & Marine Research","Tagliabue, A (corresponding author), IPSL CEA CNRS UVSQ Orme Merisiers, Lab Sci Climat & Environm, F-91198 Gif Sur Yvette, France.",atagliab@gmail.com,"Voelker, Christoph/I-7891-2012","Voelker, Christoph/0000-0003-3032-114X; Tagliabue, Alessandro/0000-0002-3572-3634",European Project of Ocean Acidification (EPOCA); Africa Centre for Climate and Earth Systems Science (ACCESS); Surface processes in the anthropocene (SOPRAN) [03F0462C]; GENCI-IDRIS [2009-10040]; CNRS-INSU,European Project of Ocean Acidification (EPOCA); Africa Centre for Climate and Earth Systems Science (ACCESS); Surface processes in the anthropocene (SOPRAN); GENCI-IDRIS; CNRS-INSU(Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)),"The collaboration necessary to initialize this work was formed during two EU COST action (735) workshops in Kiel, Germany, organized by P.

A research alliance developed corresponding separation systems using different types of membranes to allow a more energy efficient separation process: polyactive polymeric membranes for post-combustion, ceramic membranes for oxyfuel and metallic membranes for IGCC separation. By conducting an LCA, the study examines the actual greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental impacts of the new membrane separation technologies, together with concepts implementing the more common technologies. The reference systems represent today's state-of-the-art supercritical coal fired power plant in Germany, together with a more advanced ultra-supercritical plant operating at 700 A degrees C without CO2 capture. The results demonstrate that among the three reference power plants the IGCC is the superior concept due to the highest efficiency. Regarding climate change, the IGCC power plants with CO2 capture are still the best concepts. When other environmental impacts are considered, the capture technologies are inferior. The membrane concepts show the overall better results in comparison to the conventional capture technologies. The environmental impacts for membrane applications add a new range of findings to the field of CCS LCAs. Now the results for several different approaches can be compared directly for the first time.","[Troy, Stefanie; Schreiber, Andrea; Zapp, Petra] Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Energy & Climate Res Syst Anal & Technol Eva, Julich, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Research Center Julich,"Troy, S (corresponding author), Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Energy & Climate Res Syst Anal & Technol Eva, Julich, Germany.",s.troy@fz-juelich.de,,"Troy, Stefanie/0000-0002-6189-6010; Schreiber, Andrea/0000-0001-8939-5747; Zapp, Petra/0000-0002-8964-2450",,,,,47,20,20,6,58,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-954X,1618-9558,,CLEAN TECHNOL ENVIR,Clean Technol.

Here, we combined observations from surface wind stations, reanalysis damsets, and state-of-the-art regional climate models from the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX Africa) to study the current and future wind energy potential in Zambia. We found that winds are dominated by southeasterlies and are rarely strong with an average speed of 2.8 m-s(-1). When we converted the observed surface wind speed to a turbine hub height of 100 m, we found a similar to 38% increase in mean wind speed for the period 1981-2000. Further, both simulated and observed wind speed data show statistically significant increments across much of the country. The only areas that divert from this upward trend of wind speeds are the low land terrains of the Eastern Province bordering Malawi. Examining projections of wind power density (WPD), we found that although wind speed is increasing, it is still generally too weak to support large-scale wind power generation. We found a meagre projected annual average WPD of 46.6 W.m(-2). The highest WPDs of similar to 80 W.m(-2) are projected in the northern and central parts of the country while the lowest are to be expected along the Luangwa valley in agreement with wind speed simulations. On average, Zambia is expected to experience minor WPD increments of 0.004 W. m(-2) per year from 2031 to 2050. We conclude that small-scale wind turbines that accommodate cut-in wind speeds of 3.8 m.s(-1) are the most suitable for power generation in Zambia. Further, given the limitations of small wind turbines, they are best suited for rural and suburban areas of the country where obstructions are few, thus making them ideal for complementing the government of the Republic of Zambia's rural electrification efforts.","[Libanda, Brigadier; Paeth, Heiko] Univ Wurzburg, Inst Geog & Geol, Dept Phys Geog, Wurzburg, Germany",University of Wurzburg,"Libanda, B (corresponding author), Univ Wurzburg, Inst Geog & Geol, Dept Phys Geog, Wurzburg, Germany.",brigadier.libanda@uni-wuerzburg.de,", Libanda/N-9781-2019",", Libanda/0000-0001-8215-5572",Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung,Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung(Alexander von Humboldt Foundation),Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung,,81,0,0,2,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0899-8418,1097-0088,,INT J CLIMATOL,Int.

The experiments are designed to investigate the influence of sea surface temperature (SST) and soil moisture on the air temperatures over land. They involved applying changes to the analysed SST and soil moisture patterns with magnitudes consistent with the differences between forecast analysis and climatology. The results from daily 5-day forecasts over an 11-day period show that a 3 degrees C reduction in SSTs reduces the simulated air temperatures averaged over all land points by just over 1 degrees C. Moistening the soil while using the control SSTs reduces the temperatures by a little less than 1 degrees C on average although this can be larger than 3 degrees C locally. While the reduction in SST impacts the daily maximum and minimum temperatures to a similar extent, the increase in soil moisture had little impact on the daily minimum temperatures.","[Petch, Jon C.; Short, Chris J.; Best, Martin J.; McCarthy, Mark; Lewis, Huw W.; Vosper, Simon B.; Weeks, Mark] Met Off, Reg Model Evaluat & Dev, FitzRoy Rd, Exeter, Devon, England",Met Office - UK,"Petch, JC (corresponding author), Met Off, Reg Model Evaluat & Dev, FitzRoy Rd, Exeter, Devon, England.",jon.petch@metoffice.gov.uk,"Best, Martin/AAF-1051-2019","Best, Martin/0000-0003-4468-876X; Petch, Jon/0000-0003-1476-5103; Short, Christopher/0000-0002-4885-0229",,,,,18,12,12,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1530-261X,,,ATMOS SCI LETT,Atmos.

To deal with this issue, many bias correction techniques have been developed to adjust the modelled variables against observations, focusing mainly on precipitation and temperature. However, most state-of-the-art hydrological models require more forcing variables, in addition to precipitation and temperature, such as radiation, humidity, air pressure, and wind speed. The biases in these additional variables can hinder hydrological simulations, but the effect of the bias of each variable is unexplored. Here we examine the effect of GCM biases on historical runoff simulations for each forcing variable individually, using the JULES land surface model set up at the global scale. Based on the quantified effect, we assess which variables should be included in bias correction procedures. To this end, a partial correction bias assessment experiment is conducted, to test the effect of the biases of six climate variables from a set of three GCMs. The effect of the bias of each climate variable individually is quantified by comparing the changes in simulated runoff that correspond to the bias of each tested variable. A methodology for the classification of the effect of biases in four effect categories (ECs), based on the magnitude and sensitivity of runoff changes, is developed and applied. Our results show that, while globally the largest changes in modelled runoff are caused by precipitation and temperature biases, there are regions where runoff is substantially affected by and/or more sensitive to radiation and humidity. Global maps of bias ECs reveal the regions mostly affected by the bias of each variable. Based on our findings, for global-scale applications, bias correction of radiation and humidity, in addition to that of and temperature, is advised. Finer spatial-scale information is also provided, to suggest bias correction of variables beyond precipitation and temperature for regional studies.","[Papadimitriou, Lamprini V.; Koutroulis, Aristeidis G.; Grillakis, Manolis G.; Tsanis, Ioannis K.] Tech Univ Crete, Sch Environm Engn, Khania, Greece; [Tsanis, Ioannis K.] McMaster Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Hamilton, ON, Canada",Technical University of Crete; McMaster University,"Tsanis, IK (corresponding author), Tech Univ Crete, Sch Environm Engn, Khania, Greece.;Tsanis, IK (corresponding author), McMaster Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Hamilton, ON, Canada.",tsanis@hydromech.gr,"Koutroulis, Aristeidis/O-9601-2016; Grillakis, Manolis/I-3582-2019; Koutroulis, Aristeidis/H-4393-2019","Koutroulis, Aristeidis/0000-0002-2999-7575; Koutroulis, Aristeidis/0000-0002-2999-7575; Papadimitriou, Lamprini/0000-0002-4232-4527; Grillakis, Manolis/0000-0002-4228-1803",European Union [603864],European Union(European Commission),"The research leading to these results has received funding from the HELIX project of the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for research, technological development and demonstration under grant agreement no. 603864.",,60,18,18,0,18,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1027-5606,1607-7938,,HYDROL EARTH SYST SC,Hydrol.

A significant part, such as CO2 emission, comes from internal combustion engine-driven vehicles, incited the automotive sector to focus more on the sustainable electric transportation system. However, electric vehicles face significant charging time, charging methods, and range anxiety challenges. To overcome these challenges, charging technologies for electric vehicle batteries play an essential role. Many types of electric vehicle charging topologies have been discussed in the literature and implemented in many practical applications. This paper presents a state of art criticism of advanced converter topologies and charging methodology for electric vehicle applications. Apart from the conventional topologies, this manuscript has covered the comparative criticism of the recently proposed EV charging technologies regarding charging methods, control strategies, and power levels. Further, this paper discussed the different onboard chargers with their power factor correction topologies, drawbacks, and required corrections.

Variance spectral benchmarks for T and q obtained from the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) are compared to those generated by state-of-the-art numerical weather prediction analyses'' and free-running'' climate model simulations with spatial resolution comparable to AIRS. The T and q spectra from both types of models are generally too steep, with small-scale variance up to several factors smaller than AIRS. However, the two model analyses more closely resemble AIRS than the two free-running model simulations. Scaling exponents obtained for AIRS column water vapor (CWV) and height-resolved layers of q are also compared to the superparameterized Community Atmospheric Model (SP-CAM), highlighting large differences in the magnitude of CWV variance and the relative flatness of height-resolved q scaling in SP-CAM. Height-resolved q spectra obtained from aircraft observations during the Variability of the American Monsoon Systems Ocean-Cloud-Atmosphere-Land Study Regional Experiment (VOCALS-REx) demonstrate changes in scaling exponents that depend on the observations' proximity to the base of the subsidence inversion with scale breaks that occur at approximately the dominant cloud scale (similar to 10-30 km). This suggests that finer spatial resolution requirements must be considered for future satellite observations of T and q than those currently planned for infrared and microwave satellite sounders.","[Kahn, B.

Our ability to accurately simulate drought-induced forest impacts remains highly uncertain(5,6) in part owing to our failure to integrate physiological measurements, regional-scale models, and dynamic global vegetation models(DGVMs). Here we show consistent predictions of widespread mortality of needleleaf evergreen trees (NET) within Southwest USA by 2100 using state-of-the-art models evaluated against empirical data sets. Experimentally, dominant Southwest USA NET species died when they fell below predawn water potential (psi(pd)) thresholds (April-August mean) beyond which photosynthesis, hydraulic and stomatal conductance, and carbohydrate availability approached zero. The evaluated regional models accurately predicted NET psi(pd), and 91% of predictions (10 out of 11) exceeded mortality thresholds within the twenty-first century due to temperature rise. The independent DGVMs predicted >= 50% loss of Northern Hemisphere NET by 2100, consistent with the NET findings for Southwest USA. Notably, the global models underestimated future mortality within Southwest USA, highlighting that predictions of future mortality within global models may be underestimates. Taken together, the validated regional predictions and the global simulations predict widespread conifer loss in coming decades under projected global warming.","[McDowell, N. G.; Williams, A.

While only 4 species are distributed in northern Anatolia where Black Sea climate prevails, 14 species are found throughout southern and western Anatolia where the Mediterranean climate is dominant. However, no cave crickets were reported from the middle and eastern Anatolia where the continental climate is present. There is no data-based study on the distribution pattern of cave cricket species in Anatolia. This study aimed to reveal any possible relation between climatic conditions and distribution of cave crickets in three caves selected as representatives for three climate types present in Anatolia. Temperature and relative humidity in the ecological zones of the given caves and the surface were periodically measured by using data loggers. Our data show within cave variations in temperature and relative humidity among all three caves: (i) variations in temperature and relative humidity decreased from the entrance zone to the dark zone, (ii) over the winter period, temperature increased from the entrance zone to the dark zone, (iii) over the summer period, temperature decreased from the entrance zone to the dark zone, (iv) the most distinct temperature variation was measured in continental climate, and (v) the major similarity of climatic conditions between cave and climate type was observed in the Black Sea region which cave crickets species have widened distribution and limited speciation.","[Taylan, Mehmet Sait] Hakkari Univ, Inst Sci, Dept Biol, Hakkari, Turkey; [Yilmazer, Nadim; Sirin, Deniz] Namik Kemal Univ, Fac Art & Sci, Dept Biol, Tekirdag, Turkey",Hakkari University; Namik Kemal University,"Sirin, D (corresponding author), Namik Kemal Univ, Fac Art & Sci, Dept Biol, Tekirdag, Turkey.",msaittaylan@hakkari.edu.tr; nyilmazer@nku.edu.tr; denizsirin19@gmail.com,"Şirin, Deniz/AAA-1781-2021",,"TUBITAK BIDEB-2218 (Ankara, Turkey) post-doctoral scholarship [1929B011100092]","TUBITAK BIDEB-2218 (Ankara, Turkey) post-doctoral scholarship(Turkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Arastirma Kurumu (TUBITAK))","We thank Anil Alkan and Ceyhun Uludag from The Society of Anatolian Speleology Group-Aspeg, Semih Tan and Nezihi Ekizoglu from Akdeniz University Cave Research Group-Akumak, and Ferdi Ugurlu from Hacettepe University Cave Research Group-Humak for their help in the field studies.

Arctic Ocean average sea surface salinity is projected to decrease by 1.51.1psu, and the liquid freshwater column is projected to increase by 5.43.8m by the end of the 21st century under the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5) scenario. Most freshening would occur in the Arctic Ocean basins, that is, the Canada, Makarov, and Amundsen basins. Anomalies in freshwater flux from sea ice melt, Bering Strait inflow, net precipitation (P-E), river runoff, and freshwater through the Barents Sea Opening (BSO) would contribute to Arctic Ocean freshening. CMIP5 historical and RCP8.5 experiments showed that the respective projected contributions from BSO freshwater flux, river runoff, P-E, and Bering Strait inflow are about 6.4, 5.0, 2.7, and 2.2 times the contribution from sea ice melt averaged throughout the 21st century. Contributions from sea ice melt and Bering Strait inflow would increase and then decrease gradually, while those from BSO freshwater flux, river runoff, and P-E would increase continuously. The CMIP5 models are able to simulate the Arctic Ocean freshwater system more accurately than CMIP3 models. However, the simulated rate of increase of freshwater content (296232km(3)/yr) is weaker than estimated (600300km(3)/yr) based on observations (1992-2012). Moreover, the simulated BSO and Davis Strait freshwater fluxes still exhibit substantial intermodel spread and they differ considerably from observed values. Plain Language Summary The Arctic region has been experiencing rapid climate change over the past decades. Changes in the Arctic Ocean freshwater system have been observed. Climate models have been used to project the future trends of the Arctic Ocean freshwater system. Previous predictions are mostly based on a single climate model or previous generation climate models. This study investigated this topic using multimodel mean results from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5. Our results show the upper Arctic Ocean likely to freshen considerably during the 21st century. Freshwater flux from sea ice melt, Bering Strait inflow, net precipitation, river runoff, and freshwater through the Barents Sea Opening would contribute to Arctic freshening. Contributions from sea ice melt and Bering Strait inflow would increase and then decrease gradually, while those from BSO freshwater flux, river runoff, and P-E would increase continuously during the 21st century.","[Shu, Qi; Qiao, Fangli; Song, Zhenya; Li, Xinfang] Minist Nat Resources, Inst Oceanog 1, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Shu, Qi; Qiao, Fangli; Song, Zhenya] Qingdao Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol, Lab Reg Oceanog & Numer Modeling, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Shu, Qi; Qiao, Fangli; Song, Zhenya] Minist Nat Resources, Key Lab Marine Sci & Numer Modeling, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Jiechen] Natl Marine Environm Forecasting Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China",Ministry of Natural Resources of the People's Republic of China; Qingdao National Laboratory for Marine Science & Technology; Ministry of Natural Resources of the People's Republic of China; National Marine Environmental Forecasting Center,"Qiao, FL (corresponding author), Minist Nat Resources, Inst Oceanog 1, Qingdao, Peoples R China.;Qiao, FL (corresponding author), Qingdao Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol, Lab Reg Oceanog & Numer Modeling, Qingdao, Peoples R China.;Qiao, FL (corresponding author), Minist Nat Resources, Key Lab Marine Sci & Numer Modeling, Qingdao, Peoples R China.",qiaofl@fio.org.cn,"Song, Zhenya/F-9819-2013","Song, Zhenya/0000-0002-8098-5529; SHU, Qi/0000-0003-4781-571X","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFC1401407, 2017YFA0603102, 2018YFC1407205]; NSFCShandong Joint Fund for Marine Science Research Centers [U1406404]; Basic Scientific Fund for National Public Research Institute of China [2016Q03]; AoShan Talents Cultivation Excellent Scholar Program - Qingdao National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology [2017ASTCP-ES04]",National Key Research and Development Program of China; NSFCShandong Joint Fund for Marine Science Research Centers; Basic Scientific Fund for National Public Research Institute of China; AoShan Talents Cultivation Excellent Scholar Program - Qingdao National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology,"This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (grants 2016YFC1401407; 2017YFA0603102, and 2018YFC1407205) and NSFCShandong Joint Fund for Marine Science Research Centers (grant U1406404).

Archeological evidence suggests that the Liangzhu ancient city was abandoned, and the culture collapsed at similar to 4300 years ago. Here, we present speleothem records from southeastern China in conjunction with other paleoclimatic and archeological data to show that the Liangzhu culture collapsed within a short and anomalously wet period between 4345 +/- 32 and 4324 +/- 30 years ago, supporting the hypothesis that the city was abandoned after large-scale flooding and inundation. We further show that the demise of Neolithic cultures in the YRD occurred within an extended period of aridity that started at similar to 4000 +/- 45 years ago. We suggest that the major hydroclimatic changes between 4300 and 3000 years ago may have resulted from an increasing frequency of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation in the context of weakened Northern Hemisphere summer insolation.","[Zhang, Haiwei; Cheng, Hai; Cai, Yanjun; Kathayat, Gayatri; Li, Hanying; Tian, Ye; Li, Youwei; Zhao, Jingyao; Sha, Lijuan; Lu, Jiayu; Meng, Binglin; Niu, Xiaowen; Dong, Xiyu; Liang, Zeyuan; Zong, Baoyun; Ning, Youfeng] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Inst Global Environm Change, Xian 710054, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Haiwei; Cheng, Hai; Cai, Yanjun; Lan, Jianghu] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Earth Environm, State Key Lab Loess & Quaternary Geol, Xian 710061, Peoples R China; [Cheng, Hai] Chinese Acad Geol Sci, Inst Karst Geol, Key Lab Karst Dynam, Minist Land & Resources, Guilin 541004, Peoples R China; [Sinha, Ashish] Calif State Univ Dominguez Hills, Dept Earth Sci, Carson, CA 90747 USA; [Spoetl, Christoph] Univ Innsbruck, Inst Geol, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; [Liu, Bin] Zhejiang Univ, Sch Art & Archaeol, Hangzhou 310028, Peoples R China; [Edwards, R.

The impact of these storms is of paramount concern to California, where aging water supply and flood protection infrastructures are challenged by increased standards for urban flood protection, an unusually variable weather regime, and projections of climate change. Additionally, there are inherent conflicts between releasing water to provide flood protection and storing water to meet requirements for the water supply, water quality, hydropower generation, water temperature and flow for at-risk species, and recreation. To improve reservoir management and meet the increasing demands on water, improved forecasts of precipitation, especially during extreme events, are required. Here, the authors describe how California is addressing their most important and costliest environmental issue-water management-in part, by installing a state-of-the-art observing system to better track the area's most severe wintertime storms.","[White, A.

It is extremely challenging to formulate resilience thinking into practice. The current state-of-art approaches of assessing ecosystem resilience may be useful for policy makers and ecosystem resource managers to minimize climatological or natural disaster related impacts. Here, we review the methods of assessing resilience and classify and limit them to three cases: (a) forest resilience based mainly on remote sensing and tree-ring data; (b) soil microbial community resilience based on laboratory and field studies; and (c) hydrological resilience of terrestrial biomes based on the Budyko framework and climate data.","[Yi, Chuixiang; Jackson, Nathan] CUNY Queens Coll, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Flushing, NY 11367 USA; [Yi, Chuixiang] CUNY, Grad Ctr, Earth & Environm Sci Dept, New York, NY 10016 USA",City University of New York (CUNY) System; Queens College NY (CUNY); City University of New York (CUNY) System,"Yi, CX (corresponding author), CUNY Queens Coll, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Flushing, NY 11367 USA.;Yi, CX (corresponding author), CUNY, Grad Ctr, Earth & Environm Sci Dept, New York, NY 10016 USA.",cyi@qc.cuny.edu,,,,,,,194,19,19,39,135,IOP Publishing Ltd,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1748-9326,,,ENVIRON RES LETT,Environ.

The reliability of these reconstructions is however dependent on the recovery of the biological signal and the removal of competing sources of carbon and oxygen isotopes, such as remaining organic material and secondary carbonates. Modern, archaeological and fossil bone and tooth specimens have been treated with different chemicals commonly used to pre-treat the samples with the aim of removing these competing sources of isotopes. Results highlight significant shifts in the isotope values of the samples tested, with different isotopic effects according to which pre-treatment was used. This has a clear impact on the data recovered, which may lead to misinterpretations of the results and inferred past diets and climates. The results of this study suggest that both hydrogen peroxide and sodium hypochlorite, the most commonly used oxidising agents employed to remove organic substance, have major problems: hydrogen peroxide is only partially efficient as organic removal agent and causes unwanted bioapatite dissolutions and isotopic shift, while sodium hypochlorite induces the incorporation of exogenous carbonates into the bioapatite, likely from the dissolution of atmospheric CO2 into the test tube. In both cases, there is an impact on the recovered isotope composition. Hydrazine hydrate, a third chemical for organic removal, has the lowest influence on the bioapatite isotopic composition, being also efficient at removing organic matter from bioapatites. The latter is recommended as an organic removal agent if such pre-treatment is deemed necessary. The use of acetic acid also causes isotopic shifts that seem independent on the removal of secondary/diagenetic carbonate, as also occurring in modern samples. Overall, our study clearly shows that any chemical treatment commonly used to remove unwanted contaminants from the bioapatite samples has also unpredictable, often significant effects on the pristine isotopic composition recovered, and corroborates the need for consistency in the pre-treatment of bone and teeth specimens. It also questions the necessity of removing organic matter at all from most skeletal samples prior to isotopic analysis. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

It has been rewritten specially for this themed issue of RiDE in light of my research following publication of Theatre Ecology: Environments and Performance Events in 2007. Mainly in the format of a thought experiment, it argues that the current ecological crisis of global warming could be a systemic 'insanity' of planet Earth produced by a human compulsion to perform. It aims to demonstrate that finding cures for this affliction requires a radical revision of how Homo sapiens values human rights via complementary biotic rights inclusive of other organic species. As these rights are an aspect of ongoing global performance ecologies understood as integral to eco-systemic evolution, it becomes necessary for humans to invent refreshed ways of assessing how futures variously emerge through the natures of present and past. The article's thought experimental methods are adopted, in part, so that a few jocular analytical tropes can be treated as entirely serious. Hence it proposes that the concept 'retro-modernisation' should be recycled immediately and that one of the shortest of verbal paradoxes is adopted as a motto by all eco-warriors of the dramatic, theatrical and performing arts - but it is certainly not 'Be spontaneous!'","Univ Warwick, Sch Theatre Performance & Cultural Policy Studies, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",University of Warwick,"Kershaw, B (corresponding author), Univ Warwick, Sch Theatre Performance & Cultural Policy Studies, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",baz.kershaw@warwick.ac.uk,,,,,,,40,3,3,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-9783,1470-112X,,RIDE-J APPL THEATRE,RIDE-J.

Interactions between these different wave types, however, complicate the quantification of their individual contribution to the overall dynamical state of the middle atmosphere. In state-of-the-art general circulation models (GCMs), the majority of the GW spectrum cannot be resolved and therefore has to be parameterised. This is commonly implemented in two discrete schemes, one for GWs that originate from flow over orographic obstacles and one for all other kinds of GWs (non-orographic GWs). In this study, we attempt to gain a deeper understanding of the interactions of resolved with parameterised wave driving and of their influence on the stratospheric zonal winds and on the Brewer-Dobson circulation (BDC). For this, we set up a GCM time slice experiment with two sensitivity simulations: one without orographic GWs and one without non-orographic GWs. Our findings include an acceleration of the polar vortices, which has historically been one of the main reasons for including explicit GW parameterisations in GCMs. Further, we find inter-hemispheric differences in BDC changes when omitting GWs that can be explained by wave compensation and amplification effects. These are partly evoked through local changes in the refractive properties of the atmosphere caused by the omitted GW drag and a thereby increased planetary wave propagation. However, non-local effects on the flow can act to suppress vertical wave fluxes into the stratosphere for a very strong polar vortex. Moreover, we study mean age of stratospheric air to investigate the impact of missing GWs on tracer transport. On the basis of this analysis, we suggest that the larger ratio of planetary waves to GWs leads to enhanced horizontal mixing, which can have a large impact on stratospheric tracer distributions.","[Eichinger, Roland; Garny, Hella] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Meteorol Inst, Munich, Germany; [Eichinger, Roland; Garny, Hella; Danker, Jessica; Dietmueller, Simone] Deutsch Zentrum Luft & Raumfahrt DLR, Inst Phys Atmosphere, Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany; [Sacha, Petr] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci BOKU, Inst Meteorol & Climatol, Vienna, Austria; [Sacha, Petr] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Math & Phys, Dept Atmospher Phys, Prague, Czech Republic; [Oberlaender-Hayn, Sophie] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Meteorol, Berlin, Germany; [Danker, Jessica] Goethe Univ, Inst Atmospher & Environm Sci, Frankfurt, Germany","University of Munich; Helmholtz Association; German Aerospace Centre (DLR); University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna; Charles University Prague; Free University of Berlin; Goethe University Frankfurt","Eichinger, R (corresponding author), Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Meteorol Inst, Munich, Germany.;Eichinger, R (corresponding author), Deutsch Zentrum Luft & Raumfahrt DLR, Inst Phys Atmosphere, Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany.",roland.eichinger@dlr.de,"Eichinger, Roland/ABH-1018-2020; Šácha, Petr/Q-4447-2017","Eichinger, Roland/0000-0001-6872-5700; Šácha, Petr/0000-0001-9707-1750; Danker, Jessica/0000-0002-1274-7254",Helmholtz Association [VH-NG1014],Helmholtz Association(Helmholtz Association),Funded by the Helmholtz Association under grant VH-NG1014 (Helmholtz-Hochschul-Nachwuchsforschergruppe MACClim).,,88,9,9,1,3,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0930-7575,1432-0894,,CLIM DYNAM,Clim.

Recent articles have shown that environmentally sustainable consumer behaviors driven by lifestyle changes can significantly contribute to climate-change mitigation and sustainable development goals. However, lifestyle changes are not adequately captured by scenarios developed with integrated assessment and energy-system models (IAMs/ESMs), which provide limited policy insights. This article conducts a systematic review of the IAM and ESM literature to identify the most important lifestyle changes in current mitigation pathways for the residential and transport sectors, review the employed state-of-the-art modeling approaches and scenario assumptions, and propose improvements to existing methodological frameworks. The review finds that mode shifts towards public transport and active transport modes, shared mobility, and eco-driving have the greatest impact in the transport sector, while actions that reduce space and water-heating requirements and the circular economy are the most effective practices in households. Common modeling approaches lack sophistication as they omit (1) the dynamics and costs of demand-side transitions, (2) the heterogenous responses of different consumer groups, and (3) the structural effects of lifestyles on the macro-economy. New approaches employing innovative methodologies combined with big data collected from users offer new avenues to overcome these challenges and improve the modeling of lifestyle changes in large-scale models.","[Andreou, Andreas; Fragkos, Panagiotis; Fotiou, Theofano; Filippidou, Faidra] E3 Modelling, 70-72 Panormou St,POB 11523, Athens 11523, Greece",,"Fragkos, P (corresponding author), E3 Modelling, 70-72 Panormou St,POB 11523, Athens 11523, Greece.",andreou@e3modelling.com; fragkos@e3modelling.com; fotiou@e3modelling.com; filippidou@e3modelling.com,,"Andreou, Andreas/0000-0003-0892-6759; Fragkos, Panagiotis/0000-0003-3596-0661","European Commission [101003815, 891943]",European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre),"The authors would like to thank the European Commission for funding the research behind this publication through the CAMPAIGNERs project (Horizon 2020 Programme, grant agreement no. 101003815) and the WHY project (Horizon 2020 Programme, grant agreement no. 891943).",,104,0,0,9,9,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1996-1073,,ENERGIES,Energies,JUL,2022,14,,,,,,4948,10.3390/en15144948,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en15144948,,,24,Energy & Fuels,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Energy & Fuels,3G9AT,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000831639300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

We show that aerosol-induced multidecadal variations of downward solar radiative fluxes over the North Atlantic cause NASST variability during the 20th century, altering the ITCZ position and dynamically linking aerosol effects to Sahel rainfall variability. This process chain is caused by aerosol-induced changes in radiative surface fluxes rather than changes in ocean circulations.

GPP is an important indicator of ecosystem health in various ecologies and to assess climate change. The objective of the present work is to propose a machine learning based GPP estimation model using remote sensing (RS) data in combination with meteorological data (MET) and topographical data (TOPO) for prediction of GPP, which can be upscaled in temporal and spatial resolution. Random Forest Regression (RFR) is proposed for this using the Fluxnet2015 GPP dataset for the Australian region. This model has attained a very high accuracy with an R2 value of 0.82, as estimated by 10-fold cross-validation. The model has been compared with state-of-the-art machine learning models and found to be performing better than others. Different feature sets like METfeatures and TOPO-features were evaluated in combination with RS-features. The results exhibited that the RFR model performed better when MET and TOPO features are combined with RS-features. GPP prediction for the year 2014, in 8 days temporal and 500m spatial resolution for the Australian region for different plant function types is demonstrated using the proposed model and produced very high value of R2 (0.84), when compared to ground truth. Thus, the proposed approach of the RFR model for GPP estimation showed significant improvement in regional carbon cycle studies and can also be employed for simulating GPP for the future under different climate scenarios.","[Sarkar, Deep Prakash; Shankar, B.

Despite recent progress in addressing uncertainties related to the physics of sea-level rise, very little effort is made towards understanding and reducing the uncertainties related to wave-driven shoreline response. To fill this gap, the uncertainties associated with the long-term modelling of shoreline change are analysed at a high-energy cross-shore transport dominated site. Using the state-of-the-art LX-Shore shoreline change model, we produce a probabilistic shoreline reconstruction, based on 3000 simulations over the past 20 years at Truc Vert beach, southwest France, whereby sea-level rise rate, depth of closure and three model free parameters are considered uncertain variables. We further address the relative impact of each source of uncertainty on the model results performing a Global Sensitivity Analysis. This analysis shows that the shoreline changes are mainly sensitive to the three parameters of the wave-driven model, but also that the sensitivity to each of these parameters is strongly modulated seasonally and interannually, in relation with wave energy variability, and depends on the time scale of interest. These results have strong implications on the model skill sensitivity to the calibration period as well as for the predictive skill of the model in a context of future climate change affecting wave climate and extremes.

The consequences of this urban warming (i.e., urban heat island) may compromise citizens' quality of life in urban areas, indoor and outdoor comfort perception, and building energy performance in summer conditions. In this panorama, this review presents recent contributions demonstrating the effectiveness and urgent need of existing mitigation strategies. The same strategies are also comparatively assessed by means of a sensitivity analysis demonstrating their effect with varying climate conditions and urban context. Results of existing studies, validated by the present assessment, aimed at quantitatively investigating the effect of mitigation strategies for reducing building cooling needs and enhancing urban well-being, thanks to international scientific effort carried out in the last decades. To this aim, the logical flow of the review deals with the main technologies for urban warming mitigation are described, together with the main findings of numerical and experimental research initiatives, demonstrating the field effect of improving pedestrians comfort and urban well-being all around the world. Then, the mitigation potential of key green, water and cool strategies is critically reviewed, and further scientific and implementation needs are discussed. All the reviewed contributions demonstrate an undeniable technology readiness level for their practical implementation and highlight the true necessity of a shared and synergistic policy effort worldwide.","[Pisello, Anna Laura] Univ Perugia, CIRIAF Interunivers Res Ctr, Perugia, Italy; [Pisello, Anna Laura] Univ Perugia, Dept Engn, Perugia, Italy; [Saliari, Maria] Univ Athens, Dept Phys, Grp Bldg Environm Studies, Athens, Greece; [Vasilakopoulou, Konstantina] Tech Univ Crete, Dept Environm Engn, Khania, Greece; [Hadad, Shamila; Santamouris, Mattheos] Univ New South Wales, Sch Built Environm, Anita Lawrence Chair High Performance Architectur, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of Perugia; University of Perugia; National & Kapodistrian University of Athens; Technical University of Crete; University of New South Wales Sydney,"Pisello, AL (corresponding author), Univ Perugia, CIRIAF Interunivers Res Ctr, Perugia, Italy.",anna.pisello@unipg.it,"Mat, Santamouris/AAP-2836-2021","Santamouris, Matthaios/0000-0001-6076-3526; Haddad, Shamila/0000-0003-3569-5765",Horizon 2020 [678407],Horizon 2020,"Horizon 2020, Grant/Award number: 678407",,133,14,14,8,70,"WILEY PERIODICALS, INC",SAN FRANCISCO,"ONE MONTGOMERY ST, SUITE 1200, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94104 USA",2041-8396,2041-840X,,WIRES ENERGY ENVIRON,Wiley Interdiscip.

Fire globally reduces the tree covered area and vegetation carbon storage by 10%. Regionally, the effects are much stronger, up to 20% for certain latitudinal bands, and 17% in savanna regions. Global fire effects on total carbon storage and carbon turnover times are lower with the effect on gross primary productivity (GPP) close to 0. We find the strongest impacts of fire in savanna regions. Climatic conditions in regions with the highest burned area differ from regions with highest absolute fire impact, which are characterized by higher precipitation. Our estimates of fire-induced vegetation change are lower than previous studies. We attribute these differences to different definitions of vegetation change and effects of anthropogenic land use, which were not considered in previous studies and decreases the impact of fire on tree cover. Accounting for fires significantly improves the spatial patterns of simulated tree cover, which demonstrates the need to represent fire in dynamic vegetation models. Based upon comparisons between models and observations, process understanding and representation in models, we assess a higher confidence in the fire impact on tree cover and vegetation carbon compared to GPP, total carbon storage and turnover times. We have higher confidence in the spatial patterns compared to the global totals of the simulated fire impact. As we used an ensemble of state-of-the-art fire models, including effects of land use and the ensemble median or mean compares better to observational datasets than any individual model, we consider the here presented results to be the current best estimate of global fire effects on ecosystems.","[Lasslop, Gitta; Forrest, Matthew; Scheiter, Simon; Hickler, Thomas] Senckenberg Biodivers & Climate Res Ctr, Senckenberganlage 25, Frankfurt, Germany; [Hantson, Stijn] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Irvine, CA USA; [Harrison, Sandy P.] Univ Reading, Sch Archaeol Geog & Environm Sci SAGES, Reading, Berks, England; [Bachelet, Dominique] Oregon State Univ, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Burton, Chantelle] Met Off Hadley Ctr, Exeter, Devon, England; [Forkel, Matthias] Tech Univ Dresden, Inst Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing, Environm Remote Sensing Grp, Dresden, Germany; [Li, Fang] Chinese Acad Sci, Int Ctr Climate & Environm Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Melton, Joe R.] Environm Canada, Climate Res Div, Victoria, BC, Canada; [Yue, Chao] Northwest A&F Univ, State Key Lab Soil Eros & Dryland Farming Loess P, Yangling, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Archibald, Sally] Univ Witwatersrand, Ctr African Ecol, Sch Anim Plant & Environm Sci, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Arneth, Almut] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Atmospher Environm Res, Garmisch Partenkirchen, Germany; [Hickler, Thomas] Goethe Univ, Dept Phys Geog, Frankfurt, Germany; [Sitch, Stephen] Univ Exeter, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Exeter, Devon, England","Senckenberg Biodiversitat & Klima- Forschungszentrum (BiK-F); Senckenberg Gesellschaft fur Naturforschung (SGN); University of California System; University of California Irvine; University of Reading; Oregon State University; Met Office - UK; Hadley Centre; Technische Universitat Dresden; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Northwest A&F University - China; University of Witwatersrand; Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; Goethe University Frankfurt; University of Exeter","Lasslop, G (corresponding author), Senckenberg Biodivers & Climate Res Ctr, Senckenberganlage 25, Frankfurt, Germany.",gitta.lasslop@senckenberg.de,"Arneth, Almut/B-2702-2013; Sitch, Stephen A/F-8034-2015; Forkel, Matthias/O-5592-2019; Hickler, Thomas/S-6287-2016; Hantson, Stijn/H-4785-2019; Melton, Joe R./H-6803-2019; Burton, Chantelle/G-4717-2018","Arneth, Almut/0000-0001-6616-0822; Sitch, Stephen A/0000-0003-1821-8561; Forkel, Matthias/0000-0003-0363-9697; Hickler, Thomas/0000-0002-4668-7552; Hantson, Stijn/0000-0003-4607-9204; Melton, Joe R./0000-0002-9414-064X; Burton, Chantelle/0000-0003-0201-5727","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41475099, 41875137]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [338130981, SCHE 1719/21]; Newton Fund; Helmholtz Association; H2020 European Research Council [694481]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Newton Fund; Helmholtz Association(Helmholtz Association); H2020 European Research Council,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 41475099 and 41875137; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, Grant/Award Number: 338130981 and SCHE 1719/21; Newton Fund; Helmholtz Association; H2020 European Research Council, Grant/Award Number: 694481",,71,25,27,11,42,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

In the present study, we investigated the changes in ENSO-driven HC using the historical and RCP8.5 (SSP585 in CMIP6) runs from 34 models in CMIP5 and 24 models in CMIP6, and separated the roles of the changes in the ENSO SST and background SST using three atmospheric model experiments (amip, amip-p4K, and amip-future4K) in 8 CMIP5 and 7 CMIP6 models. The results showed that although the zonal-mean ENSO-driven HC strengthens slightly, the ENSO-driven HC is significantly intensified in a warmer climate from a regional perspective, especially over the eastern Pacific. The intensified ENSO-driven HC over the eastern Pacific dominates the zonal-mean changes after the counteraction of the changes in different longitudes. When the state-of-the-art CMIP5 and CMIP6 models project a robust El Nin similar to o-like warming pattern for the background SST changes in the eastern Pacific, the background SST changes enhance the changes in ENSO-driven HC over the eastern Pacific. In contrast, the changes of ENSO SST show large intermodel spread, resultantly playing a weak role in ENSO-driven HC in the multi-model ensemble, although an intensified ENSO SST can strengthen ENSO-driven HC over the eastern Pacific and vice versa. The contributions of the ENSO SST are stronger than that of the background SST, and dominate the zonal-mean changes in ENSO-driven HC.","[Xie, Xinru; Huang, Ping; Zhou, Shijie; Zhang, Jiayu] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Ctr Monsoon Syst Res, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Huang, Ping] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, State key Lab Numer Modeling Atmospher Sci & Geoph, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Xie, Xinru; Zhang, Jiayu] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Huang, P (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Ctr Monsoon Syst Res, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China.",huangping@mail.iap.ac.cn,,,"National Key R&D Program of China [2019YFA0606703]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41975116]; Key Deployment Project of the Centre for Ocean Mega-Research of Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences [COMS2019Q03]; Youth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [Y202025]; China Post-doctoral Science Foundation [BX20200329]","National Key R&D Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Key Deployment Project of the Centre for Ocean Mega-Research of Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences; Youth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciences; China Post-doctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation)","Acknowledgements This work was supported by the National Key R & D Program of China (Grant 2019YFA0606703) , the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grants 41975116) , the Key Deployment Project of the Centre for Ocean Mega-Research of Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences (COMS2019Q03) , the Youth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Y202025) , and the Special Research As-sistant Project of Chinese Academy of Sciences and the China Post-doctoral Science Foundation (BX20200329) .

Helminth vaccines should sufficiently reduce parasite transmission to protect vaccinated animals against parasite-induced disorders and production loss. Vaccine efficacy requirements depend on the parasite's epidemiology and farm management, both of which vary in different geographic regions and are influenced by climate. Vaccination is likely to be part of integrated worm control, together with other worm control measures.","[Claerebout, Edwin; Geldhof, Peter] Univ Ghent, Fac Vet Med, Lab Parasitol, Salisburylaan 133, B-9820 Merelbeke, Belgium",Ghent University,"Claerebout, E (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Fac Vet Med, Lab Parasitol, Salisburylaan 133, B-9820 Merelbeke, Belgium.",edwin.claerebout@ugent.be,,"Claerebout, Edwin/0000-0002-8292-2791",European Union [635408EU]; COST Action COMBAR - COST (European Cooperation in Science and Technology) [CA16230],European Union(European Commission); COST Action COMBAR - COST (European Cooperation in Science and Technology),"This article is based on work funded by the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme under grant agreement no. 635408EU (PARAGONE) and COST Action COMBAR CA16230, supported by COST (European Cooperation in Science and Technology).",,47,25,26,3,15,W B SAUNDERS CO-ELSEVIER INC,PHILADELPHIA,"1600 JOHN F KENNEDY BOULEVARD, STE 1800, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103-2899 USA",0749-0720,1558-4240,,VET CLIN N AM-FOOD A,Vet.

Previous studies mostly focus on the trends of drought in recent decades or long-time scales. Using two observational datasets, we reveal a remarkable weakening of the seasonal precipitation cycle over this region from 1979 to 2015, with precipitation significantly increased in the boreal winter dry season (similar to 0.13 mm/day/decade) and decreased in the boreal spring wet season (similar to 0.21 mm/day/decade), which account for similar to 14% (the precipitation changes from 1979 to 2015) of their respective climatological means. We further use a state-of-the-art atmospheric model to isolate the impact of sea surface temperature change from different ocean basins on the precipitation changes in the dry and wet seasons. Results show that the strengthening precipitation in the dry season is mainly driven by the Atlantic warming, whereas the weakening precipitation in the wet season can be primarily attributed to the Indian Ocean. Warming Atlantic intensifies the zonal circulation over the African rainforest, strengthening moisture convergence and intensifying precipitation in the boreal winter dry season. Warming Indian Ocean contributes more to reducing the zonal circulation and suppressing the convection in the boreal spring wet season, leading to an opposite effect on precipitation. This result has important implication on local ecology as well as global climate system.","[Wang, Xin-Yue; Zhu, Jiang; Xin, Meijiao; Song, Chentao; Li, Yadi; Zhou, Yi; Li, Xichen] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xin-Yue; Zhu, Jiang; Xin, Meijiao; Song, Chentao; Li, Yadi; Zhou, Yi] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Li, Xichen] Minist Nat Resources, Inst Oceanog 2, State Key Lab Satellite Ocean Environm Dynam, Hangzhou, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Ministry of Natural Resources of the People's Republic of China","Li, XC (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Li, XC (corresponding author), Minist Nat Resources, Inst Oceanog 2, State Key Lab Satellite Ocean Environm Dynam, Hangzhou, Peoples R China.",lixichen@mail.iap.ac.cn,,"Li, Xichen/0000-0001-6325-6626","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFA0601802]; Key Research Program of Frontier Sciences, CAS [ZDBS-LY-DQC010]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41676190, 41976193]","National Key Research and Development Program of China; Key Research Program of Frontier Sciences, CAS; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","This work was funded by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant No. 2016YFA0601802), the Key Research Program of Frontier Sciences, CAS (Grant No. ZDBS-LY-DQC010) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41676190 and No. 41976193).",,59,0,0,2,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",2196-4092,,,GEOSCI LETT,Geosci.

This is even more crucial aspect for glass buildings, which have been criticised as major factors in climate change around the world. Recent debates on glass facades, which culminated in plans for a glass building ban in New York City highlighted the importance of innovation in glass construction. The current solutions for mitigating energy consumption for glass facades are improving insulation (U value) and solar heat gain coefficient (SHGC) with advanced glazing or using shading devices. A fourth approach is the recent technology of water-filled glass (WFG), which utilizes water layer to improve thermal comfort and energy performance of the facade. This paper introduces Smart Water-filled Glass (SWFG) control method, which enables the change of the opacity of the facade element by colouring the fluid over a year regarding seasonal changes. The impact of changing transparency of water layer on cooling and heating energy demand is evaluated by simulating and analysing the energy performance of a reference office room with large glazing facade in different climates. The significance of this energy evaluation is that a water-filled glass with switchable transparency is simulated and assessed here for the first time. The paper analyses the performance in seven cities from all relevant major climatic regions using LBNL WINDOW and TRNSYS (v.18) As a novel approach, the simulation study makes it possible to evaluate the overall performance of two proposed operational methods (insolation-based & storage-based) for adjusting water layer settings depending on climate conditions and reusability of the captured heat in water layer. Moreover, seven different base cases are presented in this study to compare the performance of proposed system, including conventional solutions (e.g. double or triple glazing with/without shading) and a state-of-the-art switchable technology (e.g. electrochromic glazing or EC). The results verify the hypothesis that the impact of SWFG compared to WFG varies depending on the climate with 0%-5.28% for hot climates and 0.25-3.39% for climates with heating demand. The discussion includes comparison with standard glass facades, where SWFG shows 47.41%-78.01% energy savings depending on climate. The climate-based approach of SWFG and WFG offers a significant shift in facade design that sees glass buildings as an opportunity for sustainability rather than liability for climate change.

In a process-based comparison of two aerosol and chemistry schemes within the regional atmospheric modeling framework COSMO-ART (Consortium for Small-Scale Modelling, Aersosol and Reactive Trace gases extension), we identify key sensitivities of aerosol parameterizations. We consider the aerosol module MADE (Modal Aerosol Dynamics model for Europe) in combination with full gasphase chemistry and the aerosol module M7 in combination with a constant-oxidant-field-based sulfur cycle. For a Saharan dust outbreak reaching Europe, modeled aerosol populations are more sensitive to structural differences between the schemes, in particular the consideration of aqueousphase sulfate production, the selection of aerosol species and modes, and modal composition, than to parametric choices like modal standard deviation and the parameterization of aerosol dynamics. The same observation applies to aerosol optical depth (AOD) and the concentrations of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). Differences in the concentrations of ice-nucleating particles (INPs) are masked by uncertainties between two ice-nucleation parameterizations and their coupling to the aerosol scheme. Differences in cloud droplet and ice crystal number concentrations are buffered by cloud microphysics as we show in a susceptibility analysis.","[Glassmeier, Franziska; Possner, Anna; Lohmann, Ulrike] ETH, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, Zurich, Switzerland; [Vogel, Bernhard; Vogel, Heike] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Klimaforsch, Karlsruhe, Germany; [Glassmeier, Franziska] CNR, Washington, DC USA; [Glassmeier, Franziska] NOAA, Chem Sci Div, Earth Syst Res Lab, Boulder, CO USA; [Possner, Anna] Carnegie Inst Sci, Dept Global Ecol, Stanford, CA USA",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Carnegie Institution for Science,"Glassmeier, F (corresponding author), ETH, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, Zurich, Switzerland.;Glassmeier, F (corresponding author), CNR, Washington, DC USA.",franziska.glassmeier@noaa.gov,"Lohmann, Ulrike/B-6153-2009; Possner, Anna/GOE-6996-2022; Possner, Anna/I-2779-2018; Vogel, Bernhard/A-9558-2013; Glassmeier, Franziska/B-3207-2018","Lohmann, Ulrike/0000-0001-8885-3785; Possner, Anna/0000-0001-6996-8624; Vogel, Bernhard/0000-0002-8894-0165; Glassmeier, Franziska/0000-0002-1132-7821",ETH-domain CCES project OPTIWARES [41-02],ETH-domain CCES project OPTIWARES,"We thank Grazia Frontoso for isolating an M7 box model from ECHAM-HAM, Romy Ullrich for sharing the implementation of her ice-nucleation parameterization, and Ulrich Blahak and Axel Seifert for providing their cloud microphysics scheme.

This system increases demands on energy consumption and increases CO2 emission. A passive design approach is one of the measures to reduce these problems. This study involved an analytical examination of building forms, followed by testing the impact of these forms on its thermal performance and indoor thermal comfort. The tests were conducted using energy simulations software packages. Passive parameters such as shading devices, thermal insulation and natural ventilation were applied in six cases, including the baseline case within each form. The obtained results showed a significant effect of mosque forms as well as passive design techniques on the thermal comfort within the structures. The findings confirmed that the use of passive design alone would not help achieve thermal comfort, but reduce the annual energy consumption by10%. By integrating a hybrid air-conditioning system as another supporting approach, the annual energy consumption could be reduced by 67.5%, which allows for the designing of a much smaller HVAC system.","[Mushtaha, Emad] Univ Sharjah, Coll Engn, Dept Architectural Engn, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates; [Helmy, Omar] European Grad Sch, Dept Philosophy Art & Crit Thought, Saas Fee, Switzerland",University of Sharjah,"Mushtaha, E (corresponding author), Univ Sharjah, Coll Engn, Dept Architectural Engn, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates.",emushtaha@sharjah.ac.ae,"Mushtaha, Emad/AFF-2680-2022",,Research and Graduate Studies at the University of Sharjah in UAE [140451],Research and Graduate Studies at the University of Sharjah in UAE,This research is part of project [grant number 140451] funded by Research and Graduate Studies at the University of Sharjah in UAE.

Single-layer covers utilize the moisture store-and-release concept to first store and then release moisture back to the atmosphere via evapotranspiration. Although more commonly used in semi-arid and arid climates, store-and-release covers remain an attractive option in humid climates due to the low cost and relative simplicity of installation. However, knowledge of their performance in these climates is limited. The objective of this study was to assess the performance of moisture store-and-release covers at full-scale WRPs located in humid climates. This cover type was installed at a WRP in Nova Scotia, Canada, alongside state-of-the-art monitoring instrumentation. Field monitoring was conducted over 5 years to assess key components such as meteorological conditions, cover material water dynamics, net percolation, surface runoff, pore-gas, environmental receptor water quality, landform stability and vegetation. Water balances indicate small reductions in water influx to the waste rock (i.e., 34 to 28% of precipitation) with the diminished AMD release also apparent by small improvements in groundwater quality (increase in pH, decrease in sulfate/metals). Surface water quality analysis and field observations of vegetative/aquatic life demonstrate significant improvements in the surface water receptor. The WRP landform is stable and the vegetative cover is thriving. This study has shown that while a simple store-and-release cover may not be a highly effective barrier to water infiltration in humid climates, it can be used to (i) eliminate contaminated surface water runoff, (ii) minimize AMD impacts to surface water receptor(s), (iii) maintain a stable landform, and (iv) provide a sustainable vegetative canopy.","[Power, Christopher; Ramasamy, Murugan; Mkandawire, Martin] Cape Breton Univ, Verschuren Ctr Sustainabil Energy & Environm, Sydney, NS, Canada",Cape Breton University,"Power, C (corresponding author), Cape Breton Univ, Verschuren Ctr Sustainabil Energy & Environm, Sydney, NS, Canada.",chris_power@cbu.ca; murugan_ramasamy@cbu.ca; martin_mkandawire@cbu.ca,,"Power, Christopher/0000-0003-2389-4214",Enterprise Cape Breton Corporation (ECBC),Enterprise Cape Breton Corporation (ECBC),"This work was conducted under the CAPs Monitoring Project and funded by Enterprise Cape Breton Corporation (ECBC) which was later dissolved into Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC).

By contrasting multiyear El Nino events with single-year ones, we find that the succession characteristics of multiyear El Nino events are primarily caused by a negative North Pacific Oscillation (NPO) in the first-year winter via subtropical Pacific coupling processes. By contrasting reintensified multiyear El Nino events with lingering ones, we find that the reintensification characteristics are caused by a negative Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) in the first-year fall via tropical interbasin coupling processes. The phase information of the preceding winter NPO and fall IOD together can be used to project the evolution characteristics of El Nino events, particularly the reintensified multiyear and transitional single-year events. Plain Language Summary The 2015-2016 El Nino, categorized as a very strong event like the 1997-1998 and 1982-1983 events, was unique in its evolution in time as it was preceded by a weak El Nino. By analyzing a long-term simulation produced by a state-of-the-art climate model, this study uncovers two key factors driving these types of multiyear El Nino events: a meridional shift of the northern winter Aleutian Low pressure system over the North Pacific (known as the North Pacific Oscillation) and a zonal dipole-like pattern of northern fall sea surface temperatures in the Indian Ocean (known as the Indian Ocean Dipole). This study also explains how these two factors invoke tropical-extratropical interactions in the Pacific and interbasin interactions between the Indian and Pacific Oceans to give rise to the evolution characteristics of these multiyear events. Findings from this study may help improve predictions of multiyear El Nino events.","[Kim, Ji-Won; Yu, Jin-Yi] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Irvine, CA 92697 USA",University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Kim, JW (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",jiwok13@uci.edu,"Yu, Jin-Yi/AAU-9089-2020","Yu, Jin-Yi/0000-0001-6156-7623",NSF Climate and Large-Scale Dynamics Program [AGS1833075],NSF Climate and Large-Scale Dynamics Program(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)),We thank Dr. Wenju Cai and an anonymous reviewer for their valuable comments.

Therefore, discriminating between these forms, and exploring their climatology and variations are of significant importance, especially under a changing climate. In this study, a state-of-the-art parameterization scheme with wet-bulb temperature (T-w), relative humidity (RH), surface air pressure, and elevation as inputs was used to estimate the climatologies and trends of the different forms of precipitation and their temperature thresholds across China mainland from 1961 to 2016. The results indicate that on average, only 9.6% and 0.8% of the total precipitation (602.9 mm) over China during 1961-2016 occurred as snow and sleet. The trends of the different forms of precipitation varied greatly from region to region and from season to season. The regionally averaged annual precipitation, rainfall, and snowfall across China significantly increased at rates of 11.4 mm/decade, 11.0 mm/decade, and 1.0 mm/decade, respectively, whereas the annual sleet decreased at a rate of-0.3 mm/decade. The region-wide snow (rain) fraction significantly increased (decreased) in Northwestern China (NWC) and Northern China (NC) but significantly decreased (increased) on the Tibetan Plateau (TP). Given the heterogeneous RH and complex topography, the T-w values at which snow-sleet and sleet-rain occurred with equal frequency-that is, T-s and T-r, varied significantly across China, averaging 0.1 C and 0.3 C, respectively. However, most regions experienced significant decreases in the temperature thresholds (especially T-r), with decreasing RH. Almost all of the regions also experienced significant increases in T-w, especially on the TP and during the winter and spring. The adverse combination of the increase in T-w and the decrease in the temperature thresholds resulted in more precipitation falling as rain, although the snowfall slightly increased in some regions.","[Su, Bo; Xiao, Cunde; Zhao, Hongyu; Huang, Yi] Beijing Normal Univ, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Su, Bo; Chen, Deliang] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Earth Sci, Reg Climate Grp, Box 460, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Dou, Tingfeng] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Resources & Environm, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xuejia] Lanzhou Univ, Coll Earth & Environm Sci, Key Lab Western Chinas Environm Syst, Minist Educ, Lanzhou 730030, Peoples R China","Beijing Normal University; University of Gothenburg; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Lanzhou University","Chen, DL (corresponding author), Univ Gothenburg, Dept Earth Sci, Reg Climate Grp, Box 460, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden.",deliang@gvc.gu.se,,"Su, Bo/0000-0003-1499-2728",National Natural Science Foundation of China [41690145]; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA20060401]; National Foundation of China Scholarship Council [201906040104],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); National Foundation of China Scholarship Council,"Acknowledgements This research was jointly funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC grant Nos. 41690145) and the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Grant No. XDA20060401) , and National Foundation of China Scholarship Council (Grant No. 201906040104) .",,51,4,4,10,23,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0169-8095,1873-2895,,ATMOS RES,Atmos.

The state of the art in transformer thermal limits are Dynamic Thermal Rating (DTR). DTR can be based on two temperature limits: either a design temperature or maximal-permissible temperature. However, many papers estimate DTR with the design temperature only. Therefore, the true DTR is still underestimated since temperature limit is ignored as well as current limits (in some papers). Moreover, many papers rely on the conservative assumption of typical historical load profile or net load profile (considering the distributed generation, storage, electric vehicles). However, modern DSO can control the shape of (net) load profile. This can make a DTR estimation, assuming some typical (net) load profile, valuable only for a particular shape of (net) load profile but not for its modifications. This paper suggests a DTR feasible region which is constructed from current and temperature limitations and does not rely on typical load profiles. As a case study, we investigate DTR in cold and warm climates: one case in Russia with a continental climate and another in France with a temperate climate. In these climates, we assess DTR for the most common combinations of current and temperature limitations, used in standards and literature. As a result, DTR can ensure an additional capacity up to 45%. DTR, based on temperature limits, are 100% of time higher than nominal rating. Moreover, the limiting factors of DTR are quantified based on analysis of 34-year ambient temperature data. Finally, comprehensive recommendations for transformer overloading are formulated.","[Daminov, Ildar; Caire, Raphael; Alvarez-Herault, Marie-Cecile] Univ Grenoble Alpes, CNRS, Grenoble INP1, G2Elab, F-38000 Grenoble, France; [Daminov, Ildar; Prokhorov, Anton] Tomsk Polytech Univ, Power Engn Sch, 7 Usov St, Tomsk 634034, Russia",UDICE-French Research Universities; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Institut National Polytechnique de Grenoble; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Tomsk Polytechnic University,"Daminov, I (corresponding author), Univ Grenoble Alpes, CNRS, Grenoble INP1, G2Elab, F-38000 Grenoble, France.;Daminov, I (corresponding author), Tomsk Polytech Univ, Power Engn Sch, 7 Usov St, Tomsk 634034, Russia.",ildar.Daminov@g2elab.grenoble-inp.fr,"Caire, Raphael/AAY-3119-2021; ALVAREZ-HERAULT, Marie-Cecile/AAY-8372-2020; ALVAREZ-HERAULT, Marie-Cecile/AAX-4314-2021","Caire, Raphael/0000-0003-4041-3507; ALVAREZ-HERAULT, Marie-Cecile/0000-0001-5813-7454; ALVAREZ-HERAULT, Marie-Cecile/0000-0001-5813-7454; Prokhorov, Anton/0000-0002-7516-6027; Daminov, Ildar/0000-0002-7335-9167",Tomsk Polytechnic University Competitiveness Enhancement Program grant; IDEX; Grenoble INP; Conference des Grandes Ecoles,Tomsk Polytechnic University Competitiveness Enhancement Program grant; IDEX; Grenoble INP; Conference des Grandes Ecoles,"We deeply appreciate Conference des Grandes Ecoles, who first supported our research and laid the ground for its further development.

Ecosystem production depends, for example, on the solar energy amount that reaches the vegetation, however the diffuse component of this flux can substantially increase ecosystem net productivity. This phenomenon is observed in different ecosystems, but the study of the atmosphere optical properties on peatland production is lacking. In this paper, the presented methodology allowed us to disentangle the diffuse radiation impact on the net ecosystem production (NEP) of Rzecin peatland, Poland. It allowed us to assess the impact of the atmospheric scattering process determined by the aerosol presence in the air mass. An application of atmospheric radiation transfer (ART) and ecosystem production (EP) models showed that the increase of aerosol optical thickness from 0.09 to 0.17 caused NEP to rise by 3.4-5.7%. An increase of the diffusion index (DI) by 0.1 resulted in an NEP increase of 6.1-42.3%, while a DI decrease of 0.1 determined an NEP reduction of -49.0 to -10.5%. These results show that low peatland vegetation responds to changes in light scattering. This phenomenon should be taken into account when calculating the global CO2 uptake estimation of such ecosystems.","[Harenda, Kamila M.; Samson, Mateusz; Juszczak, Radoslaw; Chojnicki, Bogdan H.] Poznan Univ Life Sci, Fac Environm & Mech Engn, Dept Ecol & Environm Protect, Lab Bioclimatol, PL-60637 Poznan, Poland; [Markowicz, Krzysztof M.; Stachlewska, Iwona S.] Univ Warsaw, Inst Geophys, Fac Phys, PL-02093 Warsaw, Poland; [Kleniewska, Malgorzata] Warsaw Univ Life Sci SGGW, Inst Environm Engn, Dept Remote Sensing & Environm Assessment, PL-02787 Warsaw, Poland; [MacArthur, Alasdair] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Geosci, Grant Inst, Edinburgh EH9 3JW, Midlothian, Scotland; [Schuttemeyer, Dirk] European Space Agcy ESA, NL-2201 AZ Noordwijk, Netherlands",Poznan University of Life Sciences; University of Warsaw; Warsaw University of Life Sciences; University of Edinburgh; European Space Agency,"Harenda, KM (corresponding author), Poznan Univ Life Sci, Fac Environm & Mech Engn, Dept Ecol & Environm Protect, Lab Bioclimatol, PL-60637 Poznan, Poland.",kamila.harenda@up.poznan.pl; mateusz.samson@up.poznan.pl; radoslaw.juszczak@up.poznan.pl; krzysztof.markowicz@fuw.edu.pl; iwona.stachlewska@fuw.edu.pl; malgorzata_kleniewska@sggw.edu.pl; alasdair.macarthur@ed.ac.uk; Dirk.Schuettemeyer@esa.int; bogdan.chojnicki@up.poznan.pl,"Stachlewska, Iwona S./AFT-5148-2022; Juszczak, Radoslaw/AAH-9336-2019","Stachlewska, Iwona S./0000-0002-3890-2953; Juszczak, Radoslaw/0000-0002-5212-7383; Mac Arthur, Alasdair/0000-0002-7553-5822; Harenda, Kamila/0000-0002-6111-981X; Markowicz, Krzysztof/0000-0003-4190-0243; Schuettemeyer, Dirk/0000-0003-1112-5477; Samson, Mateusz/0000-0001-8437-4904; Chojnicki, Bogdan/0000-0002-9012-4060",European Space Agency (ESA-ESTEC) [4000119961/16/NL/FF/mg]; National Science Centre of Poland [UMO-2017/27/B/ST10/02228]; Ministry of Science and Higher Education [005/RID/2018/19],"European Space Agency (ESA-ESTEC)(European Space Agency); National Science Centre of Poland(National Science Centre, Poland); Ministry of Science and Higher Education(Ministry of Science and Higher Education, Poland)","This research was funded by European Space Agency (ESA-ESTEC), grant number 4000119961/16/NL/FF/mg (Technical assistance for POlish radar and LIdar Mobile Observation System-POLIMOS) and National Science Centre of Poland, grant number UMO-2017/27/B/ST10/02228 (Carbon dioxide uptake potential of sphagnum peatlands in the context of atmospheric optical parameters and climate changes).

Adequate observations to constrain the uncertainties in these clear-sky fluxes have long been missing. The present study provides newly derived observational clear-sky climatologies at worldwide distributed anchor sites with high-accuracy measurements from the Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) and the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program (ARM). These data are used to systematically assess the performance of a total of 36 GCMs with respect to their surface solar clear-sky fluxes. These models represent almost 2 decades of model development, from the atmospheric model intercomparison projects AMIP I and AMIP II to the state of the art models participating in the 4th Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC-AR4). Results show that earlier model versions tend to largely overestimate the surface insolation under cloud-free conditions. This identifies an overly transparent cloud-free atmosphere as a key error source for the excessive surface insolation in GCMs noted in previous studies. Possible origins are an underestimated water vapor absorption and a lack of adequate aerosol forcing. Similar biases remain in a number of current models with comparatively low atmospheric clear-sky solar absorption (around 60 Wm(-2) in the global mean). However, there are now several models participating in IPCC-AR4 with higher atmospheric clear-sky absorption (70 Wm(-2) and up, globally averaged) and more realistic aerosol treatment, which are in excellent agreement with the newly derived observational clear-sky climatologies. This underlines the progress made in radiative transfer modeling as well as in the observation and diagnosis of solar radiation under cloudless atmospheres and puts the most likely value of solar radiation absorbed in the cloud-free atmosphere slightly above 70 Wm(-2).","Swiss Fed Inst Technol, ETH, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; Pacific NW Natl Lab, Richland, WA 99352 USA",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Pacific Northwest National Laboratory,"Wild, M (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, ETH, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, Univ Str 16, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",martin.wild@env.ethz.ch,"Wild, Martin/J-8977-2012",,,,,,63,74,75,0,17,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",2169-897X,2169-8996,,J GEOPHYS RES-ATMOS,J.

This will be achieved by using various state-of-the-art atmospheric models, measurements, epidemiological studies and reviews. To assess population full exposure, an integrated view accounting both for indoor and outdoor air pollution as well as for population time activity data will be developed. New dose-response functions will be estimated between health outcome, air pollution and temperature in order to better estimate the effects on the foetus and young children. Ultimately, scenarios of future urban climate and air quality will be simulated, combining future exposure scenarios, population scenarios and exposure-response functions to describe the effects of different trends and relevant policies on relative risk and burden of illness attributed to urban pollutants and their interactions with extreme temperatures. Also the mitigation strategies that can be used to reduce urbanization and climate change effects on the local urban meteorology and air quality will be assessed. With applications in several large European cities, the project will study the impact of several alternative adaptation scenarios on urban air quality and human health to a mid-century horizon (2030-2060) accounting for the effects of a changing urban climate. Scenario-based health impact assessments will combine exposure information from climate models, emission scenarios, policy evaluation studies and concentration calculations with exposure-response functions from epidemiological studies of vulnerable groups within the project and previously published functions for mortality and hospital admissions. The effects of socioeconomic and demographic trends will be discussed, the predicted health impacts and benefits associated with different interventions and policies and other urban changes will be described.","[Delcloo, Andy] Royal Meteorol Inst Belgium, Brussels, Belgium; [Andersson, Camilla] Swedish Meteorol & Hydrol Inst, Norrkoping, Sweden; [Forsberg, Bertil] Umea Univ, Div Occupat & Environm Hlth, Dept Publ Hlth & Clin Studies, SE-90187 Umea, Sweden; [Nawrot, Tim] Hasselt Univ, Environm Res Ctr, Hasselt, Belgium; [Valari, Myrto] IPSL Ecole Polytech, Lab Meteorol Dynam, F-91128 Palaiseau, France",Royal Meteorological Institute of Belgium; Swedish Meteorological & Hydrological Institute; Umea University; Hasselt University; UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite,"Delcloo, A (corresponding author), Royal Meteorol Inst Belgium, Brussels, Belgium.",Andy.Delcloo@meteo.be; Camilla.Andersson@smhi.se; Bertil.Forsberg@envmed.umu.se; Tim.Nawrot@uhasselt.be; Myrto.Valari@lmd.polytechnique.fr,"Delcloo, Andy/AFX-6906-2022; Nawrot, Tim/AAA-4531-2019; Andersson, Camilla/B-7580-2014","Delcloo, Andy/0000-0001-5807-6241; Andersson, Camilla/0000-0001-7853-932X; Nawrot, Tim/0000-0002-3583-3593",ANSES; ADEME; BelSPO; UBA; Swedish EPA,ANSES; ADEME; BelSPO(Belgian Federal Science Policy Office); UBA(University of Buenos Aires); Swedish EPA,"ACCEPTED is carried out within the framework of the ERA- ENVHEALTH second call for transnational research projects on  Air pollution in urban areas: health impacts on vulnerable groups under changing conditions launched in 2012.

In this chapter the current state of the art in modelling is compared with the permafrost thaw and carbon cycle processes discussed in the previous chapters. Land surface models that are applied in Earth System/climate models are still missing crucial processes for predicting the future permafrost carbon feedback, show large discrepancies in hindcasting present permafrost extent and carbon and large variation in future permafrost prediction. However, improvement of permafrost--relevant soil physics is promising. Large-scale modelling of dedicated permafrost and permafrost carbon models has shown interesting results, in particular in modelling thaw of ice-rich permafrost. This chapter concludes with an outlook to the future of permafrost. The most recently published papers demonstrate that in some regions abrupt permafrost thaw is accelerating at an alarming pace. Compared to permafrost decline during the last glacial termination, near future permafrost area is expected to decline at least 2.4 times faster.","[van Huissteden, J.] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Fac Sci, Amsterdam, Netherlands",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"van Huissteden, J (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Fac Sci, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",,,,,,,,73,0,0,1,6,SPRINGER NATURE SWITZERLAND AG,BASEL,"PICASSOPLATZ 4, BASEL, CH-4052, SWITZERLAND",,,978-3-030-31379-1; 978-3-030-31378-4,,,,2020,,,,,465,497,,10.1007/978-3-030-31379-1_8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-31379-1_8,10.1007/978-3-030-31379-1,,33,"Ecology; Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Book Citation Index – Science (BKCI-S),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology,BR1GH,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000632140700009,View Full Record in Web of Science

The response of regional precipitation to global warming is spatially variable, and state-of-the-art model projections suffer large uncertainties in the geographic distribution of precipitation changes(3-5). Two views exist regarding tropical rainfall change: one predicts increased rainfall in presently rainy regions (wet-get-wetter)(6-8), and the other suggests increased rainfall where the rise in sea surface temperature exceeds the mean surface warming in the tropics (warmer-get-wetter)(9-12). Here we analyse simulations with 18 models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5), and present a unifying view for seasonal rainfall change. We find that the pattern of ocean warming induces ascending atmospheric flow at the Equator and subsidence on the flanks, anchoring a band of annual mean rainfall increase near the Equator that reflects the warmer-get-wetter view. However, this climatological ascending motion marches back and forth across the Equator with the Sun, pumping moisture upwards from the boundary layer and causing seasonal rainfall anomalies to follow a wet-get-wetter pattern. The seasonal mean rainfall, which is the sum of the annual mean and seasonal anomalies, thus combines the wet-get-wetter and warmer-get-wetter trends. Given that precipitation climatology is well observed whereas the pattern of ocean surface warming is poorly constrained(13,14), our results suggest that projections of tropical seasonal mean rainfall are more reliable than the annual mean.","[Huang, Ping; Hu, Kaiming; Huang, Ronghui] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Ctr Monsoon Syst Res, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Xie, Shang-Ping] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Xie, Shang-Ping] Ocean Univ China, Phys Oceanog Lab, Qingdao 266003, Peoples R China; [Xie, Shang-Ping] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Int Pacific Res Ctr, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Huang, Gang] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Key Lab Reg Climate Environm Res Temperate East A, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; University of California System; University of California San Diego; Scripps Institution of Oceanography; Ocean University of China; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS","Huang, P (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Ctr Monsoon Syst Res, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China.",huangping@mail.iap.ac.cn; sxie@ucsd.edu,"Huang, Ping/B-3026-2012; Xie, Shang-Ping/C-1254-2009; Hu, Kaiming/H-1555-2011; Huang, Ping/A-6399-2013; huang, gang/D-6427-2012; Hu, kaiming/S-7586-2016","Xie, Shang-Ping/0000-0002-3676-1325; Hu, Kaiming/0000-0002-9988-5747; Huang, Ping/0000-0001-7891-8848; huang, gang/0000-0002-8692-7856; ","National Basic Research Program of China [2012CB955604, 2010CB950403]; Natural Science Foundation of China [41105047, 41275083]; US National Science Foundation",National Basic Research Program of China(National Basic Research Program of China); Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); US National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"The work was supported by the National Basic Research Program of China (2012CB955604 and 2010CB950403), the Natural Science Foundation of China (41105047 and 41275083) and the US National Science Foundation.

Two sets of experiments were designed: in the first set (EXP1), OISSTv2 daily sea-ice concentration and SST variations were used as the lower boundary forcing, while in the second set (EXP2) the SST data were replaced by the daily SST climatology. In the results, the multi-model ensemble mean of EXP1 showed a near-surface (similar to 850 hPa) warming trend of 0.4 degrees C/10 yr, which was 80% of the warming trend in the reanalysis. The simulated warming trend was robust across the six models, with a magnitude of 0.36-0.50 degrees C/10 yr. The global SST could explain most of the simulated warming trend in EXP1 in the mid and low troposphere over the Arctic, and accounted for 58% of the simulated near-surface warming. The results also suggest that the upper-tropospheric warming (similar to 200 hPa) over the Arctic in the reanalysis is likely not a forced signal; rather, it is caused by natural climate variability. The source regions that can potentially impact the early winter Arctic warming are explored and the limitations of the study are discussed.","[Wang, Lutao; Hua, Wei] Chengdu Univ Informat Technol, Sch Atmospher Sci, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Wang, Lutao; Wang, Tao; Zhang, Ying; Hua, Wei] Chinese Acad Sci, Nansen Zhu Int Res Ctr, Inst Atmospher Phys, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Gao, Yongqi] Nansen Environm & Remote Sensing Ctr, Bergen, Norway; [Gao, Yongqi] Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, Bergen, Norway; [Guo, Dong; Zhang, Ying] Chinese Acad Sci, Climate Change Res Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Tao] Chengdu Univ Informat Technol, Joint Lab Climate & Environm Change, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Wang, Tao] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteoro, Nanjing, Peoples R China","Chengdu University of Information Technology; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; Nansen Environmental & Remote Sensing Center (NERSC); Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chengdu University of Information Technology; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology","Guo, D (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Climate Change Res Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China.",guodong@mail.iap.ac.cn,,,"National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFE0111800]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41790472, 41661144005]; EU H2020 Blue-Action project [727852]",National Key R&D Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China; EU H2020 Blue-Action project,This work was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China [grant number 2017YFE0111800] and the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant numbers 41790472 and 41661144005].

Methods This paper leverages documentary analysis of data across a wide array of sources to test these claims and identify lessons by creating a novel just energy transition framework. Results The study finds economic motivation, mindset and reorientation-not environmental concerns-to be the defining features for at least the first two decades of this shift. The lack of willingness to acknowledge environmental impacts and market realities has delayed the transition and led to wasteful allocation of resources towards supporting the hard coal mining industry. The prominence given to distributional justice cushions the victims of this transition financially, but does not allow a broad based coalition to advance the transition process. It is in the second phase (mid-1980s onwards that we see procedural aspects of justice come forth and support greater ownership and sustainability of the transition to emerge, while the evidence of recognition justice continues to be scant. Conclusions There are many nuanced successes in the Ruhr's example, along with some failures worth highlighting. It is in the breakdown of this transition into two distinct phases and their nuances (particularly in the domain of justice) that fresh insights emerge and allow for a better understanding of what constitutes a suitable energy transition in a particular socio-economic and political context. As the international community embarks on ambitious greenhouse gas reduction targets, it can maximise the benefits and minimise the damages and costs by considering these realities on the ground.","[Schroeder, Heike] Univ East Anglia, Sch Int Dev, Norwich Res Pk, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England",University of East Anglia,,wordsbyanmol@gmail.com,,"Schroeder, Heike/0000-0003-2342-2030",,,,,82,0,0,4,4,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2192-0567,,,ENERGY SUSTAIN SOC,Energy Sustain.

Previous studies mostly used lifecycle cost as the criteria to select the optimum insulation materials with little or no consideration of embodied energy, emission, and summer overheating potential. This study presents a comparative analysis of building insulation materials properties (thermal, hygroscopic, acoustic, reaction to fire, environmental, and cost) and their performance in different climate zones and proposed an optimization framework. Insulation materials can be primarily categorized as conventional, state-of-the-art and sustainable. State-of-the-art insulation materials have the lowest thermal conductivity value amongst the three insulation types. However, their life cycle cost is higher compared to the other types. Sustainable insulation materials could be useful to delay and minimize indoor peak temperature and reduce overheating risk during the hot summer period. The analysis also showed that building walls with comparatively lower thermal resistance are more cost-effective for the cooling dominated region, but walls with higher thermal resistance are more cost-effective in heating-dominated regions. However, highly insulated and airtight houses may also lead to increased overheating risk and peak cooling demand during a hot summer period. In addition, hygroscopic, acoustic, and fire retardancy properties of insulation materials are critical to control indoor relative humidity in a humid region, to maintain a minimum noise level in a zone, and to reduce fire destruction. Hence, the optimization should include four criteria 1) Energy, 2) Environment, 3) Economic, and 4) Comfort.","[Kumar, Dileep; Alam, Morshed; Sanjayan, Jay G.] Swinburne Univ Technol, Dept Civil & Construct Engn, Hawthorn, Vic, Australia; [Zou, Patrick X.

Results show that tomato crop diseases and their severity could be detected and discriminated from healthy ones more effectively using various remote sensing systems. Furthermore, the recent advances in RS technologies have greatly facilitated its integration with climatic and topo-edaphic factors to determine the possible drivers of disease infection.

Predictive modelling may be applied in the MSP framework to obtain spatially explicit information about biodiversity patterns. The growing number of statistical approaches used for this purpose implies the urgent need for comparisons between different predictive techniques. In this study, we evaluated the performance of selected machine learning and regression-based methods that were applied for modelling fish community indices. We hypothesized that habitat features can influence fish assemblage and investigated the effect of environmental gradients on demersal fish diversity (species richness and Shannon-Weaver Index). We used fish data from the Baltic International Trawl Surveys (2001-2014) and maps of six potential predictors: bottom salinity, depth, seabed slope, growth season bottom temperature, seabed sediments and annual mean bottom current velocity. We compared the performance of six alternative modelling approaches: generalized linear models, generalized additive models, multivariate adaptive regression splines, support vector machines, boosted regression trees and random forests. We applied repeated 10-fold cross-validation, using accuracy as the measure of model quality. Finally, we selected random forest as the best performing algorithm and implemented it for the spatial prediction of fish diversity from the Baltic Proper to the Kattegat. To obtain information on the data reliability and confidence of the developed models, which are essential for MSP, we estimated the uncertainty of predictions with standard deviation of predictions obtained from all the trees in the ensemble random forest method. We showed how state-of-the-art predictive techniques, based on easily available data and simple Geographic Information System tools, can be used to obtain reliable spatial information about fish diversity. Our comparative work highlighted the potential of machine learning method to reduce prediction error in modelling of demersal fish diversity in the framework of MSP.","[Smolinski, Szymon; Radtke, Krzysztof] Natl Marine Fisheries Res Inst, Dept Fisheries Resources, Kolla Taja 1, PL-81332 Gdynia, Poland",National Marine Fisheries Research Institute,"Smolinski, S (corresponding author), Natl Marine Fisheries Res Inst, Dept Fisheries Resources, Kolla Taja 1, PL-81332 Gdynia, Poland.",ssmolinski@mir.gdynia.pl,"Smoliński, Szymon/AAZ-1088-2020","Smoliński, Szymon/0000-0003-2715-984X; Radtke, Krzysztof/0000-0003-4736-8390",BONUS [Art 185]; EU; National Centre for Research and Development in Poland,"BONUS; EU(European Commission); National Centre for Research and Development in Poland(National Centre for Research & Development, Poland)","This work resulted from the BONUS BIO-C3 project and was supported by BONUS (Art 185), funded jointly by the EU and the National Centre for Research and Development in Poland.

We analyzed the summer interannual variability in euphausiid species composition based on carbon mass of the Baja California oceanic domain during 1998-2008. Selection of one exclusive season allowed the emphasis of interannual changes in order to research possible biological impacts. During the period 1998-2008 prevailed intense interannual activity, with four El Nino events, two of them (1997-1998 and 2006-2007) with SST anomalies propagating toward the eastern Pacific (EP-El Nino), while the other two (2002-2003 and 2004-2005) had SST anomalies limited to the central Pacific (CP-El Nino). There were also La Nina events in 1998-2000 and 2007-2008. The species with higher biomass contribution off Baja California were Nematoscelis difficilis, Euphausia gibboides, Thysanoessa gregaria, Euphausia eximia, Nyctiphanes simplex, and Euphausia pacifica, with a global geometric mean of 156, 66, 38, 30, 21, and 13 mu g Cm-3 respectively. N. difficilis and E. pacifica were dominant in the northern area (29.5-32 degrees N), N. difficilis and E. gibboides in the central area (27-29.5 N), and E. eximia dominated in the southern area (24.5-27 N). 1998-2008 biomass anomalies showed a variety of patterns by species with the clearest footprint, in most of the species, during the strong EP-E1 Nino 1997-1998. CP-E1 Nini events also left a footprint in the biomass of some species but this was not always by anomalies of the same nature as EP-E1 Nino. The best examples were N. difficilis and N. simplex, which presented lightly positive anomalies during July 1998 but were strongly negative in the summer of 2003 and 2004. The opposite was observed in E. recurva, with a negative anomaly in July 1998 but positive in 2004 and 2005. The biophysical coupling between the species assemblage and environmental variables, using canonical correspondence analysis (CCA), explained 22% of the biomass variability. The first axis was responsible for thermal conditions in the upper layer (temperature at 10 m, 50 m, and the gradient between 10 and 100 m depth), while the second axis concentrated the oxygen gradient, oxygen and salinity at 50 m depth, and 200 m temperature. A large group of tropical-subtropical species showed covariance with axis-1, while E. pacifica and T. spinifera had art inverse covariance. The equatorial species E. distinguenda and E. lamelligera were close to axis-2, though the stations were limited to slope water where intense upwelling bring oxygen depleted deep water. Transition zone species (E. gibboides, N. difficilis, T. gregaria, and N. simplex) were relatively inert to both axes. Their response to climatic variability was less predictable and new variables should be explored, including bottom-up and top-down mechanisms.","[Pares-Escobar, Fernanda; Lavaniegos, Bertha E.] CICESE, Dept Oceanog Biol, Carretera Ensenada Tijuana 3918, Ensenada 22860, Baja Ca, Mexico; [Ambriz-Arreola, Israel] Univ Guadalajara, Ctr Ecol Costera, Gomez Farias 82, San Patricio Melaque 48980, Jalisco, Mexico",CICESE - Centro de Investigacion Cientifica y de Educacion Superior de Ensenada; Universidad de Guadalajara,"Lavaniegos, BE (corresponding author), CICESE, Dept Oceanog Biol, Carretera Ensenada Tijuana 3918, Ensenada 22860, Baja Ca, Mexico.",berlav@cicese.mx,,,"CONACYT [G0041T, G35326T, 42569, 23947]; SEMARNAT-CONACYT [23804]; UCMEXUS [CNO7-125]",CONACYT(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)); SEMARNAT-CONACYT(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)); UCMEXUS,"We dedicate this paper to the memory of Gilberto Gaxiola Castro, who provided the chlorophyll data.

We developed a revised self-calibrating PDSI model that replaces E-P with leaf area index-based total evapotranspiration (ARTS E-0). It also included a simple snowmelt module. Using a unique satellite leaf area index data set and climate data, we calculated and compared ARTS E-0, three other types of E-P (i.e., Thornthwaite E-P_Th, Allen E-P_Al, and Penman-Monteith E-P_PM), and corresponding PDSI values (i.e., PDSI_ARTS, PDSI_Th, PDSI_Al, and PDSI_PM) for the period 1982-2011. The results of PDSI_ARTS, PDSI_Al, and PDSI_PM show that global land became wetter mainly due to increased precipitation and El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) effect for the period, which confirms the ongoing intensification of global hydrologic cycle with global temperature increase. However, only PDSI_Th gave a trend of global drying, which confirms that PDSI_Th overestimates the global drying in response to global warming; i.e., PDSI values are sensitive to the parameterizations for E-p. Thus, ARTS E-0, E-P_Al, and E-P_PM are preferred to E-P_Th in global drought monitoring. In short, global warming affects global drought condition in two opposite ways. One is to contribute to the increases of E-P and hence drought; the other is to increase global precipitation that contributes to global wetting. These results suggest that precipitation trend and its interaction with global warming and ENSO should be given much attention to correctly quantify past and future trends of drought.","[Yan, Hao; Lu, Hou-Quan] China Meteorol Adm, Natl Meteorol Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Yan, Hao; Yu, Qin; Shugart, Herman H.] Univ Virginia, Dept Environm Sci, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA; [Wang, Shao-Qiang] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Zai-Chun] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Remote Sensing & Digital Earth, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Zai-Chun] Ctr Applicat Spatial Informat Technol Publ Hlth, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Myneni, Ranga B.] Boston Univ, Dept Earth & Environm, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Liu, Qiang] Beijing Normal Univ, Coll Global Change & Earth Syst Sci, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China","China Meteorological Administration; University of Virginia; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; The Institute of Remote Sensing & Digital Earth, CAS; Boston University; Beijing Normal University","Yan, H (corresponding author), China Meteorol Adm, Natl Meteorol Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China.",yanhaon@hotmail.com,"Zhu, Zaichun/I-5374-2014; Myneni, Ranga B/F-5129-2012; Zhu, Zaichun/ABD-2040-2021; Myneni, Ranga B./AAU-6088-2021; Shugart, Herman/C-5156-2009","Zhu, Zaichun/0000-0001-5235-5194; Myneni, Ranga B/0000-0002-0234-6393; Zhu, Zaichun/0000-0001-5235-5194; Shugart, Herman/0000-0002-1766-8379; yan, hao/0000-0002-5287-3298","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41171284, 40801129]; National Basic Research Program of China [2013CB430205]; Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA05050602-1]; University of Virginia's Programs of Distinction grant",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Basic Research Program of China(National Basic Research Program of China); Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); University of Virginia's Programs of Distinction grant,"We acknowledge the use of the MERRA reanalysis data available at the Modeling and Assimilation Data and Information Services Center (MDISC) managed by the NASA Goddard Earth Sciences (GES) Data and Information Services Center (DISC), the CRU data of the British Atmospheric Data Centre (BADC), the global LAI3g and FPAR3g data sets available at Department of Earth and Environment of Boston University, GLASS LAI data from the Center for Global Change Data Processing and Analysis of Beijing Normal University, and the ISLSCP II global gridded soil data at Oak Ridge National Laboratory Distributed Active Archive Center (ORNL DAAC).

Identifying such disruptions at global scales is not straightforward, as it requires disentangling a weak signal from comprehensive, gapless data in a 5-D configuration space whose dimensions are latitude, longitude, time, power, and period. Drawing on reliable, state-of-the-art climate model simulations from the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) experiments and using well-tested analytical methods, clear changes in the global precipitation cycles have been found for the simulated period 1862-2003. It has also been found that the disruptions may be attributable to anthropogenic forcing. The disruptions are relevant enough to envision significant changes in precipitation timing if human greenhouse gas emissions continue to accumulate in the future. It is noteworthy that the effects of anthropogenic forcings have been found not predominantly in the intra-annual cycles, i.e., in the short-term weather patterns that would be indicative of local effects, but rather in the interannual planetary long-term variability of the atmosphere. This suggests a global, distributed effect of the anthropogenic forcings on precipitation, which in turn is indicative of changes in the precipitation patterns linked with changes in the thermodynamics of the precipitation microphysics and to a lesser extent with the dynamical aspects of the precipitation processes.","[Tapiador, Francisco J.] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Dept Environm Sci, Toledo, Spain; [Tapiador, Francisco J.; de Castro, Manuel] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Inst Environm Sci, Toledo, Spain; [Behrangi, Ali; Haddad, Ziad S.] NASA, CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA USA; [Haddad, Ziad S.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Joint Inst Reg Earth Syst Sci & Engn, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Katsanos, Dimitris] Natl Observ Athens, Inst Environm Res & Sustainable Dev, Athens, Greece",Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha; Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha; California Institute of Technology; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL); University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; National Observatory of Athens,"Tapiador, FJ (corresponding author), Univ Castilla La Mancha, Dept Environm Sci, Toledo, Spain.;Tapiador, FJ (corresponding author), Univ Castilla La Mancha, Inst Environm Sci, Toledo, Spain.",francisco.tapiador@uclm.es,"Katsanos, Dimitrios/N-7222-2014; Behrangi, Ali/V-8927-2019","Katsanos, Dimitrios/0000-0002-1969-7982; Behrangi, Ali/0000-0001-7594-8793; Castro Munoz de Lucas, Manuel de/0000-0002-9517-4948", [CGL2013-48367-P],,"F.J.T. and M.C. acknowledge project CGL2013-48367-P.

However, these processes are often complex, labor-intensive, and time-consuming. Significant efforts have been made in developing strategies for modeling thermochem-ical conversion processes to maximize their performance and productivity. Among these strategies, machine learning (ML) has attracted substantial interest in recent years in thermochemical conversion process optimi-zation, yield prediction, real-time monitoring, and process control. This study presents a comprehensive review of the research and development in state-of-the-art ML applications in pyrolysis, torrefaction, hydrothermal treatment, gasification, and combustion. Artificial neural networks have been widely employed due to their ability to learn extremely non-linear input-output correlations. Furthermore, the hybrid ML models out-performed the traditional ML models in modeling and optimization tasks. The comparison between various ML methods for different applications, and insights about where the current research is heading, is highlighted. Finally, based on the critical analysis, existing research knowledge gaps are identified, and future recommen-dations are presented.","[Khan, Muzammil; Naqvi, Salman Raza; Ullah, Zahid; Khan, Muhammad Nouman Aslam; Mehran, Muhammad Taqi] Natl Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Chem & Mat Engn, Lab Alternat Fuels & Sustainabil, H-12, Islamabad 44000, Pakistan; [Taqvi, Syed Ali Ammar] NED Univ Engn & Technol, Dept Chem Engn, Karachi 75270, Pakistan; [Farooq, Wasif] King Fahd Univ Petr & Minerals KFUPM, Dept Chem Engn, Dhahran 31261, Saudi Arabia; [Mehran, Muhammad Taqi] KU Leuven Arenberg, Ctr Membrane Separat Adsorpt Catalysis & Spect Sus, Kapeldreef 75-box 2454, B-3001 Leuven, Belgium; [Juchelkov, Dagmar; Stepanec, Libor] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Dept Elect, 17 Listopadu 15-2172, Ostrava 70800, Czech Republic",National University of Sciences & Technology - Pakistan; Ned University of Engineering & Technology; King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals; Technical University of Ostrava,"Naqvi, SR (corresponding author), Natl Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Chem & Mat Engn, Lab Alternat Fuels & Sustainabil, H-12, Islamabad 44000, Pakistan.",salman.raza@scme.nust.edu.pk,,"Mehran, Muhammad Taqi/0000-0002-6045-6558",National University of Sciences Technology; Pakistan Science Foundation;  [47],National University of Sciences Technology; Pakistan Science Foundation; ,Acknowledgment The authors would like to acknowledge the National University of Sciences & Technology for support and Pakistan Science Foundation (grant No. PSF/CRP/C-NUST/T-Helix (47) for financial support.,,182,1,1,11,11,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0016-2361,1873-7153,,FUEL,Fuel,15-Jan,2023,,1,,,,,126055,10.1016/j.fuel.2022.126055,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuel.2022.126055,,,21,"Energy & Fuels; Engineering, Chemical",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Energy & Fuels; Engineering,5L3KY,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000870315200002,View Full Record in Web of Science

The region was struck by three heat waves and a number of forest fire episodes, greatly affecting air pollution levels. We have focused on ozone and its precursors using state-of-the-art inventories for anthropogenic, biogenic and forest fire emissions. The models have been evaluated against measurement data, and processes leading to ozone formation have been quantified. Heat wave episodes are projected to occur more frequently in a future climate, and therefore this study also makes a contribution to climate change impact research. The plume from the Greek forest fires in August 2007 is clearly seen in satellite observations of CO and NO2 columns, showing extreme levels of CO in and downwind of the fires. Model simulations reflect the location and influence of the fires relatively well, but the modelled magnitude of CO in the plume core is too low. Most likely, this is caused by underestimation of CO in the emission inventories, suggesting that the CO/NOx ratios of fire emissions should be re-assessed. Moreover, higher maximum values are seen in WRF-Chem than in EMEP MSC-W, presumably due to differences in plume rise altitudes as the first model emits a larger fraction of the fire emissions in the lowermost model layer. The model results are also in fairly good agreement with surface ozone measurements. Biogenic VOC emissions reacting with anthropogenic NOx emissions are calculated to contribute significantly to the levels of ozone in the region, but the magnitude and geographical distribution depend strongly on the model and biogenic emission module used. During the July and August heat waves, ozone levels increased substantially due to a combination of forest fire emissions and the effect of high temperatures. We found that the largest temperature impact on ozone was through the temperature dependence of the biogenic emissions, closely followed by the effect of reduced dry deposition caused by closing of the plants' stomata at very high temperatures. The impact of high temperatures on the ozone chemistry was much lower. The results suggest that forest fire emissions, and the temperature effect on biogenic emissions and dry deposition, will potentially lead to substantial ozone increases in a warmer climate.","[Hodnebrog, O.; Stordal, F.] Univ Oslo, Dept Geosci, N-0316 Oslo, Norway; [Solberg, S.; Svendby, T.

Applications to the Quaternary record, however, have been sparse and limited by an acute lack of understanding of small mammal isotope ecology, particularly in arid and semi-arid environments. Here we document the oxygen and carbon isotope composition of Gerbillinae (gerbil) tooth apatite across a rainfall gradient in northwestern Africa, in order to test the relative influences of the O-18/O-16 in precipitation or moisture availability on gerbil teeth values, the sensitivity of tooth apatite C-13/C-12 to plant responses to moisture availability, and the influence of developmental period on the isotopic composition of gerbil molars and incisors. The results show that the isotopic composition of molars and incisors from the same individuals differs consistent with the different temporal periods reflected by the teeth; molar teeth are permanently rooted and form around the time of birth, whereas incisors grow continuously. The results indicate that tooth choice is an important consideration for applications as proxy Quaternary records, but also highlights a new potential means to distinguish seasonal contexts. The oxygen isotope composition of gerbil tooth apatite is strongly correlated with mean annual precipitation (MAP) below 600 mm, but above 600 mm the teeth reflect the oxygen isotope composition of local meteoric water instead. Predictably, the carbon isotope composition of the gerbil teeth reflected C-3 and C-4 dietary inputs, however arid and mesic sites could not be distinguished because of the high variability displayed in the carbon isotope composition of the teeth due to the microhabitat and short temporal period reflected by the gerbil. We show that the oxygen isotope composition of small mammal teeth strongly reflects moisture availability in semi-arid and arid environments and would provide an excellent record of palaeo-aridity in a terrestrial setting. The results illustrate that an understanding of an animal's physiology is essential for interpreting the animal's isotopic responses to external contexts, especially in arid zones.

The western boundary Agulhas Current, implicated in global heat exchange dynamics, is an important modulator of southern African climates and yet we understand its past behaviour only broadly as the Current itself scours the coastal shelf and marine sediment core records necessarily provide little detail. Numerous archaeological sites from both the late Pleistocene and Holocene provide the opportunity for reconstruction of near shore seasonal SST records, which respond both to localized wind-driven upwellings and Agulhas temperature shifts, corresponding in turn with terrestrial precipitation trends in the near-coastal and summer rainfall regions. Here we present a record of seasonal SSTs extending over MISS, MIS4, and the Holocene, from serial 8180 measurements of a single gastropod species, Turbo sannaticus. The results show that mean SST shifts accord well with global SST trends, although they are larger than those recorded in the Agulhas Current from coarser-scale marine sediment records. Comparison with a record of Antarctic sea-ice suggests that annual SST amplitude responds to Antarctic sea-ice extent, reflecting the positioning of the regional wind systems that drive upwelling dynamics along the coast. Thus, near shore SST seasonality reflects the relative dominance of the westerly and easterly wind systems. These data provide a new climate archive for an important but understudied climate system.

Moisture availability has a significant influence on the dynamic, stability and function of terrestrial ecosystems. In this study, we used wood samples from 260 Austrocedrus chilensis trees growing in northwestern Patagonia to reconstruct the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) for the last millennium (1055-2014). Our reconstruction explained 41.6% of the variance contained in the November-December SPEI at a 1-month scale for the period 1930-2013. The SPEI reconstruction has provided a long record of extreme pluvial (1060s, 1090s, 1200s, 1300s, 1360s, 1390s, 1400s, 1550s, 1580s, 1580s, 1630s, 1940s, 1960s, and 2000s) and drought events (1070s, 1150s, 1170s, 1180s, 1270s, 1310s, 1430s, 1450s, 1570s, 1600s, 1620s, and 1950s) for northwest Argentine Patagonia. Although the SPEI reconstruction indicates that the frequency of extreme events has increased since 1950, our record indicates that current levels have not exceeded those previously reached, particularly when compared to those recorded around the suggested periods for the Medieval Warm and towards the end of the Little Ice Age. The spatial and temporal relationships associated with the South Annular Mode and the Pacific Sea Surface Temperature variability as expressed by the Tripole Index indicated that the temporal variability observed in the SPEI reconstruction is modulated by hemispheric-scale atmospheric circulation dynamics. These climate forcings are likely responsible for the intensity and the rate of occurrence of extreme weather events in northwestern Patagonia. Furthermore, the SPEI reconstruction showed a spatial and temporal pattern similar to that observed in previous PDSI-based reconstructions. This study provides robust evidence of hydroclimatic variations for extratropical sectors of South America, improving our knowledge of the climate dynamics during the last millennium and allowing us to review the recently observed increase in wet and dry events in a long-term historical context.","[Hadad, Martin A.] CIGEOBIO CONICET UNSJ, Lab Dendrocronol Zonas Aridas, Gabinete Geol Ambiental FCEFyN UNSJ, Av Ignacio Roza 590 Oeste,J5402DCS, Rivadavia, San Juan, Argentina; [Gonzalez-Reyes, Alvaro; Roig, Fidel A.] Univ Mayor, Hemera Ctr Observac Tierra, Escuela Ingn Forestal, Fac Ciencias, Camino La Piramide 5750, Santiago 8580745, Chile; [Roig, Fidel A.] Univ Nacl Cuyo, CONICET, IANIGLA, Lab Dendrocronol & Hist Ambiental, Mendoza, Argentina; [Matskovsky, Vladimir] RAS, Inst Geog, Moscow, Russia; [Cherubini, Paolo] Swiss Fed Res Inst WSL, Forest Dynam Res Unit, Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Cherubini, Paolo] Univ British Columbia, Dept Forest & Conservat Sci, Fac Forestry, Vancouver, BC, Canada","Universidad Mayor; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); University Nacional Cuyo Mendoza; Institute of Geography, Russian Academy of Sciences; Russian Academy of Sciences; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape Research; University of British Columbia","Hadad, MA (corresponding author), CIGEOBIO CONICET UNSJ, Lab Dendrocronol Zonas Aridas, Gabinete Geol Ambiental FCEFyN UNSJ, Av Ignacio Roza 590 Oeste,J5402DCS, Rivadavia, San Juan, Argentina.",mhadad@unsj-cuim.edu.ar,"Cherubini, Paolo/N-9702-2013","Cherubini, Paolo/0000-0002-9809-250X; Hadad, Martin/0000-0002-9334-064X","Agencia Nacional de Promocion Cientifica y Tecnologica of Argentina [PICT-2014-0915, PICT-2018-1056]; Programa Bosques AndinosHELVETAS Swiss InterCooperation (MAH); Russian Science Foundation [17-77-20123]; Russian State Assignment project [014820190004]; Chilean Research Council [ANID/PAI/77190101]; NSF-FAPESP PIRE project [2017/500853]",Agencia Nacional de Promocion Cientifica y Tecnologica of Argentina(ANPCyT); Programa Bosques AndinosHELVETAS Swiss InterCooperation (MAH); Russian Science Foundation(Russian Science Foundation (RSF)); Russian State Assignment project; Chilean Research Council; NSF-FAPESP PIRE project,"This research was supported by the Agencia Nacional de Promocion Cientifica y Tecnologica of Argentina (PICT-2014-0915 and PICT-2018-1056 to MAH) and by the Programa Bosques AndinosHELVETAS Swiss InterCooperation (MAH) .

This is possible, if the context is appropriate, because the MS of these sediments result from climate processes active outside eaves causing variations in magnetic properties of the sediments ultimately accumulating inside of caves. Once deposited, these materials are preserved, and their stratigraphy provides a climate proxy that can be extracted. Here, using the magnetosusceptibility event and cyclostratigraphy (MSEC) method and graphic correlation, we present a paleoclimatic framework for the last 40,000 years for southern Europe and demonstrate the intersite correlation power of the method. Our preliminary result for southern Europe represents climate fluctuations from similar to 43,000 to similar to3,000 yr B.P. (we use here uncalibrated ages). The results correlate well with independent climate indicators, and because these data are robust, they can be used in relative dating.

This study provides an overview over the highly nonlinear and interactive processes involved with sea ice modifying the upper boundary conditions for ocean models in polar regions, We address the physical representation of sea ice in present-day global OGCMs in comparison to regional state-of-the-art sea-ice models.

In this review, we summarize recent reports on the pan evaporation paradox around the world over the past half century, possible causes, implications for the water cycle, and its possible change in the future. We then present a case study of China based on the latest meteorological datasets and the state-of-the-art General Circulation Models (GCMs). We confirm that pan evaporation (E-pan) decreases in most parts of China at an average of about -2.60mm/y(2), and this decrease disappears around 1993. We introduce and develop a detrending approach in sensitivity analysis and find that changes in solar radiation, wind speed, and relative humidity overcompensate the positive contribution of increasing air temperature in E-pan and lead to the well-known pan evaporation paradox. Positive changes in E-pan using 12 state-of-the-art GCMs for 2021-2050 and for 2071-2100 under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios, respectively, when compared with their corresponding multiyear mean over 1971-2000 as base line, shows that the evaporation paradox would not appear in the future. We highlight that it is vital and promising to move forward to interpreting how the atmospheric evaporative demand would change in the future.

Thus, stratigraphic successions along continental margins are archives of these environmental changes and can be used to reconstruct land-ocean linkages, which provide important context for shorter-term and future modifications to this critical zone. Here, we discuss an integrated approach to the analysis of deep-time sediment archives (>10(6) years) that considers the entire system, from eroding catchments where sediment is produced to subsiding basins where sediment accumulates.

Consequently, agri-food supply chains are becoming more intelligent, producing vast amounts of data and pushing the boundaries of the traditional food lifecycle. However, artificial intelligence (AI) for the extended agri-food supply chain is only beginning to emerge. This paper presents a short literature review of eighteen papers on the intelligent agri-food supply chain. The bibliometric analysis reveals key research clusters and current trends in the AI-enabled stages of food production, distribution, and sustainable consumption. The important advances of AI in traditional stages of production need to be expanded with intelligent planning for demand uncertainty and personalized needs of end-customers, storage optimization, waste reduction in the post-production phase (e.g., distribution and recycling), and boundary-spanning analytics. For theory, this work highlights mature areas for AI adoption in agri-food and identifies opportunities for future research in the extended agri-food supply chain. For practice, the review findings can inspire startups interested in extended agri-food ecosystems and incumbents in their pilot projects for the intelligent and sustainable digital transformation of agri-food.

Nevertheless, a comprehensive understanding of the Holocene temporal and spatial evolution of the SWW remains a significant challenge due to the sparsity of high-resolution marine archives and appropriate SWW proxies. Here we present a north-south transect of high-resolution planktonic foraminiferal oxygen isotope records from the western South Atlantic. Our proxy records reveal Holocene migrations of the Brazil-Malvinas Confluence (BMC), a highly sensitive feature for changes in the position and strength of the northern portion of the SWW. Through the tight coupling of the BMC position to the large-scale wind field, the records allow a quantitative reconstruction of Holocene latitudinal displacements of the SWW across the South Atlantic. Our data reveal a gradual poleward movement of the SWW by about 1-1.5 degrees from the early to the mid-Holocene. Afterward, variability in the SWW is dominated by millennial scale displacements on the order of 1 degrees in latitude with no recognizable longer-term trend. These findings are confronted with results from a state-of-the-art transient Holocene climate simulation using a comprehensive coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation model. Proxy-inferred and modeled SWW shifts compare qualitatively, but the model underestimates both orbitally forced multimillennial and internal millennial SWW variability by almost an order of magnitude. The underestimated natural variability implies a substantial uncertainty in model projections of future SWW shifts.","[Voigt, Ines; Prange, Matthias; Mulitza, Stefan; Groeneveld, Jeroen; Henrich, Ruediger] Univ Bremen, MARUM Ctr Marine Environm Sci, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; [Voigt, Ines; Prange, Matthias; Mulitza, Stefan; Groeneveld, Jeroen; Henrich, Ruediger] Univ Bremen, Fac Geosci, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; [Chiessi, Cristiano M.] Univ Sao Paulo, Sch Arts Sci & Humanities, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Varma, Vidya] Stockholm Univ, Dept Meteorol, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden",University of Bremen; University of Bremen; Universidade de Sao Paulo; Stockholm University,"Voigt, I (corresponding author), Univ Bremen, MARUM Ctr Marine Environm Sci, D-28359 Bremen, Germany.",ivoigt@marum.de,"Chiessi, Cristiano Mazur/E-1916-2012; Mulitza, Stefan/G-5357-2011","Chiessi, Cristiano Mazur/0000-0003-3318-8022; Mulitza, Stefan/0000-0002-3842-1447; Varma, Vidya/0000-0003-0332-1339","DFG-Research Center/Cluster of Excellence The Ocean in the Earth System; GLOMAR-Bremen International Graduate School for Marine Sciences; FAPESP [2010/09983-9, 2012/17517-3]",DFG-Research Center/Cluster of Excellence The Ocean in the Earth System(German Research Foundation (DFG)); GLOMAR-Bremen International Graduate School for Marine Sciences; FAPESP(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)),"We thank M.

In previous studies, lightning activity in Japan showed a significant signal of the solar rotational period, especially around the maxima of the decadal solar cycles. Here we analyze the time series of lightning activity in the AD 1668-1767 period, extracted from old diaries in Kyoto, Japan, and search for the signal of solar rotational cycles. The 27-day cycles were detected in the lightning data and occurred only around the maxima of the decadal sunspot cycles. The signal disappeared during AD 1668-1715, which corresponds to the latter half of the Maunder Minimum when both radiative and magnetic disturbances were thought to have been weak. These findings provide insight into the connection between solar activity and the Earth's climate.","[Miyahara, Hiroko] Musashino Art Univ, Humanities & Sci Museum Carriers, 1-736 Ogawa Cho, Kodaira, Tokyo 1878505, Japan; [Aono, Yasuyuki] Osaka Prefecture Univ, Grad Sch Life & Environm Sci, Naka Ku, 1-1 Gakuen Cho, Sakai, Osaka 5998531, Japan; [Kataoka, Ryuho] Natl Inst Polar Res, 10-3 Midori Cho, Tachikawa, Tokyo 1908518, Japan; [Kataoka, Ryuho] SOKENDAI, Sch Multidisciplinary Sci, Dept Polar Sci, 10-3 Midori Cho, Tachikawa, Tokyo 1908518, Japan",Osaka Metropolitan University; Research Organization of Information & Systems (ROIS); National Institute of Polar Research (NIPR) - Japan,"Miyahara, H (corresponding author), Musashino Art Univ, Humanities & Sci Museum Carriers, 1-736 Ogawa Cho, Kodaira, Tokyo 1878505, Japan.",miyahara@musabi.ac.jp,"KATAOKA, RYUHO/AAJ-4570-2020; Miyahara, Hiroko/GPX-4725-2022","Aono, Yasuyuki/0000-0002-6950-4341","JSPS KAKENHI [15H05816, 25287051]; Center for the Promotion of Integrated Sciences of SOKENDAI; Project to Build an International Collaborative Research for Pre-modern Japanese Texts; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [25287051] Funding Source: KAKEN","JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Center for the Promotion of Integrated Sciences of SOKENDAI; Project to Build an International Collaborative Research for Pre-modern Japanese Texts; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI grant numbers 15H05816 and 25287051.

This study adopts a novel approach to assess the potential of these energy resources, in which information from multiple climatic indicators is coupled with socioeconomic drivers of energy development. Specifically, based on a daily dataset of the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR), three climate indicators were employed to characterize the frequency, intensity and duration of solar radiation and wind speed. Then, we introduced a new overall assessment index (OAI) based on these three climatic indicators to explore the best localities from a climatic perspective-for generating solar and wind energies. The validity of the recommended sites was discussed in the context of important physiographic, environmental, and socioeconomic constraints (e.g. population density, urban settlements, distance to water bodies, transportation network, etc.). Results demonstrate that both solar radiation and wind can be seen as promising and substantial alternative sources of fossil fuel resources in Oman, with almost 3.2% and 4.4% of the Omani territory being valid for a sustainable use of wind and solar radiation, respectively. The most recommended sites for wind generation are located mainly along Al-Jazir and Duqum coasts of southeastern Oman, where a promising wind energy center can be constructed. The best localities for the development of hybrid solar radiation generation centers are likely to be placed in Sohar and Thumrayt, where solar intensity approaches 8.1 kWh/m(2), with a high frequency of occurrence throughout the year. In contrast, Oman showed low potential to generate tidal power, mainly due to a low tidal range (<2 m) along the majority of the Omani coastline. This study provides a solid base for national and local decision makers in Oman for a reliable assessment, monitoring, and sustainable exploitation of clean and renewable energy resources, especially with high population growth, accelerated urbanization, and rapid economic growth over the past few decades, which can pose more challenges to future energy demand in this country.

Ozone recovery during the twenty-first century is expected to continue to affect the jet's strength and position, leading to changes in the opposite direction compared to the twentieth century and competing with the effect of increasing greenhouse gases. Simulations of the Earth's past and future climate, such as those performed for the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6), require an accurate representation of these ozone effects. Climate models that use prescribed ozone fields lack the important feedbacks between ozone chemistry, radiative heating, dynamics, and transport. In addition, when the prescribed ozone field was not generated by the same model to which it is prescribed, the imposed ozone hole is inconsistent with the simulated dynamics. These limitations ultimately affect the climate response to ozone depletion. This study investigates the impact of prescribing the ozone field recommended for CMIP6 on the simulated effects of ozone depletion in the Southern Hemisphere. We employ a new state-of-the-art coupled climate model, Flexible Ocean Climate Infrastructure (FOCI), to compare simulations in which the CMIP6 ozone is prescribed with simulations in which the ozone chemistry is calculated interactively. At the same time, we compare the roles played by ozone depletion and by increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in driving changes in the Southern Hemisphere atmospheric circulation using a series of historical sensitivity simulations. FOCI captures the known effects of ozone depletion, simulating an austral spring and summer intensification of the midlatitude westerly winds and of the Brewer-Dobson circulation in the Southern Hemisphere. Ozone depletion is the primary driver of these historical circulation changes in FOCI. The austral spring cooling of the polar cap in the lower stratosphere in response to ozone depletion is weaker in the simulations that prescribe the CMIP6 ozone field. We attribute this weaker response to a prescribed ozone hole that is different to the model dynamics and is not collocated with the simulated polar vortex, altering the strength and position of the planetary wavenumber one. As a result, the dynamical contribution to the ozone-induced austral spring lower-stratospheric cooling is suppressed, leading to a weaker cooling trend. Consequently, the intensification of the polar night jet is also weaker in the simulations with prescribed CMIP6 ozone. In contrast, the differences in the tropospheric westerly jet response to ozone depletion fall within the internal variability present in the model. The persistence of the Southern Annular Mode is shorter in the prescribed ozone chemistry simulations. The results obtained with the FOCI model suggest that climate models that prescribe the CMIP6 ozone field still simulate a weaker Southern Hemisphere stratospheric response to ozone depletion compared to models that calculate the ozone chemistry interactively.","[Ivanciu, Ioana; Matthes, Katja; Wahl, Sebastian; Harlass, Jan; Biastoch, Arne] GEOMAR Helmholtz Ctr Ocean Res Kiel, Kiel, Germany; [Matthes, Katja; Biastoch, Arne] Christian Albrechts Univ Kiel, Fac Math & Nat Sci, Kiel, Germany",Helmholtz Association; GEOMAR Helmholtz Center for Ocean Research Kiel; University of Kiel,"Ivanciu, I (corresponding author), GEOMAR Helmholtz Ctr Ocean Res Kiel, Kiel, Germany.",iivanciu@geomar.de,"Wahl, Sebastian/AAF-3644-2022; Harlass, Jan/P-4389-2019; Wahl, Sebastian/AFI-1518-2022; Matthes, Katja/F-7361-2014","Harlass, Jan/0000-0002-3993-6960; Matthes, Katja/0000-0003-1801-3072; Ivanciu, Ioana/0000-0003-2878-7047",German Federal Ministry of Education and Research [03F0796A],German Federal Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),This research has been supported by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (grant no. 03F0796A).,,101,7,7,5,16,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1680-7316,1680-7324,,ATMOS CHEM PHYS,Atmos.

Conceptual process design is applied to obtain the life cycle inventory data to perform the ex-ante life cycle assessment, with a focus on the climate change impacts expressed in kg CO2-eq. per kg(MeOH). The plasma-assisted technology results in lower greenhouse gas emissions than the conventional thermocatalytic counterpart, when the plasma reactor itself is powered by renewable (solar or wind) electricity. This also holds for most of the environmental indicators; only a few trade-offs on (eco)toxicity, particulate matter and mineral resource indicators were found, due to the impact from wind turbine construction. For a fully electrified modus operandi, i.e. when all unit operations are electrified by renewable sources, both the plasma-assisted and thermocatalytic technologies result in low climate change impacts, in the range of 0.6-0.7 kg CO2-eq. per kg(MeOH). This is comparable to the climate change impact of CO2-based methanol production utilizing electrolytic H-2. Finally, it is estimated that up to 43% CO2 abatement may be possible by replacing the state-of-the-art (natural gas steam reforming-based) methanol production process with electrified alternatives running on renewable electricity.","[Delikonstantis, Evangelos; Marin, Guy B.; Van Geem, Kevin; Stefanidis, Georgios D.] Univ Ghent, Lab Chem Technol, Technolpk 125, B-9052 Ghent, Belgium; [Delikonstantis, Evangelos; Theofanidis, Stavros-Alexandros] AristEng Sarl, 77 Rue Merl, L-2146 Luxembourg, Luxembourg; [Igos, Elorri; Benetto, Enrico] Luxembourg Inst Sci & Technol LIST, 5 Ave Hautsfourneaux, L-4362 Esch Sur Alzette, Luxembourg; [Theofanidis, Stavros-Alexandros] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Chem Engn, Univ Campus, Thessaloniki 54124, Greece; [Stefanidis, Georgios D.] Natl Tech Univ Athens, School Chem Engn, Iroon Polytech 9, Athens 15780, Greece",Ghent University; Luxembourg Institute of Science & Technology; Aristotle University of Thessaloniki; National Technical University of Athens,"Stefanidis, GD (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Lab Chem Technol, Technolpk 125, B-9052 Ghent, Belgium.;Igos, E (corresponding author), Luxembourg Inst Sci & Technol LIST, 5 Ave Hautsfourneaux, L-4362 Esch Sur Alzette, Luxembourg.;Stefanidis, GD (corresponding author), Natl Tech Univ Athens, School Chem Engn, Iroon Polytech 9, Athens 15780, Greece.",elorri.igos@list.lu; georgios.stefanidis@ugent.be,"Benetto, Enrico/H-3234-2012; Van Geem, Kevin/J-3294-2014","Benetto, Enrico/0000-0003-1159-9162; Van Geem, Kevin/0000-0003-4191-4960; Stefanidis, Georgios/0000-0002-4347-1350; Stefanidis, Georgios/0000-0003-0783-0456; Theofanidis, Stavros-Alexandros/0000-0002-3859-7135; Delikonstantis, Evangelos/0000-0002-4727-3327; Marin, Guy/0000-0002-6733-1213",,,,,49,10,10,6,21,ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY,CAMBRIDGE,"THOMAS GRAHAM HOUSE, SCIENCE PARK, MILTON RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 0WF, CAMBS, ENGLAND",1463-9262,1463-9270,,GREEN CHEM,Green Chem.,21-Sep,2021,18,,,,7243,7258,,10.1039/d1gc01730f,http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1gc01730f,,21-Sep,16,"Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Science & Technology - Other Topics,US6LR,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000691715800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The impact of ENSO on basin-scale floods during the TRMM period (1998-2013) is examined by using the streamflow outputs from the Dominant river Routing Integrated with VIC Environment model (DRIVE). Significant simultaneous correlations between flood indices and Nino 3.4 appear in many flood-prone river basins during peak flood months across both the tropics and midlatitudes especially for flood frequency and flood duration. Gauged by significant lag-correlations between floods and Nino 3.4, significant ENSO-leading-floods relations are found as well in many river basins in South America, south and southeastern Asia, and northern Africa. These ENSO-floods-relations can greatly enhance understanding of physical mechanisms relevant to the ENSO impact and may also improve the skills of basin-scale monthly-to-seasonal flood forecast, thus allowing for better preparedness and management of flood risks. Plain Language Summary As a naturally occurring phenomenon involving quasi-periodic variation of air pressure and sea surface temperature, the ENSO impacts global floods through its modulation of atmospheric circulations, weather, and precipitation. Previous studies on ENSO-floodsrelations are often limited in supporting practical flood disaster preparedness and risk analyses because of the lack of a complete reconstruction of past flood events likely due to scattered gauge-based streamflow data and/or coarse-resolution retrospective simulations. Here flood events at model grids and for individual river basins are identified using the outputs from the Dominant river Routing Integrated with VIC Environment model (DRIVE) with a high spatial resolution (0.125 degrees x 0.125 degrees) driven by the state-of-the-art satellite precipitation product TMPA. Simultaneous and lagged responses of basin-scale floods to ENSO are explored to provide an improved knowledge of the ENSO effect on global floods and a guidance for flood disaster planning and risk management for the regions consistently impacted by ENSO.","[Yan, Yan; Wu, Huan; Li, Xiaomeng; Huang, Zhijun] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Atmospher Sci, Zhuhai, Peoples R China; [Yan, Yan; Wu, Huan; Li, Xiaomeng; Huang, Zhijun] Minist Educ, Key Lab Trop Atmosphere Ocean Syst, Zhuhai, Peoples R China; [Yan, Yan; Wu, Huan; Li, Xiaomeng; Huang, Zhijun] Southern Marine Sci & Engn Guangdong Lab Zhuhai, Zhuhai, Peoples R China; [Yan, Yan] Fudan Univ, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Yan, Yan] Fudan Univ, Inst Atmospher Sci, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Wu, Huan; Li, Xiaomeng; Huang, Zhijun] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Climate Change & Nat Disas, Zhuhai, Peoples R China; [Wu, Huan; Gu, Guojun] Univ Maryland, Earth Syst Sci Interdisciplinary Ctr, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Ward, Philip J.] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Luo, Lifeng] Michigan State Univ, Dept Geog Environm & Spatial Sci, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Tao, Jing] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Climate & Ecosyst Sci Div, Berkeley, CA USA; [Tao, Jing] Univ Washington, Civil & Environm Engn, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",Sun Yat Sen University; Southern Marine Science & Engineering Guangdong Laboratory; Fudan University; Fudan University; Sun Yat Sen University; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Michigan State University; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Wu, H (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Atmospher Sci, Zhuhai, Peoples R China.;Wu, H (corresponding author), Minist Educ, Key Lab Trop Atmosphere Ocean Syst, Zhuhai, Peoples R China.;Wu, H (corresponding author), Southern Marine Sci & Engn Guangdong Lab Zhuhai, Zhuhai, Peoples R China.;Wu, H (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Climate Change & Nat Disas, Zhuhai, Peoples R China.;Wu, H (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Earth Syst Sci Interdisciplinary Ctr, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",wuhuan3@mail.sysu.edu.cn,"Wu, Huan/ABF-6130-2020; Wu, Huan/K-1003-2013","Luo, Lifeng/0000-0002-2829-7104; Wu, Huan/0000-0003-2920-8860; Ward, Philip/0000-0001-7702-7859","National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFA0604300]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41861144014, 41775106, U1811464]; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province [2017A030313221]; Program for Guangdong Introducing Innovative and Entrepreneurial Teams [2017ZT07X355]; Guangdong Province Key Laboratory for Climate Change and Natural Disaster Studies [2020B1212060025]; Dutch Research Council (NWO) [016.161.324]",National Key R&D Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province(National Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province); Program for Guangdong Introducing Innovative and Entrepreneurial Teams; Guangdong Province Key Laboratory for Climate Change and Natural Disaster Studies; Dutch Research Council (NWO)(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)),"The authors thank the two anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments and suggestions.

Shallow pore water Si, in spite of significant annual uptake and release by plant growth and dieback, exhibits only moderate seasonal fluctuations reflecting strong buffering from labile biogenic Si, dominated by phytoliths and by secondary pedogenic silicates. Long phytolith residence times (340-900 yrs) reflect the seasonally dry climate and high solute Si concentrations. Water-extractable Si is closely associated with Al, indicating seasonal precipitation and dissolution of a highly labile 1: 1 hydroxyaluminosilicate (HAS), probably allophane, which transforms in deeper soil into fine grained, poorly crystalline kaolinite. Shallow plant roots extract greater proportions of biogenic Si and deeper plant roots larger amounts pedogenic Si. High pore water Ge/Si in late winter and spring reflects the reinforcing effects of plant fractionation and concurrent dissolution of Ge-enriched HAS. The same processes produce pore waters with depleted Si-30/Si-28. In the summer and fall, Ge/Si declines and Si-30/Si-28 increases, reflecting the cessation of plant uptake, continued dissolution of soil phytoliths and re-precipitation of less soluble HAS. Si inputs from weathering (2-90 mmol m(-2) yr(-1)) and losses from pore water discharge (18-68 mM m(-2) yr(-1)) are comparable for individual soils, decline with soil age and are significantly less than amounts of Si annual cycled through the vegetation (42-171 mM m(-2) yr(-1)). Mobile Si is generally balanced in the soils with upward bio-pumping by the shallow-rooted grasses efficiently competing against downward leaching and pore water discharge. Small net annual increases in Si in the present day soils could not have been maintained over the time scale represented by the chronosequence (65-225 yrs), implying past changes in environmental conditions.

Remotely-sensed satellite data enable us to detect and assimilate these events into weather models to improve their global-scale forecasts. Despite the significant advances in satellite imagery and image processing techniques, weather data assimilation methods currently employ conventional approaches that can be slow and inaccurate. This letter aims to bridge this gap by utilizing deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) to accurately and rapidly detect weather patterns in satellite images. InceptionV3, ResNet50, VGG16, and VGG19, as four state-of-the-art CNN models, are used to classify 9081 optical satellite images into five different weather events of convective cell clouds, tropical cyclones, convective roll clouds, wildfires, and dust storms. All these models obtained a satisfactory average accuracy of more than 80%. Among the CNNs, VGG-Nets were found to have difficulties in distinguishing roll convection from cell convection patterns. Overall, InceptionV3 was the best model by achieving an average accuracy of 92% in detecting such weather systems. The letter demonstrates the strength of these CNN techniques for weather pattern recognition that can be instrumental for atmospheric science research and weather/climate models.","[Li, Ye; Momen, Mostafa] Univ Houston, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Room N134,4726 Calhoun Rd, Houston, TX 77204 USA",University of Houston System; University of Houston,"Momen, M (corresponding author), Univ Houston, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Room N134,4726 Calhoun Rd, Houston, TX 77204 USA.",mmomen@uh.edu,"Momen, Mostafa/GQB-0505-2022",,University of Houston,University of Houston,This work was supported by the University of Houston [Startup Funds].,,28,1,1,3,17,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2150-704X,2150-7058,,REMOTE SENS LETT,Remote Sens.

The concurrent adoption of these could lead such hydrofluorocarbon (HFC)-free technologies to become standard even in the South of Europe. Consequently, these solutions have drawn an enormous interest in the Spanish food retail industry as this features very severe regulations with the purpose of substantially mitigating ongoing climate change. In this theoretical work the performance of a state-of-the-art transcritical R744 supermarket refrigerating system, i.e. a solution including medium (MT) and low temperature (LT) overfed evaporators, parallel (or auxiliary) compression and all-in-one (or fully integrated) concept, was exhaustively investigated. This was compared to that of a baseline (i.e. old solution relying on R404A-based units to satisfy the refrigeration loads and a R410A reversible heat pumping unit) and to that of another alternative complying with the environmental legislative acts in force (i.e. solution based on a R134a/R744 cascade arrangement to provide the refrigeration demands and a R1234ze(E) reversible heat pump unit). The study was carried out by considering an average-size food retail store located in the Spanish climate context. The outcomes obtained revealed that the fully integrated R744 refrigeration plant offers total energy conservations between 1% (in Tenerife) and 33% (in Burgos) over conventional separated HFC-based units. In addition, the investigated transcritical R744 system brought the total annual electricity consumption down by at least 39% compared to HFC-based arrangements in heating mode.","[Gullo, Paride; Hafner, Armin] NTNU Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway; [Banasiak, Krzysztof] SINTEF Energy Res, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); SINTEF,"Gullo, P (corresponding author), NTNU Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway.",paride.gullo@ntnu.no; armin.hafner@ntnu.no; krzysztof.Banasiak@sintef.no,"Gullo, Paride/A-8720-2019","Gullo, Paride/0000-0001-9256-875X",,,,,24,0,0,1,1,INT INST REFRIGERATION,PARIS,"177 BLVD MALESHERBES, F-75017 PARIS, FRANCE",0151-1637,,978-2-36215-026-5,REFR SCI T,,,2018,,,,,1034,1041,,10.18462/iir.gl.2018.1357,http://dx.doi.org/10.18462/iir.gl.2018.1357,,,8,"Thermodynamics; Engineering, Mechanical",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Thermodynamics; Engineering,BP0ZI,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000538678300125,View Full Record in Web of Science

The highest consumption of water is devoted to irrigation for agricultural production, and so it is in this area that efforts have to be focused to study possible interventions. Meeting and optimizing the consumption of water for irrigation also means making more resources available for drinking water and industrial use, and maintaining an optimal state of the environment. In this study we show the effectiveness of the combined use of numerical weather predictions and hydrological modelling to forecast soil moisture and crop water requirement in order to optimize irrigation scheduling.

As the climate in this region undergoes substantial changes, it is anticipated that the character of these synoptic features will change. There are a number of different methods used to identify and track cyclones, which can potentially lead to different conclusions as to cyclone variability and trends, and mechanisms which drive these features. Given this, it is timely to assess the level of consensus among 14 state-of-the-art cyclone identification and tracking methods. We undertake this comparison with the ERA-Interim data-set for the period 1979-2008 and find large differences in the number of tracks identified by different methods, but the spatial patterns of the system density broadly agree. Links between large-scale modes of variability, such as the Southern Annular Mode (SAM), and subantarctic cyclones as suggested in the literature are confirmed by our analysis. Trends in the number of cyclone tracks show a more diverse picture. Robust trends are identified by almost all methods for austral summer over the region south to 60 degrees S, mainly due to the strong relation to SAM, whereas in austral winter the methods disagree in the statistical significance of the trends. The agreement among the methods is greater when the comparison is confined to the stronger cyclones. This is confirmed by a moisture flux analysis associated with these strong synoptic systems. Our results indicate that multiple cyclone identification and tracking methods should be used to obtain robust conclusions for trends in cyclone characteristics as well as their relation to the large-scale circulation in the subantarctic region.","[Grieger, Jens] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Meteorol, Berlin, Germany; [Leckebusch, Gregor C.] Univ Birmingham, Sch Geog Earth & Environm Sci, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Raible, Christoph C.] Univ Bern, Climate & Environm Phys, Bern, Switzerland; [Raible, Christoph C.] Univ Bern, Oeschger Ctr Climate Change Res, Bern, Switzerland; [Rudeva, Irina; Simmonds, Ian] Univ Melbourne, Sch Earth Sci, Parkville, Vic, Australia; [Rudeva, Irina] RAS, PP Shirshov Inst Oceanol, Moscow, Russia",Free University of Berlin; University of Birmingham; University of Bern; University of Bern; University of Melbourne; Russian Academy of Sciences; Shirshov Institute of Oceanology,"Grieger, J (corresponding author), Free Univ Berlin, Inst Meteorol, Berlin, Germany.",jens.grieger@met.fu-berlin.de,"Leckebusch, Gregor/ABE-1058-2021; Grieger, Jens/A-1107-2014; Raible, Christoph/M-8309-2016","Leckebusch, Gregor/0000-0001-9242-7682; Grieger, Jens/0000-0003-0985-8479; Rudeva, Irina/0000-0001-9851-8198; Raible, Christoph/0000-0003-0176-0602","Australian Research Council [DP16010997]; Antarctic Science Advisory Committee [4080]; German Federal Ministry for Education and Research [FKZ: 01LP1520A]; EU Marie Curie CI Grant EVE [322208]; Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Forderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung [200020_172745]; Ministry of Education and Science of Russian Federation [14.613.21.0083, RFMEFI61317X0083]","Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Antarctic Science Advisory Committee; German Federal Ministry for Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); EU Marie Curie CI Grant EVE; Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Forderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)); Ministry of Education and Science of Russian Federation(Ministry of Education and Science, Russian Federation)",This work was supported by the Australian Research Council [grant number DP16010997]; Antarctic Science Advisory Committee [grant number 4080]; German Federal Ministry for Education and Research through the research program MiKlip (FKZ: 01LP1520A); EU Marie Curie CI Grant EVE [grant number 322208]; Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Forderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung [grant number 200020_172745] and by courtesy of the contract #14.613.21.0083 (ID RFMEFI61317X0083) with the Ministry of Education and Science of Russian Federation.,,64,36,37,2,9,STOCKHOLM UNIV PRESS,STOCKHOLM,"STOCKHOLM UNIV LIBRARY, UNIVERSITETSVAGEN 14 D, STOCKHOLM, SE-106 91, SWEDEN",,1600-0870,,TELLUS A,Tellus Ser.

The dominant source region of AABW supply to the Australian-Antarctic Basin is the Adelie and George V Land coast, in particular, polynyas formed in the western lee of the Mertz Glacier Tongue (MGT) and the grounded iceberg B9b over the Adelie and the Mertz Depressions, respectively. The calving of the MGT, which occurred on 12-13 February 2010, dramatically changed the environment for producing DSW. Here, we assess its impact using a state-of-the-art ice-ocean model.

Vegetation induces a Love-hate relationship in the development of desiccation cracks due to plant induced suction as well as root reinforcement. The objective of the paper is to provide a state-of-the-art that comprehensively reviews the desiccation process in context of the soil-water-plant interaction together. At first, basic theories of crack initiation and propagation in literature are discussed in the context of unsaturated soil mechanics. Thereafter, influence of vegetation on soil cracking is discussed systematically based on transpiration induced suction, root reinforcement, plantation strategy, root exudate and basic plant traits. Intrusive and non-intrusive measurement approaches of desiccation cracks including lab and field studies are put forward. Various schools of desiccation models have been briefly touched upon. More than 150 studies on desiccation cracks have been tabulated in this review, considering soil types, vegetation cover, drying-wetting cycles, approaches of characterizing cracks, sample size, crack pattern, hydraulic conductivity and water retention. Future scopes involving measurement considerations, usage of geotechnical centrifuge modelling, bio-amendments and plant effects on desiccation cracking have been put forward. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Proxy comparison, especially that between the alkenone-based U-37(K ') and the archaeal tetraether-based TEX86, has been increasingly applied in paleoceanographic studies as a measure to better constrain proxy-derived temperature estimates. In this study, we compile and compare published multiproxy (U-37(K ') and TEX86H) records of glacial cooling measured on the same sediment cores. In spite of the diversity in oceanographic and sedimentation settings spanned by the study sites, we find that the TEX86H-derived mean tropical LGM cooling is approximately twice as strong as that suggested by the U-37(K ') and MARGO estimates. The extent of proxy discrepancy varies with the application of various regional calibrations, but the mean TEX86H-inferred cooling remains stronger than that inferred from U-37(K '). To understand the discrepancy between proxies, we examine the seasonal and water column structure of LGM cooling simulated by state-of-the-art climate models. We find that the dissimilar magnitudes of proxy-derived glacial cooling cannot be fully explained by proxies reflecting temperature of different seasons or different water depths, if the recording season and depth are assumed to stay constant through time. A hypothetical shift in recording season and/or depth between the Holocene and the LGM could in theory cause the proxy discrepancy, but this hypothesis cannot be constrained due to a lack of information on lipid production and export in the water column during the LGM. Alternatively, the systematic proxy discrepancy, which persists across diverse oceanographic settings, may imply that the commonly applied proxy calibrations for reconstructing past temperatures are fundamentally biased. As evidenced by the improved consistency between U-37(K ') and TEX86H-based estimates of LGM cooling after we applied a global subsurface (0-200 m) temperature calibration for TEX86H, it is plausible that the TEX86H signal originates from deeper in the water column than typically assumed for the proxy calibration.

This paper comprehensively discusses the global energy supply and environmental challenges and transitions, and NGHs and their role in the energy supply, carbon cycle, and historical and future climate change, and summarizes the state-of-the-art developments in hydrate-based technologies and NGH exploitation methods and their potential environmental impacts, thereby providing a perspective on the roles of NGHs and their related technologies in the future energy supply and climate change mitigation. In all of these areas, we focus on identifying future CCS challenges and the technological development risk imposed by a natural gas-based global economy and NGH utilization, which should be highlighted in the next several decades.","[Yu, Yi-Song; Liu, Jian-Wu; Li, Xiao-Sen] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Gas Hydrate, Guangzhou Inst Energy Convers, Guangzhou 510640, Peoples R China; [Yu, Yi-Song; Liu, Jian-Wu; Li, Xiao-Sen] Guangdong Prov Key Lab New & Renewable Energy Res, Guangzhou 510640, Peoples R China; [Yu, Yi-Song; Zhang, Xianwei; Lee, Yohan] Colorado Sch Mines, Chem & Biol Engn Dept, Golden, CO 80401 USA; [Yu, Yi-Song; Liu, Jian-Wu; Li, Xiao-Sen] Chinese Acad Sci, Guangzhou Ctr Gas Hydrate Res, Guangzhou 510640, Peoples R China; [Yu, Yi-Song; Liu, Jian-Wu; Li, Xiao-Sen] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Yu, Yi-Song] Chinese Acad Sci, Guangzhou Chem Co Ltd, Guangzhou 510650, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Guangzhou Institute of Energy Conversion, CAS; Colorado School of Mines; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences","Li, XS (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Gas Hydrate, Guangzhou Inst Energy Convers, Guangzhou 510640, Peoples R China.;Li, XS (corresponding author), Guangdong Prov Key Lab New & Renewable Energy Res, Guangzhou 510640, Peoples R China.;Li, XS (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Guangzhou Ctr Gas Hydrate Res, Guangzhou 510640, Peoples R China.;Li, XS (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.",lixs@ms.giec.ac.cn,,"Liu, Jianwu/0000-0001-9009-8571; YU, Yi-Song/0000-0002-4833-2632","National Natural Science Foundation of China [22008237]; Key Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China [51736009]; Key Research Program of Frontier Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) [ZDBS-LY-SLH041]; Guangdong Special Support Program-Local innovation and entrepreneurship team project [2019BT02L278]; Special Project for Marine Economy Development of Guangdong Province [GDME-2018D002]; Fundamental Research & Applied Fundamental Research Major Project of Guangdong Province [2019B030302004, 2020B0301030003]; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province, China [2019A1515012086]; Science and Technology Program of Guangzhou, China [202102020720]; Science and Technology Apparatus Development Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [YZ201619]; Frontier Sciences Key Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [QYZDJ-SSW-JSC033]; International Postdoctoral Exchange Fellowship Program [20190073]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Key Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Key Research Program of Frontier Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS); Guangdong Special Support Program-Local innovation and entrepreneurship team project; Special Project for Marine Economy Development of Guangdong Province; Fundamental Research & Applied Fundamental Research Major Project of Guangdong Province; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province, China(National Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province); Science and Technology Program of Guangzhou, China; Science and Technology Apparatus Development Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences; Frontier Sciences Key Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences; International Postdoctoral Exchange Fellowship Program","The authors acknowledge the funding from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (22008237), the Key Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China (51736009), the Key Research Program of Frontier Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)(ZDBS-LY-SLH041), Guangdong Special Support Program-Local innovation and entrepreneurship team project (2019BT02L278), Special Project for Marine Economy Development of Guangdong Province (GDME-2018D002), Fundamental Research & Applied Fundamental Research Major Project of Guangdong Province (2019B030302004, 2020B0301030003), the Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province, China (2019A1515012086), Science and Technology Program of Guangzhou, China (202102020720), Science and Technology Apparatus Development Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (YZ201619), Frontier Sciences Key Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (QYZDJ-SSW-JSC033), and the International Postdoctoral Exchange Fellowship Program (20190073).",,431,32,32,51,172,ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY,CAMBRIDGE,"THOMAS GRAHAM HOUSE, SCIENCE PARK, MILTON RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 0WF, CAMBS, ENGLAND",1754-5692,1754-5706,,ENERG ENVIRON SCI,Energy Environ.

The study provides the first background data of any kind related to liquid water isotopes in western Newfoundland. More than 130 samples were analysed using a state-of-the-art cavity ring-down spectrometer, the Picarro Liquid Water Isotope Analyzer L2130-i, with a minimal instrumental error. The data suggest seasonal variations in which the delta O-18 varies from -33.4 to -0.03% (+0.023 parts per thousand) and delta H-2 ranges from -253.4 to 15.1%(+0.148 parts per thousand). Our data are compared with modern meteorological data and publicly available delta O-18 and delta H-2 data from greater Atlantic Canada, which suggests that the atmospheric circulation patterns, spatial features and other climate factors are distinct in Corner Brook. Isotopes in meteorological precipitation data referenced and collected in this study reflect the cool, wet climate and air-mass fluctuations unique to the geographical region and thus, this baseline is fundamental to understanding the modern isotope hydrological/climatic studies for this region.","[Marche, Brittany M.; Rashid, Harunur; Parkinson, Don-Roger] Mem Univ Newfoundland, Earth & Environm Sci, Corner Brook, NF, Canada; [Rashid, Harunur] Shanghai Ocean Univ, Coll Marine Sci, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Memorial University Newfoundland; Shanghai Ocean University,"Rashid, H (corresponding author), Mem Univ Newfoundland, Earth & Environm Sci, Corner Brook, NF, Canada.;Rashid, H (corresponding author), Shanghai Ocean Univ, Coll Marine Sci, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",Harunurbhola@gmail.com,,"Rashid, Harunur/0000-0002-7612-3790",Canada Foundation for Innovation and Research; Development Corporation Leverage Fund of the province of Newfoundland and Labrador,Canada Foundation for Innovation and Research(Canada Foundation for Innovation); Development Corporation Leverage Fund of the province of Newfoundland and Labrador,This research was supported by the Canada Foundation for Innovation and Research and the Development Corporation Leverage Fund of the province of Newfoundland and Labrador to HR.,,53,1,1,0,1,GEOLOGICAL SOC PUBLISHING HOUSE,BATH,"UNIT 7, BRASSMILL ENTERPRISE CTR, BRASSMILL LANE, BATH BA1 3JN, AVON, ENGLAND",0305-8719,,978-1-78620-497-4,GEOL SOC SPEC PUBL,Geol.

In Pakistan and many other developing countries, population growth and escalating demands for clean energy, food, and water also impose mounting pressure on agricultural land, necessitating the rapid development of innovative, holistic, and climate-compatible solutions. Here, we use a self-consistent electrical-optical-thermal model to explore the potential of east/west (E/W) vertical bifacial photovoltaic (PV) farms for state-of-the-art agrivoltaic (AV) systems-an innovative production system that enables solar energy generation over crops-an approach that can solve key obstacles in solar energy growth for Pakistan and the world whilst ensuring food-water-climate security. We compare the performance of E/W vertical bifacial PV farms with north/south (N/S) tilted bifacial PV farms for PV energy production and ground irradiance available for crops. We show that optimally designed E/W vertical bifacial PV farms provide spatial homogeneity for crop light. We further explore the effect of soiling on PV energy yield and show that due to their inherent resilience to soiling losses, E/W vertical PV farms could reduce the water budget and could be the potential candidates to be mounted in AV systems particularly in the regions having scarce water supply.

For this purpose, area-averaged surface air temperature (TI) and sea-level pressure (SLP) over Mongolia are defined. Then four large-scale indices, TImdl and SHImdl obtained from PNU CGCM, and TIMLR and SHIMLR obtained from multiple linear regressions on BKI and ESI, are incorporated using the artificial neural network (ANN) method for the prediction and statistical downscaling to obtain the monthly and seasonal 20 x 20-km-resolution aT2m over Mongolia in winter. An additional statistical method, which uses BKI and ESI as predictors of TI and SHI together with dynamic prediction by the CGCM, is used because of the relatively low skill of seasonal predictions by most of the state-of-the-art models and the multi-model ensemble systems over high-latitude landlocked Eurasian regions such as Mongolia. The results show that the predictabilities of monthly and seasonal 20 x 20-km-resolution aT2m over Mongolia in winter are improved by applying ANN to both statistical and dynamical predictions compared to utilizing only dynamic prediction. The predictability gained by the proposed method is also demonstrated by the probabilistic forecast implying that the method forecasts aT2m over Mongolia in winter reasonably well.","[Bayasgalan, Gerelchuluun; Ahn, Joong-Bae] Pusan Natl Univ, Div Earth Environm Syst, Jangjeon 2 Dong, Busan 609735, South Korea",Pusan National University,"Ahn, JB (corresponding author), Pusan Natl Univ, Div Earth Environm Syst, Jangjeon 2 Dong, Busan 609735, South Korea.",jbahn@pusan.ac.kr,,"Gerelchuluun, Bayasgalan/0000-0002-2868-3056",Rural Development Administration [KMI2018-01213]; Korean Meteorological Administration [PJ01229302],"Rural Development Administration(Rural Development Administration (RDA), Republic of Korea); Korean Meteorological Administration(Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA))","Rural Development Administration, Grant/Award Number: KMI2018-01213; Korean Meteorological Administration, Grant/Award Number: PJ01229302",,56,3,3,0,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0899-8418,1097-0088,,INT J CLIMATOL,Int.

Using state-of-the-art airborne in situ measurements and Mie scattering simulations, we demonstrate that low single scattering albedo in well-aged BBA plumes over southern West Africa results from the presence of strongly absorbing refractory black carbon (rBC), whereas the brown carbon contribution to the BBA absorption is negligible. Coatings enhance light absorption by rBC-containing particles by up to 210%. Our results show that accounting for the diversity in black carbon mixing state by combining internal and external configurations is needed to accurately estimate the optical properties and henceforth the shortwave direct radiative effect and heating rate of BBA over southern West Africa. Plain Language Summary Extensive seasonal fires over southern and central Africa result in the transport of massive amounts of biomass burning aerosols over huge areas of the eastern Atlantic Ocean. Recent field observations highlight that biomass burning aerosols transported from the coast of southern Africa to the far north over southern West Africa were characterized by low single scattering albedo. This finding is of paramount interest, because radiative heating within the absorbing aerosol layer is hypothesized to affect the low cloud deck over this specific region and may ultimately influence the large-scale circulation. However, debate remains about the causes of the low single scattering albedo by biomass burning aerosols, causing ambiguous parameterizations of their optical properties in climate models. Here we present simultaneous airborne measurements of the composition and optical properties of biomass burning aerosols transported over southern West Africa. We show that black carbon particles dominated the light absorption by biomass burning aerosols at mid-visible wavelengths. Our findings indicate that the black carbon mixing state plays a significant role in the aerosol optical properties and may be an important modulator to be considered in climate models for simulating direct and semi-direct radiative effects of biomass burning aerosol over southern West Africa.","[Denjean, Cyrielle; Libois, Quentin; Mallet, Marc; Bourrianne, Thierry; Burnet, Frederic] Univ Toulouse, CNRS, Meteo France, CNRM, Toulouse, France; [Brito, Joel; Dupuy, Regis] Univ Clermont Auvergne, LaMP, Clermont Ferrand, France; [Brito, Joel] Univ Lille, IMT Lille Douai, SAGE, Lille, France; [Flamant, Cyrille] Sorbonne Univ, CNRS, LATMOS IPSL, UVSQ, Paris, France; [Knippertz, Peter] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Karlsruhe, Germany",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Meteo France; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Clermont Auvergne (UCA); IMT - Institut Mines-Telecom; IMT Nord Europe; Sage Group; Universite de Lille - ISITE; Universite de Lille; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Universite Paris Cite; Universite Paris Saclay; Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology,"Denjean, C (corresponding author), Univ Toulouse, CNRS, Meteo France, CNRM, Toulouse, France.",cyrielle.denjean@meteo.fr,"Brito, Joel/B-6181-2013; Dupuy, Regis/AAO-7895-2020; Knippertz, Peter/D-5861-2016","Brito, Joel/0000-0002-4420-9442; Dupuy, Regis/0000-0001-5908-0699; Knippertz, Peter/0000-0001-9856-619X",European Union 7th Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) [603502]; European Facility for Airborne Research (EUFAR) through the Transnational Activity project OLACTA; European Facility for Airborne Research (EUFAR) through the Transnational Activity project MICWA; CNES,European Union 7th Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013); European Facility for Airborne Research (EUFAR) through the Transnational Activity project OLACTA; European Facility for Airborne Research (EUFAR) through the Transnational Activity project MICWA; CNES(Centre National D'etudes Spatiales),"The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Union 7th Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) under Grant Agreement no. 603502 (EU project DACCIWA: Dynamics-aerosolchemistry-cloud interactions in West Africa).

In solidly grounded or isolated networks, reliable detection and localization of the fault is already state of the art. Fault direction detection of single-pole faults in compensated networks, especially in overhead line networks, poses challenges for network operators. In many cases, the overhead line indicators used in overhead line networks do not detect the voltage with sufficient accuracy to determine unambiguous fault directions. In this paper, the influence of climate, especially humidity, on a voltage measurement method for overhead line indicators is analyzed. Extensive climate chamber measurements are performed, which form the basis for the development of a simulation model to simulate the influence of humidity. The theoretical model explains the physical influences of humidity on the voltage measurement of overhead line indicators. With this knowledge recommendations for the design of overhead line indicators with lower susceptibility to interference in the presence of moisture may be optimized.","[Burkhardt, Erwin; Zimmer, Bastian; Jenau, Frank] TU Dortmund Univ, Inst High Voltage Engn, Friedrich Wohler Weg 4, Dortmund, Germany",Dortmund University of Technology,"Burkhardt, E (corresponding author), TU Dortmund Univ, Inst High Voltage Engn, Friedrich Wohler Weg 4, Dortmund, Germany.",erwin.burkhardt@tu-dortmund.de; bastian.zimmer@tu-dortmund.de,,,,,,,25,0,0,0,0,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-1-6654-3613-7,,,,2021,,,,,,,,10.1109/EEEIC/ICPSEurope51590.2021.9584701,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/EEEIC/ICPSEurope51590.2021.9584701,,,6,"Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Engineering,BS9UG,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000784128100191,View Full Record in Web of Science

These changes will affect physical infrastructure, water supply, energy provision, transport and industrial production, hence resulting in a variety of ripple effects across different sectors of the city life. In this context, Earth observation (EO) has proven to be an effective tool for supporting decision makers in facing climate change; nevertheless, gaps still exist between the current state-of-the-art and the users' requirements. The FP7 DECUMANUS project aims at bridging this gap also by a direct strong engagement of city users. In particular, DECUMANUS has a principal objective to develop and consolidate a set of sustainable services that allows city managers to incorporate EO-based geo-spatial products and geo-information services in their climate and environmental change strategies to support the sustainable management of the cities in Europe. In this paper, we present three advanced products generated in the framework of the DECUMANUS land monitoring services, namely spatiotemporal urbanization mapping, imperviousness estimation and settlement patterns analysis. In particular, all of them have been generated according with the requirements of the project users' community and will allow supporting their environmental change adaptation strategies at the district level.","[Marconcini, Mattia; Metz, Annekatrin; Zeidler, Julian; Esch, Thomas] German Aerosp Ctr DLR, Wessling, Germany",Helmholtz Association; German Aerospace Centre (DLR),"Marconcini, M (corresponding author), German Aerosp Ctr DLR, Wessling, Germany.",,,,,,,,7,5,5,0,1,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-1-4799-6652-3,,,,2015,,,,,,,,,,,,4,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Remote Sensing",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Remote Sensing,BF1RD,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000380429700045,View Full Record in Web of Science

Such an analysis tool is useful to directly link science objectives (typically expressed via a targeted spatial resolution, temporal resolution, and accuracy) to the expected performance of the observing system architecture. As a proof of concept, we apply STAG analysis to analyze three potential future observing systems for mass change in the Earth system: a single pair of polar orbiting satellites (heritage Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment and Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment Follow-On), two polar pairs of satellites, and a polar pair of satellites coupled with an inclined (70 degrees) pair of satellites. Here, we demonstrate the use of STAG analysis to quantify the relative performance of each architecture across space (200-1,800 km) and time (1-30 days), offering a significantly more comprehensive assessment of performance than previous studies. Results show that the polar pair coupled with the inclined pair reduces errors (after state-of-the-art post-processing for each architecture is accounted for) relative to the single pair of satellites by 40-60% in medium spatial scales (500-1,200 km), with the greatest benefit being for longer solution (monthly) timespans. Overall, the results from this case study highlight the importance of increasing the isotropy of the observable over simply increasing the sampling frequency. Some demonstrated benefits of STAG analysis include the ability to incorporate state-of-the-art post-processing methods into the analysis and also tailor the analysis to specific geographic regions to address targeted scientific objectives.","[Hauk, M.] Tech Univ Munich, Chair Astron & Phys Geodesy, Munich, Germany; [Wiese, D.

Here we investigate this Indian Ocean ITCZ and the mechanisms for its origin. With a weak semiannual cycle, this ITCZ peaks in January-February with the strongest rainfall and southernmost location and a northeast-southwest orientation from the Maritime Continent to Madagascar, reaches a minimum around May with a zonal orientation, grows until its secondary maximum around September with a northwest-southeast orientation, weakens slightly until December, and then regains its mature phase in January. During austral summer, the Indian Ocean ITCZ exists over maximum surface moist static energy (MSE), consistent with convective quasi-equilibrium theory. This relationship breaks up during boreal summer when the surface MSE maximizes in the northern monsoon region. The position and orientation of the Indian Ocean ITCZ can be simulated well in both a linear dynamical model and the state-of-the-art Community Atmosphere Model version 6 (CAM6) when driven by observed sea surface temperature (SST). To quantify the contributions of the planetary boundary layer (PBL) and free-atmosphere processes to this ITCZ, we homogenize the free-atmosphere diabatic heating over the Indian Ocean in CAM6. In response, the ITCZ weakens significantly, owing to a weakened circulation and deep convection. Therefore, in CAM6, the SST drives the Indian Ocean ITCZ directly through PBL processes and indirectly via free-atmosphere diabatic heating. Their contributions are comparable during most seasons, except during the austral summer when the free-atmosphere diabatic heating dominates the mature-phase ITCZ. Significance StatementThe intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) is the globe-encircling band where trade winds converge and strong rainfall occurs in the tropics. Its rains provide life-supporting water to billions of people. Its associated latent heating invigorates the tropical atmospheric circulation and influences climate and weather across the planet. The ITCZ is located north of the equator in most tropical oceans, except in the Indian Ocean where it sits south of the equator year-around. In contrast to the well-known northern ITCZs, the origin of the southern ITCZ in the Indian Ocean remains unknown. This work provides the first explanation for how ocean surface temperature works together with processes in the lower and upper atmosphere to shape the unique ITCZ in the Indian Ocean.","[Zhang, Honghai; Seager, Richard] Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY 10964 USA; [Xie, Shang-Ping] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, San Diego, CA USA",Columbia University; University of California System; University of California San Diego; Scripps Institution of Oceanography,"Zhang, HH (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY 10964 USA.",hhzhang@ldeo.columbia.edu,"Keyes, Dennis/AAZ-9285-2021; Xie, Shang-Ping/C-1254-2009","Xie, Shang-Ping/0000-0002-3676-1325","NSF [AGS 19-34363, 19-34392]",NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This work was supported by the NSF Awards AGS 19-34363 and 19-34392.

These approaches are made more powerful by the inclusion of pangenomes, which represent the entire genome content of a species. Understanding the strengths and limitations of machine learning methods, compared with more traditional genomic selection efforts, is paramount to the successful application of these methods in crop breeding. We describe examples of genomic selection and pangenome-based approaches in crop breeding, discuss machine learning-specific challenges, and highlight the potential for the application of machine learning in genomic selection. We believe that careful implementation of machine learning approaches will support crop improvement to help counter the adverse outcomes of climate change on crop production.","[Edwards, David] Univ Western Australia, Sch Biol Sci, Perth, WA, Australia; Univ Western Australia, Inst Agr, Perth, WA, Australia",University of Western Australia; University of Western Australia,"Edwards, D (corresponding author), Univ Western Australia, Sch Biol Sci, Perth, WA, Australia.",Dave.Edwards@uwa.edu.au,"Edwards, David/H-3710-2015; Batley, Jacqueline/A-5723-2008; Petereit, Jakob/AAY-9428-2021; Bayer, Philipp Emanuel/L-4481-2018","Edwards, David/0000-0001-7599-6760; Batley, Jacqueline/0000-0002-5391-5824; Petereit, Jakob/0000-0003-2159-0380; Bayer, Philipp Emanuel/0000-0001-8530-3067; Anderson, Robyn/0000-0002-4872-3932; Danilevicz, Monica Furaste/0000-0001-7599-8184","Australia Research Council [ProjectsDP1601004497, LP140100537, LP130100925]; Forrest Research Foundation",Australia Research Council(Australian Research Council); Forrest Research Foundation,"This work is funded by the Australia Research Council (ProjectsDP1601004497, LP140100537, and LP130100925).

As state-of-the-art climate models usually require coarse resolutions to keep computational costs to a moderate level, they miss some local features that can be captured by field measurements. The downscaling approach adopted here consists of using a cascade of atmospheric models from large scale to meso-gamma scale. A regional climate model (ModSle Atmosph,rique R,gional) forced by meteorological reanalyses provides a diagnostic physically-based rain- and snowfall downscaling model with meteorological fields at the regional scale. Although the parameterizations invoked by the downscaling model are fairly simple, the knowledge of small-scale topography significantly improves the representation of spatial variability of precipitation and therefore that of the surface mass balance. Model evaluation is carried out with the help of shallow firn cores and snow height measurements provided by automatic weather stations. Although downscaling of blowing snow still needs to be implemented in the model, the net accumulation gradient across Law Dome summit is shown to be induced mostly by orographic effects on precipitation.","[Gallee, Hubert; Agosta, Cecile; Gential, Luc; Favier, Vincent; Krinner, Gerhard] UJF Grenoble 1, CNRS, LGGE, UMR 5183, St Martin Dheres, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA),"Gallee, H (corresponding author), UJF Grenoble 1, CNRS, LGGE, UMR 5183, 54 Rue Moliere,BP 96, St Martin Dheres, France.",gallee@lgge.obs.ujf-grenoble.fr,"Favier, Vincent/T-1936-2017; Agosta, Cécile/B-9625-2013; Krinner, Gerhard/A-6450-2011; Krinner, Gerhard/AAB-8837-2022","Favier, Vincent/0000-0001-6024-9498; Agosta, Cécile/0000-0003-4091-1653; Krinner, Gerhard/0000-0002-2959-5920; Krinner, Gerhard/0000-0002-2959-5920","European Commission [226375, 30]",European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre),"We acknowledge the ice2sea project, funded by the European Commission's 7th Framework Programme through grant number 226375, ice2sea manuscript number 30.

The indicators focus on the frequency and intensity of hot days and nights, and heat waves. Systematic upward trends in maximum (Tmax) and minimum (Tmin) temperatures were found at most of the stations, suggesting ongoing change in the climatology of the upper-tail of the frequency distribution. Taking into the account the observed effects of climate change on the country's climate, hot temperature events were defined using a monthly and decadal, time-sensitive approach. Indicators of event frequency are count data; thus, different Poisson models were used for temporal analysis. Further, a novel method of time-series clustering was introduced to recognize spatiotemporal patterns of WSHTIs. Different patterns were observed over time and space not only across stations but also among WSHTIs. Generally, warming trends were detected in the upper limits for both Tmax and Tmin across the warm season months with a few surprising exceptions, mostly for Tmax. Results suggest that the impact of climate change on hot weather events was more pronounced at night at most of the stations in Saudi Arabia. The overall results suggest that not only local and regional factors, such as elevation, latitude, and distance from a large body of water, but also large-scale factors such as atmospheric circulation patterns are likely responsible for the observed temporal and spatial patterns.","[Alghamdi, Ali S.] King Saud Univ, Coll Art, Dept Geog, POB 2456, Riyadh 11451, Saudi Arabia; [Harrington, John, Jr.] Kansas State Univ, Dept Geog, 1002 Seaton Hall, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA",King Saud University; Kansas State University,"Alghamdi, AS (corresponding author), King Saud Univ, Coll Art, Dept Geog, POB 2456, Riyadh 11451, Saudi Arabia.",aorifi@ksu.edu.sa,"Alghamdi, Ali S./E-5553-2018","Alghamdi, Ali S./0000-0002-9942-8060",King Saud University; Deanship of Scientific Research at King Saud University [TPF-009],King Saud University(King Saud University); Deanship of Scientific Research at King Saud University(King Saud University),"This work is a part of first author's doctoral dissertation research at Kansas State University, where the first author was sponsored by King Saud University.

The 23-element array is located on the Arctic Slope of Alaska, a region of cold continuous permafrost. Most of the monitoring wells are situated on the Arctic coastal plain between the Brooks Range and the Arctic Ocean, while others are in the foothills to the south. The data represent the true temperatures in the wellbores and surrounding rocks at the time of the measurements; they have not been corrected to remove the thermal disturbance caused by drilling the wells. With a few exceptions, the drilling disturbance is estimated to have been on the order of 0.1K or less by 1989. Thus, most of the temperature measurements acquired during the last 25 yr are little affected by the drilling disturbance. The data contribute to ongoing efforts to monitor changes in the thermal state of permafrost in both hemispheres by the Global Terrestrial Network for Permafrost, one of the primary subnetworks of the Global Terrestrial Observing System (GTOS).

We observed a decrease in the yearly emissions during the period 2012 to 2017 with regional differences in the trend. Our results highlight the importance of detailed information on gas composition and the stage of oil and gas separation of the flared gas to reduce uncertainties in the BC emission estimates.","[Bottcher, Kristin; Paunu, Ville-Veikko; Savolahti, Mikko; Karvosenoja, Niko] Finnish Environm Inst SYKE, Latokartanonkaari 11, FI-00790 Helsinki, Finland; [Kupiainen, Kaarle] Minist Environm YM, Aleksanterinkatu 7, FI-00023 Government, Finland; [Zhizhin, Mikhail] Colorado Sch Mines, 1500 Illinois St, Golden, CO 80401 USA; [Matveev, Alexey] Natl Univ Oil & Gas Gubkin Univ, Leninskiy Prospekt 65, Moscow 119296, Russia; [Klimont, Zbigniew] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal IIASA, Schlosspl 1, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria; [Vaatainen, Sampsa; Lamberg, Heikki] Univ Eastern Finland, Dept Environm & Biol Sci, Fine Particle & Aerosol Technol Lab, Yliopistonranta 1, FI-70211 Kuopio, Finland",Finnish Environment Institute; Colorado School of Mines; Gubkin Russian State University of Oil & Gas; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); University of Eastern Finland,"Bottcher, K (corresponding author), Finnish Environm Inst SYKE, Latokartanonkaari 11, FI-00790 Helsinki, Finland.",Kristin.Bottcher@syke.fi; Ville-Veikko.Paunu@syke.fi; Kaarle.Kupiainen@ym.fi; mzhizhin@mines.edu; matveevhwre@gmail.com; Mikko.Savolahti@syke.fi; klimont@iiasa.ac.at; sampsa.vaatainen@uef.fi; heikki.lamberg@uef.fi; Niko.Karvosenoja@syke.fi,"; Klimont, Zbigniew/P-7641-2015","Paunu, Ville-Veikko/0000-0002-3466-4169; Klimont, Zbigniew/0000-0003-2630-198X; Bottcher, Kristin/0000-0002-2181-5976; Karvosenoja, Niko/0000-0002-0603-7571",European Union (EU Action -Black Carbon in the Arctic/EUA-BCA) [PI/2017/392-687]; Academy of Finland (NABCEA) [296644]; Business Finland (BC Footprint) [1462/31/2019]; Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland (IBA -project Black Carbon in the Eurasian Arctic and Significance Compared to Dust Sources) [PC0TQ4BT-25],European Union (EU Action -Black Carbon in the Arctic/EUA-BCA); Academy of Finland (NABCEA)(Academy of Finland); Business Finland (BC Footprint); Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland (IBA -project Black Carbon in the Eurasian Arctic and Significance Compared to Dust Sources),"This work was supported by the European Union (EU Action -Black Carbon in the Arctic/EUA-BCA; PI/2017/392-687); Academy of Finland (NABCEA; 296644), Business Finland (BC Footprint; 1462/31/2019) and by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland (IBA -project Black Carbon in the Eurasian Arctic and Significance Compared to Dust Sources; No. PC0TQ4BT-25).; We are grateful to Brad Conrad and Matthew Johnson (Carleton University, Ottawa, Canada) for providing us with updated information on black carbon emission factors from flaring and advice for the calculation of heating values of associated petroleum gas.

However, climate change is impacting current and future yields, resulting in the need to further accelerate breeding efforts to cope with these changing conditions. Here we present approaches to accelerate plant breeding and incorporate nonadditive effects in genomic selection by applying state-of-the-art machine learning approaches. These approaches are made more powerful by the inclusion of pangenomes, which represent the entire genome content of a species. Understanding the strengths and limitations of machine learning methods, compared with more traditional genomic selection efforts, is paramount to the successful application of these methods in crop breeding. We describe examples of genomic selection and pangenome-based approaches in crop breeding, discuss machine learning-specific challenges, and highlight the potential for the application of machine learning in genomic selection. We believe that careful implementation of machine learning approaches will support crop improvement to help counter the adverse outcomes of climate change on crop production.","[Edwards, David] Univ Western Australia, Sch Biol Sci, Perth, WA, Australia; Univ Western Australia, Inst Agr, Perth, WA, Australia",University of Western Australia; University of Western Australia,"Edwards, D (corresponding author), Univ Western Australia, Sch Biol Sci, Perth, WA, Australia.",Dave.Edwards@uwa.edu.au,"Edwards, David/H-3710-2015; Batley, Jacqueline/A-5723-2008; Petereit, Jakob/AAY-9428-2021; Bayer, Philipp Emanuel/L-4481-2018","Edwards, David/0000-0001-7599-6760; Batley, Jacqueline/0000-0002-5391-5824; Petereit, Jakob/0000-0003-2159-0380; Bayer, Philipp Emanuel/0000-0001-8530-3067; Anderson, Robyn/0000-0002-4872-3932; Danilevicz, Monica Furaste/0000-0001-7599-8184","Australia Research Council [ProjectsDP1601004497, LP140100537, LP130100925]; Forrest Research Foundation",Australia Research Council(Australian Research Council); Forrest Research Foundation,"This work is funded by the Australia Research Council (ProjectsDP1601004497, LP140100537, and LP130100925).

Evaluation of the DSWR spatiotemporal patterns and trends is crucial to the understanding of weather and climate variability. In this study, DSWR is investigated over Brazil between 1980 and 2016 from contemporary state-of-the-art high resolution gridded datasets (observations, reanalyses and merged products). The results show an increase in both annual and seasonal DSWR for all regions of Brazil, with large changes over the northern, west central, and southeastern parts of the country. The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecast (ERA5) reanalysis proves to be an excellent option for investigating DSWR across Brazil, matching the observed climatology trends well. The best results are identified for the northeastern and southeastern regions during the months of March April-May, and the poorest results for the center-west region during September-October-November. Changes in cloud cover (CC) are linked to changes in DSWR. Decadal fluctuations in CC are highly correlated with DSWR trends, with the strongest correlation (r = -0.89) in the southeast region, and weakest correlation (r = -0.37) in the north. We conclude that CC is a primary modulating factor of brightening across Brazil between 1980 and 2016. In a global context, our results agree with observations from other regions over the globe. Our results may indicate changes in the rainy seasons across Brazil, especially in the northeast. Future studies may use these results to further understand the impacts of brightening over Brazil on solar energy production and agriculture.","[Zuluaga, Cristian Felipe; Avila-Diaz, Alvaro; Justino, Flavio B.] Univ Fed Vicosa, Dept Agr Engn, BR-36570900 Vicosa, MG, Brazil; [Wilson, Aaron B.] Ohio State Univ, Byrd Polar & Climate Res Ctr, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Wilson, Aaron B.] Ohio State Univ, OSU Extens Coll Food Agr & Environm Sci, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",Universidade Federal de Vicosa; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Zuluaga, CF (corresponding author), Univ Fed Vicosa, Dept Agr Engn, BR-36570900 Vicosa, MG, Brazil.",cristian.aristizabal@ufv.br,"Zuluaga, Cristian Felipe/AAI-3990-2021; Ávila-Díaz, Álvaro/L-6200-2019","Zuluaga, Cristian Felipe/0000-0001-7580-962X; Ávila-Díaz, Álvaro/0000-0002-0404-4559",Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES),Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES)(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)),"We acknowledge the Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES) for supporting this research.

By utilizing the potentials of textile construction and the integrity of Shape Memory Alloy (SMA), which reduces material weight and operation energy for a dynamic shading system. SMAs are generally suitable for construction applications due to their maintenance free, function through multiple cycles without showing wear, and replacement of complex motor and driving mechanism. The design system is developed to be driven by changes in the environment, that allows autonomous and adaptive reactions to external stimuli like ambient heat or solar radiation. Because SMAs are designed for the accuracy and standards of mechanical engineering rather than for architectural facade applications, ADAPTEX closes the inherent gaps established in systems engineering by integrating SMA wire into large scale architectural surfaces by integrated SMA into light weight material as textile. The potential of a larger scale of ADAPTEX will be explored in the continuation project ADAPTEX KLIMA+ in Muscat, Oman, which also allows the autarkic operation of ADAPTEX to be tested under ambient condition. This article discusses the development process of implementing and exchanging between digital analysis and physical prototype. This includes the process of analyzing the local climate, deeper understanding of SMA performance for a specific project site, and finally the execution of these data into full scale facade prototype and its monitoring plan for cross validations.","[Denz, Paul-Rouven; Suwannapruk, Natchai; Vongsingha, Puttakhun] Priedemann Fassadenberatung GmbH, Wall 17, D-14979 Berlin, Germany; [Waldhor, Ebba Fransen; Schneider, Maxie; Sauer, Christiane] Weissensee Acad Art Berlin, Buhringstr 20, D-13086 Berlin, Germany",,"Denz, PR (corresponding author), Priedemann Fassadenberatung GmbH, Wall 17, D-14979 Berlin, Germany.",paul.denz@priedemann.net,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",,,978-3-031-13249-0; 978-3-031-13248-3,,,,2023,,,,,237,248,,10.1007/978-3-031-13249-0_20,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-13249-0_20,,,12,Architecture; Construction & Building Technology; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Architecture; Construction & Building Technology; Science & Technology - Other Topics,BU0KR,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000870223800020,View Full Record in Web of Science

This challenge motivates the development of a framework for incorporating concerns with a wide range of ecosystem services in multiple criteria management planning contexts. Thus, the paper focused on both the analysis of the current state-of-the art research in forest management planning and the development of a conceptual framework to accommodate various components in a forest management process. On the basis of a thorough recent classification of forest management planning problems and the state-of-the-art research, we defined the key dimensions of the framework and the process. The emphasis was on helping to identify how concerns with a wide range of ecosystem services may be analyzed and better understood by forest ecosystem management planning. This research discusses the potential of contemporary management planning approaches to address multiple forest ecosystem services. It highlights the need for a multi-level perspective and appropriate spatial resolution to integrate multiple ecosystem services. It discusses the importance of methods and tools that may help support stakeholders' involvement and public participation in hierarchical planning processes.

This model calculates mass and energy balances and the levelized cost of synthetic natural gas (SNG). It consists of interconnected modules for harvesting, biomass transportation, biogasification, gas processing, energy balance, global climate change, and economics. The conversion module incorporates bioconversion technology recently developed at pilot scale at Cornell University and Walt Disney World. In large-scale biomass biogasification, in any climate at any reactor temperature, process heat needs are small and could be reduced to zero if metabolic heat production is included. Therefore, thermophilic digestion should be preferred to mesophilic, to the extent that the former results in higher reaction rates. Preliminary sensitivity analyses were conducted. Economies of scale are described. Increases in biomass productivity yield diminishing returns above 45-55 Mg/ha year (20-25 dry tons/ac). Distribution of fields around the conversion facility is unimportant as long as at least thirty percent of the surrounding area is planted in energy crops. Improvements in methane yield result in continuing returns, confirming the importance of this parameter. Only a minor penalty is incurred for overdesigning the retention time up to fifty percent; such overdesign would greatly enhance reliability.

Modeling cities as ecosystems has been initiated by a wide range of scientists as a key to addressing challenging problems concomitant with urbanization. In this paper, 'urban ecosystem modeling (UEM)' is defined in an inter-disciplinary context to acquire a broad perception of urban ecological properties and their interactions with global change. Furthermore, state-of-the-art models of urban ecosystems are reviewed, categorized as top-down models (including materials/energy-oriented models and structure-oriented models), bottom-up models (including land use-oriented models and infrastructure-oriented models), or hybrid models thereof.

(2011),ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS,,,English,Editorial Material,,,,,,,,"In a recent paper Hu et al. (2011) suggest that the recovery of stratospheric ozone during the first half of this century will significantly enhance free tropospheric and surface warming caused by the anthropogenic increase of greenhouse gases, with the effects being most pronounced in Northern Hemisphere middle and high latitudes. These surprising results are based on a multi-model analysis of CMIP3 model simulations with and without prescribed stratospheric ozone recovery. Hu et al. suggest that in order to properly quantify the tropospheric and surface temperature response to stratospheric ozone recovery, it is necessary to run coupled atmosphere-ocean climate models with stratospheric ozone chemistry. The results of such an experiment are presented here, using a state-of-the-art chemistry-climate model coupled to a three-dimensional ocean model. In contrast to Hu et al., we find a much smaller Northern Hemisphere tropospheric temperature response to ozone recovery, which is of opposite sign. We suggest that their result is an artifact of the incomplete removal of the large effect of greenhouse gas warming between the two different sets of models.","[McLandress, C.; Shepherd, T.

Whilst broad literature on sustainability has expanded significantly over the past decades, academic literature developing sustainability as a distinct science has received little attention. After more than two decades of sustainability research, the time has come for us to begin asking reflective questions about what sort of science we call sustainability science. How has the broader research on sustainability contributed to developing sustainability science as a unique discipline within the past two decades? How has the label science promoted or hindered the interdisciplinary project of integrating the natural and social sciences as well as arts and humanities in addressing human nature problems? I argue in this review paper that special efforts need to be made towards the building and positioning of sustainability as an umbrella science for global sustainability research. The benefits of the new sustainability science advocated for in this paper are that; a) it offers a universal definition of sustainability that accounts for both the needs of life and the capacity of planetary life support systems to provide for those needs and b) proposes ways of bridging gaps among different research traditions, facilitating cross disciplinary communication and addressing the challenge of multiple meanings and definitions of concepts facing sustainability research today.","[Shahadu, Hardi] Univ Saskatchewan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, Coll Grad Studies, 117 Sci Pl, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5C8, Canada",University of Saskatchewan,"Shahadu, H (corresponding author), Univ Saskatchewan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, Coll Grad Studies, 117 Sci Pl, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5C8, Canada.",hardi.shahadu@usask.ca,,,SSHRC,SSHRC(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"I would like to express my sincere thanks and appreciation to my supervisors, Drs Maureen Reed and Toddi Steelman, and Dr Brian Walker, for their comments on early drafts of this work.

These networks are exposed to a variety of natural hazards, which cause disruptions that can propagate to other network components, resulting in wider supply chain losses. However, the risks of such indirect network disruptions, or systemic risks, are often not considered in risk analyses of ports. We propose a systemic risk framework for different networks interconnected through ports, and describe the state-of-the-art risk modelling approaches to quantify systemic risks. In addition, we present a port risk layering framework that can help identify how resilience against systemic risks can be improved. As climate change will likely increase the occurrence of natural hazards to ports and transport networks, efforts to enhance system-wide resilience should be considered, alongside port adaptation, to prevent exacerbation of supply chain losses in the future.","[Verschuur, Jasper; Pant, Raghav; Koks, Elco; Hall, Jim] Univ Oxford, Environm Change Inst, Oxford OX1 3QY, England; [Koks, Elco] Free Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies, Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Oxford; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Verschuur, J (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Environm Change Inst, Oxford OX1 3QY, England.",jasper.verschuur@keble.ox.ac.uk,"Koks, Elco/ABE-7946-2020","Koks, Elco/0000-0002-4953-4527",,,,,88,2,2,22,56,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,BASINGSTOKE,"BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND",1479-2931,1479-294X,,MARIT ECON LOGIST,Marit.

The present study aimed to test conclusions resulting from single taxon studies in a multispecies comparative framework: (1) how influential are river basins in the genetic structure of freshwater species; (2) are there biogeographic frontiers between groups of basins; and (3) could deep intraspecific lineages be explained by a single event? New and existing data from 33 freshwater species (23 fishes and 10 crustaceans) were combined, and both standard single-species analyses (haplotype networks, genetic distances, phi(ST)) and multispecies methods (hierarchical ABC) were carried out for 1814 sequences from eight basins. More than half of the species displayed a high phylogeographic structure and contained at least two distinct lineages. Almost all of the lineage divergences displayed an element of north/south geographic breaks, with the most influential boundary being between the Mary and Brisbane rivers. Of the 11 basin-pair multispecies coalescent analyses, four implied a single divergence as being most likely. A regional analysis of deep lineages within 16 taxon-pairs resulted in a strongly supported inference of a single divergence, probably dating to the Pleistocene. Basin boundaries are a key determinant of phylogeographic patterns for most of these freshwater species, although the specific biogeographic relationship between basins often varies depending on the species. There are a number of influential biogeographic frontiers, with the Brisbane-Mary being the most important. The finding that a single event may be responsible for multiple deep lineages across the region implies that a highly influential climate change event may have been detected.

Several other paintings could be attributed to him either on stylistic grounds or by recognising the characteristic signature. The paintings presented here show that he proved to be what was known in the seventeenth century as 'dozijnschilder' (lit: dozen painter), assembling his works by imitating, borrowing and copying from examples by other artists, notably Haarlem painters such as Pieter van Laer, Philips Wouwerman and Nicolaes Pietersz. Berchem. This proved to be a typical feature of the artistic climate in the 1670s in Antwerp when economic recession forced many artists to produce paintings and copies by the dozen for art-dealers such as Guillaume Forchondt and Bartholomeus Floquet who then exported these paintings to France, Austria, Spain and Portugal.",,,,,,,,,,,24,0,0,0,2,NETHERLANDS INST ART HISTORY,THE HAGUE,"PRINS WILLEM ALEXANDERHOF 5, POSTBUS 90418, 2509 LK S THE HAGUE, NETHERLANDS",0030-672X,,,OUD HOLLAND,Oud Holl.,,2005,4-Mar,,,,203,212,,10.1163/187501705X00349,http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/187501705X00349,,,10,Art,Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;HCI),Art,000AR,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000234433800004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Foundational to identification of reference areas was a soil map of particle size in the control section (PSCS), a theme in US Soil Taxonomy. A 30-m resolution PSCS map of the Colorado Plateau (366,000 km(2)) was created by interpolating similar to 5000 field soil observations using a random forest model and a suite of raster environmental spatial layers representing topography, climate, general ecological community, and satellite imagery ratios. The PSCS map had overall out of bag accuracy of 61.8% (Kappa of 0.54, p < 0.0001), and an independent validation accuracy of 93.2% at a set of 356 field plots along the southern edge of Canyonlands National Park, Utah. The ART process was also tested at these plots, and matched plots with the same ecological sites (ESs) 67% of the time where sites fell within 2-km buffers of each other. These results show that the PSCS and ART have strong application for ecological monitoring and sampling design, as well as assessing impacts of disturbance and land management action using an ecological potential framework.

The Climate-KIC project Europe-wide Use of Energy from aquifers - E-USE(aq) - aimed to pave the way for Europe-wide application of ATES, through the realization andmonitoring of six ATES pilot plants across five different EU countries. In a preceding paper, based on preliminary results of E-USE(aq), conclusions were already drawn, demonstrating how the barriers for this form of shallow geothermal energy can be overcome, and sometimes even leveraged as opportunities. Based on final pilot project results, key economic and environmental outcomes are now presented. This paper startswith the analysis of specific technological barriers: unfamiliarity with the subsurface, presumed limited compatibilitywith existing energy provision systems (especially district heating), energy imbalances and groundwater contamination. The paper then shows how these barriers have been tackled, using improved site investigation and monitoring technologies to map heterogeneous subsoils. In this way ATES can cost-efficiently be included in smart grids and combined with other sources of renewable (especially solar) energy, while at the same timeachieving groundwater remediation.

Although CO2 emissions have been on the global agenda for several decades, progress has been extremely slow, insufficient and sporadic. Anthropogenic CO2 emissions are the direct result of our addiction to fossil fuels, and in 2018 accounted for 68% (or, 37.5 GtCO(2)) out of the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of 55.3 GtCO(2e) globally. Capturing CO2 at such massive quantities would require resources and technologies that can operate cost-effectively at the multigigaton scale, which we currently lack. Moreover, CO2 capture is an expensive and highly energy intensive process complicated further by logistics and the diversity of the emission sources that vary by volume, composition, location, type, and industry or sector. At the same time, however, such diversity also highlights that one size does not fit all, and hence, dictates the need for a multi-prong strategy that emphasizes the necessity to develop wide range of CCS technologies, materials and processes. This article presents a global overview and impartial assessment of the current state of CCS challenges in an extensive manner covered under the main headings of pre- and post-combustion CO2 capture, direct air capture, CO2 transport and storage and utilization, and carbon pricing. Materials aspects of post-combustion CO2 capture technologies are reviewed in detail. The article provides critical discussions of fundamental phenomena and recent advances in the field, as well as tutorial-type background information, where appropriate. The article reviews the status of global CO2 emissions as well as carbon sources and sinks, and examines a broad range of major technologies, methodologies, processes, and materials for CO2 capture, discusses technology options for carbon capture from fossil fuel-based power generation, presents the challenges to storage, utilization and the global pricing of CO2, and finishes with an assessment of knowledge gaps, mitigation options and opportunities for advances. The article emphasizes the fact that there are no easy fixes or cheap technological solutions to the interconnected problems of energy, CO2 emissions and climate change. The threats to Earth's ecosystems are too real and imminent to be judged and driven only by economics. In this existential context, the choice between 'pay now' or 'pay later' is clear and paying later will be much more expensive. The world must act now.","[Gur, Turgut M.] Stanford Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Stanford University,"Gur, TM (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",turgut.gur@stanford.edu,,,Stanford University,Stanford University(Stanford University),"The author gratefully acknowledges partial support from the Stanford Energy 3.0 program, and helpful discussions with Prof. F.

We propose Sailfish, an unsupervised change point detection framework based on the Gaussian process for time series data. In comparison with existing CPD designs, Sailfish has two novel features: 1) using the deep Gaussian process as a hidden variable transformer and 2) integrating the Gaussian process into a bi-LSTM cell for capturing past and future embedded feature trends. Our extensive experiments show that the Sailfish significantly outperforms five state-of-the-art CPD methods with a faster speed and higher accuracy on three public real-time-series datasets. Especially on the large volume of datasets, Sailfish can achieve up to a 60% reduction in training time and 13% F1-score improvement with little overhead compared to the state-of-the-arts.","[Du, Haizhou; Zheng, Yang] Shanghai Univ Elect Power, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Shanghai University of Electric Power,"Du, HZ (corresponding author), Shanghai Univ Elect Power, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",duhahaizhou@shiep.edu.cn,,,,,,,22,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",0302-9743,1611-3349,978-3-031-15934-3; 978-3-031-15933-6,LECT NOTES COMPUT SC,,,2022,,,,,740,751,,10.1007/978-3-031-15934-3_61,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-15934-3_61,,,12,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BT9ZS,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000866212600060,View Full Record in Web of Science

The major parameter for measuring the thermal energy of oceans is the sea surface temperature (SST). SST prediction plays an essential role in climatology and ocean-related studies. However, SST prediction is challenging due to the involvement of complex and nonlinear sea thermodynamic factors. To address this challenge, we design a novel ensemble of two stacked deep neural networks (DNNs) that uses air temperature, in addition to water temperature, to improve the SST prediction accuracy. To train our model and compare its accuracy with the state-of-the-art, we employ two well-known datasets from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration as well as the international Argo project. Using DNNs, our proposed method is capable of automatically extracting required features from the input time series and utilizing them internally to provide a highly accurate SST prediction that outperforms state-of-the-art models.","[Jahanbakht, Mohammad; Azghadi, Mostafa Rahimi] James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Xiang, Wei] La Trobe Univ, Sch Engn & Math Sci, Melbourne, Vic 3086, Australia",James Cook University; La Trobe University,"Azghadi, MR (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.;Xiang, W (corresponding author), La Trobe Univ, Sch Engn & Math Sci, Melbourne, Vic 3086, Australia.",mohammad.jahanbakht@my.jcu.edu.au; w.xiang@latrobe.edu.au; mostafa.rahimiazghadi@jcu.edu.au,"Azghadi, Mostafa Rahimi/P-9944-2016","Azghadi, Mostafa Rahimi/0000-0001-7975-3985; Xiang, Wei/0000-0002-0608-065X",Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship,"Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship(Australian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and Science)",This work was supported by the Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship.,,16,6,6,5,15,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",1545-598X,1558-0571,,IEEE GEOSCI REMOTE S,IEEE Geosci.

EMs typically use the basic reproduction number (R-0), a threshold quantity, to indicate risk. To provide an overall view of the risk, these model outputs can be transformed into spatial risk maps, using various aggregation methods (e.g. average R-0 over time, cumulative number of days with R-0 > 1). However, there is no standardized methodology available for this. Depending on the specific aggregation methods used, the yielded spatial risk maps may have considerably different interpretations. Additionally, the method used to visualize the aggregated data also affects the perceived spatial patterns. In this review, we compare commonly used aggregation and visualization methods and discuss the respective interpretation of risk maps. Research publications using epidemiological modelling methods were drawn from Web of Science. Only publications containing maps of R-0 transformed from EMs were considered for the analysis. An example EM was applied to illustrate how aggregation and visualization methods affect the final presentations of risk maps. Risk maps can be generated to show duration, intensity and spatio-temporal dynamics of potential outbreak risk of VBDs. We show that 1) different temporal aggregation methods lead to different interpretations; 2) similar spatial patterns do not necessarily bear the same meaning; 3) visualization methods considerably affect how results are perceived, and thus should be applied with caution. We recommend mapping both intensity and duration of the VBD outbreak risk, using small time-steps to show spatio-temporal dynamics when possible.","[Cheng, Yanchao; Tjaden, Nils Benjamin; Jaeschke, Anja; Thomas, Stephanie Margarete; Beierkuhnlein, Carl] Univ Bayreuth, Dept Biogeog, Univ Str 30, D-95447 Bayreuth, Germany; [Thomas, Stephanie Margarete; Beierkuhnlein, Carl] Bayreuth Ctr Ecol & Environm Res, BayCEER, Bayreuth, Germany",University of Bayreuth; University of Bayreuth,"Cheng, YC (corresponding author), Univ Bayreuth, Dept Biogeog, Univ Str 30, D-95447 Bayreuth, Germany.",yanchao1.cheng@uni-bayreuth.de,"Beierkuhnlein, Carl/ABF-8797-2021; Tjaden, Nils/AFT-8631-2022; Beierkuhnlein, Carl/ABF-9693-2021","Tjaden, Nils/0000-0002-7685-1659; Beierkuhnlein, Carl/0000-0002-6456-4628",China Scholarship Council [201506040059]; Bavarian State Ministry of the Environment and Consumer Protection; Bavarian State Ministry of Health and Care through the BayVirMos project [TKP 01KPB-73560]; German Research Foundation (DFG); University of Bayreuth,China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council); Bavarian State Ministry of the Environment and Consumer Protection; Bavarian State Ministry of Health and Care through the BayVirMos project; German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); University of Bayreuth,"Yanchao Cheng was funded by China Scholarship Council, No. 201506040059.

The assessment, developed by the Water Futures and Solutions (WFaS) initiative, uses the latest set of global climate change and socioeconomic scenarios and state-of-the-art global hydrological models. In Asia, water demand for irrigation, industry, and households is projected to increase substantially in the coming decades (30-40% by 2050 compared to 2010). These changes are expected to exacerbate water stress, especially in the current hotspots such as north India and Pakistan, and north China. By 2050, 20% of the land area in the Asia-Pacific region, with a population of 1.6-2 billion, is projected to experience severe water stress. We find that socioeconomic changes are the main drivers of worsening water scarcity in Asia, with climate change impacts further increasing the challenge into the 21st century. Moreover, a detailed basin-level analysis of the hydro-economic conditions of 40 Asian basins shows that although the coping capacity of all basins is expected to improve due to gross domestic product (GDP) growth, some basins continuously face severe water challenges. These basins will potentially be home to up to 1.6 billion people by mid-21st century. Plain Language Summary Home to almost 4.5 billion people, Asia has experienced unprecedented economic and population growth in recent decades. In order to sustain growing food demand and increasing standard of living, water use has been increasing rapidly in many parts of Asia. At present, water withdrawals in Asia represent 65% of the global total. This huge abstraction of water resources has resulted in many Asian regions undergoing pervasive water scarcity conditions. The imminent global changes from climate change and socioeconomic development in Asia are expected to place additional pressures on water resources in the coming decades. In such a context, it is imperative to evaluate future water scarcity conditions and identify regions at highest risk in Asia. We found that by 2050, 20% of the land area in Asia, with population exceeding 1.6-2.0 billion, is projected to experience severe water scarcity. Here, we for the first time highlight that socioeconomic changes are the main driver of worsening water scarcity in Asia, much larger than the climate change impacts.","[Satoh, Yusuke; Kahil, Taher; Byers, Edward; Burek, Peter; Fischer, Gunther; Tramberend, Sylvia; Greve, Peter; Magnuszewski, Piotr; Nava, Luzma Fabiola; Cosgrove, William; Langan, Simon; Wada, Yoshihide] IIASA, Laxenburg, Austria; [Florke, Martina] Univ Kassel, CESR, Kassel, Germany; [Eisner, Stephanie] Norwegian Inst Bioecon Res, As, Norway; [Hanasaki, Naota] Natl Inst Environm Studies, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Wada, Yoshihide] Univ Utrecht, Dept Phys Geog, Utrecht, Netherlands",International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); Universitat Kassel; Norwegian Institute of Bioeconomy Research; National Institute for Environmental Studies - Japan; Utrecht University,"Wada, Y (corresponding author), IIASA, Laxenburg, Austria.;Wada, Y (corresponding author), Univ Utrecht, Dept Phys Geog, Utrecht, Netherlands.",wada@iiasa.ac.at,"Byers, Edward A/O-3229-2019; Greve, Peter/AAD-4377-2019; Burek, Peter/ABF-4741-2020; Burek, Peter/HCH-8080-2022; Nava, Luzma Fabiola/I-1565-2019; Greve, Peter/K-5311-2015; Hanasaki, Naota/C-2932-2009; Floerke, Martina/ABE-6288-2020; Wada, Yoshihide/F-3595-2012","Byers, Edward A/0000-0003-0349-5742; Greve, Peter/0000-0002-9454-0125; Burek, Peter/0000-0001-6390-8487; Burek, Peter/0000-0001-6390-8487; Nava, Luzma Fabiola/0000-0003-4047-6006; Greve, Peter/0000-0002-9454-0125; Hanasaki, Naota/0000-0002-5092-7563; Wada, Yoshihide/0000-0003-4770-2539; Eisner, Stephanie/0000-0002-0157-1636; Langan, Simon/0000-0003-0742-3658; Kahil, Taher/0000-0002-7812-5271; Magnuszewski, Piotr/0000-0003-1211-0672",government of Norway; Asian Development Bank (ADB); Austrian Development Agency (ADA); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) Oversea Research Fellowship [JSPS-2014-878],"government of Norway; Asian Development Bank (ADB); Austrian Development Agency (ADA); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) Oversea Research Fellowship(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science)","The Water Futures and Solutions Initiative (WFaS) was launched by IIASA, UNESCO/UN-Water, the World Water Council (WWC), the International Water Association (IWA), and the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport (MOLIT) of the Republic of Korea, and has been supported by the government of Norway, the Asian Development Bank (ADB), and the Austrian Development Agency (ADA).

The maximum biodiesel yield of 83% was obtained by base catalyzed transesterification process under optimum operating conditions of methanol to oil ratio of 15:1, reaction temperature of 150 degrees C, reaction time of 5 h and catalyst loading of 3.5%. The synthesized catalyst and biodiesel were characterized for their structural features and chemical compositions using various state-of-the-art techniques, including x-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance (H-1, C-13) and gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy. The fuel properties of the biodiesel were estimated including kinematic viscosity (4.36 cSt), density (0.8312 kg/ L), flash point (72 degrees C), acid value (0.172 mgKOH/g) and sulphur content (0.0002 wt.%). These properties were compared and found in good agreement with the International Biodiesel Standards of American (ASTM-951, 6751), European Committee (EN-14214) and China GB/T 20828 (2007). The catalyst was re-used in five consecutive transesterification reactions without losing much catalytic efficiency. Overall, non-edible Raphnus raphanistrum L.. seed oil and Cu doped MMT clay catalyst appeared to be highly active, stable, and cheap contenders for future biofuel industry.

The scope of the project was to improve the procedure used to measure volatile organic compounds (VOC) emitted from building materials and products in small test chambers. The interlaboratory comparison included the CC-MS determination of 5 target compounds from carpet, 8 from polyvinyl chloride (PVC) cushion vinyl and 2 from paint; for the first time, chamber recovery (sinks), homogeneity of solid materials and possible contamination during transport were tested. The results show that the intralaboratory variance (random errors) is much smaller than the interlaboratory variance (systematic errors). Causes of the largest interlaboratory discrepancies were: (i) analytical errors; (ii) losses of the heaviest compounds due to sorption on the chamber walls; and (iii) non homogeneity of the materials. The output of this work concerns both the objective of labelling materials with regard to their VOC emissions and the pre-standard drafted by the European Commitee for Standardization (CEN) for this type of determination.","Commiss European Communities, Joint Res Ctr, Inst Environm, Ispra, Italy; Ctr Sci & Tech Batiment, Marne La Vallee, France",European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site; Italian Institute for Environmental Protection & Research (ISPRA),"Kephalopoulos, S (corresponding author), Commiss European Communities, Joint Res Ctr, Inst Environm, Ispra, Italy.",,,,,,,,11,43,43,0,19,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0905-6947,,,INDOOR AIR,Indoor Air-Int.

This promise, however, is tempered by a relatively primitive understanding of the complex systems supporting ES, which as a result are often quantified as static resources rather than as the dynamic expression of human-natural systems. This article attempts to pinpoint the minimum level of detail that ES science needs to achieve in order to usefully inform the debate on environmental securities, and discusses both the state of the art and recent methodological developments in ES in this light. We briefly review the field of ES accounting methods and list some desiderata that we deem necessary, reachable and relevant to address environmental securities through an improved science of ES. We then discuss a methodological innovation that, while only addressing these needs partially, can improve our understanding of ES dynamics in data-scarce situations. The methodology is illustrated and discussed through an application related to water security in the semi-arid landscape of the Great Ruaha river of Tanzania.","[Villa, Ferdinando] Basque Fdn Sci, IKERBASQUE, Basque Ctr Climate Change BC3, Bilbao 48008, Spain; [Voigt, Brian; Erickson, Jon D.] Univ Vermont, Rubenstein Sch Environm & Nat Resources, Gund Inst Ecol Econ, Burlington, VT 05405 USA",Basque Centre for Climate Change (BC3); Basque Foundation for Science; University of Vermont,"Villa, F (corresponding author), Basque Fdn Sci, IKERBASQUE, Basque Ctr Climate Change BC3, Bilbao 48008, Spain.",ferdinando.villa@bc3research.org,"Azkarate, Ainhoa/K-9087-2013","Azkarate, Ainhoa/0000-0003-0471-3094; Erickson, Jon D./0000-0002-2235-7428; Villa, Ferdinando/0000-0002-5114-3007","US National Science Foundation; ASSETS project; ESPA/NERC [NE-J002267-1]; Livestock-Climate Change Collaborative Research Support Program; US Agency for International Development [EEM-A-00-10-00001]; Fulbright Fellowship; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/L001195/1, NE/J000957/1] Funding Source: researchfish; NERC [NE/J000957/1, NE/L001195/1] Funding Source: UKRI",US National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); ASSETS project; ESPA/NERC; Livestock-Climate Change Collaborative Research Support Program; US Agency for International Development(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); Fulbright Fellowship; Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),The development of ARIES was originally supported by the US National Science Foundation.

In particular, we focus on a region characterized by sharp contrasts in topography, climate, and ecology (Barrancas-Buta Ranquil Locality, Neuquen Province, Argentina). We begin by analyzing the biogeographic structure of the landscape, presenting a GIS-based model of seasonally available resources. Our approach combines systematic surface survey with the analysis of evidence produced by other sampling strategies, such as excavation and rock art analysis. Based on the spatial distribution of lithic and ceramic artifacts and rock art motifs, we characterize patterns of occupational intensity, functional diversity, and information flow in areas with different biogeographic properties. The results suggest a functional delimitation of space, which operates in an averaged temporal scale, where the areas of intermediate altitude would have been used as central places from where the use of other areas was articulated. Because our sampling unit captures biogeographic variation that is widely expressed, this model of spatial organization would be useful for the archaeology of northwestern Patagonia at large.","[Rughini, Agustina A.; Frigole, Cecilia; Llano, Carina; Barberena, Ramiro] Univ Nacl Cuyo, CONICET, Inst Interdisciplinario Ciencias Basicas IC, Lab Paleoecol Humana, Mendoza, Argentina; [Romero Villanueva, Guadalupe] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Inst Nacl Antropol & Pensamiento Latinoamer, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Lucero, Gustavo] Univ Catolica Temuco, Fac Ciencias Sociales & Humanidades, Dept Antropol, Temuco, Chile; [Cardillo, Marcelo; Borrazzo, Karen] Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Filosofia & Letras, CONICET, Inst Multidisciplinario Hist & Ciencias Humanas, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Fernandez, M.

Laser output has been studied with variation of the active compound (CuBr) pressure in the range from 0.1 up to 0.6 torr for gas discharge tubes of different volumes. The optimal additive pressure has been shown to linearly depend on a voltage across gas discharge tube at high pressure of the buffer gas. The optimal density of copper bromide decreases while pulse repetition rate increases up to 100 kHz.

Fluctuation in radiocarbon date distribution is compared with summed probability distribution of calibrated dates as well as total numbers of settlements and dwellings arranged in chronological order. Results indicate the appearance of Neolithic and Bronze Age settlements in the early sixth and the late fourth millennium BC each followed by a rapid growth of population with a peak around 5500 and 3000 cal BP. Population decline is identified from 5300, 4900, 4500 cal BP during the Neolithic and 2800 and 2400 cal BP during the Bronze Age. The period between 4500 and 3500 cal BP corresponds with the lowest density of settlements and dwellings. Agricultural villages collapsed 2400-2000 cal BP. The paper suggests the hypothesis that climate change, especially cold or dry climate induced by weak Asian monsoon events, is possibly responsible for the fluctuation of settlements and population in prehistoric Korea.

Since 1998, the European Journal of Innovation Management (EJIM) has been a leading forum dedicated to thought leadership and research on the advances in innovation management. Given that EJIM has run over two decades, the time is now opportune to reflect on the journal's contributions to innovation management. Thus, this paper aims to retrospectively review the productivity, impact and knowledge of innovation management research in EJIM. Design/methodology/approach This paper adopts a bibliometric methodology to engage in a retrospective review of EJIM. The bibliographic data of 757 papers published in EJIM from 1998 to 2021 were retrieved from Scopus and analyzed using performance analysis and science mapping techniques. Findings The productivity (publication) and impact (citation) of innovation management research curated by EJIM have grown prolifically over time. Though EJIM operates with a European title, the journal receives and publishes contributions worldwide (e.g. Asia, Europe, North America, South America and Oceania). Noteworthily, the knowledge of innovation management research in EJIM can be divided into four categories: basic themes (general), which comprise innovation, open innovation, new product development and product and process innovation; motor themes (well-developed), which consist of organizational culture and innovation and leadership and creativity; niche themes (very specialized), which include dynamic capabilities and business model innovation; and emerging or declining themes (weakly developed or marginalized), which is made up of research and development (R&D) and green innovation.

However, gaps exist between what information providers understand as useful information and what users recognise as usable WIS, leading to under-utilisation of WIS in the farming sector and other domains. Drawing mainly on qualitative research methods, our study examined farmers' perceptions about the usability of existing WIS for farming, focusing on the Ada East District in the Greater Accra Region in Ghana. We developed five information design and delivery criteria: local embeddedness, legitimacy, spatial and temporal resolution, predictive skill, and accessibility. The findings show that smallholder farmers access ten different WIS in the study district. However, the extent to which each WIS was used varied, given that the farmer-to-farmer and the private weather forecasters' information were more used than the other available services. The usability of the existing WIS provided for farming was either enhanced or obstructed by various factors, including the origin of the information, information providers' level of interaction with farmers, continuity in the delivery of information, respect for local values, accessible level, and mode of payment, among others. Some of the information design and delivery criteria and factors affecting WIS usability had trade-offs or complementarities, which is inevitable. In conclusion, we propose that the information providers find a balance between these factors to meet farmers' information needs in a particular context.","[Sarku, Rebecca; Termeer, Katrien; Dewulf, Art] Leeuwenborch, Publ Adm & Policy, Hollandseweg 1,Bldg 201, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands; [Van Slobbe, Erik] Water Syst & Global Change, POB 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; [Kranjac-Berisavljevic, Gordana] Univ Dev Studies, POB TL 1350, Tamale, Ghana",Wageningen University & Research; University for Development Studies,"Sarku, R (corresponding author), Leeuwenborch, Publ Adm & Policy, Hollandseweg 1,Bldg 201, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands.",beasarku@gmail.com; erik.vanslobbe@wur.nl; katrien.termeer@wur.nl; art.dewulf@wur.nl,,,Netherlands organisation for scientific research (NWO) [W 07.69.204.],Netherlands organisation for scientific research (NWO)(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)),This work was supported by the Netherlands organisation for scientific research (NWO) [W 07.69.204.] .,,91,2,2,1,2,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2405-8807,,,CLIM SERV,Clim.

Due to the effect of the SPB, the prediction error of PDO-related SSTA events starts to grow rapidly during the ASO season and yields a positive (negative) prediction error for the warm (cold) events, essentially inducing a delay of the events. The SPB may be one of the main factors limiting the predictability of North Pacific sea surface temperature. The physical and dynamical mechanisms of the SPB are explored from two aspects: thermodynamics and dynamics. In terms of thermodynamics, we demonstrate that the fastest error growth of PDO-related SST cold (warm) events during the ASO season is mainly due to the largest anomalous release (absorption) of the latent heat flux in this season; while for dynamics, the effect of the vertical gradient of climatological mean sea temperature on the anomalous upwelling (downwelling) dominates the contribution of the dynamical temperature advections to the error growth of the PDO-related SST cold (warm) events during the ASO season. The anomalous release (absorption) of the latent heat flux and anomalous upwelling (downwelling) of the ocean currents are both related to the anomalous northwesterly or cyclonic (southeasterly or anticyclonic) wind over the PDO-related SSTA region, which indicates that the error growth associated with the SPB of PDO-related SST cold (warm) events is mainly driven by anomalous wind stress. The error growth associated with the SPB for PDO-related SSTA may also explain why the SSTA in the Kuroshio-Oyashio Extension is much less predictable than in other regions of the North Pacific, as shown by some state-of-the-art climate models.","[Duan, Wansuo; Wu, Yujie] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, State Key Lab Numer Modeling Atmospher Sci & Geop, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Wu, Yujie] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Duan, WS (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, State Key Lab Numer Modeling Atmospher Sci & Geop, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.",duanws@lasg.iap.ac.cn,"Wu, Yujie/C-3510-2012; Duan, Wansuo/AAJ-4536-2020","Wu, Yujie/0000-0002-0415-8142; ",National Basic Research Program of China [2012CB955202]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41376018]; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA11010303],National Basic Research Program of China(National Basic Research Program of China); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences),"We wish to thank the anonymous reviewers for their insightful comments and constructive suggestions.

B,"Hu, ZZ; Huang, BH; Pegion, K",,"Askew, ES; Bromley, JP",,"Hu, Zeng-Zhen; Huang, Bohua; Pegion, Kathy",,,BIASES AND THE MOST PREDICTABLE PATTERNS IN THE NCEP CFS OVER THE TROPICAL ATLANTIC OCEAN,ATLANTIC AND INDIAN OCEANS: NEW OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH,,,English,Article; Book Chapter,,,,,,,FORECAST SYSTEM; ENSO; MODEL; CLIMATE,"In this chapter, we examined the biases and the most predictable patterns over the tropical Atlantic Ocean by using hindcasts and a long-term integration of the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Climate Forecast System (CFS). CFS is a state-of-the-art coupled system, which is now being used at NCEP for operational seasonal climate predictions. It is shown that CFS reproduces the major features of the leading variability modes in the tropical Atlantic Ocean and the associated physical processes. However, there are significant biases, particularly over the southeastern tropical Atlantic Ocean. These biases have a strong impact on the predictable skill and the structures of the model predicted patterns in the tropical Atlantic Ocean. Compared with observations, the CFS produces too few low clouds over the southeastern Atlantic and too many high clouds over the whole tropical Atlantic. The center of the low clouds is shifted westward in the model away from the cold tongue region towards the central ocean. The underestimation of low clouds in the southeastern Atlantic may be one of the potential sources of the warm biases of sea surface temperature (SST) in this region. The low clouds are linked to a stable or inversion layer between 850 hPa and 925 hPa in observations, but are associated with a stable layer between 700 hPa and 850 hPa in the CFS, which suggests that low clouds are generated in a higher layer in the model than in the real world. On average, the lower troposphere is less stable in the CFS than in the observations over the tropical Atlantic region, which is more favorable for the development of deep convection and generation of high clouds. On average, for predictions with initial conditions (IC) of all months, the predictability of SST in the tropical Atlantic is higher in the west than in the east. Seasonally, the skill is higher for predictions with IC in summer or autumn and lower for those with IC in spring. The CFS poorly predicts the meridional gradient across the equator. The superiority of the CFS predictions to the persistence forecasts depends on IC month, region, and lead time. The CFS prediction is generally better than the corresponding persistence forecast when lead time is longer than 3 months. The most predictable pattern of SST in March has the same sign in almost the whole tropical Atlantic. The corresponding pattern in March is dominated by the same sign for geopotential height at 200 hPa in most of the domain and by significant opposite variation for precipitation between the northwestern tropical North Atlantic and the regions from tropical South America to the southwestern tropical North Atlantic. These predictable signals mainly result from the influence of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). For the CFS, the predictive skill in the tropical Atlantic Ocean is largely determined by its ability to predict ENSO. This is due to the strong connection between ENSO and the most predictable patterns in the tropical Atlantic Ocean in the model. The higher predictive skill of tropical North Atlantic SST is consistent with the ability of the CFS to predict ENSO on inter-seasonal time scales, particularly for the ICs in warm months from March to October. In the southeastern ocean, the systematic warm bias is a crucial factor leading to the low skill in the region.","[Hu, Zeng-Zhen; Huang, Bohua; Pegion, Kathy] Ctr Ocean Land Atmosphere Studies, Calverton, MD USA; [Huang, Bohua] George Mason Univ, Dept Climate Dynam, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA",George Mason University,"Hu, ZZ (corresponding author), Ctr Ocean Land Atmosphere Studies, Calverton, MD USA.",hu@cola.iges.org,"Pegion, Kathy/E-1525-2013; Hu, Zeng-Zhen/B-4373-2011","Pegion, Kathy/0000-0001-5820-7678; Hu, Zeng-Zhen/0000-0002-8485-3400",,,,,17,2,2,0,1,"NOVA SCIENCE PUBLISHERS, INC",HAUPPAUGE,"400 OSER AVE, STE 1600, HAUPPAUGE, NY 11788-3635 USA",,,978-1-60692-475-4,,,,2009,,,,,1,15,,,,,,15,Oceanography,Book Citation Index – Science (BKCI-S),Oceanography,BMP96,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000273314400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The urban heat island is manifested in the formation of an urban boundary layer with distinct thermodynamic features that in turn govern transport processes of air pollutants. While many studies already demonstrated the benefit of urban canopy models (UCM) for atmospheric modelling, work on the impact on urban air chemistry is scarce. This study uses the state-of-the-art coupled chemistry-climate modelling system MECO(n) to assess the impact of the COSMO UCM TERRA_URB on the dynamics and gas phase chemistry in the boundary layer of the urban agglomeration Rhine-Main in Germany. Comparing the model results to ground observations and satellite and ground based remote sensing data, we found that the UCM experiment reduces the bias in temperature at the surface and throughout the boundary layer. This is true for ground level NO2 and ozone distribution as well. The application of MECO(n) for urban planning purposes is discussed by designing case studies representing two projected scenarios in future urban planning - densificati n of central urban areas and urban sprawl. Averaged over the core urban region and 10-days during a heat wave period in July 2018, model results indicate a warming of 0.7 K in surface temperature and 0.2 K in air temperature per 10 % increase in impervious surface area fraction. Within this period, a 50 % total increase of imperviousness accounts for a 3 K and 1 K spatially averaged warming respectively. This change in thermodynamic features results in a decrease of surface NO2 concentration by 10-20 % through increased turbulent mixing in areas with highest impervious fraction and highest emissions. In the evening and nighttime however, increased densificati n in the urban centre results in amplifie canyon blocking, which in turn results in average increase in near surface NO2 concentrations of about 10 %, compared to the status quo. This work intends to analyse regional scale features of surface-atmosphere interactions in an urban boundary layer and can be seen as preparatory work for higher resolution street scale models.","[Fallmann, Joachim] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, South German Climate Off Ce, Karlsruhe, Germany; [Fallmann, Joachim] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res Tropospher Res, Karlsruhe, Germany; [Fallmann, Joachim; Barra, Marc; Tost, Holger] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Inst Atmospher Phys, Mainz, Germany; [Kumar, Vinod] Max Planck Inst Chem, Mainz, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz; Max Planck Society,"Fallmann, J (corresponding author), Karlsruher Inst Technol KIT, Inst Meteorol & Klimaforsch, Postfach 3640, D-76021 Karlsruhe, Germany.",joachim.fallmann@kit.edu,,,Carl-Zeiss foundation; Alexander von Humboldt foundation,Carl-Zeiss foundation; Alexander von Humboldt foundation(Alexander von Humboldt Foundation),"This study has been funded by the Carl-Zeiss founda-tion.

Results show that terrestrial ecosystems of India have been a carbon sink for this period. Driven by a strong CO2 fertilization effect, magnitude of NBP increased from 27.17 TgC/yr in the 1980s to 34.39 TgC/yr in the 1990s but decreased to 23.70 TgC/yr in the 2000s due to change in climate. Adoption of forest conservation, management, and reforestation policies in the past decade has promoted carbon sequestration in the ecosystems, but this effect has been offset by loss of carbon from ecosystems due to rising temperatures and decrease in precipitation. Plain Language Summary Our study presents the results for net biome productivity (NBP) for India on a country scale, which are estimated using a state-of-the-art land surface model. Environmental factors, such as elevated atmospheric CO2, climate change, nitrogen deposition, and land cover changes, have been identified as the major factors responsible for changes in terrestrial carbon fluxes. Broadly, the manuscript presents the relative contribution of these environmental factors to changes in NBP in India for the last three decades. Most of the published studies on this topic have focused on the NBP estimates at regional or global scale. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to quantify NBP at country scale. The results presented are timely because this manuscript adds to the knowledge of the carbon budget on a country level, identifies uncertainties in our understanding that can motivate further experiments, and aides in quantifying the regional and global carbon budget. These original research results presented in this study have implications for the ongoing international debate on climate treaty which calls for countries to apply the carbon stored in its forests and other ecosystems toward its budgeted reduction in carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.","[Gahlot, Shilpa; Roy, Somnath Baidya] Indian Inst Technol Delhi, Ctr Atmospher Sci, New Delhi, India; [Shu, Shijie; Jain, Atul K.] Univ Illinois, Dept Atmospher Sci, 105 S Gregory Ave, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Delhi; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Roy, SB (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol Delhi, Ctr Atmospher Sci, New Delhi, India.;Jain, AK (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Atmospher Sci, 105 S Gregory Ave, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",jain1@illinois.edu; drsbr@iitd.ac.in,"Jain, Atul/D-2851-2016; Shu, Shijie/GMW-6553-2022","Jain, Atul/0000-0002-4051-3228; Shu, Shijie/0000-0003-4140-918X; Baidya Roy, Somnath/0000-0002-7677-4972",University of Illinois under NASA grant [NNX414AD94G]; NSF [NSF AGS 12-43071]; US DOE [DOE DE-SC0016323]; Div Atmospheric & Geospace Sciences [1243071] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,University of Illinois under NASA grant; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); US DOE(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Div Atmospheric & Geospace Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)),"The four sets of gridded terrestrial carbon fluxes outputs (GPP, NPP, NBP, Ra, Rh, and land use emission) simulated using ISAM for India under four different experimental discussed in the paper can be downloaded from the ISAM model website: http://climate.atmos.uiuc.edu/ Gahlot_etal_GRL_Data.tar.gz.

Although much effort has gone into producing state-of-the-art seasonal streamflow forecasts from improving IHCs and SCFs, these developments are expensive and time consuming and the forecasting skill is still limited inmost parts of the world. Hence, sensitivity analyses are crucial to funnel the resources into useful modeling and forecasting developments. It is in this context that a sensitivity analysis technique, the variational ensemble streamflow prediction assessment (VESPA) approach, was recently introduced. VESPA can be used to quantify the expected improvements in seasonal streamflow forecast skill as a result of realistic improvements in its predictability sources (i.e., the IHCs and the SCFs)-termed skill elasticity''- and to indicate where efforts should be targeted. The VESPA approach is, however, computationally expensive, relying on multiple hindcasts having varying levels of skill in IHCs and SCFs. This paper presents two approximations of the approach that are computationally inexpensive alternatives. These new methods were tested against the original VESPA results using 30 years of ensemble hindcasts for 18 catchments of the contiguous United States. The results suggest that one of themethods, end point blending, is an effective alternative for estimating the forecast skill elasticities yielded by the VESPA approach. The results also highlight the importance of the choice of verification score for a goal- oriented sensitivity analysis.","[Arnal, Louise; Stephens, Elisabeth; Cloke, Hannah L.] Univ Reading, Dept Geog & Environm Sci, Shinfield Pk, Reading, Berks, England; [Arnal, Louise; Pappenberger, Florian] European Ctr Medium Range Weather Forecasts, Shinfield Pk, Reading, Berks, England; [Wood, Andrew W.] NCAR, Res Applicat Lab, Boulder, CO USA; [Cloke, Hannah L.] Univ Reading, Dept Meteorol, Reading, Berks, England; [Pappenberger, Florian] Univ Bristol, Sch Geog Sci, Bristol, Avon, England",University of Reading; European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF); National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; University of Reading; University of Bristol,"Arnal, L (corresponding author), Univ Reading, Dept Geog & Environm Sci, Shinfield Pk, Reading, Berks, England.;Arnal, L (corresponding author), European Ctr Medium Range Weather Forecasts, Shinfield Pk, Reading, Berks, England.",l.l.s.arnal@pgr.reading.ac.uk,"Pappenberger, Florian/A-2839-2009","Pappenberger, Florian/0000-0003-1766-2898; Cloke, Hannah/0000-0002-1472-868X; Stephens, Elisabeth/0000-0002-5439-7563; Arnal, Louise/0000-0002-0208-2324",Horizon IMPREX project [641811]; Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship [ECF-2013-492]; National Science Foundation; U.S. Bureau of Reclamation [R11AC80816]; U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Climate Preparedness and Resilience Program [1254557],Horizon IMPREX project; Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship(Leverhulme Trust); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); U.S. Bureau of Reclamation; U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Climate Preparedness and Resilience Program,"L.

For a safe preservation of their art objects museums try to minimize this risk, which is typically done by imposing strict limitations on the indoor temperature and humidity conditions. The high energy demand resulting from this approach, however, undermines the aim of preeminent museums to execute a sustainable preservation strategy of their collections. A rational improvement of this aspect asks for detailed information on the history of museum objects, complemented by a thorough comprehension of the failure and deformation behaviour of museum objects under indoor climate fluctuations. Accordingly, in this paper the hygro-mechanical response of mock-ups of historical Dutch cabinet door panels made of oak wood is examined under several relative humidity variations. In specific, the mock-ups were subjected to (i) an instantaneous decrease of 40% relative humidity, (ii) eight successive, instantaneous drops of 5% relative humidity, and (iii) a varying relative humidity profile ranging between 35 and 71%. The shrinkage characteristics of mock-ups are translated to their damage susceptibility using an analytical hygro-mechanical bi-layer model. This model shows that restrained hygral shrinkage may originate from: (i) a difference in moisture content across the thickness direction of the panel, or (ii) a directional difference in the coefficient of hygroscopic expansions of structural components forming a coherent connection. The first type of shrinkage occurs in the outer regions of the panel thickness, while the second type of shrinkage takes place at the cleated ends. Further, by accounting for the age-dependency of the fracture strength of oak wood, a clear distinction can be made between the damage susceptibility of new door panels and historical door panels present in museum cabinets. The six main conclusions of the experimental study-conveniently summarized at the end of this paper-provide a scientific basis for the understanding of shrinkage cracks and dimensional changes observed on decorated oak wooden panels in historical Dutch cabinets, and thus may assist in advising museums on future sustainable preservation strategies and rational guidelines for indoor climate specifications.","[Luimes, R.

We studied effects of increased background [O-3] (up to [ambient] x 2) and increased N deposition (up to +50 kg ha-1 a-1) on mature, subalpine grassland during the third treatment year. During 10 days and 13 nights, distributed evenly over the growth period of 2006, we measured ecosystem-level CO2 exchange using a static cuvette. Light dependency of gross primary production (GPP) and temperature dependency of ecosystem respiration rates (R-eco) were established. Soil temperature, soil water content, and solar radiation were monitored. Using R-eco and GPP values, we calculated seasonal net ecosystem production (NEP), based on hourly averages of global radiation and soil temperature. Differences in NEP were compared with differences in soil organic C after 5 years of treatment. The high [O-3] had no effect on aboveground dry matter productivity (DM), but seasonal mean rates of both R-eco and GPP decreased ca. 8%. NEP indicated an unaltered growing season CO2-C balance. High N treatment, with a +31% increase in DM, mean R-eco increased ca. 3%, but GPP decreased ca. 4%. Consequently, seasonal NEP yielded a 53.9 g C m-2 (+/- 22.05) C loss compared with control. Independent of treatment, we observed a negative NEP of 146.4 g C m-2 (+/- 15.3). Carbon loss was likely due to a transient management effect, equivalent to a shift from pasture to hay meadow and a drought effect, specific to the 2006 summer climate. We argue that this resulted from strongly intensified soil microbial respiration, following mitigation of nutrient limitation. There was no interaction between O-3 and N treatments. Thus, during the 2006 growing season, the subalpine grassland lost > 2% of total topsoil organic C as respired CO2, with increased N deposition responsible for one-third of that loss.","[Volk, Matthias; Novak, Kris; Giger, Robin; Bassin, Seraina; Fuhrer, Juerg] Agroscope ART Reckenholz, Swiss Fed Res Stn Agroecol & Agr, Air Pollut Climate Grp, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland; [Obrist, Daniel] Univ Basel, Dept Environm Sci, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Research Station Agroscope; Swiss Federal Research Station for Agroecology & Agriculture; University of Basel,"Volk, M (corresponding author), Agroscope ART Reckenholz, Swiss Fed Res Stn Agroecol & Agr, Air Pollut Climate Grp, Reckenholzstr 191, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland.",matthias.volk@art.admin.ch,,,Swiss Federal Office of Environment,Swiss Federal Office of Environment,"This work was supported by the Swiss Federal Office of Environment in the framework of the International Cooperative Programme 'Vegetation' (ICP Vegetation) of the UNECE CLRTAP.

This work reviews 23 peer-reviewed journal papers that outline the state-of-the-art in technical and economic as-sessments of biogenic renewable gas injection. The review has particular focus on (i) the technical constraints gas grids place on biogenic renewable gas injection, (ii) models for biogenic gas production and supply chains, (iii) the use of compressed natural gas (CNG) as a vehicle fuel, (iv) the optimisation of injection facility location, and (v) the incorporation of SCADA data recorded by gas network operators. The review found that the state-of-the-art literature highlighted the importance of models that analyse the production, injection, and distribution of biogenic renewable gas in the gas grid. Research to date has developed models to optimise biogenic renewable gas supply chains and injection points. These optimisation models have been approached from several different perspectives, including (a) maximising renewable gas production, (b) minimising the cost of energy, and (c) matching the variable nature of gas demand. Models have also been created to determine the impacts of biogenic renewable gas injection on gas networks. These models have been used to assess gas blending in the network, including pressures, Wobbe index (WI), higher heating value and gas composition. However, it also identified several gaps in the literature that should be addressed in future work. Firstly, the state of the art does not include a comprehensive study where all the potential impact factors associated with biogenic renewable gas injection are considered. Secondly, studies that model and optimise the locations for renewable gas injection facilities have not given consideration as to how the injected gas will affect gas flow within the network. Finally, the impact of CNG demand on gas networks and their capacity to accept renewable gas injection should be determined.","[Keogh, Niamh; Monaghan, R. F.

Rather than simply presenting work under a different name (a pseudonym), Herms deployed the literary technique of heteronymywhich is both a tool (a heteronym) and a conceptual strategy. Herms's heteronymous practice comprised presenting work by distinct personae, each of whom differed from the others in terms of aesthetic style, philosophy, personality, and life story.

There exists a large potential for energy saving in buildings by improving the thermal performance of windows. For decisions on energy saving window retrofits, accurate estimation of the energy saved and its uncertainty is of importance. The ISO 15099 standard, which is normative for thermal modelling of windows within the building sector, does not give uncertainty estimates. The main novelty of this study was to provide uncertainty analysis for model prediction of the thermal transmittance of windows, in the perspective of decisions on window retrofits. For this purpose, we proposed a new simplified model, which facilitated uncertainty analysis, and still was similar to the ISO 15099 window model. The model was validated by application of a benchmark validation procedure to a set of previously performed validation experiments. Main conclusions were: (i) The model was accurate within a prediction uncertainty equal to 0.20 Wm-2K-1; (ii) The domain where the model is valid was described using existing well-documented validation experiments. This domain was restricted to windows with glazing thermal transmittance corresponding to 2-layer glazing, and to windows where the frame area is a minor part of the total window area. (iii) The prediction uncertainty was mainly determined by the measurement uncertainty in the validation experiments; (iv) If a window retrofit is based on reduction of window thermal transmittance, then this reduction has to be larger than 0.56 Wm-2K-1 in order to yield energy savings above the uncertainty limit.","[Ohlsson, K.

The other two are mitigation and geoengineering. These three are orthogonal in the sense that each can be pursued independently of the others.(13) Climate change adaptation is a natural response to risk, a sort of extension of emergency preparedness, but it is more than that. Climate change adaptive actions are beginning to be taken in some parts of both the developing and the developed world, and they can be effective at various geographic scales but most often locally. Assessing risks against the costs and benefits of adaptive measures is an art that is just beginning to become practiced for climate change. Incorporation of adaptation policies into community, regional and national planning is also growing with U.N. encouragement and support. The net cost of adaptation will likely grow as greenhouse gases (GHG) in the atmosphere increase and adverse effects grow, and at some concentration the cost of adaptation may become a losing cause. Adaptation planning, policy adoption and actions will be driven at national, regional and local levels by perceived risks. Poor people particularly in vulnerable places will be at greatest risk. Each nation should take the adaptation strategy seriously and seek to increase adaptive capacity at various levels. This includes maintaining ecosystem health and the viability of important species. Sharing of information, resources, tools and experiences can make adaptation actions more effective and less expensive. Research may also lead to innovations that reduce the cost and effort of adapting. Sharing might be facilitated by an international system of www coupled research and information organizations funded from public and private institutions.","[Fulkerson, William] Univ Tennessee, Inst Secure & Sustainable Environm, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Wilbanks, Thomas J.] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Oak Ridge, TN USA",University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Oak Ridge National Laboratory,"Fulkerson, W (corresponding author), Univ Tennessee, Inst Secure & Sustainable Environm, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA.",,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,8,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"PO BOX 128 FARRER RD, SINGAPORE 9128, SINGAPORE",,,978-981-283-463-8,SCI CULT-NUCL STRAT,,,2008,,,,,191,+,,10.1142/9789812834645_0020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1142/9789812834645_0020,,,2,Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences; Neurosciences; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences; Neurosciences & Neurology; Public Administration,BIJ75,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000260159500020,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study evaluated the performance of 36 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5) GCMs in relation to their skills in simulating mean annual, monsoon, winter, pre-monsoon, and post-monsoon precipitation and maximum and minimum temperature over Pakistan using state-of-the-art spatial metrics, SPAtial EFficiency, fractions skill score, Goodman-Kruskal's lambda, Cramer's V, Mapcurves, and Kling-Gupta efficiency, for the period 1961-2005. The multi-model ensemble (MME) precipitation and maximum and minimum temperature data were generated through the intelligent merging of simulated precipitation and maximum and minimum temperature of selected GCMs employing random forest (RF) regression and simple mean (SM) techniques. The results indicated some differences in the ranks of GCMs for different spatial metrics. The overall ranks indicated NorESM1-M, MIROC5, BCC-CSM1-1, and ACCESS1-3 as the best GCMs in simulating the spatial patterns of mean annual, monsoon, winter, pre-monsoon, and post-monsoon precipitation and maximum and minimum temperature over Pakistan. MME precipitation and maximum and minimum temperature generated based on the best-performing GCMs showed more similarities with observed precipitation and maximum and minimum temperature compared to precipitation and maximum and minimum temperature simulated by individual GCMs. The MMEs developed using RF displayed better performance than the MMEs based on SM. Multiple spatial metrics have been used for the first time for selecting GCMs based on their capability to mimic the spatial patterns of annual and seasonal precipitation and maximum and minimum temperature. The approach proposed in the present study can be extended to any number of GCMs and climate variables and applicable to any region for the suitable selection of an ensemble of GCMs to reduce uncertainties in climate projections.","[Ahmed, Kamal; Shahid, Shamsuddin] UTM, Fac Civil Engn, Johor Baharu 81310, Malaysia; [Ahmed, Kamal] Lasbela Univ Agr Water & Marine Sci, Fac Water Resource Management, Balochistan 90150, Pakistan; [Sachindra, Dhanapala A.] Victoria Univ, Coll Engn & Sci, Inst Sustainabil & Innovat, POB 14428, Melbourne, Vic 8001, Australia; [Demirel, Mehmet C.] Istanbul Tech Univ, Dept Civil Engn, TR-34469 Istanbul, Turkey; [Chung, Eun-Sung] Seoul Natl Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Seoul 01811, South Korea",Universiti Teknologi Malaysia; Victoria University; Istanbul Technical University; Seoul National University of Science & Technology,"Chung, ES (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Seoul 01811, South Korea.",eschung@seoultech.ac.kr,"Chung, Eun-Sung/U-9010-2019; Demirel, Mehmet Cüneyd/A-7177-2010; SHAHID, SHAMSUDDIN/B-5185-2010","Demirel, Mehmet Cüneyd/0000-0003-4402-906X; SHAHID, SHAMSUDDIN/0000-0001-9621-6452; Chung, Eun-Sung/0000-0002-4329-1800; Dhanapala Arachchige, Sachindra/0000-0002-4022-0636",National Foundation Research [NRF-2016R1D1A1B04931844]; Professional Development Research University (PDRU) of Universiti Teknologi Malaysia [Q.J130000.21A2.04E10]; Turkish Scientific and Technical Research Council (TUBITAK) [118C020],National Foundation Research; Professional Development Research University (PDRU) of Universiti Teknologi Malaysia; Turkish Scientific and Technical Research Council (TUBITAK)(Turkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Arastirma Kurumu (TUBITAK)),This research has been supported by the National Foundation Research (grant no.

Observations show that these floes can adopt a range of sizes spanning orders of magnitude, from metres to tens of kilometres. Floe size impacts the nature and magnitude of interactions between the sea ice, ocean, and atmosphere including lateral melt rate and momentum and heat exchange. However, large-scale geophysical sea ice models employ a continuum approach and traditionally either assume floes adopt a constant size or do not include an explicit treatment of floe size. In this study we apply novel observations to analyse two alternative approaches to modelling a floe size distribution (FSD) within the state-of-the-art CICE sea ice model. The first model considered is a prognostic floe size-thickness distribution where the shape of the distribution is an emergent feature of the model and is not assumed a priori. The second model considered, the WIPoFSD (Waves-in-Ice module and Power law Floe Size Distribution) model, assumes floe size follows a power law with a constant exponent. We introduce a parameterisation motivated by idealised models of in-plane brittle fracture to the prognostic model and demonstrate that the inclusion of this scheme enables the prognostic model to achieve a reasonable match against the novel observations for mid-sized floes (100 m-2 km). While neither FSD model results in a significant improvement in the ability of CICE to simulate pan-Arctic metrics in a stand-alone sea ice configuration, larger impacts can be seen over regional scales in sea ice concentration and thickness. We find that the prognostic model particularly enhances sea ice melt in the early melt season, whereas for the WIPoFSD model this melt increase occurs primarily during the late melt season. We then show that these differences between the two FSD models can be explained by considering the effective floe size, a metric used to characterise a given FSD. Finally, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages to these different approaches to modelling the FSD. We note that although the WIPoFSD model is unable to represent potentially important features of annual FSD evolution seen with the prognostic model, it is less computationally expensive and produces a better fit to novel FSD observations derived from 2 m resolution MEDEA imagery, possibly making this a stronger candidate for inclusion in climate models.","[Bateson, Adam William; Feltham, Daniel L.; Schroder, David] Univ Reading, Ctr Polar Observat & Modelling, Dept Meteorol, Reading RG2 7PS, Berks, England; [Schroder, David] British Antarctic Survey, Cambridge CB3 0ET, England; [Wang, Yanan; Hwang, Byongjun] Univ Huddersfield, Sch Appl Sci, Huddersfield, W Yorkshire, England; [Ridley, Jeff K.] Hadley Ctr Climate Predict & Res, Met Off, Exeter EX1 3PB, Devon, England; [Aksenov, Yevgeny] Natl Oceanog Ctr Southampton, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, England",University of Reading; UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); NERC British Antarctic Survey; University of Huddersfield; Met Office - UK; Hadley Centre; NERC National Oceanography Centre; University of Southampton,"Bateson, AW (corresponding author), Univ Reading, Ctr Polar Observat & Modelling, Dept Meteorol, Reading RG2 7PS, Berks, England.",a.w.bateson@pgr.reading.ac.uk,,"Wang, Yanan/0000-0003-1191-7925; Bateson, Adam/0000-0002-1239-4161; Schroeder, David/0000-0003-2351-4306","Natural Environment Research Council [NE/R000654/1, NE/N018044/1, NE/S002545/1, NE/R000085/1, NE/T000260/1, NE/R015953/1]; NERC; UK Met Office [NE/M009637/1]; Joint UK BEIS/Defra Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme [GA01 101]",Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); UK Met Office; Joint UK BEIS/Defra Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme,"This research has been supported by the Natural Environment Research Council (grant nos.

European carbon net-neutrality goals are put under test in a model comparison exercise using state of the art Energy-Environment-Economy (E3) models: ETM-UCL, PRIMES and REMIND. Results show that while achieving the transition to carbon neutrality by mid-century is feasible under quite different future energy systems, some robust commonalities emerge. Electrification of end use sectors combined with large-scale expansion of renewable energy is a no-regret decision for all strategies; Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) plays an important role for achieving net-neutral targets under all scenarios, but is most relevant when demand-side changes are limited; hydrogen and synthetic fuels can be a relevant mitigation option for mid-century mitigation in hard-to-abate sectors; energy efficiency can reduce the supply system strain. Finally, high carbon prices (300-900(sic)/tCO(2)) are needed under all strategies in order to achieve carbon net neutrality in 2050. (C) 2021 The Authors.

The essay concludes with a more in-depth description of my larger project at the Brooklyn Museum in 2012 that included interventions in three of the museum's early American period rooms. My site-specific installations disrupted the familiar appearance of the historic rooms and attempted to reveal darker elements of the American story, such as the slave trade behind the labor on a plantation; the widespread death of Native Americans through war, disease, and forced displacement; and the violence and environmental destruction created by colonial expansionism.

We describe a six-tracer biogeochemistry module of steady-state phytoplankton and zooplankton dynamics in Biogeochemistry with Light, Iron, Nutrients and Gas (BLING version 2) with particular emphasis on enhancements relative to the previous version and evaluate its implementation in Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory's (GFDL) fourth-generation climate model (CM4.0) with 1/4 degrees ocean. Major geographical and vertical patterns in chlorophyll, phosphorus, alkalinity, inorganic and organic carbon, and oxygen are well represented. Major biases in BLINGv2 include overly intensified production in high-productivity regions at the expense of productivity in the oligotrophic oceans, overly zonal structure in tropical phosphorus, and intensified hypoxia in the eastern ocean basins as is typical in climate models. Overall, while BLINGv2 structural limitations prevent sophisticated application to plankton physiology, ecology, or biodiversity, its ability to represent major organic, inorganic, and solubility pumps makes it suitable for many coupled carbon-climate and biogeochemistry studies including eddy interactions in the ocean interior. We further overview the biogeochemistry and circulation mechanisms that shape carbon uptake over the historical period. As an initial analysis of model historical and idealized response, we show that CM4.0 takes up slightly more anthropogenic carbon than previous models in part due to enhanced ventilation in the absence of an eddy parameterization. The CM4.0 biogeochemistry response to CO2 doubling highlights a mix of large declines and moderate increases consistent with previous models.","[Dunne, J. P.; Guo, H.; John, J. G.; Krasting, J.

Results regarding the GPCC products illustrated a substantial and significant performance decrease with up to four times higher errors during periods with low observation inputs (1998-2012 with 2 stations on average per 124,000 km(2)) compared to periods with high quantities of regionally incorporated station data (1980-1994 with 14 stations on average per 124,000 km(2)). If independent stations were considered, the coefficient of efficiency indicated that only three of the gridded datasets (MERRA-2 bias corrected, GPCC, GPCC MP) performed better than the long term station mean for characterizing surface precipitation. Error patterns and magnitudes show that in complex terrain, evaluation of temporal and spatial variations of included observations is a prerequisite for using gridded precipitation products for scientific applications and to avoid overly optimistic performance assessments.","[Zandler, Harald; Haag, Isabell; Samimi, Cyrus] Univ Bayreuth, Dept Geog, Working Grp Climatol, Univ Str 30, D-95447 Bayreuth, Germany; [Zandler, Harald; Samimi, Cyrus] Univ Bayreuth, Bayreuth Ctr Ecol & Environm Res, Dr Hans Frisch Str 1-3, D-95448 Bayreuth, Germany",University of Bayreuth; University of Bayreuth,"Zandler, H (corresponding author), Univ Bayreuth, Dept Geog, Working Grp Climatol, Univ Str 30, D-95447 Bayreuth, Germany.;Zandler, H (corresponding author), Univ Bayreuth, Bayreuth Ctr Ecol & Environm Res, Dr Hans Frisch Str 1-3, D-95448 Bayreuth, Germany.",harald.zandler@uni-bayreuth.de,"Haag, Isabell/HDL-7761-2022; Samimi, Cyrus/H-8085-2012","Samimi, Cyrus/0000-0001-7001-7893; Zandler, Harald/0000-0001-5505-2455; Haag, Isabell/0000-0002-3308-5245",Volkswagen Foundation - German Research Foundation (DFG); University of Bayreuth,Volkswagen Foundation - German Research Foundation (DFG); University of Bayreuth,We would like to express our gratitude to all institutions that make climatological data available free of charge for the scientific community.

Since scientific investigations began in 1948, the discrepancy between the sophistication of the culture and the low agricultural potential of the environment has become increasingly apparent. Although claims that Marajoara settlement pattern is urban in scale, that the population could have been up to one million people, and that the ceramic art is one of the most highly developed in the hemisphere are extravagant, there is no doubt that the society maintained a relatively high level of complexity during nearly 1000 years in an environment that today supports only a sparse population dedicated mainly to cattle raising. Similar levels of cultural development elsewhere on the planet are sustained either by intensive agriculture or by unusually productive wild resources. Elimination of the former focuses attention on the latter and several new lines of evidence suggest that intensive exploitation of palm starch may be the solution to the mystery of the Marajoara.","Smithsonian Inst, Natl Museum Nat Hist, Washington, DC 20560 USA",Smithsonian Institution; Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History,"Meggers, BJ (corresponding author), Smithsonian Inst, Natl Museum Nat Hist, MRC-112, Washington, DC 20560 USA.",,,,,,,,67,12,14,0,9,MAX-PLANCK-INST LIMNOLOGIE,PLON,"AG TROPENOKOLOGIE ATTN: DR.

We find that a southward (northward) shift in the westerly winds leads to an intensification (weakening) of no more than 10% of the AMOC. This response of the ocean physics to shifting winds agrees with other studies starting from preindustrial background climate, but the responsible processes are different. In our setup changes in AMOC seemed to be more pulled by upwelling in the south than pushed by downwelling in the north, opposite to what previous studies with different background climate are suggesting. The net effects of the changes in ocean circulation lead to a rise in atmospheric pCO(2) of less than 10atm for both northward and southward shift in the winds. For northward shifted winds the zone of upwelling of carbon- and nutrient-rich waters in the Southern Ocean is expanded, leading to more CO(2)outgassing to the atmosphere but also to an enhanced biological pump in the subpolar region. For southward shifted winds the upwelling region contracts around Antarctica, leading to less nutrient export northward and thus a weakening of the biological pump. These model results do not support the idea that shifts in the westerly wind belt play a dominant role in coupling atmospheric CO2 rise and Antarctic temperature during deglaciation suggested by the ice core data.","[Voelker, Christoph; Koehler, Peter] Helmholtz Ctr Polar & Marine Res, Alfred Wegener Inst, D-27515 Bremerhaven, Germany","Helmholtz Association; Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar & Marine Research","Kohler, P (corresponding author), Helmholtz Ctr Polar & Marine Res, Alfred Wegener Inst, POB 120161, D-27515 Bremerhaven, Germany.",peter.koehler@awi.de,"Köhler, Peter/F-7293-2010; Voelker, Christoph/I-7891-2012","Köhler, Peter/0000-0003-0904-8484; Voelker, Christoph/0000-0003-3032-114X",German Research Foundation DFG [KO 2937/5-1]; EU [264879],German Research Foundation DFG(German Research Foundation (DFG)); EU(European Commission),LGM forcing data were kindly provided by Xu Zhang.

The methodology of this Doctorate in Sustainable Built Environment (D.SBE) action research project, designed, developed and implemented by the first author, uses a mixed method. The case study is a 364 beds hospital located in Abu Dhabi, capital city of the UAE, with a vegetated open space and decorative water features representing more than 50% of the building footprint. The primary source of the medical facility landscape irrigation and water feature is designed to be air conditioning condensate water to avoid usage of any desalinated water in an arid environment. For four months of the year, the irrigation demand will not be met by the condensate water in winter because peak condensate formation occurs in summer. This shortfall availability during the winter months is proposed to be met by soil amendment and by use of other alternative water types. The soil test results show rapid plant growth with one of the soil conditioner solution whereas water savings is inconclusive due to irrigation system hydraulic irregularities and the lack of irrigation standardized rating for building operation. The next steps are to firstly balance the soil pH with a gypsum solution, to secondly reprogram the irrigation system controller with tested and audited hydraulic building parameters and to thirdly include all adequate parameters including ETo and rainfall to estimate the irrigation demand so that water savings can be accurately monitored. This intervention study will help understand the correlation between soil water quality together with irrigation rate and irrigation distribution system's audit and how these factors impact on the environment, operation and maintenance cost and practices, greenhouse gas emissions, and building systems water and energy consumption. The results may be relevant to local authorities responsible for making and adjusting standards for outdoor irrigation strategy for all types of building. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Modeling studies show that the ITCZ structure is very sensitive to moist convection parameterization and in particular, to the vertical profile of convective heating and free-tropospheric moistening. To further explore this sensitivity, the authors focus in this study on the influence of lateral entrainment in convective plumes on the simulated tropical precipitation and large-scale circulation. Sensitivity studies to the entrainment parameter were performed in a hierarchy of models (coupled ocean-atmosphere GCM, atmospheric GCM, and aquaplanet GCM), in order to mitigate the double ITCZ problem in the Centre National de Recherches Meteorologiques Coupled Global Climate Model, version 5 (CNRM-CM5). The sensitivity of the ITCZ structure to lateral entrainment is robust across our hierarchy of models. In response to increased entrainment, the realistic simulations exhibit a weakening of the southern side of the double ITCZ over the southeastern Pacific Ocean and a better representation of the South Pacific convergence zone (SPCZ). However, as a result of stronger moisture-convection feedbacks, precipitation is overestimated in the center of convergence zones. The change in ITCZ configuration is associated with a more realistic representation of the large-scale vertical regimes, explained by a decreased frequency of weak-to-moderate ascending regimes and an enhanced frequency of subsidence regimes. Mechanisms at play in this circulation change are examined by analyzing the vertically integrated dry static energy budget. This energetic analysis suggests that the feedback between large-scale dynamics and deep convection is crucial in controlling the probability distribution function (PDF) of midtropospheric vertical wind. This PDF, in turn, controls the precipitation distribution and, in particular, the double ITCZ bias.","[Oueslati, Boutheina; Bellon, Gilles] CNRS Meteo France, CNRM, F-31057 Toulouse 01, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Meteo France,"Oueslati, B (corresponding author), CNRS Meteo France, CNRM, 42 Ave Gaspard Coriolis, F-31057 Toulouse 01, France.",boutheina.oueslati@meteo.fr,,"Bellon, Gilles/0000-0003-3981-1225",,,,,50,61,62,0,21,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0894-8755,,,J CLIMATE,J.

The intent is to highlight the extensive presence of supercooled liquid water over the Southern Ocean region, particularly during summer. The phase of such clouds directly affects the absorbed shortwave radiation, which has recently been found to be poorly simulated in both state-of-the-art reanalysis and coupled global climate models (Trenberth and Fasullo). The climatology finds that supercooled liquid water is present year-round in the low-altitude clouds across this section of the Southern Ocean. Further, the MODIS cloud phase algorithm identifies very few glaciated cloud tops at temperatures above -20 degrees C, rather inferring a large portion of uncertain cloud tops. Between 50 and 60 degrees S during the summer, the albedo effect is compounded by a seasonal reduction in high-level cirrus. This is in direct contrast to the Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska. Here MODIS finds a higher likelihood of observing warm liquid water clouds during summer and a reduction in the relative frequency of cloud tops within the 0 degrees to 20 degrees C temperature range. As the MODIS cloud phase product has limited ability to confidently identify cloud-top phase between -5 degrees and -25 degrees C, future research should include observations from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) and other space-based sensors to help with the classification within this temperature range. Further, multiregion in situ verification of any remotely sensed observations is vital to further understanding the cloud phase processes.","[Morrison, Anthony E.] Monash Univ, Sch Math Sci, Melbourne, Vic 3800, Australia",Monash University,"Morrison, AE (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Sch Math Sci, Melbourne, Vic 3800, Australia.",anthony.e.morrison@gmail.com,"Siems, Steven T/C-8339-2013","Siems, Steven T/0000-0002-8478-533X",Australian Research Council [LP0562358],Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"This research was supported by the Australian Research Council through Linkage Grant LP0562358.

This review examines how social capital contributes to the food security of communities. A systematic literature review, based on Prisma, is designed to provide a state of the art review on capacity social capital in this realm. The output of this method led to finding 39 related articles. Studying these articles illustrates that social capital improves food security through two mechanisms of knowledge sharing and product sharing (i.e., sharing food products). It reveals that social capital through improving the food security pillars (i.e., food availability, food accessibility, food utilization, and food system stability) affects food security. In other words, the interaction among the community members results in sharing food products and information among community members, which facilitates food availability and access to food. There are many shreds of evidence in the literature that sharing food and food products among the community member decreases household food security and provides healthy nutrition to vulnerable families, and improves the food utilization pillar of food security. It is also disclosed that belonging to the social networks increases the community members' resilience and decreases the community's vulnerability that subsequently strengthens the stability of a food system. This study contributes to the common literature on food security and social capital by providing a conceptual model based on the literature. In addition to researchers, policymakers can use this study's findings to provide solutions to address food insecurity problems.","[Nosratabadi, Saeed; Khazami, Nesrine; Abdallah, Marwa Ben] Szent Istvan Univ, Doctoral Sch Management & Business Adm, H-2100 Godollo, Hungary; [Lackner, Zoltan] Szent Istvan Univ, Fac Food Sci, Dept Food Econ, Villanyi Str 29-43, H-1118 Budapest, Hungary; [S.

The art projects interrogate conflicting perspectives on landscape and nature in the North. The case studies demonstrate, both directly and indirectly, the political and cultural tensions made evident by the mapping of the micro and macro undercurrents at work in the region, and examine how mapping has been used as a methodology to visualise those intractable material relationships, often using the map as a trope to do so. These mappings make visible the enmeshments of these remote locations into a global ecosystem. The concept of the Anthropocene provides a useful framework to describe the contemporary context of climate change, ecological decline, biodiversity loss and recent discourses on land use within which the artworks by two artists, Julia Barton and Stephen Hurrel, will be discussed. The significance of Kester's concept of Littoral Art were explored through the eponymous art project by Barton, which maps the human debris brought by the northern sea currents to the shores of the Western and Northern coasts, and Stephen Hurrel's cultural mapping of the island of Barra on the West Coast. These projects were further considered in the context of Timothy Morton and Tim Ingold's meshwork theory and the concept of the 19th century Scottish town planner and environmentalist Patrick Geddes, whose urging to 'think global, act local' is implicit in the multi-layered understanding of the Anthropocene.","[Panneels, Inge] Edinburgh Napier Univ, Sch Comp, Creat Informat, Edinburgh EH11 4DY, Midlothian, Scotland",Edinburgh Napier University,"Panneels, I (corresponding author), Edinburgh Napier Univ, Sch Comp, Creat Informat, Edinburgh EH11 4DY, Midlothian, Scotland.",i.panneels@napier.ac.uk,,"Panneels, Inge/0000-0002-7668-0546",AHRC,AHRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Arts & Humanities Research Council (AHRC)),"AHRC funded PhD research, Northumbria University, Visual Culture.",,56,0,0,0,4,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-0752,,ARTS,Arts,DEC,2019,4,,,,,,123,10.3390/arts8040123,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/arts8040123,,,19,"Humanities, Multidisciplinary",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Arts & Humanities - Other Topics,KB6ZI,,"gold, Green Published",,,12/21/22,WOS:000506640300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The skill of several predictors of the pan-Arctic sea ice area was quantified: the sea ice area itself, the pan-Arctic sea ice volume, and some areal predictors built from the subgrid ice thickness distribution (ITD). Sea ice area provides a potential predictability of about 3 months, which is consistent with previous studies using model and observation data. Sea ice volume predictive skill for winter sea ice area prediction is weak. Nevertheless, there is a higher potential to predict the September ice area with the June volume anomaly than with the June area anomaly. Using ITD-based predictors, two regimes of predictability were highlighted. The first one, a persistence regime, applies to winter/early spring sea ice seasonal predictability. The winter sea ice cover can be predicted in late fall/early winter from the amount of young ice formed since the freeze-up onset in the margins. However, sea ice area itself is potentially the best predictor of winter sea ice area at seasonal time scales. The second regime is a memory regime. It applies to the predictability of summer sea ice area. An ice area anomaly in September is potentially predictable up to 6 months in advance, using the area covered by ice thicker than a critical thickness lying between 0.9 and 1.5 m. Results of this study are preliminary; however, they provide information for the design of future prediction systems and highlight the need for observations and a state-of-the-art sea ice model.","[Chevallier, Matthieu; Salas-Melia, David] Meteo France, CNRM GAME GMGEC ASTER, CNRS, Grp Etud Atmosphere Meteorol,Ctr Natl Rech Meteor, F-31057 Toulouse, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Meteo France,"Chevallier, M (corresponding author), Meteo France, CNRM GAME GMGEC ASTER, CNRS, Grp Etud Atmosphere Meteorol,Ctr Natl Rech Meteor, 42 Ave Gaspard Coriolis, F-31057 Toulouse, France.",matthieu.chevallier@meteo.fr,,"Chevallier, Matthieu/0000-0003-2033-166X","Ecole des Ponts ParisTech, Marne-la-Vallee (France); Total RD; European Commission [GOCE-CT-2003-505539]","Ecole des Ponts ParisTech, Marne-la-Vallee (France); Total RD; European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre)","This work formed part of a doctorate thesis at the Centre National de Recherches Meteorologiques, Toulouse (France), funded by Ecole des Ponts ParisTech, Marne-la-Vallee (France).

Several well-established methodologies are available, including risk factor analysis, risk modelling and dynamic modelling. Even so, predictive modelling is very much the 'art of the possible', which tends to drive research effort towards some areas and away from others which may be at least as important. Building on the undoubted success of quantitative modelling of the epidemiology and control of human and animal diseases such as AIDS, influenza, foot-and-mouth disease and BSE, attention needs to be paid to developing a more holistic framework that captures the role of the underlying drivers of disease risks, from demography and behaviour to land use and climate change. At the same time, there is still considerable room for improvement in how quantitative analyses and their outputs are communicated to policy makers and other stakeholders. A starting point would be generally accepted guidelines for 'good practice' for the development and the use of predictive models.","Univ Edinburgh, Ashworth Labs, Ctr Infect Dis, Edinburgh EH9 3JT, Midlothian, Scotland",University of Edinburgh,"Woolhouse, M (corresponding author), Univ Edinburgh, Ashworth Labs, Ctr Infect Dis, Kings Bldg,W Mains Rd, Edinburgh EH9 3JT, Midlothian, Scotland.",mark.woolhouse@ed.ac.uk,,,Wellcome Trust; Research and Policy for Infectious Disease Dynamics (RAPIDD) programme,Wellcome Trust(Wellcome TrustEuropean Commission); Research and Policy for Infectious Disease Dynamics (RAPIDD) programme,"This work was partly supported by the Wellcome Trust (project grant to M.

Quantifying the skill of models for different regions and time scales is important, not only to improve forecast skill, but to enhance the effective uptake of forecast information. The Subseasonal to Seasonal Prediction project (S2S) database contains near-real-time forecasts and reforecasts from 11 operational centers and provides a great opportunity to evaluate and compare the skill of operational S2S systems. This study evaluates the skill of these state-of-the-art global prediction systems in predicting monthly precipitation over the Greater Horn of Africa. This comprehensive evaluation was performed using deterministic and probabilistic forecast verification metrics. Results from the analysis showed that the prediction skill varies with months and region. Generally, the models show high prediction skill during the start of the rainfall season in March and lower prediction skill during the peak of the rainfall in April. ECCC, ECMWF, KMA, NCEP, and UKMO show better prediction skill over the region for most of the months compared with the rest of the models. Conversely, BoM, CMA, HMCR, and ISAC show poor prediction skill over the region. Overall, the ECMWF model performs best over the region among the 11 models analyzed. Importantly, this study serves as a baseline skill assessment with the findings helping to inform how a subset of models could be selected to construct an objectively consolidated multimodel ensemble of S2S forecast products for the Greater Horn of Africa region, as recommended by the World Meteorological Organization.","[Endris, Hussen Seid; Segele, Zewdu Tessema; Gudoshava, Masilin; Artan, Guleid A.] IGAD Climate Predict & Applicat Ctr, Nairobi, Kenya; [Hirons, Linda; Woolnough, Steve] Univ Reading, Natl Ctr Atmospher Sci, Reading, Berks, England; [Gudoshava, Masilin] Natl Univ Sci & Technol, Bulawayo, Zimbabwe",UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); NERC National Centre for Atmospheric Science; University of Reading; National University of Science & Technology - Zimbabwe,"Endris, HS (corresponding author), IGAD Climate Predict & Applicat Ctr, Nairobi, Kenya.",hussen.seid1@gmail.com,,"Hirons, Linda/0000-0002-1189-7576; Woolnough, Steven/0000-0003-0500-8514","U.K. Research and Innovation as part of the Global Challenges Research Fund, African SWIFT program [NE/P021077/1]; Intra-ACP Climate Services and Related Applications (ClimSA) project - 11th EDF [ACP/FED/038-833]; National Centre for Atmospheric Science ODA national capability program ACREW - NERC [NE/R000034/1]; GCRF; Weather and Climate Information Services (WISER)","U.K. Research and Innovation as part of the Global Challenges Research Fund, African SWIFT program; Intra-ACP Climate Services and Related Applications (ClimSA) project - 11th EDF; National Centre for Atmospheric Science ODA national capability program ACREW - NERC; GCRF; Weather and Climate Information Services (WISER)","This work was supported by U.K. Research and Innovation as part of the Global Challenges Research Fund, African SWIFT program, Grant NE/P021077/1.

Many aspects of ancient Egyptian culture, including the existence of skeletal dysplasia, and in particular achondroplasia, are well known through the monuments and records that survived until modern times. The hot and dry climate in Egypt allowed for the preservation of bodies and skeletal anomalies. the oldest dwarf skeleton, the Badarian skeleton (4500 BCE), possibly represents an epiphyseal disorder. Among the remains of dwarfs with achondroplasia from ancient Egypt (2686-2190 BCE), exists a skeleton of a pregnant female, believed to have died during delivery with a baby's remains in situ. British museums have partial skeletons of dwarfs with achondroplasia, humeri probably affected with mucopolysaccharidoses, and a skeleton of a child with osteogenesis imperfecta. Skeletal dysplasia is also found among royal remains. The mummy of the pharaoh Siptah (1342-1197 BCE) shows a deformity of the left leg and foot. A mummified fetus, believed to be the daughter of king Tutankhamun, has scoliosis, spina bifida, and Sprengel deformity. In 2006 I reviewed the previously existing knowledge of dwarfism in ancient Egypt. the purpose of this second historical review is to add to that knowledge with an expanded contribution. the artistic documentation of people with skeletal dysplasia from ancient Egypt is plentiful including hundreds of amulets, statues, and drawing on tomb and temple walls. Examination of artistic reliefs provides a glance of the role of people with skeletal dysplasia and the societal attitudes toward the m. Both artistic evidence and moral teachings in ancient Egypt reveal wide integration of individuals with disabilities into the society.

Study 2 comprised 21 sports teams (N = 267 athletes) and focused on athletes' specific leadership quality as a task, motivational, social, and external leader. The extent to which athletes felt connected with their leader proved to be most predictive for athletes' perceptions of that leader's quality on each leadership role.

Although state-of-the-art numerical weather prediction (NWP) models have become much better in representing the relevant sources of predictability like land and sea surface states, the subseasonal potential is not fully realized. Complexities arise because drivers depend on the state of other drivers and on interactions over multiple time scales. This study applies statistical modeling to ERA5 data, and explores how nine potential drivers, interacting on eight time scales, contribute to the subseasonal predictability of high summer temperatures in western and central Europe. Features and target temperatures are extracted with two variations of hierarchical clustering, and are fitted with a machine learning (ML) model based on random forests. Explainable AI methods show that the ML model agrees with physical understanding. Verification of the forecasts reveals that a large part of predictability comes from climate change, but that reliable and valuable subseasonal forecasts are possible in certain windows, like forecasting monthly warm anomalies with a lead time of 15 days. Contributions of each driver confirm that there is a transfer of predictability from the land and sea surface state to the atmosphere. The involved time scales depend on lead time and the forecast target. The explainable AI methods also reveal surprising driving features in sea surface temperature and 850 hPa temperature, and rank the contribution of snow cover above that of sea ice. Overall, this study demonstrates that complex statistical models, when made explainable, can complement research with NWP models, by diagnosing drivers that need further understanding and a correct numerical representation, for better future forecasts.","[Van Straaten, Chiem; Whan, Kirien; Coumou, Dim; Schmeits, Maurice] Royal Netherlands Meteorol Inst KNMI, De Bilt, Netherlands; [Van Straaten, Chiem; Coumou, Dim; Schmeits, Maurice] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies IVM, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Coumou, Dim] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Potsdam, Germany; [Van den Hurk, Bart] Deltares, Delft, Netherlands",Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; Deltares,"Van Straaten, C (corresponding author), Royal Netherlands Meteorol Inst KNMI, De Bilt, Netherlands.;Van Straaten, C (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies IVM, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",chiem.van.straaten@knmi.nl,,"van den Hurk, Bart/0000-0003-3726-7086; van Straaten, Chiem/0000-0002-7291-6777; Coumou, Dim/0000-0003-2155-8495",Dutch Research Council (NWO) [ALWOP.395],Dutch Research Council (NWO)(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)),"This study is part of the open research programme Aard- en Levenswetenschappen, Project ALWOP.395, which is financed by the Dutch Research Council (NWO).

Our results documented that (1) NPP of the study area an increasing trend from 1990-2018 shows and exhibits significant spatial heterogeneity; (2) the significant increase of NPP was mainly in the restored mining areas, indicating that the ecological restoration of mining areas can effectively improve the regional carbon sequestration capacity; (3) from 1990 to 2018, climate change released 0.136 TgC, while landscape pattern change contributed to carbon storage with 0.266 TgC; and (4) the restoration and reconstruction of vegetation in the mining areas is an important way to achieve carbon neutrality of Huangshi City in the future, and the changes of NPP varied among different ecological restoration modes.","[Liao, Qipeng; Liu, Xinran; Xiao, Mingzhu] China Univ Geosci, Sch Arts & Commun, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China; [Liao, Qipeng] Univ Barcelona, Fac Fine Art, Barcelona 08028, Spain",China University of Geosciences; University of Barcelona,"Liao, QP (corresponding author), China Univ Geosci, Sch Arts & Commun, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China.;Liao, QP (corresponding author), Univ Barcelona, Fac Fine Art, Barcelona 08028, Spain.",liaoqp@cug.edu.cn; liuxinran@cug.edu.cn; xiao_mingzhu@cug.edu.cn,,,National Social Science Fund of China [19BG133],National Social Science Fund of China,This work is sponsored by the National Social Science Fund of China (Grant number 19BG133).,,33,3,3,38,53,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

In this work we investigate the simulation of such relationship by 11 state-of-the-art atmospheric general circulation models runs with prescribed observed sea surface temperatures. In general, the Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project simulations show good skill in capturing the main characteristics of the summer MJO as well as its influence on convection and rainfall over West Africa. Most models simulate an eastward spatiotemporal propagation of enhanced and suppressed convection similar to the observed MJO, although their signal over West Africa is weaker in some models. In addition, the ensemble average of models' composites gives a better performance in reproducing the main features and timing of the MJO and its impact over West Africa. The influence on rainfall is well captured in both Sahel and Guinea regions thereby adequately producing the transition between positive and negative rainfall anomalies through the different phases as in the observations. Furthermore, the results show that a strong active convection phase is clearly associated with a stronger African Easterly Jet (AEJ) but the weak convective phase is associated with a much weaker AEJ. Our analysis of the equatorial waves suggests that the main impact over West Africa is established by the propagation of low-frequency waves within the MJO and Rossby spectral peaks. Results from the simulations confirm that it may be possible to predict anomalous convection over West Africa with a time lead of 15-20 day.","[Niang, Coumba; Gaye, Amadou T.] Univ Cheikh Anta Diop, LPAO SF, ESP, BP 5085, Dakar, Senegal; [Niang, Coumba] Agencia Estatal Consejo Super Invest Cient CSIC, Inst Geociencias IGEO, Madrid, Spain; [Niang, Coumba; Mohino, Elsa] Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Fis Tierra Astron & Atrofis 1, Geofis & Meteorol, Madrid, Spain; [Niang, Coumba; Omotosho, J.

Following the argumentative turn in policy analysis, the paper analyzes the process of problem definition by means of a framing analysis, zooming in on four major drought events covered in German farming sector journals that are published by farmers' associations. The article compares the framing of the four most-cited drought events-1947, 1975-76, 2003, and 2011-12-in order to better understand how problematization has changed over time, and how farmers justify and rationalize calls for political action. Three research questions are answered: What problems are named by farmers journals when describing drought events, and what solutions are proposed? Who is considered responsible for problems and solutions? How has framing of drought changed over time? The paper shows that farmers frame drought as a matter of justice and assert their perceived right to subsidies, compensation, farmer-friendly tax policies, and market regulations by the state. From 2003, drought has been framed in association with climate change. The data findings suggest that there is no post-productivist, post-exceptionalist paradigm shift connected to proposed drought policy solutions. Drought framings appear to be persistent, giving priority to assured farmers' incomes, not water distribution. Considering the lobby power of farmers' associations in Germany, this finding helps to understand why state interventions remain the same over time.","[Mueller, Wibke] Albert Ludwigs Univ Freiburg, Forest & Environm Policy, Tennenbacher Str 4, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany",University of Freiburg,"Muller, W (corresponding author), Albert Ludwigs Univ Freiburg, Forest & Environm Policy, Tennenbacher Str 4, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany.",wibke.mueller@ifp.uni-freiburg.de,,,"Water Network Baden-Wurttemberg - Ministry of Science, Research and Art of the State of Baden-Wurttemberg; Baden-Wurttemberg Ministry of Science, Research and Art; University of Freiburg","Water Network Baden-Wurttemberg - Ministry of Science, Research and Art of the State of Baden-Wurttemberg; Baden-Wurttemberg Ministry of Science, Research and Art; University of Freiburg","This research was funded by the Water Network Baden-Wurttemberg which is funded by the Ministry of Science, Research and Art of the State of Baden-Wurttemberg.

The model is forced with observed sea surface temperatures, changes in greenhouse gases, and ozone-depleting substances, plus solar and volcanic effects, and results from five WACCM realizations (with slightly different initial conditions) are analyzed. We focus on the vertical structure of tropospheric warming and stratospheric cooling increasing with height, the latitudinal and seasonal dependence of trends, and on the temporal evolution of stratospheric temperatures in response to stratospheric ozone depletion and partial recovery. The model captures the observed trend structure in most respects, and the ensemble of simulations provides quantitative estimates of the impact of internal variability on trend estimates. In regions of low variability (e.g., over low latitudes) the ensemble mean trends agree with the observations, while in regions of high variability (e.g., the polar stratosphere) the observations mostly fall within the range of realizations. Temperature response to evolving stratospheric ozone is evaluated by computing separate trends over 1979-1997 (ozone depletion) and 1998-2014 (partial recovery). Robust changes in temperature trends between these periods occur in the global upper stratosphere and in the Antarctic spring lower stratosphere, with consistent behavior between model and observations. Observed lower stratospheric temperatures in the Antarctic show statistically significant warming after 1998, reflecting recently reported healing of the ozone hole. Plain Language Summary This work compares temperature trends during 1979-2014 measured by satellites with results from a state-of-the-art chemistry-climate model, incorporating observed forcings including observed sea surface temperatures and changes in greenhouse gases and ozone-depleting substances, plus solar cycle and volcanic effects. We analyze an ensemble of five different model simulations (with slightly different initial conditions) to evaluate effects of internal climate variability on temperature trends. Temperature trends show good quantitative agreement between model and observations, including troposphere warming and stratosphere cooling increasing with altitude. This agreement demonstrates that the satellite-observed temperature changes are a result of known forcings, both natural and anthropogenic. Stratospheric temperatures reflect the influence of stratospheric ozone depletion and partial recovery, with stronger cooling during the first half of the record. Satellite measurements identify a warming of the Antarctic lower stratosphere since 1998, as a response to the recently reported healing of the Antarctic ozone hole.","[Randel, William J.; Wu, Fei; Kinnison, Douglas E.] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [Polvani, Lorenzo] Columbia Univ, Dept Appl Phys & Appl Math, New York, NY USA; [Zou, Cheng-Zhi] NOAA NESDIS, Ctr Satellite Applicat & Res, College Pk, MD USA; [Mears, Carl] Remote Sensing Syst, Santa Rosa, CA USA",National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; Columbia University; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Randel, WJ (corresponding author), Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA.",randel@ucar.edu,"Polvani, Lorenzo M/E-5949-2011; Zou, Cheng-Zhi/E-3085-2010; Randel, William J/K-3267-2016","Randel, William J/0000-0002-5999-7162; Mears, Carl/0000-0002-6020-9354; Kinnison, Douglas/0000-0002-3418-0834",U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF); NSF Frontiers in Earth System Dynamics grant [OCE-1338814]; NSF [AG132249]; NASA [NNX14AF92G]; Office of Science of the U.S. Department of Energy; NSF,U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NSF Frontiers in Earth System Dynamics grant; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); Office of Science of the U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"The National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) is sponsored by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF).

To date we lack scientific evidence for the relative contribution of natural and anthropogenic drivers for the majority of marine habitats in order to adequately assess the role of different stressors across the European seas. Such relationship can be investigated by analysing the correlation between environmental variables and biotic patterns in multivariate space and taking into account non-linearities. Within the framework of the EMBOS (European Marine Biodiversity Observatory System) programme, hard bottom intertidal communities were sampled in a standardized way across European seas. Links between key natural and anthropogenic drivers and hard bottom communities were analysed using Boosted Regression Trees modelling. The study identified strong interregional variability and showed that patterns of hard bottom macroalgal and invertebrate communities were primarily a function of tidal regime, nutrient loading and water temperature (anomalies). The strength and shape of functional form relationships varied widely however among types of organisms (understorey algae composing mostly filamentous species, canopy-forming algae or sessile invertebrates) and aggregated community variables (cover or richness). Tidal regime significantly modulated the effect of nutrient load on the cover and richness of understorey algae and sessile invertebrates. In contrast, hydroclimate was more important for canopy algae and temperature anomalies and hydroclimate separately or interactively contributed to the observed patterns. The analyses also suggested that climate-induced shifts in weather patterns may result in the loss of algal richness and thereby in the loss of functional diversity in European hard bottom intertidal areas.","[Kotta, Jonne;

Acheulean industries (Mode II) first appear in the later part of the early Middle Pleistocene [Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 19-13]. This paper reviews: (i) the age of the earliest Acheulean in Britain; (ii) the climates under which the earliest Acheulean industries occur, as recorded by the palaeoecological assemblages that are found at key archaeological sites; and (iii) the spatial and temporal pattern of regional climate change, i.e. the magnitude of glacial/interglacial cycles that occurred as a backdrop to the first arrival of Mode II archaeology in Britain. This review suggests that in Britain, the earliest Acheulean populations arrived during MIS 13 and that early occupation occurred under a range of climatic/environmental settings but frequently under post-temperate late interglacial or interstadial-type cool boreal environments. Furthermore, this review shows that the pattern of climate forcing in Western Europe during MIS 13-12 was not analogous to the interglacial cycles of the past 450 000 years as latitudinal climate gradients appear to have been less pronounced. The paper concludes by discussing the significance of these observations for understanding the arrival of the earliest Acheulean in Britain.

The economic growth of the inhabitants of this tribal area is hampered by a variety of biotic, abiotic, ecophysiological and geographical factors showing distinct signs of unsustainability. The natural springs and rivers freeze due to subzero temperatures (40 to -35 degrees C) from November to April. Repeated snowfall, high incidence of UV radiation, high diurnal temperature variation, negligible rainfall and high wind velocity (45-60 miles h(-1)) during winter are some of the main features of the climate of this region. The glacial melt serves as a source of irrigation during summer. The soils are shallow, sandy loam in texture, low in organic matter and neutral to alkaline in reaction. The fruit growing areas extends from 2000 m to 3200 m a.s.l., apple being the most dominant fruit crop of the tribal belts of Himachal Pradesh; while apricot in the Ladakh region, particularly for its dried products. The market value of fruits, particularly apple, apricot and almond produced from these cold desert areas, is almost double that of fruits produced from other temperate and sub-temperate parts of the country. The major proportion of high quality apples in India is produced only from the cold desert areas of Kinnaur and Spiti. To date the Delicious group of apple cultivars has dominated, with a recent trend towards spur type cultivars and color strains, whereas in apricot, Halman, Shakarpara, Charmagaz, Nari, Rakchey-Karpo, Kaisi and Suffaida are popular. Almond, walnut, wild apricot, pistachio and seabuckthorn are other important fruits of the region. The export quality fruits produced from this region are excellent in respect of colour, taste, shape and keeping quality. With the increasing global temperature and changing weather scenario the area under fruits is expanding rapidly with the addition of new areas towards higher altitudes.","[Sharma, D.

The period of economic and social recovery following the pandemic presents an unprecedented opportunity to invest in biorefineries based on the pyrolysis of agricultural residues. These produce a plethora of sustainable resources while also contributing to the economic valorization of first-sector local economies. However, biomass-derived pyrolysis liquid is highly oxygenated, which hinders its long-term stability and usability. Catalytic hydrogenation is a proposed upgrading method to reduce this hindrance, while recent studies on the use of nickel and niobium as low-cost catalysts, both abundant in Brazil, reinforce the potential synergy between different economic sectors within the country. This review gathers state-of-the-art applications of these technologies with the intent to guide the scientific community and lawmakers alike on yet another alternative for energy and commodities production within an environmentally sustainable paradigm.","[Schmitt, Caroline Carriel; Fonseca, Frederico Gomes; Fraga, Mariana M.

Is very common the use of the equilibrium line altitude as a climatic indicator, for this reason it is necessary to have the current status of the glaciers, or their state during the glacial phase we want to reconstruct. To obtain these data it is necessary to have the surface and, ideally, the volume of the glaciers. In order to obtain these delimitation a metholodogy is proposed, which consist of carrying out geomorphological sketches, in order to be able to deduce the limits reached by the ice in other periods and, after that, to carry out a reconstruction and calculation of the equilibrium line altitudes.

For these reasons, global land surface models are routinely evaluated in order to assess their ability to reproduce the observed phenological variability. In this work, we present a new approach that integrates a wider spectrum of growing season modes, in order to better describe the observed variability in vegetation growing season onset and offset, as well as assess the ability of state-of-the-art land surface models to capture this variability at the global scale. The method is applied to the Community Land Model version 4.5 (CLM4.5) simulations and LAI3g satellite observation. The comparison between data and model outputs shows that CLM4.5 is capable of reproducing the growing season features in the Northern Hemisphere midlatitude and high latitude, but also displays its limitations in areas where water availability acts as the main driver of vegetation phenological activity. Besides, the new approach allows evaluating land surface models in capturing multigrowing-season phenology. In this regard, CLM4.5 proves its ability in reproducing the two-growing-season cycles in the Horn of Africa. In general, the new methodology expands the area of analysis from northern midlatitude and high latitude to the global continental areas and allows to assess the vegetation response to the ongoing climate change in a larger variety of ecosystems, ranging from semiarid regions to rain forests, passing through temperate deciduous and boreal evergreen forests.","[Peano, D.; Materia, S.; Gualdi, S.] CSP, Fdn Ctr Euro Mediterraneo Cambiamenti Climat, Bologna, Italy; [Collalti, A.] Natl Res Council Italy ISAFOM CNR, Inst Agr & Forestry Syst Mediterranean, Arcavacata Di Rende, Italy; [Collalti, A.] Univ Tuscia, Dept Innovat Biol Agrofood & Forest Syst, Viterbo, Italy; [Alessandri, A.] Koninklijk Nederlands Meteorol Inst, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Alessandri, A.; Anav, A.] Agenzia Nazl Nuove Tecnol Energie & Sciluppo Econ, Rome, Italy; [Bombelli, A.] IAFES, Fdn Ctr Turo Mediterraneo Cambiamenti Climat, Viterbo, Italy; [Gualdi, S.] Ist Nazl Geofis & Vulcanol, Bologna, Italy",Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto per i Sistemi Agricoli e Forestali del Mediterraneo (ISAFoM-CNR); Tuscia University; Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute; Centro Euro-Mediterraneo sui Cambiamenti Climatici (CMCC); Istituto Nazionale Geofisica e Vulcanologia (INGV),"Peano, D (corresponding author), CSP, Fdn Ctr Euro Mediterraneo Cambiamenti Climat, Bologna, Italy.",daniele.peano@cmcc.it,"Gualdi, Silvio/F-3061-2015; Peano, Daniele/K-1049-2019; Collalti, Alessio/G-1701-2019; Anav, Alessandro/P-2284-2018","Gualdi, Silvio/0000-0001-7777-8935; Peano, Daniele/0000-0002-6975-4447; Collalti, Alessio/0000-0002-4980-8487; BOMBELLI, Antonio/0000-0003-0132-3090; Anav, Alessandro/0000-0002-4217-7563; MATERIA, Stefano/0000-0001-5635-2847",European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program [641816],European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program,"We thank the Editor and the two anonymous reviewers whose comments improved the manuscript.

Here, we present the results of the first such exercise for the field of sclerochronology, thereby providing an overview of persistent and emergent research questions that should be addressed by future studies. Through online correspondence following the 5th International Sclerochronology Conference in 2019, participants submitted and rated questions that addressed either knowledge gaps or promising applications of sclerochronology. An initial list of 130 questions was compiled based on contributions of conference attendees and reviewed by expert panels formed during the conference. Herein, we present and discuss the 50 questions rated to be of the highest priority, determined through an online survey distributed to sclerochronology community members post the conference. The final list (1) includes important questions related to mechanisms of biological control over biomineralization, (2) highlights state of the art applications of sclerochronological methods and data for solving long-standing questions in other fields such as climate science and ecology, and (3) emphasizes the need for common standards for data management and analysis. Although research priorities are continually reassessed, our list provides a roadmap that can be used to motivate research efforts and advance sclerochronology toward new, and more powerful, applications.","[Trofimova, Tamara; Mette, Madelyn J.; Andersson, Carin] Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, NORCE Norwegian Res Ctr, Bergen, Norway; [Alexandroff, Stella J.] Bangor Univ, Sch Ocean Sci, Bangor, Gwynedd, Wales; [Alexandroff, Stella J.; Butler, Paul G.; Scourse, James D.] Univ Exeter, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Exeter, Devon, England; [Tray, Elizabeth] Galway Mayo Inst Technol, Marine & Freshwater Res Ctr, Galway, Ireland; [Campana, Steven E.] Univ Iceland, Life & Environm Sci, Reykjavik, Iceland; [Harper, Elizabeth M.] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge, England; [Johnson, Andrew L.

Results show a delayed expansion and settlement of much of Australia following the termination of the late Pleistocene until after 9,000 years ago (or 9ka). The onset of the Holocene climatic optimum (9-6ka) coincides with rapid expansion, growth and establishment of regional populations across similar to 75% of Australia, including much of the arid zone. This diffusion from isolated Pleistocene refugia provides a mechanism for the synchronous spread of pan-continental archaeological and linguistic attributes at this time (e.g. Pama-Nyungan language, Panaramitee art style, backed artefacts). We argue longer patch residence times were possible at the end of the optimum, resulting in a shift to more sedentary lifestyles and establishment of low-level food production in some parts of the continent. The onset of El Nino - Southern Oscillation (ENSO; 4.5-2ka) restricted low-level food production, and resulted in population fragmentation, abandonment of marginal areas, and reduction in ranging territory of similar to 26%. Importantly, climate amelioration brought about by more pervasive La Nina conditions (post-2ka), resulted in an intensification of the mobility strategies and technological innovations that were developed in the early- to mid-Holocene. These changes resulted in population expansion and utilization of the entire continent. We propose that it was under these demographically packed conditions that the complex social and religious societies observed at colonial contact were formed.","[Williams, Alan N.] Australian Natl Univ, Fenner Sch Environm & Soc, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Williams, Alan N.] Archaeol & Heritage Management Solut Pty Ltd, Waterloo, Australia; [Ulm, Sean] James Cook Univ, Coll Arts Soc & Educ, Cairns, Australia; [Turney, Chris S.

GWMs are developed within different modelling frameworks and consider different underlying hydrological processes, leading to varied model structures. Furthermore, the equations used to describe various processes take different forms and are generally accessible only from within the individual model codes. These factors have hindered a holistic and detailed understanding of how different models operate, yet such an understanding is crucial for explaining the results of model evaluation studies, understanding inter-model differences in their simulations, and identifying areas for future model development. This study provides a comprehensive overview of how 16 state-of-the-art GWMs are designed. We analyse water storage compartments, water flows, and human water use sectors included in models that provide simulations for the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project phase 2b (ISIMIP2b). We develop a standard writing style for the model equations to enhance model intercomparison, improvement, and communication. In this study, WaterGAP2 used the highest number of water storage compartments, 11, and CWatM used 10 compartments. Six models used six compartments, while four models (DBH, JULESW1 , Mac-PDM.20, and VIC) used the lowest number, three compartments. WaterGAP2 simulates five human water use sectors, while four models (CLM4.5, CLM5.0, LPJmL, and MPI-HM) simulate only water for the irrigation sector. We conclude that, even though hydrological processes are often based on similar equations for various processes, in the end these equations have been adjusted or models have used different values for specific parameters or specific variables. The similarities and differences found among the models analysed in this study are expected to enable us to reduce the uncertainty in multi-model ensembles, improve existing hydrological processes, and integrate new processes.","[Telteu, Camelia-Eliza;

Here, we combine chemical transport simulations and field measurements to investigate the effect of anthropogenic pollution from an isolated metropolis on the particle number concentration over the preindustrial-like Amazon rainforest through various new-particle formation (NPF) mechanisms and primary particle emissions. To represent organic-mediated NPF, we employ a state-of-the-art model that systematically simulates the formation chemistry and thermodynamics of extremely low volatility organic compounds, as well as their roles in NPF processes, and further update the model to improve organic NPF simulations under human-influenced conditions. Results show that urban pollution from the metropolis increases the particle number concentration by a factor of 5-25 over the downwind region (within 200 km from the city center) compared to background conditions. Our model indicates that NPF contributes over 70% of the total particle number in the downwind region except immediately adjacent to the sources. Among different NPF mechanisms, the ternary NPF involving organics and sulfuric acid overwhelmingly dominates.

Black carbon (BC), dust, and other light-absorbing impurities (LAIs) darken the surface and enhance snowmelt by boosting the absorption of solar energy. It is therefore important for coupled aerosol-climate and ice sheet models to include snow darkening effects from LAI, and yet most do not. In this study, we conduct several thousand simulations with the Community Land Model (CLM) component of the Community Earth System Model (CESM) to characterize changes in melt runoff due to variations in the amount, timing, and nature (wet or dry) of BC deposition on the GrIS. From this large matrix of simulations, we develop a kernel relating runoff to the location, month, year (from 2006 to 2015), and magnitudes of BC concentration within precipitation and dry deposition flux. BC deposition during June-August causes the largest increase in annually integrated runoff, but winter deposition events also exert large (roughly half as great) runoff perturbations due to reexposure of impurities at the snow surface during summer melt. Current BC deposition fluxes simulated with the atmosphere component of CESM induce a climatological-mean increase in GrIS-wide runoff of similar to 8 Gt yr(-1), or +6.8% relative to a paired simulation without BC deposition. We also provide linear equations that relate the increase in total runoff to GrIS-wide wet and dry BC deposition fluxes. It is our hope that the runoff kernel and simple equations provided here can be used to extend the utility of state-of-the-art aerosol models.","[Li, Yang; Flanner, Mark G.] Univ Michigan, Climate & Space Sci & Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Li, Y (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Climate & Space Sci & Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",yanglibj@umich.edu,"Flanner, Mark/C-6139-2011; Li, Yang/AAJ-2682-2021","Flanner, Mark/0000-0003-4012-174X; Li, Yang/0000-0003-1972-7472",Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-SC0013991],Department of Energy (DOE)(United States Department of Energy (DOE)),This research was supported by the Department of Energy (DOE) grant DE-SC0013991.,,33,5,7,3,19,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1680-7316,1680-7324,,ATMOS CHEM PHYS,Atmos.

Using a state-of-the-art chemistry-climate model, we show that increased stratospheric aerosol loading from volcanic eruptions after 2004 impeded the rate of ozone recovery post-2000. In contrast, eruptions increased ozone loss rates over the depletion era from 1980 to 1998. We also present calculations without any aerosol chemistry to isolate contributions from gas-phase chemistry alone. This study reinforces the need for accurate information regarding stratospheric aerosol loading when modeling ozone changes, particularly for the challenging task of accurately identifying the early signs of ozone healing distinct from other sources of variability. Plain Language Summary This study examines the impact of volcanic eruptions on ozone depletion and recovery. Volcanic eruptions increase stratospheric aerosols and thereby enhance ozone depletion. Model simulations indicate that several large eruptions increased the rate of ozone depletion from 1979 to 1998, while a series of moderate eruptions after 2004 slowed the rate of ozone recovery from 1999 to 2014. The Montreal Protocol's effectiveness in restoring the ozone layer can be expected to emerge most clearly whenever volcanically quiescent periods occur in the future.","[Wilka, Catherine; Shah, Kasturi; Stone, Kane; Solomon, Susan] MIT, Dept Earth Atmospher & Planetary Sci, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Kinnison, Douglas; Mills, Michael] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Atmospher Chem Observat & Modeling Lab, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [Schmidt, Anja] Univ Cambridge, Dept Chem, Cambridge, England; [Schmidt, Anja] Univ Cambridge, Dept Geog, Cambridge, England; [Neely, Ryan R., III] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Neely, Ryan R., III] Univ Leeds, Natl Ctr Atmospher Sci, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; University of Cambridge; University of Cambridge; University of Leeds; UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); NERC National Centre for Atmospheric Science; University of Leeds,"Wilka, C (corresponding author), MIT, Dept Earth Atmospher & Planetary Sci, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",cwilka@mit.edu,"Schmidt, Anja/ABD-7113-2021; Mills, Michael/B-5068-2010","Schmidt, Anja/0000-0001-8759-2843; Wilka, Catherine/0000-0002-2917-1140; Mills, Michael/0000-0002-8054-1346",U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) atmospheric chemistry division [1539972]; NSF [AGS-138814]; NASA LWS [NNX14AH54G]; NSF; Office of Science of the U.S. Department of Energy; New Zealand Deep South National Science Challenge,U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) atmospheric chemistry division; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NASA LWS(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Office of Science of the U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); New Zealand Deep South National Science Challenge,"K.

FY-3C GNOS, on board the FY-3 series C satellite launched in September 2013, was designed to acquire setting and rising radio occultation (RO) data by using GNSS signals from both the Chinese BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS) and the US Global Positioning System (GPS). So far, the GNOS measurements and atmospheric and ionospheric data products have been validated and evaluated and then been used for atmosphere-and ionosphere-related scientific applications. This paper reviews the FY-3C GNOS instrument, RO data processing, data quality evaluation, and preliminary research applications according to the state-of-the-art status of the FY-3C GNOS mission and related publications. The reviewed data validation and application results demonstrate that the FY-3C GNOS mission can provide accurate and precise atmospheric and ionospheric GNSS (i.e., GPS and BDS) RO profiles for numerical weather prediction (NWP), global climate monitoring (GCM), and space weather research (SWR).

Here, the newly released state-of-the-art China Hourly Merged Precipitation Analysis (CHMPA) data has been used to evaluate the ten models from the fifth phase of the Coupled Models Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). Particularly, the precipitation predictions under the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP)4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios in China are assessed for the period from 2008 to 2017. Interestingly, the ensemble mean precipitation under the two emission scenarios does not show systematic differences. Intercomparison analysis of precipitation between multi-model prediction and CHMPA yields a high correlation coefficient (0.85-0.95) on the annual timescale. However, most models tend to overestimate the precipitation in northern China but to underestimate that in southern China, due to the model-simulated monsoon precipitation extending to the north earlier. Relative to UKMO-HadGEM2AO model, other models overestimate precipitation at the southeastern edge of the Tibetan Plateau where the overestimation reaches up to 150%. In terms of the temporal evolution of predicted precipitation, the multi-model ensemble produces relatively small interannual variability except for more summer monsoon precipitation with biases over 0.3 mm/day, which indicates that models are not capable of reproducing the seasonal and meridional propagation of precipitation. Compared with the original model output, the precipitation corrected by quantile mapping algorithm better agrees with the observations for spatial and temporal distributions. The findings have great implications for better utilizing model-predicted precipitation in climate change studies.","[Lv, Yanmin; Guo, Jianping; Yun, Yuxing; Yin, Jinfang; Liu, Lin; Yan, Yan; Chen, Dandan] Chinese Acad Meteorol Sci, State Key Lab Severe Weather, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Yim, Steve Hung-Lam] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Geog & Resource Management, Sha Tin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Yim, Steve Hung-Lam; Yang, Yuanjian] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Inst Environm Energy & Sustainabil, Sha Tin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Yim, Steve Hung-Lam] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Ctr Environm Policy & Resource Management, Sha Tin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yong] China Meteorol Adm, Meteorol Observat Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China",Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences (CAMS); Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese University of Hong Kong; Chinese University of Hong Kong; Chinese University of Hong Kong; China Meteorological Administration,"Guo, JP (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Meteorol Sci, State Key Lab Severe Weather, Beijing, Peoples R China.",jpguocams@gmail.com,"Guo, Jianping/K-1497-2017; yang, yang/HGT-7999-2022; Chen, Dan/GRY-2691-2022; yang, yang/GWB-9426-2022","Guo, Jianping/0000-0001-8530-8976; Chen, Dan/0000-0002-1570-9034; ",Ministry of Science and Technology of China [2017YFC1501401]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41771399]; Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences [2017Z005],"Ministry of Science and Technology of China(Ministry of Science and Technology, China); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences","The authors would like to thank the AWS-CMORPH data provided by National Meteorological Information Center of China Meteorological Administration.

This part of the Ganga floodplain region, which under the influence of undergoing active tectonic regime related subsidence, is the hotbed of annual flood disaster. This makes the region one of the best natural laboratories to test the flood susceptibility models for establishing a universalization of such models in low relief highly flood prone areas. Based on highly sophisticated flood inventory archived for this region, and 12 flood conditioning factors viz. annual rainfall, soil type, stream density, distance from stream, distance from road, Topographic Wetness Index (TWI), altitude, slope aspect, slope, curvature, land use/land cover, and geomorphology, an advanced novel hybrid model Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), and three metaheuristic models-based ensembles with ANFIS namely ANFIS-GA (Genetic Algorithm), ANFIS-DE (Differential Evolution), and ANFIS-PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization), have been applied for zonation of the flood susceptible areas. The flood inventory dataset, prepared by collected flood samples, were apportioned into 70:30 classes to prepare training and validation datasets. One independent validation method, the Area-Under Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC) Curve, and other 11 cut-off-dependent model evaluation metrices have helped to conclude that the ANIFS-GA has outperformed other three models with highest success rate AUC = 0.922 and prediction rate AUC = 0.924. The accuracy was also found to be highest for ANFIS-GA during training (0.886) & validation (0.883). Better performance of ANIFS-GA than the individual models as well as some ensemble models suggests andwarrants further study in this topoclimatic environment using other classes of susceptibility models. This will further help establishing a benchmark model with capability of highest accuracy and sensitivity performance in the similar topographic and climatic setting taking assumption of the quality of input parameters as constant.

Ionization rates were parameterized according to CRAC:CRII (Cosmic Ray-induced Atmospheric Cascade: Application for Cosmic Ray Induced Ionization), a detailed state-of-the-art model describing the effects of SPEs in the entire altitude range of the CCM from 0 to 80 km. This is the first study of the atmospheric effect of such an extreme event that considers all the effects of energetic particles, including the variability of galactic cosmic rays, in the entire atmosphere. We assumed two scenarios for the event, namely with a hard (as for the SPE of February 1956) and soft (as for the SPE of August 1972) spectrum of solar particles. We have placed such an event in the year 2020 in order to analyze the impact on a near future atmosphere. We find statistically significant effects on NOx, HOx, ozone, temperature and zonal wind. The results show an increase of NOx of up to 80 ppb in the northern polar region and an increase of up to 70 ppb in the southern polar region. HOx shows an increase of up to 4000%. Due to the NOx and HOx enhancements, ozone reduces by up to 60% in the mesosphere and by up to 20% in the stratosphere for several weeks after the event started. Total ozone shows a decrease of more than 20 DU in the northern hemisphere and up to 20 DU in the southern hemisphere. The model also identifies SPE induced statistically significant changes in the surface air temperature, with warming in the eastern part of Europe and Russia of up to 7 K for January.","[Calisto, M.] Int Space Sci Inst, Bern, Switzerland; [Usoskin, I.] Univ Oulu, Sodankylae Geophys Observ, Oulu Unit, FI-90014 Oulu, Finland; [Usoskin, I.] Univ Oulu, Dept Phys, FI-90014 Oulu, Finland; [Rozanov, E.] Phys Meteorol Observ, World Radiat Ctr, Davos, Switzerland; [Rozanov, E.] ETH, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, Zurich, Switzerland",University of Oulu; University of Oulu; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Calisto, M (corresponding author), Int Space Sci Inst, Bern, Switzerland.",Marco.Calisto@issibern.ch,"Rozanov, Eugene/V-1881-2018; Usoskin, Ilya G./E-5089-2014; Rozanov, Eugene/A-9857-2012","Rozanov, Eugene/0000-0003-0479-4488; Usoskin, Ilya G./0000-0001-8227-9081; Rozanov, Eugene/0000-0003-0479-4488",Swiss National Science Foundation [CRSI122-130642],Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission),The authors want to acknowledge to the ISSI teams for stimulating discussions.

This study shows the state-of-the-art in modelling carbonaceous aerosol over Europe by comparing simulations performed with seven chemical transport models (CTMs) currently in air quality assessments in Europe: CAMx, CHIMERE, CMAQ, EMEP/MSC-W, LOTOS-EUROS, MINNI and RCGC. The simulations were carried out in the framework of the EURODELTA III modelling exercise and were evaluated against field measurements from intensive campaigns of European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme (EMEP) and the European Integrated Project on Aerosol Cloud Climate and Air Quality Interactions (EUCAARI). Model simulations were performed over the same domain, using as much as possible the same input data and covering four seasons: summer (1-30 June 2006), winter (8 January - 4 February 2007), autumn (17 September15 October 2008) and spring (25 February - 26 March 2009). The analyses of models' performances in prediction of elemental carbon (EC) for the four seasons and organic aerosol components (OA) for the last two seasons show that all models generally underestimate the measured concentrations. The maximum underestimation of EC is about 60% and up to about 80% for total organic matter (TOM). The underestimation of TOM outside of highly polluted area is a consequence of an underestimation of secondary organic aerosol (SOA), in particular of its main contributor: biogenic secondary aerosol (BSOA). This result is independent on the SOA modelling approach used and season. The concentrations and daily cycles of total primary organic matter (TPOM) are generally better reproduced by the models since they used the same anthropogenic emissions. However, the combination of emissions and model formulation leads to overestimate TPOM concentrations in 2009 for most of the models. All models capture relatively well the SOA daily cycles at rural stations mainly due to the spatial resolution used in the simulations. For the investigated carbonaceous aerosol compounds, the differences between the concentrations simulated by different models are lower than the differences between the concentrations simulated with a model for different seasons.","[Mircea, Mihaela; D'Isidoro, Massimo; Briganti, Gino; Cappelletti, Andrea] ENEA, Italian Natl Agcy New Technol Energy & Sustainabl, Via Martiri di Monte Sole 4, Bologna 40129, Italy; [Bessagnet, Bertrand; Colette, Augustin; Couvidat, Florian; Rouil, Laurence] Natl Inst Ind Environm & Risks, INERIS, Parc Technol ALATA, Verneuil En Halatte 60550, France; [Pirovano, Guido] RSE SpA, Via Rubattino 54, Milan 20134, Italy; [Aksoyoglu, Sebnem; Ciarelli, Giancarlo; Prevot, Andre S.

The surface air temperatures over the tropical Pacific were constructed as a network, and the nodes within this network were linked if they have a similar temporal varying pattern. Using three different reanalysis datasets, we verified the percolation phase transition. That is, when the influences of El Nino/La Nina are strong enough to isolate more than 48% of the nodes, the network may abruptly be divided into many small pieces, indicating a change of the network state. This phenomenon was reproduced successfully by a coupled general circulation model, Flexible Global Ocean-Atmosphere-Land System Model Spectral Version 2, but another model, Flexible Global Ocean-Atmosphere-Land System Model Grid-point Version 2, failed. As both models have the same oceanic component, but are with different atmospheric components, the improperly used atmospheric component should be responsible for the missing of the percolation phase transition. Considering that this new phenomenon is only recently noticed, current state-of-the-art models may ignore this process and induce unrealistic simulations. Accordingly, percolation phase transition is proposed as a new test bed, which deserves more attention in the future.","[Hua, Lijuan] Chinese Acad Meteorol Sci, State Key Lab Severe Weather LASW, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Hua, Lijuan; Yu, Yongqiang] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, State Key Lab Numer Modeling Atmospher Sci & Geop, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Lu, Zhenghui; Yuan, Naiming] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, CAS Key Lab Reg Climate Environm Temperate East A, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Lu, Zhenghui] Peking Univ, Sch Phys, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Lab Climate & Ocean Atmosphere Studies, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Chen, Lin; Wang, Lu] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Int Pacific Res Ctr, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Chen, Lin; Wang, Lu] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci & Technol, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA","Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences (CAMS); Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; Peking University; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa","Yuan, NM (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, CAS Key Lab Reg Climate Environm Temperate East A, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.",naimingyuan@hotmail.com,"Yu, Yongqiang/K-7808-2012; Wang, Lu/AAI-2225-2019","Yu, Yongqiang/0000-0001-8596-3583; ","National Key Research and Development Program [2016YFA0600404, 2016YFA0601504]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41675088, 41606011]; Basic Scientific Research and Operation Foundation of CAMS [2015Z002, 2017Y007]; LASG Open Project; Major Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China [91637210]; State Key Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China [41530426]; CAS Pioneer Hundred Talents Program",National Key Research and Development Program; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Basic Scientific Research and Operation Foundation of CAMS; LASG Open Project; Major Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); State Key Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); CAS Pioneer Hundred Talents Program,"This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program (2016YFA0600404 and 2016YFA0601504) and by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41675088 and No. 41606011), and jointly supported by the Basic Scientific Research and Operation Foundation of CAMS (2015Z002 and 2017Y007) and the LASG Open Project.

We develop a bio-economic whole-farm model, which couples the process-based crop growth model CropSyst with an economic decision model at farm scale and use a genetic algorithm as optimization technique. This integrated modelling approach is employed to optimize the farmer's management decisions with regard to crop land use as well as crop-specific nitrogen fertilization and irrigation intensities under different climate and water policy scenarios. Our results show that the farm's water demand will increase by almost 100% under climate change. However, both, an increased volumetric water price and a water quota, are under current and future expected climate conditions effective policy measures to reduce the farm's water consumption. At the same time, due to adjustments in the crop mix as well as in crop-specific nitrogen fertilization and irrigation strategies, both policies lead to losses in farm income and in the farmer's utility of only about 10%. Nevertheless, a higher water price as well as a water quota increase under future expected climate conditions the crop farm's downside risk exposure (i.e. probability of low farm incomes).

However, process-based ecosystem models, which are in principal suitable for the task, are commonly evaluated at only a few sites and for a limited number of plant species. It is thus often unclear if the processes and parameters involved are suitable for model application at a regional scale. We tested the LandscapeDNDC forest growth module PnET (derived from the Photosynthetic / EvapoTranspiration model)with site-specific as well as multi-site calibrated parameters using independent data sets of eddy covariance measurements across a European transect. Although site-specific parametrization is superior (r(2) for pooled Gross Primary Production (GPP) during calibration period: site-specific = 0.93, multi-site = 0.88; r(2) for pooled Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) during calibration period: site-specific = 0.81, multi-site = 0.73), we show that general parameters are able to represent carbon uptake over periods of several years. The procedure has been applied for the three most dominant European tree species i.e., Scots pine, Norway spruce and European beech. In addition, we discuss potential model improvements with regard to the sensitivity of parameters to site conditions differentiated into climate, nutrient and drought influences.","[Molina-Herrera, Saul; Grote, Ruediger; Santabarbara-Ruiz, Ignacio; Kraus, David; Klatt, Steffen; Haas, Edwin; Kiese, Ralf; Butterbach-Bahl, Klaus] Karlsruhe Inst Technol KIT, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res IMK IFU, D-82467 Garmisch Partenkirchen, Germany; [Butterbach-Bahl, Klaus] Int Livestock Res Inst ILRI, Nairobi 00100, Kenya",Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; CGIAR; International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI),"Grote, R (corresponding author), Karlsruhe Inst Technol KIT, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res IMK IFU, D-82467 Garmisch Partenkirchen, Germany.",Saul.Herrera@kit.edu; ruediger.grote@kit.edu; Ignacio.Santabarbara@kit.edu; David.Kraus@kit.edu; Steffen.Klatt@kit.edu; Edwin.Haas@kit.edu; Ralf.Kiese@kit.edu; Klaus.Butterbach-Bahl@kit.edu,"Kiese, Ralf/A-7310-2013; Haas, Edwin/A-7890-2013; Butterbach-Bahl, Klaus/A-8081-2013; Kraus, David/B-7663-2016; Grote, Rüdiger/A-7350-2013","Haas, Edwin/0000-0003-0664-642X; Butterbach-Bahl, Klaus/0000-0001-9499-6598; Kraus, David/0000-0003-2485-8389; Grote, Rüdiger/0000-0001-6893-6890; Kiese, Ralf/0000-0002-2814-4888","EU IP ECLAIRE; German Science Foundation/Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) [GE 1090/9-1, BR 2238/13-1]",EU IP ECLAIRE; German Science Foundation/Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"This modeling study was supported by the EU IP ECLAIRE and received additional support from the German Science Foundation/Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) within the Project Modeling beech-dominated deciduous forest development based on competitive mechanisms of water and nitrogen partitioning under contract number GE 1090/9-1 and the Project Uncertainty of predicted hydro-biogeochemical fluxes and trace gas emissions on the landscape scale under climate and land use change under contract number BR 2238/13-1.

The spatial patterns of interannual sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies from the coupled models are characterized by maximum variations displaced from the coast of South America, and generally extending too far west with respect to observations. Thermocline variability is characterized by dominant modes that are qualitatively similar in all the models, and consistent with the recharge oscillator paradigm for ENSO. The meridional scale of the thermocline depth anomalies is generally narrower than observed, a result that can be related to the pattern of zonal wind stress perturbations in the central-western equatorial Pacific. The wind stress response to eastern equatorial Pacific SST anomalies in the models is narrower and displaced further west than observed. The meridional scale of the wind stress can affect the amount of warm water involved in the recharge/discharge of the equatorial thermocline, while the longitudinal location of the wind stress anomalies can influence the advection of the mean zonal temperature gradient by the anomalous zonal currents, a process that may favor the growth and longer duration of ENSO events when the wind stress perturbations are displaced eastwards. Thus, both discrepancies of the wind stress anomaly patterns in the coupled models with respect to observations (narrow meridional extent, and westward displacement along the equator) may be responsible for the ENSO timescale being shorter in the models than in observations. The examination of the leading advective processes in the SST tendency equation indicates that vertical advection of temperature anomalies tends to favor ENSO growth in all the CGCMs, but at a smaller rate than in observations. In some models it can also promote a phase transition. Longer periods tend to be associated with thermocline and advective feedbacks that are in phase with the SST anomalies, while advective tendencies that lead the SST anomalies by a quarter cycle favor ENSO transitions, thus leading to a shorter period.

However, there is still no window system on the market that can offer the flexibility required to provide a comfortable visual environment and an efficient energy response in climates where heating is required in winter, and cooling is required in summer. This paper describes an experimental investigation of a novel glazing system, designed to overcome glare and radiation damage to interior furnishings, yet which causes no reduction in the energy efficiency of the glazed opening compared with a conventional window used in direct gain systems. The proposed glazing system (patent pending) incorporates a rotatable frame holding two glazing components: transparent glazing providing a weatherproof seal, and absorptive glazing with a low shading coefficient(1). The absorptive glazing is fixed at a small distance from the clear glazing, forming an airspace between them which is sealed at the sides but open at the bottom and top, SO that air flows freely through it. In summer, the absorptive glass faces the exterior of the building, absorbing excessive solar radiation and dissipating the heat to the ambient air. In winter, the glazing assembly is rotated so that the absorbing glass faces the interior, reducing glare but allowing effective convective and radiative heating of the adjacent space.

An accurate and rapid mapping of these phenomena is a key component of effective emergency management and disaster risk reduction plans. Earth Observation big data such as the ones acquired by the Copernicus programme, are providing unprecedented opportunities to detect changes and assess economic impacts in case of disasters. This paper presents an innovative flood mapping technique based on an index which is computed using multi temporal statistics of Synthetic Aperture Radar images. The index compares a large amount of reference scenes to those acquired during the investigated flood and allows an easy categorization of flooded areas; either areas solely temporarily covered by water or areas with mixed water and vegetation. The method has been developed specifically to exploit Sentinel-1 data but can be applied to any other sensor. It has been tested for the 2010 flood of Veneto (Italy) and the floods of 2015 in Malawi and Uganda. Extensive qualitative analysis and cross-comparison with other state-of-the art methods, proved the proposed approach highly reliable and particularly effective, allowing a precise, simple and fast flood mapping. Compared to the maps produced for emergency management for the event analyzed, we obtained an overall agreement of 96.7% for Malawi and an average of 96.5% for Veneto for the 5 maps presented.","[Cian, Fabio] Univ Ca Foscari Venice, Dept Econ, Venice, Italy; [Cian, Fabio] Venice Ctr Climate Studies VICCS, Venice, Italy; [Marconcini, Mattia] DFD German Aerosp Ctr DFD DLR, Wessling, Germany; [Ceccato, Pietro] Columbia Univ, Int Res Inst Climate & Soc IRI, New York, NY USA",Universita Ca Foscari Venezia; Columbia University,"Cian, F (corresponding author), Univ Ca Foscari Venice, Dept Econ, Venice, Italy.",fabio.cian@unive.it; mattia.marconcini@dlr.de; pceccato@iri.columbia.edu,,"Cian, Fabio/0000-0002-4469-736X",,,,,92,89,92,8,89,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0034-4257,1879-0704,,REMOTE SENS ENVIRON,Remote Sens.

Nonetheless, gauging stations are distributed unevenly around the world, leaving many white spaces on global freshwater resources maps. Here, we use a machine learning algorithm and historical weather data to upscale sparse in situ river discharge measurements. We provide a global reanalysis of monthly runoff rates for periods covering decades to the past century at a resolution of 0.5 degrees (about 55 km), and with up to 525 ensemble members based on 21 different atmospheric forcing data sets. This global runoff reconstruction, named Global RUNoff ENSEMBLE (G-RUN ENSEMBLE), is evaluated using independent observations from large river basins and benchmarked against other publicly available runoff data sets over the period 1981-2010. The accuracy of the data set is evaluated on observed river flow from basins not used for model calibration and is found to compare favorably against state-of-the-art global hydrological model simulations. The G-RUN ENSEMBLE estimates the global mean runoff volume to range between 3.2 x 10(4) and 3.8 x 10(4) km(3) yr(-1). This publicly available data set (https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.12794075) has a wide range of applications, including regional water resources assessments, climate change attribution studies, hydro-climatic process studies as well as the evaluation, calibration and refinement of global hydrological models. Plain Language Summary River discharge is related to numerous impacts associated with floods and droughts. It is relatively well observed in North America and Europe, but no global data sets of monthly river discharge accounting for the uncertainty in historical hydrometeorological conditions have been available so far. Here we derive a new global 119-year-long monthly data set of river discharge at 0.5 degrees-resolution (ca. 55 km) using a machine learning algorithm and historical weather data in combination with local discharge data. This new reconstruction, the G-RUN ENSEMBLE, is publicly available (https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.12794075).

Mass production through the use of machines has improved the overall societal prosperity in industrialized countries. The great and continuous demand of mechanization, economic growth, and energy consumption has resulted in the excessive use of natural resources and the mining of natural energy deposits. Challenges such as serious environmental pollution, ecological damage, and climate change have been identified as some of the critical issues for sustainable development. Therefore, this paper proposes a Delphi and Fuzzy (DFuzzy) model in order to institute low-carbon ecocities. DFuzzy is a scientific decision-making model with quantitative multiple attributes and artificial intelligence. Twelve specialists from the Delphi experts were interviewed, including chief executive officers (CEOs) of industries, management committee members, and senior academics, all of whom have 15 years of experience in urban planning practice. After a three-round Delphi process with 17 criteria that were taken from the literature, four criteria of the DFuzzy model were recognized by experts: policy norms, resident cooperation, pollution prevention and control, and ecological reserves. The practical application of the DFuzzy model took three areas as examples: the Baiyun District and Conghua District of Guangzhou City, and the Dahu Community of Kaohsiung City. Through the experts' consensus in the two-round Delphi process, the four criteria, as the input basis, demonstrated the objective quantitative calculation function of the DFuzzy model and also indicated that the model established in this study provides a reference for evaluating low-carbon ecocities.","[Hsueh, Sung-Lin; Sun, Yue] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Nanfang Coll, Dept Art Design & Creat Ind, 882 Wenquan Rd, Guangzhou 510970, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Yan, Min-Ren] Chinese Culture Univ, Coll Business, Taipei 106, Taiwan","Nanfang College, Guangzhou; Sun Yat Sen University; Chinese Culture University","Yan, MR (corresponding author), Chinese Culture Univ, Coll Business, Taipei 106, Taiwan.",hsueh.sl@msa.hinet.net; sinyocn@gmail.com; ymr3@faculty.pccu.edu.tw,,"Yan, Min-Ren/0000-0002-8270-9763",Ministry of Science and Technology in Taiwan,"Ministry of Science and Technology in Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)",Parts of this research was supported by the grant from the Ministry of Science and Technology in Taiwan.,,46,5,5,3,19,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,2-Oct,2019,20,,,,,,5833,10.3390/su11205833,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su11205833,,,15,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,JP6US,,"Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000498398900289,View Full Record in Web of Science

Drawing on a rich array of qualitative methods and theoretical approaches, providing far-ranging empirical insights and reflecting reflexively on the implications of the research undertaken, the papers of this special section contribute to sketching out a nascent cultural geography of coastal change. In this introduction, we focus on the conceptual aspects which inform and cut across each of the contributions and which we envisage as conceptual building blocks meriting further investigation.

Aerosol composition is the key parameter affecting the refractive index, which determines how much radiation is scattered and absorbed. Composition of aerosols is unfortunately not measured by state of the art satellite remote sounders. Here we use high resolution infrared measurements for aerosol type differentiation, exploiting, in that part of spectrum, the dependency of their refractive index on wavelength. We review existing detection methods and present a unified detection method based on linear discrimination analysis. We demonstrate this method on measurements of the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) and five different aerosol types, namely volcanic ash, windblown sand, sulfuric acid droplets, ammonium sulfate and smoke particles. We compare these with traditional MODIS AOD measurements. The detection of the last three types is unprecedented in the infrared in nadir mode, but is very promising, especially for sulfuric acid droplets which are detected in the lower troposphere and up to 6 months after injection in the upper troposphere/lower stratosphere.","[Clarisse, L.; Coheur, P. -F.; Hurtmans, D.; Clerbaux, C.] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Serv Chim Quant & Photophys, Brussels, Belgium; [Prata, F.] Norwegian Inst Air Res NILU, Climate & Atmosphere Dept, N-2027 Kjeller, Norway; [Clerbaux, C.] Univ Paris 06, Paris, France; [Clerbaux, C.] Univ Versailles St Quentin, CNRS INSU, LATMOS IPSL, Paris, France",Universite Libre de Bruxelles; Norwegian Institute for Air Research; UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Earth Sciences & Astronomy (INSU); UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Universite Paris Cite; Universite Paris Saclay,"Clarisse, L (corresponding author), Univ Libre Bruxelles, Serv Chim Quant & Photophys, Brussels, Belgium.",lclariss@ulb.ac.be,"Prata, Fred/B-4020-2009; clerbaux, cathy/I-5478-2013; Clarisse, Lieven/GQQ-4657-2022","Clarisse, Lieven/0000-0002-8805-2141","F.R.S.-FNRS [M.I.S. nF.4511.08]; Belgian State Federal Office for Scientific, Technical and Cultural Affairs; European Space Agency; Actions de Recherche Concertees (Communaute Francaise de Belgique)","F.R.S.-FNRS(Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique - FNRS); Belgian State Federal Office for Scientific, Technical and Cultural Affairs; European Space Agency(European Space AgencyEuropean Commission); Actions de Recherche Concertees (Communaute Francaise de Belgique)","IASI has been developed and built under the responsibility of the Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES, France).

In many mountain ecosystems, as well as in the adjacent lowlands, glaciers play a crucial role in freshwater provision and regulation. This article first presents the state of the art on glacier monitoring and related strategies within the framework of the Global Terrestrial Network for Glaciers (GTN-G). Both in situ measurements of changes in glacier mass, volume, and length as well as remotely sensed data on glacier extents and changes over entire mountain ranges provide clear indications of climate change. Based on experiences from capacity-building activities undertaken in the Tropical Andes and Central Asia over the past years, we also review the state of the art on institutional capacity in these regions and make further recommendations for sustainable mountain development. The examples from Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, and Kyrgyzstan demonstrate that a sound understanding of measurement techniques and of the purpose of measurements is necessary for successful glacier monitoring. In addition, establishing durable institutions, capacity-building programs, and related funding is necessary to ensure that glacier monitoring is sustainable and maintained in the long term. Therefore, strengthening regional cooperation, collaborating with local scientists and institutions, and enhancing knowledge sharing and dialogue are envisaged within the GTN-G. Finally, glacier monitoring enhances the resilience of the populations that depend on water resources from glacierized mountains or that are affected by hazards related to glacier changes. We therefore suggest that glacier monitoring be included in the development of sustainable adaptation strategies in regions with glaciated mountains.","[Nussbaumer, Samuel U.; Hoelzle, Martin; Salzmann, Nadine] Univ Fribourg, Dept Geosci, Chemin Musee 4, CH-1700 Fribourg, Switzerland; [Nussbaumer, Samuel U.; Husler, Fabia; Huggel, Christian; Zemp, Michael] Univ Zurich, Dept Geog, Winterthurerstr 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Husler, Fabia] Fed Off Environm FOEN, Papiermuhlestr 172, CH-3063 Ittigen, Switzerland",University of Fribourg; University of Zurich,"Nussbaumer, SU (corresponding author), Univ Fribourg, Dept Geosci, Chemin Musee 4, CH-1700 Fribourg, Switzerland.;Nussbaumer, SU (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Dept Geog, Winterthurerstr 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland.",samuel.nussbaumer@unifr.ch,"Salzmann, Nadine/AAE-4752-2021","Nussbaumer, Samuel/0000-0002-5314-5815; Salzmann, Nadine/0000-0001-5876-7624; Hoelzle, Martin/0000-0002-3591-4377",SDC/MeteoSwiss,SDC/MeteoSwiss,"The Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) is supporting WGMS capacity building and twinning activities and SMD-related knowledge management at the Universities of Zurich and Fribourg through the Sustainable Mountain Development for Global Change (SMD4GC) program.

While the current state-of-the-art tests on anaerobic digestion feasibility are carried out at the laboratory scale, the here described tests were carried out at a pilot-to-large scale. An experimental campaign was carried out on hemp straw residues to assess the effective performance of this feedstock in biogas production by reproducing the real operating conditions of an industrial plant. An organic loading rate was applied according to two different amounts of hemp straw residues (3% wt/wt and 5% wt/wt). Also, specific bioenhancers were used to maximize biogas production. When an enzymatic treatment was not applied, a higher amount of hemp straw residues determined an increase of the median values of the gas production rate of biogas of 92.1%. This reached 116.6% when bioenhancers were applied. The increase of the specific gas production of biogas due to an increment of the organic loading rate (5% wt/wt) was +77.9% without enzymatic treatment and it was +129.8% when enzymes were used. The best management of the biodigester was found in the combination of higher values of hemp straw residues coupled with the enzymatic treatment, reaching 0.248 Nm(3)center dot kg(volatile solids)(-1) of specific biogas production. Comparisons were made between the biogas performance obtained within the present study and those found in the literature review coming from studies on a laboratory scale, as well as those related to the most common energy crops. The hemp straw performance was similar to those provided by previous studies on a laboratory scale. Values reported in the literature for other lignocellulosic crops are close to those of this work. Based on the findings, biogas production can be improved by using bioenhancers. Results suggest an integration of industrial hemp straw residues as complementary biomass for cleaner production and to contribute to the fight against climate change.","[Asquer, Carla; Melis, Emanuela; Scano, Efisio Antonio] Sardegna Ric, Renewable Energies Facil, Biofuels & Biomass Lab, 6 Str Ovest ZI Macchiareddu, I-09010 Uta, Italy; [Carboni, Gianluca] Agris Sardegna, Viale Trieste 111, I-09123 Cagliari, Italy",,"Melis, E (corresponding author), Sardegna Ric, Renewable Energies Facil, Biofuels & Biomass Lab, 6 Str Ovest ZI Macchiareddu, I-09010 Uta, Italy.",asquer@sardegnaricerche.it; emanuela.melis@sardegnaricerche.it; efisioas@tin.it; gcarboni@agrisricerca.it,"Scano, Efisio Antonio/AAW-3119-2021; Carboni, Gianluca/R-2370-2019","Carboni, Gianluca/0000-0001-9699-3550",Agris Sardegna,Agris Sardegna,This research was funded by Agris Sardegna under a three-year agreement with Sardegna Ricerche.,,54,9,9,1,7,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2225-1154,,CLIMATE,Climate,DEC,2019,12,,,,,,142,10.3390/cli7120142,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/cli7120142,,,20,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,KA1JX,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000505556200003,View Full Record in Web of Science

The sub-seasonal to seasonal (s2s) project, undertaken by WCRP, started in 2013 to improve the forecast beyond weather scale which is a challenging gap area in research and operational forecast domain. The primary objective of this s2s project is to provide the sub-seasonal to seasonal forecast in various lead times. Extended range forecast project at Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) is envisioned more than a decade ago in this way, keeping in view of the demands from the stakeholders to create a robust research background required for improved delivery of operational forecast in this scale. Extended range forecast implies an outlook with a lead-time of 2-3weeks. Several efforts have been undertaken to improve the extended range forecast in the past decade or so at IITM. The current study summarizes the development of extended range prediction system for operational implementation at IMD. The research and development that lead to the development of extended range prediction are summarized at first. It describes the efforts that were undertaken to establish the statistical properties of monsoon intraseasonal oscillations, establish the predictability horizon, represent the oscillations in state-of-art climate models and finally develop the latest state-of-art forecast technique. This technique is now operationally implemented at India Meteorological Department. The study then summarizes potential applications of extended range forecast in meteorological perspective. The primaryuse of this forecast system is the development of an operational country-wide forecast product in the extended range time scale. The application of this forecast can be made in several allied fields like agro-meteorology, hydrometeorology, health sector etc. A brief discussion is made relating the potential use of this forecast to these fields.","[Chattopadhyay, Rajib; Joseph, Susmitha; Abhilash, S.; Mandal, Raju; Dey, Avijit; Phani, R.; Ganesh, Saranya; Kaur, Manpreet; Sahai, A.

The practical consequences of such power loss are the need for larger, more expensive battery packs to perform engine cold cranking, slow charging in cold weather, restricted regenerative braking, and reduction of vehicle cruise range by as much as 40 per cent(3). Previous attempts to improve the low-temperature performance of lithium-ion batteries(4) have focused on developing additives to improve the low-temperature behaviour of electrolytes(5,6), and on externally heating and insulating the cells(7-9). Here we report a lithium-ion battery structure, the 'all-climate battery' cell, that heats itself up from below zero degrees Celsius without requiring external heating devices or electrolyte additives. The self-heating mechanism creates an electrochemical interface that is favourable for high discharge/charge power. We show that the internal warm-up of such a cell to zero degrees Celsius occurs within 20 seconds at minus 20 degrees Celsius and within 30 seconds at minus 30 degrees Celsius, consuming only 3.8 per cent and 5.5 per cent of cell capacity, respectively. The self-heated all-climate battery cell yields a discharge/regeneration power of 1,061/1,425 watts per kilogram at a 50 per cent state of charge and at minus 30 degrees Celsius, delivering 6.4-12.3 times the power of state-of-the-art lithium-ion cells. We expect the all-climate battery to enable engine stop-start technology capable of saving 5-10 per cent of the fuel for 80 million new vehicles manufactured every year(10). Given that only a small fraction of the battery energy is used for self-heating, we envisage that the all-climate battery cell may also prove useful for plug-in electric vehicles, robotics and space exploration applications.","[Wang, Chao-Yang; Zhang, Guangsheng; Yang, Xiao-Guang; Leng, Yongjun] Penn State Univ, Dept Mech & Nucl Engn, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Wang, Chao-Yang; Zhang, Guangsheng; Yang, Xiao-Guang; Leng, Yongjun] Penn State Univ, Electrochem Engine Ctr ECEC, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Wang, Chao-Yang; Ge, Shanhai; Xu, Terrence; Ji, Yan] EC Power, 341 Sci Pk Rd, State Coll, PA 16803 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park,"Wang, CY (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Dept Mech & Nucl Engn, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.;Wang, CY (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Electrochem Engine Ctr ECEC, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.;Wang, CY (corresponding author), EC Power, 341 Sci Pk Rd, State Coll, PA 16803 USA.",cxw31@psu.edu,"Wang, Chao-Yang/C-4122-2009; Zhang, Guangsheng/D-7369-2011; Leng, Yongjun/C-6523-2008; Ji, Yan/G-3031-2016; Wang, Chao/GXF-8353-2022; Yang, Xiao-Guang/L-5290-2013","Zhang, Guangsheng/0000-0001-9052-6345; Leng, Yongjun/0000-0001-9868-0195; Ji, Yan/0000-0001-9088-1670; Yang, Xiao-Guang/0000-0002-9880-3682",,,,,11,420,448,73,1030,NATURE PORTFOLIO,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,28-Jan,2016,7587,,,,515,+,,10.1038/nature16502,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature16502,,,9,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,DB7DD,26789253,,Y,N,12/21/22,WOS:000368673800034,View Full Record in Web of Science

The current state of the art for broad-scale estimates of change in biomes and ecotones between biomes is limited to equilibrium estimates of ecological change under some future equilibrium climate. Uncertainties in these estimates abound, ranging from uncertainties in future climate scenarios to uncertainties in our ecological models and finally to uncertainties in modelling the feedbacks between the climate and the biosphere. Ecologists and policymakers need to go beyond equilibrium estimates of biosphere change to transient responses of the biosphere as the climate changes. Ecotones between biomes have been suggested as sensitive areas of change that could be effectively modelled and monitored for future change. Ecotones are also important in influencing local and regional biodiversity patterns and ecological flows. The ecological processes that could affect change at ecotones and within biomes are discussed; they include internal ecosystem processes, such as competition, and external abiotic processes, most notably drought and related disturbances. Drought followed by infestations and fire appears to be the most likely process that could mediate ecological change under a rapidly changing climate. The impacts would be apparent all across biomes, not just at ecotones. However, specific predictions about the dynamics of ecotones can be made qualitatively, based on a theory of patch scaling and diversity in relation to abiotic stressors. Under current conditions, the size of homogeneous patches is expected to be small at ecotones, but to enlarge with distance from the ecotone. Directional climatic change should promote a coalescence of patches on one side of the ecotone and increased fragmentation on the other side. Ecotones should begin to blur as viewed from a satellite only to re-form at some later date in a new location. This view is in contrast to the notion that ecotones would retain sharp distinction and simply move across the landscape. These changes are presented as hypotheses based on theory and should be testable in a mechanistic modeling framework that is only now being developed.","OREGON STATE UNIV,DEPT BOT & PLANT PATHOL,CORVALLIS,OR 97331",Oregon State University,,,"Neilson, Ronald P/A-8588-2009",,,,,,38,165,177,1,49,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",1051-0761,,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

We update date calibrations with local Delta R corrections and mixtures of recent calibration curves and include five previously unpublished dates. We use histograms of calibrated medians, sorted in 100-year bins, to assess sustained regional patterns with dates associated with domestic animal bone and pottery (n = 73). While too small to be useful as a population proxy, the current set of dates does reveal three pulses of occupation separated by two clear gaps, which we evaluate with a Bayesian model of three sequential phases. The model's boundaries are used as estimates of the dates of Early (AD 80-210), Middle (AD 490-790), and Late (AD 1180-1690) occupational phases separated by two substantial lapses of 280 and 380 years, respectively. The alternating phases of presence and absence are suggestively correlated with climate shifts, leading to a discussion of the idea that effective moisture was a crucial factor in choosing whether to occupy Namaqualand. The set of archaeological dates has greater temporal and spatial resolution than many regional climate data, so we suggest that these trends may more accurately reflect the variable conditions specific to Namaqualand, at least until they are refined by future climate research.","[Dewar, Genevieve] Univ Toronto Scarborough, Dept Anthropol, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Dewar, Genevieve] Univ Witwatersrand, Rock Art Res Inst, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Marsh, Erik J.] Univ Nacl Cuyo, CONICET, Lab Paleoecol Humana, Fac Ciencias Exactas & Nat, Mendoza, Argentina",University of Toronto; University of Witwatersrand; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); University Nacional Cuyo Mendoza,"Dewar, G (corresponding author), Univ Toronto Scarborough, Dept Anthropol, Toronto, ON, Canada.;Dewar, G (corresponding author), Univ Witwatersrand, Rock Art Res Inst, Johannesburg, South Africa.",gdewar@utsc.utoronto.ca,,"Dewar, Genevieve/0000-0003-3202-4720; Marsh, Erik/0000-0003-2355-5415",,,,,75,6,6,0,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1556-4894,1556-1828,,J ISL COAST ARCHAEOL,J.

The metamodel method is gaining popularity as it offers a better balance between accuracy and calculation time. In addition, a wrapper method was used as a feature selection approach to find the best feature subsets in order to reduce models' complexity. Therefore, the performances of eleven state-of-the-art algorithms including evolutionary-based algorithms, swarm intelligence-based algorithms and human-based algorithms, coupled with a learner such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Support vector machine (SVM), were assessed. Hybrid model based on League championship algorithm (LCA), Discrete symbiotic organisms search (DSOS) algorithm, Particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm showed better results in terms of accuracy and reduction of feature input parameters. Indeed, the best desired performances were obtained with LCA-SVM for cooling load, DSOS-SVM for heating load, PSO-ANN for both heating and cooling loads. On the other hand, to optimize the annual thermal load, the NSGA-II algorithm was used. Results showed a reduction of 68% of the total annual load compared to the base case in Meknes city, 73% in Ifrane and 67% in Marrakech. The solution that reflects a compromise between the two objective functions (i.e., cooling load and heating load) gives better results in terms of CO2 emissions reduction in all climates evaluated, except in the cold climate.","[Abdou, N.; El Mghouchi, Y.; Jraida, K.; Mouqallid, M.] Moulay Ismail Univ, Natl Grad Sch Arts & Crafts ENSAM, Dept Energy, Meknes, Morocco; [Hamdaoui, S.] USMBA, Ecole Super Technol Fes, Route Imouzzer,BP 2427, Fes, Morocco; [Hajou, A.] Moulay Ismail Univ, Fac Sci Meknes, Dept Phys, Meknes, Morocco",Moulay Ismail University of Meknes; Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah University of Fez; Moulay Ismail University of Meknes,"Abdou, N; El Mghouchi, Y (corresponding author), Moulay Ismail Univ, Natl Grad Sch Arts & Crafts ENSAM, Dept Energy, Meknes, Morocco.",nawaldine1@gmail.com; elmghouchi.87@gmail.com,,"El Mghouchi, Youness/0000-0003-2164-2056",,,,,61,0,0,1,1,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",,2352-7102,,J BUILD ENG,J.

This issue has become more severe and increasingly occurred in the Mekong River Delta of Vietnam. The main objective of this work is to map soil salinity intrusion in Ben Tre province located on the Mekong River Delta of Vietnam using the Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) C-band data combined with five state-of-the-art machine learning models, Multilayer Perceptron Neural Networks (MLP-NN), Radial Basis Function Neural Networks (RBF-NN), Gaussian Processes (GP), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Random Forests (RF). For this purpose, 63 soil samples were collected during the field survey conducted from 4-6 April 2018 corresponding to the Sentinel-1 SAR imagery. The performance of the five models was assessed and compared using the root-mean-square error (RMSE), the mean absolute error (MAE), and the correlation coefficient (r). The results revealed that the GP model yielded the highest prediction performance (RMSE = 2.885, MAE = 1.897, and r = 0.808) and outperformed the other machine learning models. We conclude that the advanced machine learning models can be used for mapping soil salinity in the Delta areas; thus, providing a useful tool for assisting farmers and the policy maker in choosing better crop types in the context of climate change.","[Pham Viet Hoa; Nguyen An Binh] Vietnam Acad Sci & Technol, Ho Chi Minh City Inst Resources Geog, Mac Dinh Chi 1,1 Dist, Ho Chi Minh City 700000, Vietnam; [Nguyen Vu Giang] Vietnam Acad Sci & Technol, Space Technol Inst, Hoang Quoc Viet 18, Hanoi 10000, Vietnam; [Nguyen Vu Giang] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Div Forest Nat & Landscape, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium; [Le Vu Hong Hai] Mil Tech Acad, ITSE, Hoang Quoc Viet 236, Hanoi 10000, Vietnam; [Tien-Dat Pham] RIKEN, Geoinformat Unit, Ctr Adv Intelligence Project AIP, Chuo Ku, Mitsui Bldg,15th Floor,1-4-1 Nihonbashi, Tokyo 1030027, Japan; [Hasanlou, Mahdi] Univ Tehran, Sch Surveying & Geospatial Engn, Coll Engn, Tehran 1417466191, Iran; [Dieu Tien Bui] Duy Tan Univ, Inst Res & Dev, Da Nang 550000, Vietnam; [Dieu Tien Bui] Univ South Eastern Norway, Geog Informat Syst Grp, Dept Business & IT, N-3800 Bo I Telemark, Norway",Vietnam Academy of Science & Technology (VAST); Vietnam Academy of Science & Technology (VAST); KU Leuven; RIKEN; University of Tehran; Duy Tan University,"Bui, DT (corresponding author), Duy Tan Univ, Inst Res & Dev, Da Nang 550000, Vietnam.;Bui, DT (corresponding author), Univ South Eastern Norway, Geog Informat Syst Grp, Dept Business & IT, N-3800 Bo I Telemark, Norway.",pvhoa@hcmig.vast.vn; nvgiang@sti.vast.vn; nabinh@hcmig.vast.vn; lhvh108@gmail.com; tiendat.pham@riken.jp; hasanlou@ut.ac.ir; dieu.t.bui@usn.no,"le vu hong, hai/ABG-4109-2021; Nguyen, Vu/HGV-1806-2022; Pham, Tien Dat/N-9821-2017","le vu hong, hai/0000-0002-8787-1356; Pham, Tien Dat/0000-0002-6422-2847; Hasanlou, Mahdi/0000-0002-7254-4475; Nguyen Vu, Giang/0000-0002-6989-2778","Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology through the project Studying, Assessing, and Zoning Soil Salinity Intrusion by using Multi-temporal Satellite Imagery-A case study at Ben Tre province, National Program on Space Science and Technology (2016-2020) [VT-UD.03/16-20]","Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology through the project Studying, Assessing, and Zoning Soil Salinity Intrusion by using Multi-temporal Satellite Imagery-A case study at Ben Tre province, National Program on Space Science and Technology (2016-2020)","This research was funded by Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology through the project Studying, Assessing, and Zoning Soil Salinity Intrusion by using Multi-temporal Satellite Imagery-A case study at Ben Tre province (the grant number is VT-UD.03/16-20), which belongs to the National Program on Space Science and Technology (2016-2020).",,75,51,51,9,41,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2072-4292,,REMOTE SENS-BASEL,Remote Sens.,JAN,2019,2,,,,,,128,10.3390/rs11020128,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs11020128,,,21,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,HK4OS,,"Green Published, gold, Green Submitted",,,12/21/22,WOS:000457939400025,View Full Record in Web of Science

For state-of-the-art global climate models (GCM), especially those in which embedded cloud-resolving models replace conventional statistical parameterizations (i.e., multiscale modeling framework, MMF), the required long integrations can be prohibitively expensive. Here an alternative approach is explored, which implements Newtonian relaxation (nudging) to constrain simulations with both pre-industrial and present-day aerosol emissions toward identical meteorological conditions, thus reducing differences in natural variability and dampening feedback responses in order to isolate radiative forcing. Ten-year GCM simulations with nudging provide a more stable estimate of the global-annual mean net aerosol indirect radiative forcing than do conventional free-running simulations. The estimates have mean values and 95% confidence intervals of -1.19 +/- 0.02 W/m(2) and -1.37 +/- 0.13 W/m(2) for nudged and free-running simulations, respectively. Nudging also substantially increases the fraction of the world's area in which a statistically significant aerosol indirect effect can be detected (66% and 28% of the Earth's surface for nudged and free-running simulations, respectively). One-year MMF simulations with and without nudging provide global-annual mean net aerosol indirect radiative forcing estimates of -0.81 W/m(2) and -0.82 W/m(2), respectively. These results compare well with previous estimates from three-year free-running MMF simulations (-0.83 W/m(2)), which showed the aerosol-cloud relationship to be in better agreement with observations and high-resolution models than in the results obtained with conventional cloud parameterizations.

The authors make recommendations on the scientific knowledge needs and co design actions identified during two consultations, part of the Decade preparatory-phase, framing them in the Mediterranean Sea's unique environmental and socio-economic perspectives. According to the 'Mediterranean State of the Environment and Development Report 2020' by the United Nations Environment Programme Mediterranean Action Plan and despite notable progress, the Mediterranean region is not on track to achieve and fully implement the Sustainable Development Goals of Agenda 2030. Key factors are the cumulative effect of multiple human-induced pressures that threaten the ecosystem resources and services in the global change scenario. The basin, identified as a climate change vulnerability hotspot, is exposed to pollution and rising impacts of climate change. This affects mainly the coastal zones, at increasing risk of extreme events and their negative effects of unsustainable management of key economic assets. Transitioning to a sustainable blue economy is the key for the marine environment's health and the nourishment of future generations. This challenging context, offering the opportunity of enhancing the knowledge to define science-based measures as well as narrowing the gaps between the Northen and Southern shores, calls for a joint (re)action. The paper reviews the state of the art of Mediterranean Sea science knowledge, sets of trends, capacity development needs, specific challenges, and recommendations for each Decade's societal outcome. In the conclusions, the proposal for a Mediterranean regional programme in the framework of the Ocean Decade is addressed. The core objective relies on integrating and improving the existing ocean-knowledge, Ocean Literacy, and ocean observing capacities building on international cooperation to reach the Mediterranean Sea that we want.","[Cappelletto, Margherita;

Viticulturists, enologists, and wine makers define several types of maturity, including physiological maturity, technological maturity, phenolic maturity, and aromatic maturity. Physiological maturity is a biological concept. Technological maturity and phenolic maturity are relatively well documented in the scientific literature, being linked to quantifiable compounds in grape must. Articles on aromatic maturity are scarcer. This is surprising, because aromatic maturity is, probably, the most important of the four in determining wine quality and typicity, including terroir expression, i.e. the identifiable taste of wine in relation to its origin. Optimal terroir expression can be obtained when technological, phenolic, and aromatic maturity are reached at the same time, or within a short time frame. This is more likely to occur when the ripening takes place under mild temperatures, neither too cool, nor too hot. Aromatic expression in wine can be driven, in order from low to high maturity, by green, herbal, spicy, floral, fresh fruit, ripe fruit, jammy fruit, dried fruit, candied, or cooked fruit aromas. Green and cooked fruit aromas are not desirable in red wines, while the levels of other aromatic nuances contribute to the typicity of the wine in relation to its place of origin. Wines produced in cool climates, or on cool soils in temperate climates, are likely to express herbal or fresh fruit aromas, while wines produced under warm climates, or on warm soils in temperate climates, may express ripe fruit, jammy fruit, or candied fruit aromas. This article reviews the state of the art of compounds underpinning the aromas of wines obtained from grapes harvested at different stages of maturity. Advances in the understanding of how aromatic maturity shapes terroir expression and how it can be manipulated by variety choices and management practices, under current and future climatic conditions, are shown. Early ripening varieties perform better in cool climates and late ripening varieties in warm climates. Additionally, maturity can be advanced or delayed by different canopy management practices or training systems. Timing of harvest also impacts aromatic expression of the produced wine. Gaps in the literature are highlighted to guide future directions of research.","[van Leeuwen, Cornelis; Destrac-Irvine, Agnes; Gowdy, Mark] Univ Bordeaux, EGFV, Bordeaux Sci Agro, INRAE,ISVV, F-33882 Villenave Dornon, France; [Barbe, Jean-Christophe; Darriet, Philippe; Lytra, Georgia; Marchal, Axel; Plantevin, Marc; Pons, Alexandre; Thibon, Cecile] Univ Bordeaux, Bordeaux INP, Bordeaux Sci Agro, UMR 1366,OENOLOGIE,ISVV, F-33140 Villenave Dornon, France; [Poitou, Xavier] Jas Hennessy, 1 Rue Richonne, F-16100 Cognac, France; [Pons, Alexandre] Tonnellerie Seguin Moreau, ZI Merpins, F-16103 Cognac, France",INRAE; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite de Bordeaux; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite de Bordeaux,"van Leeuwen, C (corresponding author), Univ Bordeaux, EGFV, Bordeaux Sci Agro, INRAE,ISVV, F-33882 Villenave Dornon, France.",vanleeuwen@agro-bordeaux.fr,,"Plantevin, Marc/0000-0003-1699-1059; Marchal, Axel/0000-0002-4053-2998; DARRIET, Philippe/0000-0002-7202-8710; van Leeuwen, Cornelis/0000-0002-9428-0167",,,,,158,1,1,4,4,INT VITICULTURE & ENOLOGY SOC-IVES,VILLENAVE D ORNON,"INST SCI VIGNE VIN-ISVV, 210 CHEMIN DE LEYSOTTE, VILLENAVE D ORNON, FRANCE",,2494-1271,,OENO ONE,OENE One,,2022,2,,,,335,351,,10.20870/oeno-one.2022.56.2.5441,http://dx.doi.org/10.20870/oeno-one.2022.56.2.5441,,,17,Food Science & Technology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Food Science & Technology,2R3EB,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000820993400010,View Full Record in Web of Science

Nearly zero energy buildings cannot be realized without highly insulated building envelopes. New thermal insulation solutions are needed to fulfil the performance and buildability requirements. There is on-going strong development of new insulation materials and applications and also the performance properties of conventional insulations are continuously improved. A project was created to form road-maps for thermal insulation materials, products and solutions applicable in northern conditions. These road maps answer the needs of the building industry, applied research and authorities for the mid-to long-term periods. The main objective was to identify the R&D topics, product development priorities and the emerging and promising technologies and materials that can support technology leaps towards energy and resource efficient targets. The study included state-of-the-art report, analysis of key performance indicators of thermal insulation products, a sophisticated patent search and several interviews of professionals in the building sector. The interviews followed by workshops revealed the visions, expectations, barriers, trends and hypes that are related to the energy efficient building envelope applications. This study that was focused on Finnish perspective, but the formed road-maps cover the Northern climate conditions, European regulations and the international material and product development aspects. The challenges discovered in cold climate conditions give perspective also for the development needs and potentials in other climates. (C) 2015 The Authors.

The irregular date palm fruit ripening in the past few years is assumed to be related to climatic change. The current study aimed to design and validate an automated sensor-based artificial ripening system (S-BARS) combined with ultrasound pretreatment for artificial ripening date palm cv. Khalas. A sensor-based control system was constructed to allow continuous real-time recording and control over the process variables. The impact of processing variables, i.e., the artificial ripening temperature (ART-temp) and relative humidity (ART-RH) using the designed S-BARS combined with ultrasound pretreatment variables, i.e., time (USP-Time) and temperature (USP-Temp) on the required time for fruit ripening (RT), the percentage of ripened fruits (PORF), the percentage of damaged fruits (PODF), and the electrical energy consumption (EEC) were investigated. The quadratic predictive models were developed using the Box-Behnken Design (B-BD) to predict the RT, PORF, PODF, and EEC experimentally via Response Surface Methodology. The quadratic models were developed to make predictions using the Response Surface Methodology (RSM) and the B-BD. Design Expert software (Version 13) was used for modeling and graphically analyzing the acquired data. The artificial ripening parameter values were determined by solving the regression equations and analyzing the 3D response surface plots. All parameters were simultaneously optimized by RSM using the desirability function. The Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) between the predicted and actual experimental values were used to evaluate the developed models. The physicochemical properties of the ripened fruit were assessed under the optimization criteria. The results indicated that the pretreated unripe date fruits with 40 kHz ultrasound frequency, 110 W power, and USP-Temp of 32.49 degrees C for 32.03 min USP-Time under 60 degrees C ART-Temp and 59.98% ART-RH achieved the best results. The designed S-BARS precisely controlled the temperature and relative humidity at the target setpoints. The ultrasound pretreatment improved the color and density of the artificially ripened date fruits, decreased the RT and EEC, and increased the PORF without negatively affecting the studied fruit quality attributes. The developed models could effectively predict the RT, PORF, PODF, and EEC. The designed S-BARS combined with ultrasound pretreatment is an efficient approach for high-quality ripening date fruits.","[Mohammed, Maged; Alqahtani, Nashi K.] King Faisal Univ, Date Palm Res Ctr Excellence, Al Hasa 31982, Saudi Arabia; [Mohammed, Maged] Menoufia Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Agr & Biosyst Engn, Shibin Al Kawm 32514, Egypt; [Alqahtani, Nashi K.] King Faisal Univ, Dept Food & Nutr Sci, Coll Agr & Food Sci, Al Hasa 31982, Saudi Arabia",King Faisal University; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Menofia University; King Faisal University,"Mohammed, M (corresponding author), King Faisal Univ, Date Palm Res Ctr Excellence, Al Hasa 31982, Saudi Arabia.;Mohammed, M (corresponding author), Menoufia Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Agr & Biosyst Engn, Shibin Al Kawm 32514, Egypt.",memohammed@kfu.edu.sa,"Mohammed, Maged/Q-2131-2016; mohamed, Maged/AAL-1376-2021","Mohammed, Maged/0000-0003-3860-1306; mohamed, Maged/0000-0003-3860-1306","Deanship of Scientific Research, Vice Presidency for Graduate Studies and Scientific Research, King Faisal University, Saudi Arabia [GRANT1149]","Deanship of Scientific Research, Vice Presidency for Graduate Studies and Scientific Research, King Faisal University, Saudi Arabia","This work was supported by the Deanship of Scientific Research, Vice Presidency for Graduate Studies and Scientific Research, King Faisal University, Saudi Arabia [Grant No. GRANT1149].",,106,0,0,0,0,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4395,,AGRONOMY-BASEL,Agronomy-Basel,NOV,2022,11,,,,,,2805,10.3390/agronomy12112805,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy12112805,,,30,Agronomy; Plant Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture; Plant Sciences,6E4XX,,"gold, Green Published",,,12/21/22,WOS:000883385800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Challenges with exact meteorological directions assist to foresee and handle problems well in time. Different strategies have been investigated using various machine learning techniques in reported forecasting systems. Current research investigates climate as a major challenge for machine information mining and deduction. Accordingly, this paper presents a hybrid neural model (MLP and RBF) to enhance the accuracy of weather forecasting. Proposed hybrid model ensure precise forecasting due to the specialty of climate anticipating frameworks. The study concentrates on the data representing Saudi Arabia weather forecasting. The main input features employed to train individual and hybrid neural networks that include average dew point, minimum temperature, maximum temperature, mean temperature, average relative moistness, precipitation, normal wind speed, high wind speed and average cloudiness. The output layer composed of two neurons to represent rainy and dry weathers. Moreover, trial and error approach is adopted to select an appropriate number of inputs to the hybrid neural network. Correlation coefficient, RMSE and scatter index are the standard yard sticks adopted for forecast accuracy measurement. On individual standing MLP forecasting results are better than RBF, however, the proposed simplified hybrid neural model comes out with better forecasting accuracy as compared to both individual networks. Additionally, results are better than reported in the state of art, using a simple neural structure that reduces training time and complexity.","[Saba, Tanzila; AlGhamdi, Jarallah S.] Prince Sultan Univ, Coll Comp & Informat Sci, Riyadh 11586, Saudi Arabia; [Rehman, Amjad] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Comp, Skudai 81310, Johor, Malaysia",Prince Sultan University; Universiti Teknologi Malaysia,"Saba, T (corresponding author), Prince Sultan Univ, Coll Comp & Informat Sci, Riyadh 11586, Saudi Arabia.",tanzilasaba@yahoo.com,"Saba, Tanzila/D-4593-2018","Saba, Tanzila/0000-0003-3138-3801",,,,,35,27,27,0,5,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",2190-5487,2190-5495,,APPL WATER SCI,Appl.

Changes in one or more of these spheres can result in a cascade of changes throughout the system in ways that are often poorly understood. Here we investigate how past and present climate change have impacted permafrost, hydrology, and ecosystems on the Tibetan Plateau. We do this by compiling existing climate, hydrologic, cryosphere, biosphere, and geologic studies documenting change over decadal to glacial-interglacial timescales and longer. Our emphasis is on showing present-day trends in environmental change and how plateau ecosystems have largely flourished under warmer and wetter periods in the geologic past. We identify two future pathways that could lead to either a favorable greening or unfavorable degradation and desiccation of plateau ecosystems. Both paths are plausible given the available evidence. We contend that the key to which pathway future generations experience lies in what, if any, human intervention measures are implemented. We conclude with suggested management strategies that can be implemented to facilitate a future greening of the Tibetan Plateau.","[Ehlers, Todd A.; Appel, Erwin; Dippold, Michaela A.] Univ Tubingen, Dept Geosci, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany;

The study focuses on the performance of models used to assess impacts of pollutants on climate and air quality as part of the EU ECLIPSE project. Models, run using the same ECLIPSE emissions, are compared over different spatial scales to in situ surface, vertical profiles and satellite data. Several rather clear biases are found between model results and observations, including overestimation of ozone at rural locations downwind of the main emission regions in China, as well as downwind over the Pacific. Several models produce too much ozone over polluted regions, which is then transported downwind. Analysis points to different factors related to the ability of models to simulate VOC-limited regimes over polluted regions and NOx limited regimes downwind. This may also be linked to biases compared to satellite NO2, indicating overestimation of NO2 over and to the north of the northern China Plain emission region. On the other hand, model NO2 is too low to the south and west of this region and over South Korea/Japan. Overestimation of ozone is linked to systematic underestimation of CO particularly at rural sites and downwind of the main Chinese emission regions. This is likely to be due to enhanced destruction of CO by OH. Overestimation of Asian ozone and its transport downwind implies that radiative forcing from this source may be overestimated. Model-observation discrepancies over Beijing do not appear to be due to emission controls linked to the Olympic Games in summer 2008. With regard to aerosols, most models reproduce the satellite-derived AOD patterns over eastern China. Our study nevertheless reveals an overestimation of ECLIPSE model mean surface BC and sulphate aerosols in urban China in summer 2008. The effect of the short-term emission mitigation in Beijing is too weak to explain the differences between the models. Our results rather point to an overestimation of SO2 emissions, in particular, close to the surface in Chinese urban areas. However, we also identify a clear underestimation of aerosol concentrations over northern India, suggesting that the rapid recent growth of emissions in India, as well as their spatial extension, is underestimated in emission inventories. Model deficiencies in the representation of pollution accumulation due to the Indian monsoon may also be playing a role. Comparison with vertical aerosol lidar measurements highlights a general underestimation of scattering aerosols in the boundary layer associated with overestimation in the free troposphere pointing to modelled aerosol lifetimes that are too long. This is likely linked to too strong vertical transport and/or insufficient deposition efficiency during transport or export from the boundary layer, rather than chemical processing (in the case of sulphate aerosols). Underestimation of sulphate in the boundary layer implies potentially large errors in simulated aerosol-cloud interactions, via impacts on boundary-layer clouds. This evaluation has important implications for accurate assessment of air pollutants on regional air quality and global climate based on global model calculations. Ideally, models should be run at higher resolution over source regions to better simulate urban-rural pollutant gradients and/or chemical regimes, and also to better resolve pollutant processing and loss by wet deposition as well as vertical transport. Discrepancies in vertical distributions require further quantification and improvement since these are a key factor in the determination of radiative forcing from short-lived pollutants.","[Quennehen, B.; Raut, J. -C.; Law, K.

Here, we perform a prospective life cycle assessment of two state-of-the art cement plants, one in Sweden and one in Germany, under conventional and retrofitted oxyfuel conditions considering alternative fuel mixes with increasing bio-based fractions of forest residues or dedicated bioenergy crops. The analysis also considers effects of the projected changes in the electricity systems up to 2050. Retrofitting the cement plants to oxyfuel reduces climate change impacts between 74 and 91%, while with additional use of biomass as alternative fuel the cement plants reach negative emission between - 24 and - 169 gCO(2eq.) kg(clinker)(-1), depending on operational condition, location, and biomass type. Additional emission reduction of - 10 (Sweden) and - 128 gCO(2eq.) kg(clinker)(-1) (Germany) are expected from the decarbonization of the future electricity systems. Retrofitting the cement plants to oxyfuel conditions shows trade-offs with other environmental impacts (e.g., human toxicity, water and energy depletion), which are partially offset with projected changes in electricity systems. Our results illustrate the large climate change mitigation potential in the cement sector that can be achieved by the implementation of oxyfuel carbon capture and storage and biomass use as alternative fuel.","[Cavalett, Otavio; Watanabe, Marcos D.

The reconstructions are based on historical records from the virtual research environment Tambora (tambora.org, 2018) and official instrumental records. The historical records and recent data were related to each other through modern index calculations, drought categories and their historical equivalents. Historical and modern written documents are also taken into account to analyze the climatic effects and consequences on the environment and society. These pathways of effects are derived and combined with different drought categories. The derived historical precipitation index (HPI) is correlated with the standardized precipitation index (SPI). Finally, a historical drought index (HDI) and a historical wet index (HWI) are derived from the basic monthly precipitation index (PI) from 1500 onward. Both are combined for the historical humidity index (HHI). On this basis, the long-term development of dryness and drought in Germany since 1500, as well as medium-term deviations of drier and wetter periods and individual extreme events, is presented and discussed.","[Glaser, Ruediger; Kahle, Michael] Univ Freiburg, Inst Environm Social Sci & Geog, Phys Geog, D-79098 Freiburg, Germany",University of Freiburg,"Glaser, R (corresponding author), Univ Freiburg, Inst Environm Social Sci & Geog, Phys Geog, D-79098 Freiburg, Germany.",ruediger.glaser@geographie.uni-freiburg.de,,"Kahle, Michael/0000-0001-8571-2821; Glaser, Ruediger/0000-0001-6819-2764","Ministry of Science, Research and Art of Baden-Wurttemberg (Water Research Network, DRIeR)","Ministry of Science, Research and Art of Baden-Wurttemberg (Water Research Network, DRIeR)","This research has been supported by the Ministry of Science, Research and Art of Baden-Wurttemberg (Water Research Network, DRIeR).",,80,11,11,1,5,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1814-9324,1814-9332,,CLIM PAST,Clim.

Therefore, predictions for communities far from urbanization are in the practice, imprecise. Currently, these inaccurate predictions for the climate changes, affect the agriculture in several areas, due to inadequate planning by the farmer, which is based on a priori knowledge that the inhabitants have with the experience from the observation of the climate behavior, action that is highly imprecise and unpredictable. Therefore, in this work, for a more accurate weather forecast in rural regions, a portable low-cost meteorological device is proposed, which using suitable sensors measures and record the weather variables such as temperature, humidity of the air, luminosity, rain, humidity, and atmospheric pressure. Using these weather data, a classification of the target class set {rainy, cloudy, sunny}, is made based on the parameters obtained through the device. Then, using a combinations of assembled algorithms with deep learning, optimum results are obtained with the following classifiers: MultiClassClassifier+Multilayer perceptron, using the sampling criteria 2/3-1/3, cross validation and representative sample. The classification results are comparable and competitive, with respect to those reported in the state-of-the-art, and stands out by distinguishing the target classes with a high degree of precision.","[Galicia, Nayely; Sanchez-Delacruz, Eddy; Nakase, Carlos; Lara, David] Inst Tecnol Super Misantla, Misantla, Veracruz, Mexico; [Biswal, Rajesh R.] Tecnol Monterrey, Escuela Ingenierfa & Ciencias, Monterrey, Nuevo Leon, Mexico; [Mejia, Jose] Univ Autonoma Ciudad Juarez, Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua, Mexico",Tecnologico de Monterrey; Universidad Autonoma de Ciudad Juarez,"Sanchez-Delacruz, E (corresponding author), Inst Tecnol Super Misantla, Misantla, Veracruz, Mexico.",eddsacx@gmail.com,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1865-0929,1865-0937,978-3-030-42520-3; 978-3-030-42519-7,COMM COM INF SC,,,2020,,,,,13,25,,10.1007/978-3-030-42520-3_2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-42520-3_2,,,13,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BT4NR,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000832292000002,View Full Record in Web of Science

As a corollary to these citizen science efforts, citizen humanities engages public participation in humanities research and/or with humanities tools such as creative writing, photography, art-making, or conducting and recording interviews. In this essay, we outline our work creating a citizen environmental humanities website, Herbaria 3.0, including our motivations, process, and theoretical underpinnings. This project draws upon the critical understanding within environmental studies of the importance of narrative and storytelling for fostering a connection and commitment to environments and nonhuman beings. Situated within the field of environmental humanities, our website solicits, collects, and archives stories about the manifold relationships between plants and people, inviting visitors to read, share, or write their own story for digital publication. The kind of environmental storytelling that results, we argue, can (1) enrich our conceptualization of attachment to places, (2) expand our notion of what counts as an encounter with nature, and (3) help us recognize the agency of individual plants. We conclude that similar citizen humanities projects are crucial to the ongoing work of environmental humanities and environmental studies at large, for it is through such public engagement that we can meet the cultural challenges that seeded, and the societal problems occasioned by, ongoing climate change.","[Gianquitto, Tina] Colorado Sch Mines, Dept Humanities Arts & Social Sci, Golden, CO 80401 USA; [LaFauci, Lauren] Linkoping Univ, Unit Gender Studies, Dept Themat Studies, Linkoping, Sweden",Colorado School of Mines; Linkoping University,"LaFauci, L (corresponding author), Linkoping Univ, Unit Gender Studies, Dept Themat Studies, Linkoping, Sweden.",tinagian@mines.edu; lauren.e.lafauci@liu.se,,,"Linkoping University; Seed Box Environmental Humanities Collaboratory at Linkoping University, Sweden - Mistra, The Swedish Foundation for Strategic Environmental Research; Formas, a Swedish Research Council for Sustainable Development; Rachel Carson Center for Environment and Society, LMU-Munich, Germany; Department of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences, Colorado School of Mines, Golden, CO, USA; Department of Thematic Studies, Linkoping University, Sweden","Linkoping University; Seed Box Environmental Humanities Collaboratory at Linkoping University, Sweden - Mistra, The Swedish Foundation for Strategic Environmental Research; Formas, a Swedish Research Council for Sustainable Development; Rachel Carson Center for Environment and Society, LMU-Munich, Germany; Department of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences, Colorado School of Mines, Golden, CO, USA; Department of Thematic Studies, Linkoping University, Sweden","Open access funding provided by Linkoping University.

In recent decades, scientific assessments have indicated that the oceans are seriously degraded to the detriment of most near-future societies. Human-induced impacts range from climate change, ocean acidification, loss of biodiversity, eutrophication and marine pollution to local degradation of marine and coastal environments. Such environmental violence takes form of both 'spectacular' events, like oil spills and 'slow violence', occurring gradually and out of sight. The purpose of this paper is to show four cases of coastal and marine forms of slow violence and to provide counter-accounts of how to reinvent our consumer imaginary at such locations, as well as to develop what is here referred to as 'low-trophic theory,' a situated ethical stance that attends to entanglements of consumption, food, violence, environmental adaptability and more-than-human care from the co-existential perspective of multispecies ethics. We combine field-philosophical case studies with insights from marine science, environmental art and cultural practices in the Baltic and North Sea region and feminist posthumanities. The paper shows that the oceanic imaginary is not a unified place, but rather, a set of forces, which requires renewed ethical approaches, conceptual inventiveness and practical creativity. Based on the case studies and examples presented, the authors conclude that the consideration of more-than-human ethical perspectives, provided by environmental arts and humanities is crucial for both research on nature and space, and for the flourishing of local multispecies communities. This paper thus inaugurates thinking and practice along the proposed here ethical stance of low-trophic theory, developed it along the methodological lines of feminist environmental posthumanities.","[Radomska, Marietta; Asberg, Cecilia] Linkoping Univ, Linkoping, Sweden",Linkoping University,"Radomska, M (corresponding author), Linkoping Univ, Dept Themat Studies, Unit Gender Studies, S-58183 Linkoping, Sweden.",marietta.radomska@liu.se,"Radomska, Marietta/K-9599-2015","Radomska, Marietta/0000-0001-8520-6785",Seed Box: A Mistra-Formas Environmental Humanities Collaboratory; Ake Wiberg Foundation,Seed Box: A Mistra-Formas Environmental Humanities Collaboratory; Ake Wiberg Foundation,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by The Seed Box: A Mistra-Formas Environmental Humanities Collaboratory (M.

These state-of-the-art land models have yet to incorporate deeper, abrupt thaw in the PCF. Here we use model data, supported by field observations, radiocarbon dating, and remote sensing, to show that methane and carbon dioxide emissions from abrupt thaw beneath thermokarst lakes will more than double radiative forcing from circumpolar permafrost-soil carbon fluxes this century. Abrupt thaw lake emissions are similar under moderate and high representative concentration pathways (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5), but their relative contribution to the PCF is much larger under the moderate warming scenario. Abrupt thaw accelerates mobilization of deeply frozen, ancient carbon, increasing C-14-depleted permafrost soil carbon emissions by similar to 125-190% compared to gradual thaw alone. These findings demonstrate the need to incorporate abrupt thaw processes in earth system models for more comprehensive projection of the PCF this century.","[Anthony, Katey Walter; Anthony, Peter; Jones, Benjamin] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Water & Environm Res Ctr, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA; [von Deimling, Thomas Schneider] Max Planck Inst Meteorol, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany; [von Deimling, Thomas Schneider; Nitze, Ingmar; Grosse, Guido] Alfred Wegener Inst Helmholtz, Ctr Polar & Marine Res, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany; [Nitze, Ingmar] Univ Potsdam, Inst Geog, D-14476 Potsdam, Germany; [Frolking, Steve] Univ New Hampshire, Inst Study Earth Oceans & Space, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Emond, Abraham; Daanen, Ronald] Alaska Div Geol & Geophys Surveys, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA; [Lindgren, Prajna] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Geophys Inst, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA; [Grosse, Guido] Univ Potsdam, Inst Earth & Environm Sci, D-14476 Potsdam, Germany","University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Fairbanks; Max Planck Society; Helmholtz Association; Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar & Marine Research; University of Potsdam; University System Of New Hampshire; University of New Hampshire; University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Fairbanks; University of Potsdam","Anthony, KW (corresponding author), Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Water & Environm Res Ctr, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA.",kmwalteranthony@alaska.edu,"Frolking, Steve/ABF-9046-2021; Grosse, Guido/F-5018-2011; Schneider von Deimling, Thomas/D-8289-2013","Frolking, Steve/0000-0001-6414-5004; Grosse, Guido/0000-0001-5895-2141; Walter Anthony, Katey/0000-0003-2079-2896; Nitze, Ingmar/0000-0002-1165-6852; Schneider von Deimling, Thomas/0000-0002-4140-0495; Jones, Benjamin/0000-0002-1517-4711","NSF [ARCSS 1500931, ARC-1304823]; NASA [ABoVE NNX15AU49A, ABoVE 1572960]; ERC [338335]; HGF [ERC-0013]; ESA GlobPermafrost; BMBF [03G0836C, 01LN1709A]; DOE [DE-SC0010580, DE-SC0016440]; Directorate For Geosciences [1304823] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Office of Polar Programs (OPP) [1500931] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); ERC(European Research Council (ERC)European Commission); HGF; ESA GlobPermafrost; BMBF(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); DOE(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Directorate For Geosciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)); Office of Polar Programs (OPP)(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)),"Charles Koven provided data from the Community Land Model, version 4.5 (CLM4.5BGC).

We assess how atmospheric forcing data uncertainties affect land surface model (LSM) simulations by means of an extensive evaluation exercise using a number of state-of-the-art remote sensing and station-based datasets. For this purpose, we use the CO2-responsive ISBA-A-gs LSM coupled with the CNRM version of the Total Runoff Integrated Pathways (CTRIP) river routing model. We perform multi-forcing simulations over the Euro-Mediterranean area (25-75.5 degrees N, 11.5 degrees W-62.5 degrees E, at 0.5 degrees resolution) from 1979 to 2012. The model is forced using four atmospheric datasets. Three of them are based on the ERA-Interim reanalysis (ERA-I). The fourth dataset is independent from ERA-Interim: PGF, developed at Princeton University. The hydrological impacts of atmospheric forcing uncertainties are assessed by comparing simulated surface soil moisture (SSM), leaf area index (LAI) and river discharge against observation-based datasets: SSM from the European Space Agency'sWater Cycle Multi-mission Observation Strategy and Climate Change Initiative projects (ESA-CCI), LAI of the Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS), and Global Runoff Data Centre (GRDC) river discharge. The atmospheric forcing data are also compared to reference datasets. Precipitation is the most uncertain forcing variable across datasets, while the most consistent are air temperature and SW and LW radiation. At the monthly timescale, SSM and LAI simulations are relatively insensitive to forcing uncertainties. Some discrepancies with ESA-CCI appear to be forcing-independent and may be due to different assumptions underlying the LSM and the remote sensing retrieval algorithm. All simulations overestimate average summer and early-autumn LAI. Forcing uncertainty impacts on simulated river discharge are larger on mean values and standard deviations than on correlations with GRDC data. Anomaly correlation coefficients are not inferior to those computed from raw monthly discharge time series, indicating that the model reproduces inter-annual variability fairly well. However, simulated river discharge time series generally feature larger variability compared to measurements. They also tend to overestimate winter-spring high flows and underestimate summer-autumn low flows. Considering that several differences emerge between simulations and reference data, which may not be completely explained by forcing uncertainty, we suggest several research directions. These range from further investigating the discrepancies between LSMs and remote sensing retrievals to developing new model components to represent physical and anthropogenic processes.","[Gelati, Emiliano; Decharme, Bertrand; Calvet, Jean-Christophe; Minvielle, Marie; Fairbairn, David] CNRS, Meteo France, CNRM, UMR3589, Toulouse, France; [Polcher, Jan] CNRS, IPSL, Lab Meteorol Dynam, UMR8539, Paris, France; [Weedon, Graham P.] Joint Ctr Hydrometeorol Res, Met Off, Wallingford, Oxon, England; [Gelati, Emiliano] European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Ispra, Italy; [Fairbairn, David] European Ctr Medium Range Weather Forecasts, Reading, Berks, England",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Earth Sciences & Astronomy (INSU); Meteo France; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Earth Sciences & Astronomy (INSU); UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Universite Paris Cite; Met Office - UK; European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site; European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF),"Calvet, JC (corresponding author), CNRS, Meteo France, CNRM, UMR3589, Toulouse, France.",jean-christophe.calvet@meteo.fr,"Gelati, Emiliano/E-5022-2018; Weedon, Graham P./B-7574-2008; Calvet, Jean-Christophe/A-8762-2012; Decharme, Bertrand/Z-4563-2019","Gelati, Emiliano/0000-0002-8972-8561; Weedon, Graham P./0000-0003-1262-9984; Calvet, Jean-Christophe/0000-0001-6425-6492; Decharme, Bertrand/0000-0002-8661-1464; Fairbairn, David/0000-0002-6495-7384; polcher, Jan/0000-0001-9020-5795",French REMEMBER project within the HYMEX initiative [ANR 2012 SOCENV 001]; European FP7 project: eartH2Observe [603608]; European FP7 project: ImagineS [311766]; Joint DECC and Defra Integrated Climate Program - DECC/Defra [GA01101],French REMEMBER project within the HYMEX initiative; European FP7 project: eartH2Observe; European FP7 project: ImagineS; Joint DECC and Defra Integrated Climate Program - DECC/Defra,"We are thankful to Emanuel Dutra and Gianpaolo Balsamo (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, ECMWF, Reading, UK) for providing the ERA-Interim atmospheric forcing dataset as well as the GPCP-corrected version.

Previous model studies employed grid resolutions at which the impact of mesoscale eddies has to be parameterized. We present results of a state-of-the-art eddy-resolving global ocean model with a closed Drake Passage and compare with results of the same model at noneddying resolution. An analysis of the pathways of heat by decomposing the meridional heat transport into eddy, horizontal, and overturning circulation components indicates that the model behavior on the large scale is qualitatively similar at both resolutions. Closing Drake Passage induces (i) sea surface warming around Antarctica due to equatorward expansion of the subpolar gyres, (ii) the collapse of the overturning circulation related to North Atlantic Deep Water formation leading to surface cooling in the North Atlantic, and (iii) significant equatorward eddy heat transport near Antarctica. However, quantitative details significantly depend on the chosen resolution. The warming around Antarctica is substantially larger for the noneddying configuration (approximate to 5.5 degrees C) than for the eddying configuration (approximate to 2.5 degrees C). This is a consequence of the subpolar mean flow which partitions differently into gyres and circumpolar current at different resolutions. We conclude that for a deciphering of the different mechanisms active in Eocene-Oligocene climate change detailed analyses of the pathways of heat in the different climate subsystems are crucial in order to clearly identify the physical processes actually at work.","[Viebahn, Jan P.; von der Heydt, Anna S.; Le Bars, Dewi; Dijkstra, Henk A.] Univ Utrecht, Inst Marine & Atmospher Res Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University,"Viebahn, JP (corresponding author), Univ Utrecht, Inst Marine & Atmospher Res Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands.",J.P.Viebahn@uu.nl,"Dijkstra, Henk A./H-2559-2016; von der Heydt, Anna S/B-9250-2008; Le Bars, Dewi/AAK-8631-2020","von der Heydt, Anna S/0000-0002-5557-3282; Le Bars, Dewi/0000-0002-1175-4225","Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO), Earth and Life Sciences [ALW 802.01.024]; NWO [SH-209-14]","Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO), Earth and Life Sciences(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)); NWO(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO))","The model data used in this paper are available from the corresponding author upon request (j.p.viebahn@uu.nl).

Compared to the state of the art, these layers were sufficiently improved and characterized by spectroscopic methods, by scanning electron microscopy and by gas permeation measurements. Water vapor transmission rates (WVTR) below 10(-2) g m(-2) d(-1) were achieved. In this way, single barrier films were developed and produced on a pilot plant from roll to roll, 250 mm wide, at speeds up to 10 m min(-1). Two films were laminated using adhesives curable with ultraviolet (UV) light and evaluated by peel tests, gas permeation measurement and climate testing. It could be shown that the described high-barrier laminates which exhibit WVTR approximate to 5 x 10(-4) g m(-2) d(-1), determined by the calcium mirror method, are suitable for encapsulation of flexible thin-film photovoltaic modules. Durability of the encapsulated modules could be verified in several climate tests including damp-heat, thermo-cycle (heating, freezing, wetting) and UV exposures which are equivalent to more than 20 years of endurance at outdoor conditions in temperate climate. In the frame of further research and technical development it seems to be possible to design a cost efficient industrial scale process for the production of encapsulation films for photovoltaic applications.

Extremes are expressed in terms of return values using a time-dependent generalized extreme value (GEV) model fitted to monthly maxima. Unlike the standard GEV method, this approach allows analyzing return periods at different time scales (monthly, seasonal, annual, etc). The study focuses on the end of the 20th century (1961-2000), used as a calibration/validation period, and assesses the changes projected for the period 2061-2100 considering the A1B emission scenario. The performance of the regional models is evaluated for each season of the calibration period against the high-resolution gridded E-OBS dataset, showing a similar South-North gradient with larger values over the Mediterranean basin. The inter-RCM changes in the bias pattern with respect to the E-OBS are larger than the bias resulting from a change in the boundary conditions from ERA-40 to ECHAM5 20c3m. The maximum temperature response to increased green house gases, as projected by the A1B scenario, is consistent for both RCMs. Under that scenario, results indicate that the increments for extremes (e.g. 40-year return values) will be two or three times higher than those for the mean seasonal temperatures, particularly during Spring and Summer in Southern Europe.","[Dolores Frias, Maria] Univ Cantabria, Dept Appl Math & Comp Sci, E-39005 Santander, Spain; [Minguez, Roberto; Mendez, Fernando J.] Univ Cantabria, Environm Hydraul Inst IH Cantabria, Santander 39011, Spain; [Manuel Gutierrez, Jose] CSIC UC, Inst Fis Cantabria, Santander 39005, Spain",Universidad de Cantabria; Universidad de Cantabria; IHCantabria - Instituto de Hidraulica Ambiental de la Universidad de Cantabria; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); Universidad de Cantabria; CSIC - Instituto de Fisica de Cantabria (IFCA),"Frias, MD (corresponding author), Univ Cantabria, Dept Appl Math & Comp Sci, Avd Castros S-N, E-39005 Santander, Spain.",friasmd@unican.es,"Mínguez, Roberto/B-8134-2015; Frias, Maria Dolores MD/F-4874-2012; Gutiérrez, José M./C-5754-2009; Gutiérrez, José/GSJ-1846-2022","Mínguez, Roberto/0000-0001-7180-3845; Gutierrez, Jose Manuel/0000-0002-2766-6297; Frias, Maria Dolores/0000-0001-5148-1156; Mendez, Fernando/0000-0002-5005-1100","EU [505539]; Spanish Ministry MICINN [CSD2007-00067, CTM2010-15009, CGL2010-21869]; Spanish Ministry MARM [200800050084091, 200800050084265]; Spanish Ministry MF [E17/08]","EU(European Commission); Spanish Ministry MICINN(Ministry of Science and Innovation, Spain (MICINN)Spanish Government); Spanish Ministry MARM; Spanish Ministry MF","The ENSEMBLES data used in this work was funded by the EU FP6 Integrated Project ENSEMBLES (Contract number 505539) whose support is gratefully acknowledged.

We use a large number and combinations of datasets to obtain insights into the impact of the error correlations among different datasets that affect 3CH estimates. Error correlations may be caused by actual correlations of errors, representativeness differences, or imperfect collocation of the datasets. We show that the 3CH method discriminates among the datasets and how error statistics of observations compare to state-of-the-art reanalyses and forecasts, as well as reanalyses that do not assimilate satellite data. We explore results for October and November 2006 and 2019 over different latitudinal regions and show error growth of the NCEP forecasts with time.

Particularly important was the severe drought of the 1970s and 1980s, which had widespread impacts(1-6). Research into the causes of this drought has identified anthropogenic aerosol forcing(3,4,7) and changes in sea surface temperatures (SSTs; refs 1,2,6,8-11) as the most important drivers. Since the 1980s, there has been some recovery of Sahel rainfall amounts(2-6,11-14), although not to the pre-drought levels of the 1940s and 1950s. Here we report on experiments with the atmospheric component of a state-of-the-art global climate model to identify the causes of this recovery. Our results suggest that the direct influence of higher levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere was the main cause, with an additional role for changes in anthropogenic aerosol precursor emissions. We find that recent changes in SSTs, although substantial, did not have a significant impact on the recovery. The simulated response to anthropogenic greenhouse-gas and aerosol forcing is consistent with a multivariate fingerprint of the observed recovery, raising confidence in our findings. Although robust predictions are not yet possible, our results suggest that the recent recovery in Sahel rainfall amounts is most likely to be sustained or amplified in the near term.","[Dong, Buwen; Sutton, Rowan] Univ Reading, Natl Ctr Atmospher Sci, Dept Meteorol, Reading RG6 6BB, Berks, England",UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); NERC National Centre for Atmospheric Science; University of Reading,"Dong, BW (corresponding author), Univ Reading, Natl Ctr Atmospher Sci, Dept Meteorol, Reading RG6 6BB, Berks, England.",b.dong@reading.ac.uk; r.sutton@reading.ac.uk,,"Sutton, Rowan/0000-0001-8345-8583; Dong, Buwen/0000-0003-0809-7911","PAGODA project of Changing Water Cycle programme of the UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/I006672/1]; European Union [607085]; UK National Centre for Atmospheric Science - Natural Environment Research Council; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/I006672/1, ncas10009] Funding Source: researchfish; NERC [NE/I006672/1] Funding Source: UKRI",PAGODA project of Changing Water Cycle programme of the UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); European Union(European Commission); UK National Centre for Atmospheric Science - Natural Environment Research Council; Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"This work was supported by the PAGODA project of Changing Water Cycle programme of the UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) under grant NE/I006672/1 and the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme [FP7/2007-2013] under grant agreement no 607085.

Transmission pipeline networks are suited particularly for connecting primary hydrogen producers and consumers over medium distances to meet the future hydrogen demand in regions that strongly rely on energy imports. Nonetheless, the development and operation of large-scale hydrogen pipeline networks may have various yet unknown impacts on the envi-ronment. This work investigates the energetic efficiency and the environmental performance of hydrogen transport via pipeline by means of thermodynamic analysis and life cycle assessment. Pertinent technical spec-ifications for large-scale hydrogen pipeline networks were derived based on the current design of state-of-the-art hydrogen pipelines and compressor stations. Since the energy-efficient operation of the pipeline network is essential for a climate-friendly hydrogen transport, thermodynamic analyses were performed to determine the resulting energy demand. Depending on the impact category considered, there are advantages and trade-offs in aiming for an energy-efficient as well as environmentally friendly hydrogen transport solution. The most decisive parameters to reach these aims are the condition of the line pipe's inner layer, the applied load capacity, as well as the compression ratios,-stages and-positioning. By varying these parameters and considering multiple transport variants, we recommend three measures for the design and operation of new or repurposed hydrogen","[Tsiklios, C.; Hermesmann, M.; Mueller, T.

This can be concluded from a review of the Comprehensive Assessments on the energy efficiency potential in the heating and cooling sector performed by European Union Member States under Art. 14 of the Energy Efficiency Directive. This article estimates the potential space cooling demands in the residential sector of the EU and the resulting impact on electricity generation and supply systems using the United States as a proxy. A georeferenced approach was used to establish the potential residential space cooling demand in NUTS-3 regions of EU. The total potential space cooling demand of the EU was estimated to be 292 TW h for the residential sector in an average year. The additional electrical capacity needed was estimated to 79 GW. With proper energy system development strategies, e.g. matching capacity of solar PV with cooling demand, or introduction of district cooling, the stresses on electricity system from increasing cooling demand can be mitigated. The estimated potential of space cooling demand, identified in this paper for all EU Members States, could be used while preparing the next iteration of EU MS Comprehensive Assessments or other energy related studies.","[Jakubcionis, Mindaugas; Carlsson, Johan] European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Inst Energy & Transport, POB 2, NL-1755 ZG Petten, Netherlands",European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC Institute for Energy & Transport (IET),"Jakubcionis, M (corresponding author), European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Inst Energy & Transport, POB 2, NL-1755 ZG Petten, Netherlands.",mindaugas.jakubcionis@ec.europa.eu,,,,,,,26,64,64,2,5,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,FEB,2017,,,,,225,235,,10.1016/j.enpol.2016.11.047,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2016.11.047,,,11,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EI8PD,,hybrid,,,12/21/22,WOS:000392768800022,View Full Record in Web of Science

The analysis of up-to-date satellite datasets, atmospheric re-analyses and our control coupled simulation suggests that the model broadly reproduces the radiation budgets close to re-analyses and observed datasets. However, there are large uncertainties in the top-of-atmosphere radiation budget over the Northern Hemishere (NH) subtropical desert region during boreal summer; while the model has a rather neutral radiation budget during boreal summer over the Sahara Desert, the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts Interim reanalysis show in contrast a radiative excess throughout the NH desert region and the up-to-date satellite dataset has a clear negative radiation budget over north-eastern Sahara region and over Arabian Peninsula. Taking into account these incertitudes, our key finding is that by darkening the deserts and arid regions to the west of ISM through a negative albedo perturbation in our coupled model, the length and intensity of the rainy season over the Indian region are both significantly increased with two well-defined rainfall anomaly maxima in May-June and September-October. The ISM onset is advanced by 1month and is characterized by a rapid northward propagation of the rainfall band over the Indian domain. Reversing the sign of our artificial albedo perturbation over the deserts in the model gives an opposite response, highlighting the robust role of the subtropical deserts in the ISM system, but the amplitude of the ISM response is also significantly larger, demonstrating nonlinearity in the monsoon-desert relationship. Additional albedo perturbation experiments further demonstrate that the whole hot subtropical deserts extending across Afro-Asian continents, and including the Sahara, plays a key-role in the ISM response. Finally, the modulations of the meridional tropospheric temperature gradient along with stronger equatorial asymmetry of mean easterly shear and moisture distribution over the Indian domain are key-factors for explaining the ISM response and its nonlinearity to the albedo perturbations over the NH subtropical deserts. Further insights from moisture budget show that the nonlinearity in advection moisture tendencies manifests in nonlinearity of the ISM response.","[Sooraj, K.

These values are then compared to two state-of-the-art radiative transfer models to determine if the models are accurately partitioning solar absorption between the atmosphere and the ocean. The paper develops an independent approach to obtain a clear-sky signal from 10-s resolution surface pyranometer data that is in excellent agreement with upper envelope methods. Over a diurnal average, the ocean absorbs 70.9% +/- 1.3% of the solar radiation incident at the top of the atmosphere (TOA). The data, measured from ship and low-flying aircraft platforms, also yield the zenith angle dependence of the surface absorption. The clear-sky data are representative of dry regions east of the date line during March 1993, Likewise, a combination of tropopause albedo measurements from the ER-2 aircraft and Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) clear-sky TOA albedos are used to find the absorption of solar radiation by the atmosphere (integrated from the surface to the TOA). Clear-sky TOA albedo is computed from the ER-2 tropopause measurements using a radiative transfer model and measurements of stratospheric aerosol and ozone. The computed TOA albedos agree with ERBE at about 6% for overhead sun, The diurnal average fractional atmospheric column absorption is 20.2% +/- 1.6%. Two multispectral radiation models agree to within 5 W m(-2) of the observed daily average clear-sky oceanic solar absorption when the atmospheric profile is constrained by measurements and the observed TOA albedo is used as a boundary condition.","UNIV HAMBURG,INST METEOROL,D-2000 HAMBURG,GERMANY",University of Hamburg,"Conant, WC (corresponding author), UNIV CALIF SAN DIEGO,SCRIPPS INST OCEANOG,CTR CLOUDS CHEM & CLIMATE,9500 GILMAN DR,LA JOLLA,CA 92093, USA.",,,,,,,,27,29,30,0,4,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693",0894-8755,,,J CLIMATE,J.

This review discusses the present state of CCS research and development, the advantages of the various approaches, and the barriers to commercialization that exist today. It also provides an evaluation of certain practical small- and large-scale CCS applications. The high initial investment, as well as ongoing maintenance costs, plague today's commercially accessible CO2 capture technologies, including absorption, adsorption, membranes, and cryogenic separation. Gas hydrate-based capture has the potential to become the dominant method for CO2 separation because of the high recovery rates and purity it provides. Hydrate-based technologies, including CO2 capture, CO2 separation, and transportation, can also be used to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and have excellent application potential. Despite this, the potential of technology based on gas hydrates to help reduce the effects of climate change in the future has received little attention. This study discusses cosmopolitan energy provision and environmental challenges and conversions, and the role of gas hydrates in the carbon cycle. This paper summarizes the state-of-the-art developments in hydrate-based reactors, thereby providing a perspective on the roles of NGHs in the future energy supply and climate change mitigation. In all these areas, we focus on identifying future CCS challenges and the technological development risk in gas hydrate-based systems, which should be highlighted in the next several decades.","[Rehman, Adeel Ur; Lal, Bhajan] Univ Teknol PETRONAS, CO2 Res Ctr CO2RES, Bandar Seri Iskandar 32610, Perak, Malaysia; [Rehman, Adeel Ur; Lal, Bhajan] Univ Teknol PETRONAS, Dept Chem Engn, Bandar Seri Iskandar 32610, Perak, Malaysia",Universiti Teknologi Petronas; Universiti Teknologi Petronas,"Lal, B (corresponding author), Univ Teknol PETRONAS, CO2 Res Ctr CO2RES, Bandar Seri Iskandar 32610, Perak, Malaysia.;Lal, B (corresponding author), Univ Teknol PETRONAS, Dept Chem Engn, Bandar Seri Iskandar 32610, Perak, Malaysia.",bhajan.lal@utp.edu.my,,,,,,,153,0,0,4,4,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1996-1073,,ENERGIES,Energies,NOV,2022,21,,,,,,8309,10.3390/en15218309,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en15218309,,,27,Energy & Fuels,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Energy & Fuels,6B5ZY,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000881412200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Three 15-year numerical experiments were completed: the first with realistic vegetation characteristics varying monthly (VEG run), the second without vegetation over land (NOVEG run), and the third with the vegetation characteristics held at their annual mean values (VEGMEAN run). In these models, the hydrological cycle and land surface energy budget were widely affected by vegetation. Global- and annual-mean evapotranspiration significantly increased by 11.8% in the VEG run compared with the NOVEG run, while runoff decreased by 13.2% when the realistic vegetation is incorporated. Vegetation plays different roles in different regions. In tropical Asia, vegetation-induced cooling of the land surface plays a crucial role in decreasing tropical precipitation. In middle latitudes and the Amazon region, however, the vegetation-induced increase of evapotranspiration plays a more important role in increasing precipitation. The seasonal variation of vegetation also shows clear influences on the hydrological cycle and energy budget. In the boreal mid-high latitudes where vegetation shows a strong seasonal cycle, evapotranspiration and precipitation are higher in the summer in the VEG run than in the VEGMEAN run.","[Xu Zhongfeng; Fu Congbin] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, RCE, TEA, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Xu Zhongfeng; Zeng Gang] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Minist Educ, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Fu Congbin] Nanjing Univ, Sch Atmospher Sci, Nanjing 210093, Jiangsu, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Nanjing University","Xu, ZF (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, RCE, TEA, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.",xuzhf@tea.ac.cn,"Xu, Zhongfeng/N-6715-2019","Xu, Zhongfeng/0000-0002-1274-6438",National Basic Research Program of China [2006CB400502]; Foundation of the Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Meteorological Disaster [KLME0704]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [20070410133],National Basic Research Program of China(National Basic Research Program of China); Foundation of the Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Meteorological Disaster; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation),"This research is supported jointly by the National Basic Research Program of China (Grant No. 2006CB400502), the Foundation of the Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Meteorological Disaster KLME0704, and the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation 20070410133.",,27,2,2,0,0,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1674-2834,2376-6123,,ATMOS OCEAN SCI LETT,Atmos.

Hence, the scarcity of virgin resources and consequently the increase of environmental effects such as Global Warming Potential (GWP) have been measured based on the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). It has been illustrated that the architecture trend has increased the environmental impact of new materials by 5 times the old ones in GWP. To optimize and increase resource productivity, a review of buildings by the principles of Circular Economy (CE) has shown that 10% of old house materials and 3% of new house materials could be returned to the chain based on the CE concept. Other than reducing the GWP emissions of the construction industry and the development of zero waste systems, this paper, by replac-ing conventional materials with biocompatible, has been able to increase the Building Circularity (BC) by 27% in the old house and 3% in the new one, which emphasizes a regenerative approach. As a result, with this solution, more integrity would be observed between the construction environment and nature, both in the development of past architecture and in the improvement of future architecture.

It ensembles core emerging technologies that lay out the platform for spatial decision-making, geo-computation and location-based services (LBS). In the past few decades, rapid developments in geolocation-based platforms and services have made significant contributions towards emerging markets and applications like spatial data infrastructure (SDI), digital earth observations (EO), precision agriculture, location-based commerce (l-commerce), mobile commerce (m-commerce), e-commerce, e-governance, etc. These technologies have also indispensably effected the institutionalization of e-agriculture in the agricultural sector (the primary driver of economy across nations), which thrives with improved productivity and sustainability (adaptive to climate change). However, Geo-ICDTs face adamant challenge in the form of developing, implementing, integrating and steering adaptability among end-users. Understanding stochastic behaviour of these parameters requires capturing real-time/near real-time data from several sources, such as sensor networks, remote sensing, crowdsourcing, experimental setups and lab-based studies. These requirements necessitate development of a system of things infrastructure that can capture location-specific data from several sources and can communicate with each other, thus evolving as an integrated system. This system of things is often referred as the Internet of things (IoT), which works under the framework of Geo-ICDT. This chapter closely discusses the MMA (monitoring, management and adaptation) framework, its components and their implementation in precision agriculture.","[Suradhaniwar, Saurabh; Kar, Soumyashree; Nandan, Rohit; Raj, Rahul; Jagarlapudi, Adinarayana] Indian Inst Technol, Ctr Studies Resources Engn, Mumbai 400076, Maharashtra, India",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Bombay,"Jagarlapudi, A (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol, Ctr Studies Resources Engn, Mumbai 400076, Maharashtra, India.",adi@iitb.ac.in,"Raj, Rahul/AGE-3988-2022; Raj, Rahul/AAS-8008-2021","Raj, Rahul/0000-0002-4620-0409; Nandan, Rohit/0000-0002-1219-7598",,,,,108,4,4,0,4,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",,,978-3-319-78711-4; 978-3-319-78710-7,GEOTECH ENVIRON,,,2018,,,,,75,99,,10.1007/978-3-319-78711-4_5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-78711-4_5,10.1007/978-3-319-78711-4,,25,"Geography, Physical; Remote Sensing",Book Citation Index – Science (BKCI-S),Physical Geography; Remote Sensing,BN4IU,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000481929300007,View Full Record in Web of Science

We use the state-of-the-art ECHAM6-HAMMOZ global chemistry-climate model to investigate the seasonal transport of anthropogenic Asian sulfate aerosols and their impact on the UTLS. Sensitivity simulations for SO2 emission perturbation over India (48% increase) and China (70% decrease) are performed based on the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) satellite-observed trend, rising over India by similar to 4.8% per year and decreasing over China by similar to 7.0% per year during 2006-2017. The enhanced Indian emissions result in an increase in aerosol optical depth (AOD) loading in the UTLS by 0.61 to 4.17% over India. These aerosols are transported to the Arctic during all seasons by the lower branch of the Brewer-Dobson circulation enhancing AOD by 0.017% to 4.8 %. Interestingly, a reduction in SO2 emission over China inhibits the transport of Indian sulfate aerosols to the Arctic in summer-monsoon and post-monsoon seasons due to subsidence over northern India. The region of sulfate aerosol enhancement shows significant warming in the UTLS over northern India, south China (0.2 +/- 0.15 to 0.8 +/- 0.72 K) and the Arctic (similar to 1 +/- 0.62 to 1.6 +/- 1.07 K). The estimated seasonal mean direct radiative forcing at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) induced by the increase in Indian SO2 emission is -0.2 to -1.5 W m(-2) over northern India. The Chinese SO2 emission reduction leads to a positive radiative forcing of similar to 0.6 to 6 W m(-2) over China. The decrease in vertical velocity and the associated enhanced stability of the upper troposphere in response to increased Indian SO2 emissions will likely decrease rainfall over India.","[Fadnavis, Suvarna; Kalita, Gayatry] Indian Inst Trop Meteorol, Ctr Climate Change Res, Pune, Maharashtra, India; [Mueller, Rolf] Forschungszentrum Julich, IEK7, Julich, Germany; [Rowlinson, Matthew; Rap, Alexandru] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Li, Jui-Lin Frank] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA USA; [Gasparini, Blaz] Univ Washington, Dept Atmospher Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Laakso, Anton] Finnish Meteorol Inst, Kuopio, Finland",Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) - India; Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM); Centre for Climate Change Research - India; Helmholtz Association; Research Center Julich; University of Leeds; California Institute of Technology; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL); University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; Finnish Meteorological Institute,"Fadnavis, S (corresponding author), Indian Inst Trop Meteorol, Ctr Climate Change Res, Pune, Maharashtra, India.",suvarna@tropmet.res.in,"Müller, Rolf/ABA-8213-2021; Müller, Rolf/A-6669-2013; Fadnavis, Suvarna S/AAA-7485-2020; Rap, Alexandru/G-7532-2016; Gasparini, Blaž/AAV-5206-2020","Müller, Rolf/0000-0002-5024-9977; Müller, Rolf/0000-0002-5024-9977; Fadnavis, Suvarna S/0000-0003-4442-0755; Rap, Alexandru/0000-0002-2319-6769; Gasparini, Blaž/0000-0002-7177-0155; Rowlinson, Matthew/0000-0002-5236-6536",,,,,83,16,16,1,17,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1680-7316,1680-7324,,ATMOS CHEM PHYS,Atmos.

Sited in the margins of urban public space, they appear as playful and generous interventions in decaying and chaotic city landscapes. Passers-by stumbling upon these structures often linger to observe Simonds' slow and measured work and sometimes take it upon themselves to watch over the Dwellings, caring for theirs' as a cherished part of a neighbourhood. Beginning amidst an artistic climate of experimenting with alternative exhibition models and an ethos of democratic circulation - as in conceptual art's various dematerialized' practices and in earthworks - the Dwellings take on the issue of dissemination by proposing that they be encountered as a gift, free and clear'. Setting Simonds' practice apart is his priority that the work exists as a public good. That intent is reinforced by the Dwelling's very materiality, for the inevitable crumble or erosion of clay renders them so fragile that moving them would destroy them, ensuring that they can never be privately owned, but can also never be preserved, whether motivated by a heartfelt, helpful desire to protect them, by greed or personal gain, or simply by the innocent desire to have one for himself'. That is not to say that the Dwellings leave nothing to be possessed - what can be kept simply does not resemble familiar objects of property. Instead, the works are carried forward as memory or embodied archive by those who have experienced them. These aspects of the work demand, in perpetuity, a wholly different notion of exchange that is more akin to an offering, and, indeed, to a gift, in all valences of the term. These observations are the springboard for a series of conversations between Simonds and van Haaften-Schick in 2016 and 2018.","[van Haaften-Schick, Lauren] Cornell Univ, Hist Art & Visual Studies, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Cornell University,"van Haaften-Schick, L (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Hist Art & Visual Studies, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",,,"van Haaften-Schick, Lauren/0000-0002-4655-272X",,,,,6,0,0,0,0,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1352-8165,1469-9990,,PERFORM RES,Perform.

We highlight an additional influence whereby increased meridional stationary eddy circulation downstream of the Tibetan Plateau drives a stronger moisture flux convergence over southeastern China, intensifying the early summer rainband. This effect occurs robustly across the Community Earth System Model large ensemble Representative Control Pathway 8.5 simulations, and only for its pre-Meiyu stage (mid-May through late June). The westerly jet impinging on the Plateau is also enhanced, suggesting an orographic influence on the westerlies as the root cause. The increased westerlies result from warmer tropical tropospheric temperatures that enhance the meridional temperature gradient at the latitudes of the Plateau. Our results highlight the potential role of the westerlies in altering the East Asian early summer monsoon rainfall in the late 21st century. Plain Language Summary Early summer rainfall over East Asia is projected to increase in the future as consequence of two related physical changes resulting from global warming: more moisture in the air with warmer temperatures, and stronger monsoonal circulations. A set of state-of-the-art simulations of the future climate that we analyzed suggests that the rainfall increase will be especially pronounced in the pre-Meiyu stage (mid-May to late June) when the East Asian rainband extends from southeastern China to southern Japan; at the end of the century, rainfall over southeastern China is projected to increase up to 40%. The cause of this intensification is different: it occurs because the westerlies linger at the latitudes of the Tibetan Plateau during this time instead of migrating northward, and the resulting atmospheric flow downstream brings about stronger convergent flows that concentrates and delivers more moisture to the pre-Meiyu rainband. More work, and using other models, will be needed to demonstrate that this future pre-Meiyu intensification is real. However, the significance of our result from a climate science viewpoint is in demonstrating that the change in the westerlies impinging on the Tibetan Plateau can have a first-order effect on future changes to the East Asian summer rainfall climate.","[Chiang, John C.

Simultaneously, the intelligent monitoring system can predict the extreme greenhouse environment in advance, reduce diseases and insect pests, reduce the use of pesticides and fertilizers, and provide high-quality food. Researchers are becoming more and more interested in greenhouse monitoring systems, and how to put them into production correctly and effectively is a major challenge. This paper aims to review the intelligent greenhouse monitoring system systematically, serve the data transmission and server processing subsystems by identifying, listing and further explaining the greenhouse environmental parameters and studying the overall design of the greenhouse monitoring system.

Although the tGKF relies on Gaussianity, we show that a central limit theorem (CLT) for the parameter of interest is enough to obtain asymptotically precise covering even if the observations are non-Gaussian processes. As a proof of concept we study the functional signal-plus-noise model and derive a CLT for an estimator of the Lipshitz-Killing curvatures, the only data-dependent quantities in the tGKF. We further discuss extensions to discrete sampling with additive observation noise using scale space ideas from regression analysis. Our theoretical work is accompanied by a simulation study comparing different methods to construct SCBs for the population mean. We show that the tGKF outperforms state-of-the-art methods with precise covering for small sample sizes, and only a Rademacher multiplier-t bootstrap performs similarly well. A further benefit is that our SCBs are computational fast even for domains of dimension greater than one. Applications of SCBs to diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) fibers (1D) and spatio-temporal temperature data (2D) are discussed. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Telschow, Fabian J.

In this context, several agencies and associations, such as the European Union H2020, the United States Council for Automotive Research (USCAR) and the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia (UN ESCAP) have defined a set of quantitative and qualitative goals in terms of efficiency, reliability, power losses, power density and economical costs to be met by next generation hybrid and full electric vehicle (HEV/EV) drive systems. As a consequence, the automotive electric drives (which consists of the electric machine, power converter and their cooling systems) of future vehicles have to overcome a number of technological challenges in order to comply with the aforementioned technical objectives. In this context, this paper presents, for each component of the electric drive, a comprehensive review of the state of the art, current technologies, future trends and enabling technologies that will make possible next generation HEV/EVs.","[Lopez, I.] Univ Basque Country, Dept Elect Engn, Plaza Ing Torres Quevedo 1, Bilbao 48013, Spain; [Ibarra, E.; Matallana, A.; Andreu, J.; Kortabarria, I.] Univ Basque Country, Dept Elect Technol, Plaza Ing Torres Quevedo 1, Bilbao 48013, Spain",University of Basque Country; University of Basque Country,"Lopez, I (corresponding author), Univ Basque Country, Dept Elect Engn, Plaza Ing Torres Quevedo 1, Bilbao 48013, Spain.",iraide.lopez@ehu.eus; edorta.ibarra@ehu.eus; asier.matallana@ehu.eus; jon.andreu@ehu.eus; inigo.kortabarria@ehu.eus,"Kortabarria, Inigo/L-2238-2014; MATALLANA, ASIER/AAQ-4242-2020; Ibarra, Edorta/S-7704-2016; Andreu, Jon/AAJ-9403-2020; Kortabarria, Inigo/X-6007-2019","Kortabarria, Inigo/0000-0001-7338-2052; MATALLANA, ASIER/0000-0002-3588-4147; Ibarra, Edorta/0000-0002-2164-8573; Andreu, Jon/0000-0003-2367-5513; Kortabarria, Inigo/0000-0001-7338-2052; Lopez, Iraide/0000-0003-4309-4417","Department of Education, Linguistic Policy and Culture of the Basque Government within the fund for research groups of the Basque university system [IT978-16]; Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad of Spain [DPI2014-53685-C2-2-R]; Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad of Spain within the FEDER funds; Government of the Basque Country within the research program ELKARTEK as the project KT4TRANS [KK-2015/00047, KK-2016/00061]; UPV/EHU [ESPDOC16/25]","Department of Education, Linguistic Policy and Culture of the Basque Government within the fund for research groups of the Basque university system; Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad of Spain(Spanish Government); Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad of Spain within the FEDER funds; Government of the Basque Country within the research program ELKARTEK as the project KT4TRANS; UPV/EHU","This work has been partially supported by the Department of Education, Linguistic Policy and Culture of the Basque Government within the fund for research groups of the Basque university system IT978-16, by the Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad of Spain within the project DPI2014-53685-C2-2-R and FEDER funds and by the Government of the Basque Country within the research program ELKARTEK as the project KT4TRANS (KK-2015/00047 and KK-2016/00061), as well as by the program to support the specialization of Ph.D researchers at UPV/EHU ESPDOC16/25.",,262,54,54,15,122,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",1364-0321,1879-0690,,RENEW SUST ENERG REV,Renew.

By applying different materials and techniques and creating various elements and spaces, architects make hard climatic conditions more tolerable for residents. Iwan is one of the cooling elements which is used in different forms and dimensions in the Islamic architecture. In the present research, Iwan has been introduced as a climatic element in traditional and contemporary architectures and its role in reducing the energy consumption in buildings has been studied. In this respect, first, the thermal loads of a building without Iwan are computed using the EnergyPlus software. Then, four different forms of Iwan are added to the above-mentioned structure along the four principal orientations, moreover, the effect of Iwan on the reduction of thermal loads is analyzed for four different climates. Finally, the design parameters of Iwan, in terms of depth and form, which can help reduce the thermal loads in different climatic conditions are presented. The results show that the best position for using an Iwan is the south direction and the use of Iwan in temperate & humid, hot & humid, cold & mountainous and hot & dry climates could reduce the energy consumption in buildings by 32%, 26%, 14% and 29%, respectively.","[Eskandari, Hamid; Saedvandi, Mahdi] Art Univ Isfahan, Fac Architecture & Urbanism, Dept Architecture, Esfahan 8146834615, Iran; [Mahdavinejad, Mohammadjavad] Tarbiat Modares Univ, Fac Art & Architecture, Dept Architecture, Tehran 14115116, Iran",Tarbiat Modares University,"Eskandari, H (corresponding author), Art Univ Isfahan, Fac Architecture & Urbanism, Dept Architecture, Esfahan 8146834615, Iran.",eskandari@yu.ac.ir; saedvandi@yahoo.com; Mahdavinejad@modares.ac.ir,"Mahdavinejad, Mohammadjavad/H-8187-2017","Mahdavinejad, Mohammadjavad/0000-0002-6454-6518",,,,,64,1,1,1,18,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2075-5309,,BUILDINGS-BASEL,BUILDINGS-BASEL,JAN,2018,1,,,,,,3,10.3390/buildings8010003,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/buildings8010003,,,18,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Civil",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Construction & Building Technology; Engineering,FU8JA,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000424097900003,View Full Record in Web of Science

The course, Power Systems Journey: Making the Invisible Visible and Actionable, is part of the University of Minnesota interdisciplinary grand-challenge curriculum. Students take on the challenge of public science communication about how to change the electric-grid system (from power generation to consumption) as part of an energy transition to respond to climate change. The course integrates electrical engineering, history of science and technology, systems thinking, design thinking, paradigms, art, humanities, science communication, storytelling, experiential learning, and the creation of GIS story-maps and museum exhibits. The design context and elements of the course are described and include: the grand challenge of the energy transition itself, the context of energy-transition education, the nature of the grand-challenge curriculum, the collaborative and teaching philosophy, the role of students, the interdisciplinary course framework, the special focus on the role of arts and humanities in energy education, and the course-curricular structure, which uses the Earth Systems Journey curriculum model. The centerpiece of the article describes the Power Systems Journey experience in narrative form to match the pedagogical approach of the course using artwork examples from students as they investigated the grid. The article concludes with reflections from students and teachers on what the course offers and where to go from here.","[Brigham, Jonee Kulman] Univ Minnesota, Coll Design, Minnesota Design Ctr, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Imbertson, Paul] Univ Minnesota, Elect & Comp Engn, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Brigham, JK (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Coll Design, Minnesota Design Ctr, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",Kulma002@umn.edu; imberts@umn.edu,,,,,,,25,0,0,1,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

Organic P (P-o) compounds play key roles in biological and ecosystems function in the terrestrial environment being critical to cell function, growth and reproduction. We asked a group of experts to consider the global issues associated with P-o in the terrestrial environment, methodological strengths and weaknesses, benefits to be gained from understanding the P-o cycle, and to set priorities for P-o research. We identified seven key opportunities for P-o research including: the need for integrated, quality controlled and functionally based methodologies; assessment of stoichiometry with other elements in organic matter; understanding the dynamics of P-o in natural and managed systems; the role of microorganisms in controlling P-o cycles; the implications of nanoparticles in the environment and the need for better modelling and communication of the research. Each priority is discussed and a statement of intent for the P-o research community is made that highlights there are key contributions to be made toward understanding biogeochemical cycles, dynamics and function of natural ecosystems and the management of agricultural systems.","[George, T.

However, current state-of-the-art atmospheric circulation models have difficulty in reproducing observed MJO characteristics when forced by observed daily sea surface temperature alone. An important practical question is how much data a model needs in assimilation to reproduce real MJO events? By analysing ERA-20C and NOAA-20CR reanalysis data, the authors tried to figure out whether a model could reproduce observed MJO events by assimilating the observed surface signal alone. The phase propagation and vertical structure associated with MJO were compared between the reanalysis data and observations during 1979-2010. A total skill score considering both temporal correlation and spatial standard deviation were defined. The result showed that both ERA-20C and NOAA-20CR could reproduce the observed MJO characteristics very well, with the former superior to the latter, regardless of MJO intensity. Thus, a minimum requirement for an operational atmospheric model for MJO prediction is the assimilation of the observed surface signals.","[Cui, Jingxuan; Wang, Lu; Li, Tim] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster, Joint Int Res Lab Climate & Environm Change ILCEC, Minist Educ KLME,Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Cui, Jingxuan; Wang, Lu; Wu, Bo] Chinese Acad Sci, IAP, LASG, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Li, Tim] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Int Pacific Res Ctr, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Li, Tim] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci & Technol, Dept Atmospher Sci, Honolulu, HI USA",Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa,"Wang, L (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",luwang@nuist.edu.cn,"Wu, Bo/C-8644-2009; Wang, Lu/AAI-2225-2019",,"National Key Research and Development Program of China [2018YFC1505801, 2015CB453200]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41705059, 41875069]; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [NA18OAR4310298]; Division of Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences [1643297]; Startup Foundation for Introducing Talent of NUIST",National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); Division of Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)); Startup Foundation for Introducing Talent of NUIST,"National Key Research and Development Program of China, Grant/Award Numbers: 2018YFC1505801, 2015CB453200; National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Numbers: 41705059, 41875069; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Grant/Award Number: NA18OAR4310298; Division of Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences, Grant/Award Number: 1643297; the Startup Foundation for Introducing Talent of NUIST",,61,9,9,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0899-8418,1097-0088,,INT J CLIMATOL,Int.

J,"Nambiar, AR",,,,"Nambiar, Aparna R.",,,The Aesthetic of Acclimatization Performing the slow death of traditional dance in Singapore,PERFORMANCE RESEARCH,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Singapore's global aspirations have, since the turn of the 21st century, led to the consolidation of a range of new institutions-arts research centers, degree granting programs in universities, museums, festivals- with affiliated experts, to prepare the ground for an emergent arts scene that is aligned with the norms of contemporary western art practice. As neoliberal instrumentation competes with the communitarian logic of the traditional arts, dance forms such as Indian classical, Javanese court and Malay folk dances, which once sought to link the ancient past and perpetuity for ethnic communities of spectatorship, are constricted within narrowly defined categories of the regional performing arts market. To avoid becoming mere touristic spectacles, a new generation of traditionally trained artists reinvent their respective forms to accommodate the near future of contemporary culture in Singapore. Such adaptations unsettle the once cohesive universe of traditional dance, resulting in unfinished and unsettling works that betray, to quote Nicholas Bourriard, countless forms of melancholy, This paper looks at two recent works of contemporary dance staged in Singapore-January Low's Reclaim (2019), Raka Maitra's Pallavi Series (2015-2018). I consider dance emerging from this latter discourse as articulating an aesthetic of acclimatization, sustained by political, communal and institutional attachments that emerge in a climate of overwhelming crises and adjustment. As the traditional dance world in Singapore enters a state of slow death, I identify projects that embark on experiments of partial recuperation, which stay with the trouble, as Donna Harraway suggests, making-with and getting-on with what remains of traditional dance and its embodied practices. I suggest that these projects extend the life of traditional dance as a minor, mutated species in an early evolutionary stage that nevertheless transforms the ecology they acclimate to. In remaining selectively porous to neoliberal and biopolitical operations, and receptive to novel artistic regimes, can the aesthetic of acclimatization allow traditional dance to escape its totalization within neoliberal calculations?",,,,,,,,,,,24,0,0,0,0,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1352-8165,1469-9990,,PERFORM RES,Perform.

Great opportunities exist within cities for tackling climate change. Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect is a phenomenon where significant temperature difference between inner micro-climates of a city and their neighboring micro-climates can be perceived. Mitigation of UHI effects can positively contribute to alleviate detriments of climate change. This research project aims to investigate effective and resilient UHI mitigation strategies and to provide guidance for their application in future. A review of literature indicates that UHI is a growing problem in the UK and that mitigation of such effects would enhance sustainable development at urban scale. The lack of guidance for designers and planners looking into mitigating the UHI effect is also identified. Utilizing ENVI-met simulations and through Urban Futures Assessment Method (UFAM), this research identifies and tests resilient and effective UHI mitigation strategies. Results show that building form, orientation and layout are among the most effective UHI mitigation strategies. Trees, shrubs and grass (TSG), and use of high albedo materials (HAM) in external building surfaces are also indicated as effective measures whose success is dependent on building form. All assessed mitigation strategies (TSG, HAM, UIWB) are shown to have a similar level of resilience which could be improved if properly future-proofed against subsequent changes. Accordingly some practical suggestions are provided to help improve the resilience of tested UHI mitigation strategies. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Coming from a disciplinary trajectory that spent a long stop at international relations (IR), these provocations attach me to geopoetics as practice and a growing field. My engagement here is oriented to geopoetics not only at the threshold of geography and the arts and humanities, but also the intersections of geography and politics. I primarily propose that viewing geopoetics as an open space for experimenting allows for disrupting masterful understandings of the academic self and counters a univocal, universal narrative of the world.","[Nassar, Aya] Univ Durham, Durham, England",Durham University,"Nassar, A (corresponding author), Univ Durham, Dept Geog, South Rd, Durham DH1 3LE, England.",aya.m.nassar@durham.ac.uk,"Nassar, Aya/AHI-8172-2022","Nassar, Aya/0000-0002-9801-1503",,,,,13,4,4,1,1,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",2043-8206,2043-8214,,DIALOGUES HUM GEOGR,Dialogues Hum.

The use of high-reflective products on the building envelope, and particularly on the roof, has been suggested as a potential solution. The overall impact of using high-reflective products on roofs largely depends on the local climatic conditions and on the characteristics of the building, making it difficult to determine whether the use of these products is beneficial without the use of detailed modelling approaches. In this context, this study aims to propose a method to provide indications for designers and policymakers to make early decisions on the potential benefits of the use of high-reflective products on residential buildings, based on simple and readily-available climatic data of the location. The approach, based on the use of state-of-the-art simulation software, allows researchers to obtain a multi-linear regression of the effect of high-reflective products on roofs as a function of the heating degree days and of the local value of the climate vector. The approach is applied to the case of the Italian territory, where a block-of-flats is selected as the reference building, with features common to a significant part of the national residential stock. The proposed approach allows for the provision of a quantitative estimate of the expected impact of high-reflective roof coverings on the energy performance of residential buildings in all Italian municipalities. The analysis shows that high-reflective products on roofs are likely to reduce the building annual energy demand for heating and cooling in 9% to 25% of Italian municipalities, depending on the building energy renovation state. The proposed approach, whose results are expressed also by means of thematic maps, can be replicated to other geographic areas and can be extended to different energy saving technologies.","[Baldi, Francesco; Genova, Enrico; Gugliandolo, Alessandra; Segreto, Maria-Anna] Energy & Sustainable Econ Dev ENEA, Italian Natl Agcy New Technol, Energy Efficiency Unit Dept DUEE, Via Martiri di Monte Sole 4, I-40129 Bologna, Italy",Italian National Agency New Technical Energy & Sustainable Economics Development,"Genova, E (corresponding author), Energy & Sustainable Econ Dev ENEA, Italian Natl Agcy New Technol, Energy Efficiency Unit Dept DUEE, Via Martiri di Monte Sole 4, I-40129 Bologna, Italy.",francesco.baldi@enea.it; enrico.genova@enea.it; alessandra.gugliandolo@enea.it; mariaanna.segreto@enea.it,"Baldi, Francesco/B-1325-2018","Baldi, Francesco/0000-0001-5841-4191; SEGRETO, MARIA-ANNA/0000-0002-6698-2671; GENOVA, Enrico/0000-0001-9675-2730",Italian Ministry of Economic Development,"Italian Ministry of Economic Development(Ministry of Economic Development, Italy)",This work was supported by the Italian Ministry of Economic Development through the project COOL-IT within the Ricerca di sistema elettrico-Parte B funding scheme.,,23,0,0,2,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,MAY,2022,9,,,,,,4969,10.3390/su14094969,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14094969,,,22,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,1E9PP,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000794811200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The observed summertime drying over India is replaced by widespread wettening once local aerosol emissions are kept at preindustrial levels while all the other forcings evolve. Constant remote aerosol emissions partially suppress the precipitation decrease. While predominant precipitation changes over India are thus associated with local aerosols, remote aerosols contribute as well, especially in favoring an earlier monsoon onset in June and enhancing summertime rainfall over the northwestern regions. Conversely, temperature and near-surface circulation changes over South Asia are more effectively driven by remote aerosols. These changes are reflected into northward cross-equatorial anomalies in the atmospheric energy transport induced by both local and, to a greater extent, remote aerosols.

Consequently, the knowledge on marine flooding has progressed significantly for the last years and this review, focused on storm-induced marine submersions, responds to the need for a synthesis. Three main components are presented in the review: (1) a state-of-the-art on marine submersions from the viewpoint of several scientific disciplines; (2) a selection of examples demonstrating the added value of interdisciplinary approaches to improve our knowledge of marine submersions; (3) a selection of examples showing how the management of future crises or the planning efforts to adapt to marine submersions can be supported by new results or techniques from the research community. From a disciplinary perspective, recent progress was achieved with respect to physical processes, numerical modeling, the knowledge of past marine floods and vulnerability assessment. At a global scale, the most vulnerable coastal areas to marine flooding with high population density are deltas and estuaries. Recent and well-documented floods allow analyzing the vulnerability parameters of different coastal zones. While storm surges can nowadays be reproduced accurately, the modeling of coastal flooding is more challenging, particularly when barrier breaches and wave overtopping have to be accounted for. The chronology of past marine floods can be reconstructed combining historical archives and sediment records. Sediment records of past marine floods localized in back barrier depressions are more adequate to reconstruct past flooding chronology. For the two last centuries, quantitative and descriptive historical data can be used to characterize past marine floods. Beyond providing a chronology of events, sediment records combined with geochronology, statistical analysis and climatology, can be used to reconstruct millennial-scale climate variability and enable a better understanding of the possible regional and local long-term trends in storm activity. Sediment records can also reveal forgotten flooding of exceptional intensity, much more intense than those of the last few decades. Sedimentological and historical archives, combined with high-resolution topographic data or numerical hindcast of storms can provide quantitative information and explanations for marine flooding processes. From these approaches, extreme past sea levels height can be determined and are very useful to complete time series provided by the instrumental measurements on shorter time scales. In particular, historical data can improve the determination of the return periods associated with extreme water levels, which are often inaccurate when computed based on instrumental data, due to the presence of gaps and too short time-series. Long-term numerical hindcast of tides and surges can also be used to provide the required time series for statistical analysis. Worst-case scenarios, used to define coastal management plans and strategies, can be obtained from realistic atmospheric settings with different tidal ranges and by shifting the trajectory of storms. Management of future crises and planning efforts to adapt to marine submersions are optimized by predictions of water levels from hydrodynamic models. Such predictions combined with in situ measurements and analysis of human stakes can be used to define a vulnerability index. Then, the efficiency of adaptation measures can be evaluated with respect to the number of lives that could be potentially saved. Numerical experiments also showed that the realignment of coastal defenses could result in water level reduction up to 1 m in the case where large marshes are flooded. Such managed realignment of coastal defenses may constitute a promising adaptation to storm-induced flooding and future sea level rise. From a legal perspective, only a few texts pay specific attention to the risk of marine flooding whether nationally or globally. Recent catastrophic events and their unintended consequences in terms of death and damages have triggered political decisions, like in USA after hurricane Katrina, and in France after catastrophic floods that occurred in 2010.

In order to avoid excessive solar gains and glare issues to the occupants, it is necessary to adopt suitable solutions that limit the incoming solar radiation, such as highly reflective coatings or movable shading devices. However, such devices must be accurately selected, according to the building location and to the exposure of the glazed faades, while also taking into account possible regulatory measures. This paper evaluates the effectiveness of a series of shading devices applied to an existing office building in Southern Italy. The building shows large glazed surfaces and has no overhangs, thus significant thermal discomfort is perceived in summer by the occupants. The aim is to identify those solutions that allow to improve thermal comfort while also keeping a sufficient illuminance level indoors, without disregarding the compliance with Italian regulations about the installation of shading devices and, of course, the need to keep costs on a reasonable level. The analyses are repeated for different building orientations, in order to provide general information. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Two 91-year simulations are conducted: one with a repeating seasonal cycle of Arctic sea ice for the late twentieth-century, taken from the fully coupled WACCM historical run; the other with Arctic sea ice for the late twenty-first century, obtained from the fully coupled WACCM RCP8.5 run. In response to Arctic sea ice loss, polar cap stratospheric ozone decreases by 13 DU (34 DU at the North Pole) in spring, confirming the results of Scinocca et al (2009 Geophys. Res. Lett. 36 L24701). The ozone loss is dynamically initiated in March by a suppression of upward-propagating planetary waves, possibly related to the destructive interference between the forced wave number 1 and its climatology. The diminished upward wave propagation, in turn, weakens the Brewer-Dobson circulation at high latitudes, strengthens the polar vortex, and cools the polar stratosphere. The ozone reduction persists until the polar vortex breaks down in late spring.","[Sun, Lantao; Deser, Clara; Tomas, Robert] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [Polvani, Lorenzo] Columbia Univ, Dept Appl Phys & Appl Math, New York, NY USA; [Polvani, Lorenzo] Columbia Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, New York, NY USA",National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; Columbia University; Columbia University,"Sun, LT (corresponding author), Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA.",lantao@ucar.edu,"Sun, Lantao/O-5028-2019; Sun, Lantao/D-9948-2015; Polvani, Lorenzo M/E-5949-2011","Sun, Lantao/0000-0001-8578-9175; Sun, Lantao/0000-0001-8578-9175; ",National Science Foundation (NSF) Arctic System Science Program; NSF,National Science Foundation (NSF) Arctic System Science Program; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"The authors would like to thank Drs.

In particular, the technique is integrated with a state-of-the-art hourly whole building simulation program to predict the effect of indoor temperature setback and foundation insulation configuration on the hourly variation of crawlspace temperature and ground-coupled heat loss of a residential building. It is found that the indoor temperature setback in the house affects significantly both the crawlspace temperature and the foundation heat loss. Typically, it was found that the setback and the setup in house temperature increases the amplitude of the fluctuations of both the crawlspace temperature and the foundation heat loss. A simple correlation is provided to determine the effect of the temperature setback on the foundation heat loss.

However, perennial grasses productivity can be limited by severe freezing conditions in some geographical areas, although these risks could decrease with the advance of climate warming, the possibility of unpredictable early cold events cannot be discarded. We conducted a study on the model perennial grass Brachypodium sylvaticum to investigate the molecular mechanisms that contribute to cold and freezing adaption. The study was performed on two different B. sylvaticum accessions, Ain1 and Osl1, typical to warm and cold climates, respectively. Both accessions were grown under controlled conditions with subsequent cold acclimation followed by freezing stress. For each treatment a set of morphological parameters, transcription, metabolite, and lipid profiles were measured. State-of-the-art algorithms were employed to analyze cross-component relationships. Phenotypic analysis revealed higher adaption of Osl1 to freezing stress. Our analysis highlighted the differential regulation of the TCA cycle and the GABA shunt between Ain1 and Osl1. Osl1 adapted to freezing stress by repressing the GABA shunt activity, avoiding the detrimental reduction in fatty acid biosynthesis and the concomitant detrimental effects on membrane integrity.","[Toubiana, David; Sade, Nir; Wilhelmi, Maria del Mar Rubio; Blumwald, Eduardo] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Plant Sci, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Sade, Nir] Tel Aviv Univ, Sch Plant Sci & Food Secur, Tel Aviv, Israel; [Liu, Lifeng; Vogel, John P.] DOE Joint Genome Inst, 2800 Mitchell Dr, Walnut Creek, CA 94598 USA; [Brotman, Yariv; Luzarowska, Urszula] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Life Sci, Beer Sheva, Israel",University of California System; University of California Davis; Tel Aviv University; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Ben Gurion University,"Blumwald, E (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Plant Sci, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",eblumwald@ucdavis.edu,,"Vogel, John/0000-0003-1786-2689; Toubiana, David/0000-0001-9526-1745; Luzarowska, Urszula/0000-0002-3350-5297","US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research [DE-SC0008797]; Will W.

Modelling efforts during the past decade have predominantly been based on using morphologically highly realistic representations of the particle geometry in conjunction with numerically exact methods for solving the light-scattering problem. We review (i) the present state of knowledge about the morphological, dielectric, and compositional properties of BC aerosols, (ii) the state-of-the-art in numerical light-scattering methods frequently applied to black carbon, and (iii) the recent literature on modelling optical properties of BC aggregates, both bare and internally mixed with liquid-phase material. From this review we formulate some key lessons learned regarding those morphological properties that have a dominant impact on the optical properties. These morphological key features can form the basis for devising simplified model particles that can be used in large-scale applications. We illustrate this approach with one example appropriate for climate modelling, and one example relevant to the interpretation of lidar remote sensing data. (C) 2020 The Authors.

J,"Schlichting, KM",,,,"Schlichting, Kara Murphy",,,Hot Town: Sensing Heat in Summertime Manhattan,ENVIRONMENTAL HISTORY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"This essay examines visual records to reveal summer heat's effect on the body, on living spaces, and on Manhattan's cityscape due to the urban heat island, the phenomenon of significantly warmer temperatures in metropolitan areas due to concentrated development and human activities. Although the bodily experience of heat and humidity is intimate and subjective, summer temperatures, especially when amplified by a heat wave, fostered collective seasonal suffering in the pre-climate-controlled city. This essay analyzes a political cartoon, news photography, and the work of two artists associated with American realism and the Ashcan School of art. While urban historians have long recognized the environment in cities, their studies have focused on physical places such as parks rather than on more elusive categories of nature such as weather and climate. A history of urbanites' sensory experience of heat-as-environment therefore waits to be told. The interaction of weather with New York's pavement, brick, and stone created a summer heatscape; visual archives of this phenomenon foreground the materiality of both the body and the urban environment. They make visible the seasonal feeling of, and environmental challenges inherent to, Manhattan's dense tenement districts.","[Schlichting, Kara Murphy] CUNY, Queens Coll, New York, NY 10017 USA",City University of New York (CUNY) System; Queens College NY (CUNY),"Schlichting, KM (corresponding author), CUNY, Queens Coll, New York, NY 10017 USA.",,,,,,,,33,0,0,0,0,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",1084-5453,1930-8892,,ENVIRON HIST-US,Environ.

In particular, global ocean acidification is having a profound effect on the coastal waters of the EBUS, affecting the entire trophic chain, net primary production (NPP) and related economic activities such as fisheries. Another predicted change related to human activity is that of upwelling dynamics with expected long-term changes in upwelling winds as proposed by Bakun (1990), Bakun et al. (2015) and Rykaczewski et al. (2015). Although these predicted long-term changes may emerge only later in the 21st century, this has fueled many studies using historical data. Long-term increase in upwelling winds has thus been a much debated topic, showing that there is considerable uncertainty depending on the EBUS considered, the effect of natural climate fluctuations, the choice of wind dataset, the time period considered, and the methodologies and significance tests applied. Therefore, there is an immediate interest in being able to monitor upwelling using verified and self-consistent wind data sets. This work focused on a sensitivity study of the estimated trends in upwelling winds in the California Current Upwelling System (CCUS), for the most recent period 1996-2018, using the two state-of-the-art satellite wind analyses and two atmospheric model re-analyses. Embedded into the strong modulation by natural climate fluctuations on interannual and decadal time scales, we do see an increase in upwelling-favorable winds in the core of the CCUS, with a local increase of more than 25% in seasonal upwelling transport for the period considered. In this central upwelling zone, a good agreement on stronger equatorward winds for the winter and spring seasons is found between the different datasets, although with different significance levels. Conversely, conflicting results are found in the southernmost part of the CCUS between the satellite analyses and the model reanalyses. Systematic, time-dependent differences are found between the wind products, highlighting the need to further investigate the poorly documented temporal stability of these widely used wind long-term climatology products. The observed spatial structuring of the estimated wind trends is consistent with the trend analysis of water chlorophyll-a, partial pressure of CO2, and basity (pH) analysis products. This result is consistent with changes being important for modulating the carbonate system within the CCUS.","[Quilfen, Y.; Piolle, J-F; Autret, E.] Univ Brest, Lab Oceanog Phys & Spatiale LOPS, IUEM, CNRS,IRD,IFREMER, Brest, France; [Shutler, J.] Univ Exeter, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Penryn, England",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Ifremer; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite de Bretagne Occidentale; Institut Universitaire Europeen de la Mer (IUEM); University of Exeter,"Quilfen, Y (corresponding author), Univ Brest, Lab Oceanog Phys & Spatiale LOPS, IUEM, CNRS,IRD,IFREMER, Brest, France.",Yves.Quilfen@ifremer.fr,,"AUTRET, Emmanuelle/0000-0002-0979-9192; Quilfen, Yves/0000-0003-2405-1075",European Space Agency [4000112091/14/ILG],European Space Agency(European Space AgencyEuropean Commission),"This study was conducted as part of the OceanSODA project, funded by the European Space Agency under the contract 4000112091/14/ILG.

As a result, they might sometimes work at non- optimal operation points below or above the maximum power point of the photovoltaic component, which would directly translate into efficiency losses. Up until now, however, no common parameter describing and quantifying this and other real-life operating related losses (e.g. spectral mismatch) exists in the community. Therefore, the annual- hydrogen-yield-climatic-response (AHYCR) ratio is introduced as a figure of merit to evaluate the outdoor performance of integrated solar water splitting devices. This value is defined as the ratio between the real annual hydrogen yield and the theoretical yield assuming the solar-to-hydrogen device efficiency at standard conditions. This parameter is derived for an exemplary system based on state-of-the-art AlGaAs//Si dual-junction solar cells and an anion exchange membrane electrolyzer using hourly resolved climate data from a location in southern California and from reanalysis data of Antarctica. This work will help to evaluate, compare and optimize the climatic response of solar water splitting devices in different climate zones.","[Koelbach, Moritz; May, Matthias M.] Univ Tubingen, Inst Phys & Theoret Chem, Tubingen, Germany; [Koelbach, Moritz; May, Matthias M.] Univ Ulm, Inst Theoret Chem, Ulm, Germany; [Koelbach, Moritz] Helmholtz Zentrum Berlin Mat & Energie GmbH, Inst Solar Fuels, Berlin, Germany; [Hoehn, Oliver] Fraunhofer ISE Solare Energiesyst, Freiburg, Germany; [Rehfeld, Kira] Univ Tubingen, Dept Geosci, Tubingen, Germany; [Rehfeld, Kira] Univ Tubingen, Dept Phys, Tubingen, Germany; [Finkbeiner, Manuel; Barry, James] Heidelberg Univ, Inst Environm Phys, Heidelberg, Germany; [Barry, James] Hsch Bonn Rhein Sieg, Int Ctr Sustainable Dev, St Augustin, Germany",Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen; Ulm University; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Zentrum fuer Materialien und Energie GmbH (HZB); Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen; Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen; Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg; Hochschule Bonn Rhein Sieg,"Kolbach, M (corresponding author), Univ Tubingen, Inst Phys & Theoret Chem, Tubingen, Germany.;Kolbach, M (corresponding author), Univ Ulm, Inst Theoret Chem, Ulm, Germany.;Kolbach, M (corresponding author), Helmholtz Zentrum Berlin Mat & Energie GmbH, Inst Solar Fuels, Berlin, Germany.",moritz.koelbach@uni-tuebingen.de,"Rehfeld, Kira/O-1781-2019; May, Matthias/H-8552-2013","Rehfeld, Kira/0000-0002-9442-5362; May, Matthias/0000-0002-1252-806X; Barry, James/0000-0002-8384-4983; Kolbach, Moritz/0000-0003-1828-0437","German Bundesministerium fur Bildung and Forschung (BMBF) [03SF0619K, 03SF0619A]; German Research Foundation (DFG) [434023472]; DFG [395588486]",German Bundesministerium fur Bildung and Forschung (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); DFG(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"This work was supported by the German Bundesministerium fur Bildung and Forschung (BMBF), project H2Demo (No. 03SF0619K and 03SF0619A).

It is shown that the temperature susceptibility of the asphalt cement, the curing rate of cutback liquid asphalts, and the transport of asphalt emulsions at low temperatures are the main problems associated with selecting a binder material. Emulsions appear to be the best suited for use in cold climates, but there is little experience with their use in the far north. In addition, it is indicated neither standard nor the modified Marshall nor the Hveem tests provide ideal tests for selecting the optimum binder content, the degree of curing, the required aerating, or the amount of mixing water for designing asphalt mixes.","QUEENS UNIV,DEPT CIVIL ENGN,KINGSTON K7L 3N6,ONTARIO,CANADA",Queens University - Canada,"STEWART, JA (corresponding author), ROYAL MIL COLL CANADA,DEPT CIVIL ENGN,KINGSTON K7K 6M7,ONTARIO,CANADA.",,,,,,,,56,0,0,0,4,NATL RESEARCH COUNCIL CANADA,OTTAWA,"RESEARCH JOURNALS, MONTREAL RD, OTTAWA ON K1A 0R6, CANADA",0315-1468,,,CAN J CIVIL ENG,Can.

Recent efforts have been dedicated to the improvement of dynamical models, while statistical schemes still need to take full advantage of the availability of ocean subsurface variables, provided regularly for the last few decades as a result of the Tropical Ocean-Global Atmosphere Program (TOGA). Here we use a number of predictor variables, including temperature at different depths and regions of the equatorial ocean, in a flexible statistical dynamic components model to make skillful long-lead retrospective predictions (hindcasts) of the Nino-3.4 index in the period 1970-2016. The model hindcasts the major EN episodes up to 2.5 years in advance, including the recent extreme 2015/16 EN. The analysis demonstrates that events are predicted more accurately after the completion of the observational array in the tropical Pacific in 1994, as a result of the improved data quality and coverage achieved by TOGA. Therefore, there is potential to issue long-lead predictions of this climatic phenomenon at a low computational cost.","[Petrova, Desislava; Ballester, Joan; Rodo, Xavier] Barcelona Inst Global Hlth, Climate & Hlth Programme, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain; [Koopman, Siem Jan] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Rodo, Xavier] Inst Catalana Recerca & Estudis Avancats, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain",ISGlobal; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; ICREA,"Petrova, D (corresponding author), Barcelona Inst Global Hlth, Climate & Hlth Programme, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.",desislava.petrova@isglobal.org,"Ballester, Joan/E-6627-2017; Rodó, Xavier/F-7663-2017; Koopman, S.J./M-7814-2019; Koopman, Siem Jan/E-1838-2011","Ballester, Joan/0000-0003-0009-437X; Rodó, Xavier/0000-0003-4843-6180; Koopman, S.J./0000-0002-4440-9524; Koopman, Siem Jan/0000-0002-4440-9524; Petrova, Desislava/0000-0001-9129-1787",,,,,67,10,10,1,3,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0894-8755,1520-0442,,J CLIMATE,J.

As water demands get closer and closer to the water availability in many regions, each drop of water becomes increasingly valuable and water must be managed more efficiently and intensively. However, soaring water use worsens water scarcity conditions already prevalent in semi-arid and arid regions, increasing uncertainty for sustainable food production and economic development. Planning for future development and investments requires that we prepare water projections for the future. However, estimations are complicated because the future of the world's waters will be influenced by a combination of environmental, social, economic, and political factors, and there is only limited knowledge and data available about freshwater resources and how they are being used. The Water Futures and Solutions (WFaS) initiative coordinates its work with other ongoing scenario efforts for the sake of establishing a consistent set of new global water scenarios based on the shared socio-economic pathways (SSPs) and the representative concentration pathways (RCPs). The WFaS fasttrack assessment uses three global water models, namely H08, PCR-GLOBWB, and WaterGAP. This study assesses the state of the art for estimating and projecting water use regionally and globally in a consistent manner. It provides an overview of different approaches, the uncertainty, strengths and weaknesses of the various estimation methods, types of management and policy decisions for which the current estimation methods are useful.

However, the correlation between vegetation growth, temperature and seasonal amplitude of atmospheric CO2 concentration have become elusive with the slowed increasing trend of vegetation growth and weakened temperature control on CO2 uptake since late 1990s. Here, based on in situ atmospheric CO2 concentration records from the Barrow observatory site, we found a slow down in the increasing trend of the atmospheric CO2 amplitude from 1990s to mid 2000s. This phenomenon was associated with the paused decrease in the minimum CO2 concentration ([CO2](min)), which was significantly correlated with the slow down of vegetation greening and growing season length extension. We then showed that both the vegetation greenness and growing-season length were positively correlated with spring but not autumn temperature over the northern lands. Furthermore, such asymmetric dependences of vegetation growth upon spring and autumn temperature cannot be captured by the state-of-art terrestrial biosphere models. These findings indicate that the responses of vegetation growth to spring and autumn warming are asymmetric, and highlight the need of improving autumn phenology in the models for predicting seasonal cycle of atmospheric CO2 concentration.","[Li, Zhao; Xia, Jianyang; Cheng, Wanying; Yan, Liming] East China Normal Univ, Sch Ecol & Environm Sci, Tiantong Natl Stn Forest Ecosyst, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China; [Li, Zhao; Xia, Jianyang; Cheng, Wanying; Yan, Liming] East China Normal Univ, Sch Ecol & Environm Sci, Res Ctr Global Change & Ecol Forecasting, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China; [Li, Zhao; Xia, Jianyang; Cheng, Wanying; Yan, Liming] IEC, 3663 N Zhongshan Rd, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China; [Ahlstrom, Anders] Lund Univ, Dept Phys Geog & Ecosyst Sci, SE-22362 Lund, Sweden; [Ahlstrom, Anders] Stanford Univ, Sch Earth Energy & Environm Sci, Dept Earth Syst Sci, 473 Via Ortega, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Rinke, Annette; Ji, Duoying; Moore, John C.] Beijing Normal Univ, Coll Global Change & Earth Syst Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Rinke, Annette] Alfred Wegener Inst, Helmholtz Ctr Polar & Marine Res, Potsdam, Germany; [Koven, Charles] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Berkeley, CA USA; [Hayes, Daniel J.; Chen, Guangsheng] Univ Maine, Sch Forest Resources, Orono, ME 04469 USA; [Zhang, Geli] China Agr Univ, Coll Land Sci & Technol, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Krinner, Gerhard] Univ Grenoble Alpes, IGE, CNRS, F-38000 Grenoble, France; [Dong, Jinwei] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Land Surface Pattern & Simulat, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Liang, Junyi] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Div Environm Sci, Oak Ridge, TN 37830 USA; [Liang, Junyi] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Climate Change Sci Inst, Oak Ridge, TN 37830 USA; [Jiang, Lifen; Luo, Yiqi] No Arizona Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Flagstaff, AZ USA; [Ciais, Philippe; Peng, Shushi] UVSQ, CNRS, Lab Sci Climat & Environm, CEA,UMR8212, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Peng, Shushi] CNRS, LGGE, F-38041 Grenoble, France; [Peng, Shushi] Peking Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Peng, Shushi] Univ Grenoble Alpes, LGGE, F-38041 Grenoble, France; [Wang, Ying-Ping] CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere, PMB 1, Aspendale, Vic 3195, Australia; [Xiao, Xiangming; Shi, Zheng] Univ Oklahoma, Dept Microbiol & Plant Biol, Ctr Spatial Anal, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Xiao, Xiangming] Fudan Univ, Sch Life Sci, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [McGuire, A.

Ocean acidification is a consequence of the absorption of anthropogenic carbon emissions and it profoundly impacts marine life. Arctic regions are particularly vulnerable to rapid pH changes due to low ocean buffering capacities and high stratification. Here, an unsupervised machine learning methodology is applied to simulations of surface Arctic acidification from two state-of-the-art coupled climate models. We identify four sub-regions whose boundaries are influenced by present-day and projected sea ice patterns. The regional boundaries are consistent between the models and across lower (SSP2-4.5) and higher (SSP5-8.5) carbon emissions scenarios. Stronger trends toward corrosive surface waters in the central Arctic Ocean are driven by early summer warming in regions of annual ice cover and late summer freshening in regions of perennial ice cover. Sea surface salinity and total alkalinity reductions dominate the Arctic pH changes, highlighting the importance of objective sub-regional identification and subsequent analysis of surface water mass properties.","[Krasting, John P.; Dunne, John P.; John, Jasmin G.] NOAA, OAR, Geophys Fluid Dynam Lab, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA; [De Palma, Maurizia] Kean Univ, Sch Environm & Sustainabil Sci, Union, NJ USA; [De Palma, Maurizia; Sonnewald, Maike] Princeton Univ, Cooperat Inst Modeling Earth Syst, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Princeton University,"Krasting, JP (corresponding author), NOAA, OAR, Geophys Fluid Dynam Lab, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA.",John.Krasting@noaa.gov,"John, Jasmin G./F-8194-2012; Krasting, John/G-9360-2019; Dunne, John/F-8086-2012","John, Jasmin G./0000-0003-2696-277X; De Palma, Maurizia/0000-0002-3838-3671; Krasting, John/0000-0002-4650-9844; Dunne, John/0000-0002-8794-0489",,,,,47,0,0,1,4,SPRINGERNATURE,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,2662-4435,,COMMUN EARTH ENVIRON,Commun.

Sensitivity studies with the regional climate model REMO show distinct feedbacks between the simulation of the monsoon circulation with and without irrigation processes. We find that the temperature and mean sea level pressure, where the standard REMO version without irrigation shows a significant bias over the areas of Indus basin, is highly sensitive to the water used for irrigation. In our sensitivity test we find that removal of this bias has caused less differential heating between land and sea masses. This in turns reduces the westerlies entering into land from Arabian Sea, hence creating conditions favorable for currents from Bay of Bengal to intrude deep into western India and Pakistan that have been unrealistically suppressed before. We conclude that the representation of irrigated water is unavoidable for realistic simulation of south Asian summer monsoon and its response under global warming. Citation: Saeed, F., S.

In the past, extensive and intensive international efforts have been devoted to coupled model developments for ENSO studies. A hierarchy of coupled ocean-atmosphere models has been formulated; in terms of their complexity, they can be categorized into intermediate coupled models (ICMs), hybrid coupled models (HCMs), and fully coupled general circulation models (CGCMs). ENSO modeling has made signifiscant progress over the past decades, reaching a stage where coupled models can now be used to successfully predict ENSO events 6 months to one year in advance. Meanwhile, ENSO exhibits great diversity and complexity as observed in nature, which still cannot be adequately captured by current state-of-the-art coupled models, presenting a challenge to ENSO modeling. We primarily reviewed the long-term efforts in ENSO modeling continually and steadily made at different institutions in China; some selected representative examples are presented here to review the current status of ENSO model developments and applications, which have been actively pursued with noticeable progress being made recently. As ENSO simulations are very sensitive to model formulations and process representations etc., dedicated efforts have been devoted to ENSO model developments and improvements. Now, different ocean-atmosphere coupled models have been available in China, which exhibit good model performances and have already had a variety of applications to climate modeling, including the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6). Nevertheless, large biases and uncertainties still exist in ENSO simulations and predictions, and there are clear rooms for their improvements, which are still an active area of researches and applications. Here, model performances of ENSO simulations are assessed in terms of advantages and disadvantages with these differently formulated coupled models, pinpointing to the areas where they need to be further improved for ENSO studies. These analyses provide valuable guidance for future improvements in ENSO simulations and predictions.","[Zhang Rong-Hua; Gao Chuan; Hu Junye; Tian Feng; Zhu Yuchao] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Oceanol, Key Lab Ocean Circulat & Waves, Qingdao 266071, Peoples R China; [Zhang Rong-Hua; Gao Chuan; Hu Junye; Tian Feng; Zhu Yuchao] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Ocean Megasci, Qingdao 266071, Peoples R China; [Zhang Rong-Hua; Gao Chuan; Hu Junye; Tian Feng; Zhu Yuchao] Pilot Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol, Lab Ocean & Climate Dynam, Qingdao 266237, Peoples R China; [Zhang Rong-Hua] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Quaternary Sci & Global Change, Xian 710061, Peoples R China; [Zhang Rong-Hua; Yu Yongqiang] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Yu Yongqiang; Chen Lin; Liu Hailong; Lin Pengfei] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, LASG, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Song Zhenya; Qiao Fangli] Minist Nat Resources, Inst Oceanog 1, Qingdao 266061, Peoples R China; [Song Zhenya; Qiao Fangli] Pilot Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol, Lab Reg Oceanog & Numer Modeling, Qingdao 266237, Peoples R China; [Song Zhenya; Qiao Fangli] Minist Nat Resources, Key Lab Marine Sci & Numer Modeling MASNUM, Qingdao 266061, Peoples R China; [Song Zhenya; Qiao Fangli] Natl Engn Lab Integrated Aerosp Ground Ocean Big, Qingdao 266061, Peoples R China; [Ren Hong-Li; Wang Lin] Chinese Acad Meteorol Sci, State Key Lab Severe Weather, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Ren Hong-Li; Wang Lin] China Meteorol Adm, Lab Climate Studies, Natl Climate Ctr, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Ren Hong-Li; Wang Lin] China Meteorol Adm, CMA NJU Joint Lab Climate Predict Studies, Natl Climate Ctr, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Tang Youmin] Univ Northern British Columbia, Environm Sci & Engn, Prince George, BC V2N 4Z9, Canada; [Tang Youmin] Minist Nat Resources, State Key Lab Satellite Ocean Environm Dynam, Inst Oceanog 2, Hangzhou 310012, Peoples R China; [Wu Tongwen; Chen Lin] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster, Minist Educ KLME, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China; [Wu Tongwen; Chen Lin] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteoro, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China; [Wu Fanghua] China Meteorol Adm, Beijing Climate Ctr, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Oceanology, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Qingdao National Laboratory for Marine Science & Technology; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; Ministry of Natural Resources of the People's Republic of China; Qingdao National Laboratory for Marine Science & Technology; Ministry of Natural Resources of the People's Republic of China; Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences (CAMS); Chinese Academy of Sciences; China Meteorological Administration; China Meteorological Administration; University of Northern British Columbia; Ministry of Natural Resources of the People's Republic of China; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; China Meteorological Administration","Zhang, RH (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Oceanol, Key Lab Ocean Circulat & Waves, Qingdao 266071, Peoples R China.;Zhang, RH (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Ocean Megasci, Qingdao 266071, Peoples R China.;Zhang, RH (corresponding author), Pilot Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol, Lab Ocean & Climate Dynam, Qingdao 266237, Peoples R China.;Zhang, RH (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Quaternary Sci & Global Change, Xian 710061, Peoples R China.;Zhang, RH (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.",rzhang@qdio.ac.cn,"Lin, Pengfei/AAJ-5379-2020; Yu, Yongqiang/K-7808-2012","Lin, Pengfei/0000-0003-2361-0066; Yu, Yongqiang/0000-0001-8596-3583; Zhu, Yuchao/0000-0002-0277-200X",,,,,174,34,34,15,59,SCIENCE PRESS,BEIJING,"16 DONGHUANGCHENGGEN NORTH ST, BEIJING, 100717, PEOPLES R CHINA",2096-5508,2523-3521,,J OCEANOL LIMNOL,J.

China has embarked on a path towards more sustainable energy use to meet domestic (e.g. air quality) and global needs (e.g. climate change), and to sustain its economic welfare. However, most energy-economy models for China have shown limitations to evaluate policy instruments and technology diffusion in industries, in relation to the multiple policy goals. In this paper, the advantages and weaknesses of 19 current energy models for China are evaluated, including important co-benefits as reduced air pollutant emissions. Results show that the co-benefits of energy use and emission policies are rarely modeled on industrial level. Based on the critical assessment of the state-of-the-art energy models, we develop recommendations for modeling industrial energy use, with an emphasis on improved incorporation of (economic, environmental and energy) policy effects, technology representation, co-benefit modeling, and uncertainty analysis.

However, an improvement is still possible, as shown in this study. This study is the first to experimentally investigate a construction of the R744 ejector with a modulated opening of the suction nozzle bypass duct. Four bypass positions along the ejector axis were tested using three sets of motive nozzle conditions characteristic of a refrigeration unit operating in a warm climate. Two levels of evaporation temperature, as well as the superheat influence, were investigated to evaluate the application potential. The efficiency of the prototype was equal to or greater than that of the standard construction because the closed bypass duct did not result in deteriorated ejector performance. The best bypass positioning resulted in improved efficiency for the pressure lift up to 7 bar. The maximum efficiency improvement was 37% with application potential for systems with low-pressure lift modes. The simulation of the full 3-D bypass ejector allowed for insight into the efficiency improvement. Finally, guidelines were given for further improvement considering the connection between the standard suction chamber and the bypass chamber.","[Bodys, Jakub; Smolka, Jacek; Palacz, Michal; Haida, Michal; Nowak, Andrzej J.] Silesian Tech Univ, PL-44100 Gliwice, Poland; [Banasiak, Krzysztof] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, N-7465 Trondheim, Norway",Silesian University of Technology; Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Bodys, J (corresponding author), Silesian Tech Univ, PL-44100 Gliwice, Poland.",jakub.bodys@polsl.pl,"Haida, Michal/GLV-1134-2022; Palacz, Michal/M-5293-2019; Palacz, Michal MP/M-2563-2015","Haida, Michal/0000-0002-4592-6275; Palacz, Michal/0000-0002-7222-6303; Palacz, Michal MP/0000-0002-7222-6303; Bodys, Jakub/0000-0002-0852-8470",National Centre of Science [2017/27/B/ST8/00945]; Silesian University of Technology [08/060/RGJ20/0251]; programme Diamond Grant [08/060/DG17/0140],National Centre of Science; Silesian University of Technology; programme Diamond Grant,"The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support of the National Centre of Science through project No. 2017/27/B/ST8/00945.

The purpose of the workshop was to assess the current state of the art of global coupled modeling on the decadal and longer timescales in terms of methodology and results to identify the major issues and problems facing this activity and to discuss possible alternatives for making progress in light of these problems. This workshop brought together representatives from nearly every group in the world actively involved in formulating and running such models. After presentations by workshop participants, four working groups identified key issues involving 1) initialization and model spinup, 2) strategies and techniques for coupling of model components, 3) flux correction/adjustment, and 4) secular drift and systematic errors. The participants concluded that improved communication between those engaged in this activity will be important to enhance further progress.

The atmospheric cycle of PBAPs is here parame-terized in a state-of-the-art global 3-D chemistry-transport model by taking into account their primary emissions as well as their chemical aging during the long-range transport in the atmosphere. Different ecosystems are used to parameterize the respective flux rates of PBAPs considering bacteria, fungal spores and pollen, and using meteorological parameters in order to account for fluxes seasonal variation. Bioaerosols are assumed to be emitted as 50 % hydrophilic particles but they can be transferred to the soluble mode via atmospheric oxidation, changing thus their physical properties and their atmospheric lifetime. The global annual flux of PBAPs to the atmosphere calculated by the model equals about 123 Tg yr(-1) (47.5 Tg-C yr(-1)) and the atmospheric burden is calculated to equal about 791 Gg. These calculated emissions largely depend on the assumed size distribution and is comparable to the amount of primary particulate organic carbon injected into the atmosphere by anthropogenic emissions.","[Myriokefalitakis, S.; Fanourgakis, G.; Kanakidou, M.] Univ Crete, Dept Chem, Environm Chem Proc Lab, POB 2208, Iraklion 70013, Greece",University of Crete,"Myriokefalitakis, S; Kanakidou, M (corresponding author), Univ Crete, Dept Chem, Environm Chem Proc Lab, POB 2208, Iraklion 70013, Greece.",stelios@uoc.gr; mariak@uoc.gr,"Myriokefalitakis, Stelios/J-3701-2014; Fanourgakis, Georgios/ABH-3162-2021","Myriokefalitakis, Stelios/0000-0002-1541-7680; ",European FP7 collaborative project BACCHUS (Impact of Biogenic versus Anthropogenic emissions on Clouds and Climate: towards a Holistic UnderStanding),European FP7 collaborative project BACCHUS (Impact of Biogenic versus Anthropogenic emissions on Clouds and Climate: towards a Holistic UnderStanding),This work has been supported by the European FP7 collaborative project BACCHUS (Impact of Biogenic versus Anthropogenic emissions on Clouds and Climate: towards a Holistic UnderStanding).,,19,12,12,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",2194-5217,,978-3-319-35095-0; 978-3-319-35094-3,SPRINGER ATMOS SCI,,,2017,,,,,845,851,,10.1007/978-3-319-35095-0_121,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-35095-0_121,,,7,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,BG8KN,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000392385800121,View Full Record in Web of Science

This could be detrimental for photoprotection mechanisms, mainly those associated with thermal dissipation, making plants more susceptible to eventual drought predicted by climate change models. With the purpose to study the effect of temperature and water availability on light energy utilization and putative adjustments in photoprotective mechanisms of Deschampsia antarctica Desv., plants were collected from two Antarctic provenances: King George Island and Lagotellerie Island. Plants were cultivated at 5, 10 and 16 degrees C under well-watered (WW) and water-deficit (WD, at 35% of the field capacity) conditions. Chlorophyll fluorescence, pigment content and de-epoxidation state were evaluated. Regardless of provenances, D. antarctica showed similar morphological, biochemical and functional responses to growth temperature. Higher temperature triggered an increase in photochemical activity (i.e. electron transport rate and photochemical quenching), and a decrease in thermal dissipation capacity (i.e. lower xanthophyll pool, Chl a/b and beta carotene/neoxanthin ratios). Leaf mass per unit area was reduced at higher temperature, and was only affected in plants exposed to WD at 16 degrees C and exhibiting lower electron transport rate and amount of chlorophylls. D. antarctica is adapted to frequent freezing events, which may induce a form of physiological water stress. Photoprotective responses observed under WD contribute to maintain a stable photochemical activity. Thus, it is possible that short-term temperature increases could favor the photochemical activity of this species. However, long-term effects will depend on the magnitude of changes and the plant's ability to adjust to new growth temperature.","[Saez, Patricia L.; Rivera, Betsy K.; Ramirez, Constanza F.; Vallejos, Valentina] Univ Concepcion, Fac Ciencias Forestales, Dept Silvicultura, Lab Cult Tejidos Vegetales,Ctr Biotecnol, Concepcion, Chile; [Cavieres, Lohengrin A.] Univ Concepcion, Fac Ciencias Nat & Oceanog, Dept Bot, Lab ECOBIOSIS, Concepcion, Chile; [Corcuera, Luis J.] Univ Concepcion, Fac Ciencias Nat & Oceanog, Dept Bot, Lab Fisiol Vegetal, Barrio Univ S-N, Concepcion, Chile; [Bravo, Leon A.] Univ La Frontera, Ctr Plant Soil Interact & Nat Resources Biotechno, Dept Ciencias Agron & Recursos Nat,Sci & Technol, Lab Fisiol & Biol Mol Vegetal,Inst Agroind,Fac Ci, Temuco, Chile",Universidad de Concepcion; Universidad de Concepcion; Universidad de Concepcion; Universidad de La Frontera,"Bravo, LA (corresponding author), Univ La Frontera, Ctr Plant Soil Interact & Nat Resources Biotechno, Dept Ciencias Agron & Recursos Nat,Sci & Technol, Lab Fisiol & Biol Mol Vegetal,Inst Agroind,Fac Ci, Temuco, Chile.",leon.bravo@ufrontera.cl,"Cavieres, Lohengrin/A-9542-2010; Bravo, León/AAO-8437-2020","Cavieres, Lohengrin/0000-0001-9122-3020; Bravo, León/0000-0003-4705-4842; Saez, Patricia L./0000-0002-8594-7329","National Fund for Scientific and Technological Development (FONDECYT) [11130332]; Associative Research Program of CONICYT [CONICYT-PIA ART-1102]; Chilean Antarctic Institute [INACH AN-02-12, FI-02-13]",National Fund for Scientific and Technological Development (FONDECYT)(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT); Associative Research Program of CONICYT; Chilean Antarctic Institute,"This research was funded by The National Fund for Scientific and Technological Development (FONDECYT 11130332), The Associative Research Program of CONICYT (CONICYT-PIA ART-1102) and The Chilean Antarctic Institute (INACH AN-02-12 and FI-02-13).

The major drivers of enhanced SCA(NBP) remain unclear and intensely debated, with land-use change, CO2 fertilization and warming being identified as likely contributors. We integrated CO2-flux data from two atmospheric inversions (consistent with atmospheric records) and from 11 state-of-the-art land-surface models (LSMs) to evaluate the relative importance of individual contributors to trends and drivers of the SCA(NBP) of CO2 fluxes for 1980-2015. The LSMs generally reproduce the latitudinal increase in SCA(NBP) trends within the inversions range. Inversions and LSMs attribute SCA(NBP) increase to boreal Asia and Europe due to enhanced vegetation productivity (in LSMs) and point to contrasting effects of CO2 fertilization (positive) and warming (negative) on SCA(NBP). Our results do not support land-use change as a key contributor to the increase in SCA(NBP). The sensitivity of simulated microbial respiration to temperature in LSMs explained biases in SCA(NBP) trends, which suggests that SCA(NBP) could help to constrain model turnover times.","[Bastos, Ana] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Dept Geog, Luisenstr 37, D-80333 Munich, Germany; [Ciais, Philippe; Chevallier, Frederic; Ballantyne, Ashley P.; Maignan, Fabienne; Wang, Xuhui; Peylin, Philippe; Zhu, Dan] Univ Paris Saclay, LSCE, IPSL, CEA CNRS UVSQ, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Roedenbeck, Christian] Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, D-07745 Jena, Germany; [Ballantyne, Ashley P.] Univ Montana, Dept Ecosyst & Conservat Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Yin, Yi] CALTECH, Div Geol & Planetary Sci, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Fernandez-Martinez, Marcos] Univ Antwerp, Ctr Excellence PLECO Plants & Ecosyst, Dept Biol, B-2610 Antwerp, Belgium; [Friedlingstein, Pierre] Univ Exeter, Coll Engn Math & Phys Sci, Exeter EX4 4QF, Devon, England; [Penuelas, Josep] UAB, Global Ecol Unit, CSIC, CREAF,CEAB, Bellaterra 08193, Catalonia, Spain; [Penuelas, Josep] CREAF, Cerdanyola Del Valles 08193, Catalonia, Spain; [Piao, Shilong L.] Peking Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Sino French Inst Earth Syst Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Sitch, Stephen] Univ Exeter, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Exeter EX4 4RJ, Devon, England; [Smith, William K.] Univ Arizona, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Zhu, Zaichun] Peking Univ, Sch Urban Planning & Design, Shenzhen Grad Sch, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China; [Haverd, Vanessa] CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Kato, Etsushi] IAE, Minato Ku, Tokyo 1050003, Japan; [Jain, Atul K.] Univ Illinois, Dept Atmospher Sci, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Lienert, Sebastian] Univ Bern, Phys Inst, Climate & Environm Phys, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Lienert, Sebastian] Univ Bern, Oeschger Ctr Climate Change Res, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Lombardozzi, Danica] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Climate & Global Dynam Lab, Boulder, CO 80302 USA; [Nabel, Julia E.

It brings together scholars from diverse schools working on new areas of research and application in urban design and planning. Emergent research agendas include both novel areas of research and important shifts in the direction of a research area. The challenge for planning schools is to reflect critically on these changes and develop long-term research agendas that can better position our field in society and academia, and provide a basis from which to assess our academic programmes. The chapters in this issue display the different scales and fields of planning, including planning for: disaster recovery; climate change, especially opportunities for mitigation; shrinking cities in the First World; and rapidly urbanising informal and impoverished cities in the global South. At the same time, the chapters identify research areas that respond to major social and environmental changes. Olshansky and Chang highlight the increasing losses from catastrophic disasters, and address the need for disaster recovery planning. Wheeler, Randolph and London focus on climate change, and, noting the urgency of action now, their research agenda emphasises opportunities for planners to develop research and policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Hollander, Pallagst, Schwarz and Popper look at increasing economic and population trends in many First World cities that result in city 'shrinkage'. They present new opportunities for improving cities' green space networks and natural features, and for research. The trebling of urban population in African cities by 2050, in conditions of poverty and informality, is the major trend driving Parnell, Pietriese and Watson's chapter. They present an agenda for new planning theories and for supporting empirical research to address the actual conditions of African cities. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Aesthetics is not only a way of making sensible but also contributes ontologically to the world it makes sensible. In this view aesthetics does not rely on a subject's capacity to apprehend the world as a perceptually objectifiable entity. Focusing on works by Jason deCaires Taylor (Anthropocene and La Gardinera de la Esperanza) and Robert Smithson (Spiral Jetty), the authors interrogate how artistic engagements with anthropocenic materiality and temporality have the potential to articulate a double bind between aesthetics and ontology. Both artists not only allow recipients to be confronted with complex earthly entanglements but also have a material and aesthetic impact on their respective sites. Discussing deCaires Taylor's and Smithson's works, the authors argue that the artists' aesthetics is not only a way of granting experiential access to an earth that resists objectification but also a manifestation of the processes through which earth's materiality transforms throughout time.","[Huepkes, Philip] Heinrich Heine Univ Dusseldorf, Inst Media & Cultural Studies, Dusseldorf, Germany; [Duerbeck, Gabriele] Univ Vechta, Literary & Cultural Studies, Vechta, Germany",Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf,"Hupkes, P (corresponding author), Heinrich Heine Univ Dusseldorf, Inst Media & Cultural Studies, Dusseldorf, Germany.",,,,German Research Foundation (DFG) [DU 320/8-1],German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"We wish to thank Peter H.

Beyond the stand-alone computational fluid dynamic analysis, the proposed solution is also tested in an entire construction by means of a dynamic simulation software, in different cities. Results showed that the better performance is obtained in moderate climate environments, especially in the hot season: a reduction even higher than the 50% of the heating and cooling envelope energy losses and gains can be reached, respect to a reference building realised with local state-of the art criteria and subjected to the same operating conditions.

However, the added value provided by such models is not well explored so far, and claims have been made that RCMs have little utility. Here, it is demonstrated that RCMs are indeed returning significant added value. Employing appropriate spatial filters, the scale-dependent skill of a state-of-the-art RCM ( with and without nudging of large scales) is examined by comparing its skill with that of the global reanalyses driving the RCM. This skill is measured by pattern correlation coefficients of the global reanalyses or the RCM simulation and, as a reference, of an operational regional weather analysis. For the spatially smooth variable air pressure the RCM improves this aspect of the simulation for the medium scales if the RCM is driven with large-scale constraints, but not for the large scales. For the regionally more structured quantity near-surface temperature the added value is more obvious. The simulation of medium-scale 2-m temperature anomaly fields amounts to an increase of the mean pattern correlation coefficient up to 30%.","GKSS Forschungszentrum Geesthacht GmbH, Inst Coastal Res, D-21502 Geesthacht, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Zentrum Geesthacht - Zentrum fur Material- und Kustenforschung,"Feser, F (corresponding author), GKSS Forschungszentrum Geesthacht GmbH, Inst Coastal Res, Max Planck Str 1, D-21502 Geesthacht, Germany.",feser@gkss.de,"Feser, Frauke/C-1605-2014","Feser, Frauke/0000-0002-0252-468X",,,,,13,83,85,0,11,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0027-0644,,,MON WEATHER REV,Mon.

Drawing on Paulo Freire's theory of critical pedagogy, this paper examines the impact of a Freirean-inspired Dublin-based participatory arts initiative on youth from lower socioeconomic backgrounds in Ireland. Focusing on the Freirean concepts of dialogue, democratic relations, voice, creativity and imagination, the authors present a case study of Fighting Words Creative Writing Centre, a socially-engaged participatory arts organisation currently operating in the non-formal education sector in Ireland. The research, a qualitative study conducted over a 12-month period, presents data gathered from participants and other key stakeholders through interviews and questionnaires. The findings indicate that participants in Fighting Words demonstrate increased levels of engagement and motivation, improved confidence and self-esteem, recognition of and pride in creative ability, a stronger sense of self, a greater ability to work collaboratively, and improved literacy.","[White, Irene; Lorenzi, Francesca] Dublin City Univ, Sch Educ Studies, Dublin, Ireland; [Norman, James O'Higgins] Dublin City Univ, Antibullying Res & Resource Ctr, Dublin, Ireland",Dublin City University; Dublin City University,"White, I (corresponding author), Dublin City Univ, Sch Educ Studies, Dublin, Ireland.",Irene.White@dcu.ie,"Pimentel, Priscilla/AAG-6402-2019",,,,,,22,0,0,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0264-3944,1468-0122,,PASTOR CARE EDUC,Pastor.

This development can generally be associated with environmental and economic concerns related with required adaptation to changes in climate, demographic structures and infrastructures as well as climate resilience including flood control and drought resistance. The addressed and supported measures can be assigned to the two focus areas 'Decentralized rainwater harvesting and utilization', aiming for saving of precious fresh water resources and centrally supplied drinking water, as well as 'decentralized rainwater retention and management', aiming for flood control and protection of existing infrastructures and ecosystems.

Thermodynamics-based PUE models considering representative economizer choices are proposed, taking climate variables and energy system parameters as inputs for robust PUE predictions. Sobol's method is used to assess total order sensitivity indices of key modeling parameters, suggesting that climate variables and uninterruptible power supply (UPS) efficiencies are the most important parameters. The PUE values of 17 HDCs operated by Google and Facebook were predicted, considering location-specific weather conditions, and uncertainties in energy system parameters and economizer choices. Results were verified using reported PUE values, indicating the model's effectiveness in capturing regional and seasonal PUE variations, and in generating point-estimations for macro-level data center (DC) energy models. Finally, achievable PUE values were computed through differential evolution, identifying minimum practical PUE values that could be obtained with state-of-the-art technologies. The framework can be applied in predictions of location-specific PUE values, PUE improvement analysis, and PUE target-setting by policy makers. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Summer rainfall over NEC (NECR) has a fundamental influence on society, yet its successful seasonal prediction remains a long-term scientific challenge to current dynamical models. The poor NECR prediction skill is partly attributed to the large NECR variability at both the interannual and interdecadal time scales. Here, we focus on the oceanic drivers of the late summer NECR variability and associated physical processes at interannual time scale. Then, we establish an empirical prediction model to predict the interannual variability of summer NECR at 1-month lead time (in June). The analysis of observations spanning 40 years (1963-2002) reveals three physically and synergistically influencing predictors of the late summer NECR interannual variability. Above-normal NECR is preceded in the previous spring by (a) warm sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the tropical northern Indian Ocean, (b) a positive thermal contrast tendency in the tropical West-East Pacific SST, and (c) a positive tendency of the North Atlantic tripolar SST. These precursors enhance the anomalous low-level anticyclone over the western North Pacific and southerly anomalies over NEC in late summer, which are beneficial to enhancing NECR. An empirical prediction model built on these three predictors achieves a forecast temporal correlation coefficient (TCC) skill of 0.72 for 1961-2019, and a 17-year (2003-2019) independent forecast shows a significant TCC skill of 0.70. The skill is substantially higher than that of five state-of-the-art dynamical models and their ensemble mean for 1979-2019 (TCC = 0.24). These results suggest that the proposed empirical model is a meaningful approach for the prediction of NECR, although the dynamical prediction of NECR has considerable room for improvement.","[Zhao, Junhu; Zuo, Jinqing; Feng, Guolin] China Meteorol Adm, Lab Climate Studies, Natl Climate Ctr, 46 Zhongguancun Nandajie, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Han; Yang, Liu] Lanzhou Univ, Coll Atmospher Sci, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China; [Yang, Jie] Jiangsu Climate Ctr, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China; [Xiong, Kaiguo] Wuhan Reg Climate Ctr, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China; [Feng, Guolin] Yangzhou Univ, Dept Phys Sci & Technol, Yangzhou 225000, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Junhu; Feng, Guolin; Dong, Wenjie] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Atmospher Sci, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Climate Change & Nat Disas, Zhuhai 519000, Peoples R China",China Meteorological Administration; Lanzhou University; Yangzhou University; Sun Yat Sen University,"Feng, GL (corresponding author), China Meteorol Adm, Lab Climate Studies, Natl Climate Ctr, 46 Zhongguancun Nandajie, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.;Feng, GL (corresponding author), Yangzhou Univ, Dept Phys Sci & Technol, Yangzhou 225000, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.;Feng, GL (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Atmospher Sci, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Climate Change & Nat Disas, Zhuhai 519000, Peoples R China.",fenggl@cma.gov.cn,,,"National Key Research and Development Program on Monitoring, Early Warning and Prevention of Major Natural Disaster [2018YFC1506005]; National Natural Science Foundations of China [41875093, 41975102, 42075017, 41975098, 41705074]","National Key Research and Development Program on Monitoring, Early Warning and Prevention of Major Natural Disaster; National Natural Science Foundations of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","The authors are grateful to the anonymous reviewers and editor for their insightful comments to improve the quality of the paper.

Today, countless urban settlements across the globe have jumped into the so-called 'smart city' bandwagon to achieve this goal. Under the smart city agenda, presently, many government agencies are attempting to engineer an urban transformation to tackle urban prosperity, liveability, and sustainability issues mostly through the means of technology solutions. Nonetheless, the notion of smart cities is ambiguous, and there are limited conceptual frameworks to assist cities and their administrations in understanding the big picture view of this urban development paradigm. The aim of this paper is to generate a clear understanding on the making of successful smart city practices. This is done by elaborating the smart cities notion through a multidimensional conceptual framework, examining smart city best practices across the globe-i.e., Songdo, Masdar, Amsterdam, San Francisco, Brisbane-, and providing insights of smart city approaches from these cases. The findings of the study disclose the need for a comprehensive smart city conceptualisation to inform policymaking and consequently the practice. This will help in the formation of a much-needed smart urbanism model for the resilient settlements of the climate emergency era.","[Yigitcanlar, Tan] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Civil Engn & Built Environm, 2 George St, Brisbane, Qld 4000, Australia; [Han, Hoon] Univ New South Wales, Fac Built Environm, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Kamruzzaman, Md] Monash Univ, Monash Art Design & Architecture, 900 Dandenong Rd, Caulfield, Vic 3145, Australia; [Ioppolo, Giuseppe] Univ Study Messina, Dept Econ, Piazza Pugliatti 1, I-98122 Messina, Italy; [Sabatini-Marques, Jamile] Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Adv Studies, Rua Anfiteatro 513, Butanta, SP, Brazil",Queensland University of Technology (QUT); University of New South Wales Sydney; Monash University; Universidade de Sao Paulo,"Yigitcanlar, T (corresponding author), Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Civil Engn & Built Environm, 2 George St, Brisbane, Qld 4000, Australia.",tan.yigitcanlar@qut.edu.au; h.han@unsw.edu.au; md.kamruzzaman@monash.edu; giuseppe.ioppolo@unime.it; jamilesabatini@usp.br,"Han, Hoon/ABC-7783-2022; Yigitcanlar, Tan/J-1142-2012; Kamruzzaman/AAG-5909-2020","Han, Hoon/0000-0003-3200-7728; Yigitcanlar, Tan/0000-0001-7262-7118; Kamruzzaman/0000-0001-7113-942X; Sabatini Marques, Jamile/0000-0003-3734-4459",,,,,115,81,81,18,112,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0264-8377,1873-5754,,LAND USE POLICY,Land Use Pol.,NOV,2019,,,,,,,104187,10.1016/j.landusepol.2019.104187,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2019.104187,,,11,Environmental Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,JK5MF,,Green Submitted,Y,N,12/21/22,WOS:000494886800074,View Full Record in Web of Science

In recent years, Brazil's southern coastal region has been affected by several different extreme weather events that have caused coastal flooding, with economic losses as well as fatalities. Understanding and improving the predictability of these events has become a major issue for the local population. In this study, state-of-the-art numerical modeling was applied to this region to assess the ability of the Ocean-Land Atmosphere Model to represent major extreme events. The model was applied to the region with a high-resolution grid refinement technique capable of simultaneously representing global and local atmospheric phenomena. The main events that affected Brazil's southern coastal region between 2000 and 2018 were identified and then simulated. All selected events were associated with cyclonic and/or anticyclonic systems near the coastal region of the study area. Those systems were responsible for bringing heavy rain, strong winds and sea level rise, causing impacts for the coastal region. The results of the numerical simulations were compared with observational data to evaluate model performance. The model simulated well the air temperature and wind fields. Correlation values for sea level pressure were high despite a maximum positive bias of approximately 2 hPa. Precipitation presented a negative bias for most events. Finally, the results show that the methodology allowed for a detailed representation of sensible and latent heat fluxes for the region, allowing a better representation of local mesoscale features.","[de Souza, D.

Clear bottlenecks for the ubiquitous application of isotopic analysis across the SPAC are the relatively high-energy and specialized materials required to extract water from plant materials. Could simple and cost-effective do-it-yourself MacGyver methods be sufficient for extracting plant water for isotopic analysis? This study develops a suite of novel techniques for plant water extraction and compares them to a standard research-grade water extraction method. Our results show that low-tech methods using locally-sourced materials can indeed extract plant water consistently and comparably to what is done with other state-of-the-art methods. Further, our findings show that other factors play a larger role than water extraction methods in achieving the desired accuracy and precision of stable isotope composition: (1) appropriate transport, (2) fast sample processing and (3) efficient workflows. These results are methodologically promising for the rapid expansion of isotopic investigations, especially for citizen science and/or school projects or in remote areas, where improved SPAC understanding could help manage water resources to fulfill agricultural and other competing water needs.","[Fischer, Benjamin M.

However, how so drastic changes induced by wildfires and how the age of the burnt scar affect the small and meso-scale atmospheric boundary layer dynamics are largely unknown. These questions are relevant for process analysis, meteorological and air quality forecast but also for regional climate analysis. Such questions are addressed numerically in this study on the case of the Portugal wildfires in 2003 as a testbed. In order to study the effects of burnt scars, an ensemble of numerical simulations using the Weather Research and Forecasting modeling system (WRF) have been performed with different surface properties mimicking the surface state immediately after the fire, few days after the fire and few months after the fire. In order to investigate such issue in a seamless approach, the same modelling framework has been used with various horizontal resolutions of the model grid and land use, ranging from 3.5 km, which can be considered as the typical resolution of state-of-the art regional numerical weather prediction models to 14 km which is now the typical target resolution of regional climate models. The study shows that the combination of high surface heat fluxes over the burnt area, large differential heating with respect to the preserved surroundings and lower surface roughness produces very intense frontogenesis with vertical velocity reaching few meters per second. This powerful meso-scale circulation can pump more humid air from the surroundings not impacted by the wildfire and produce more cloudiness over the burnt area. The influence of soil temperature immediately after the wildfire ceases is mainly seen at night as the boundary-layer remains unstably stratified and lasts only few days. So the intensity of the induced meso-scale circulation decreases with time, even though it remains until full recovery of the vegetation. Finally all these effects are simulated whatever the land cover and model resolution and there are thus robust processes in both regional climate simulations and process studies or short-time forecast. However, the impact of burnt scars on the precipitation signal remains very uncertain, especially because low precipitation is at stake. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The decrease in the near-bottom oxygen levels from spring to autumn is a common feature in the gulf, but in 2018, extensive hypoxia was observed. We analyzed temperature, salinity, oxygen, and nutrient data collected in 2018, along with historical data available from environmental databases. Meteorological and hydrological data from the study year were compared with their long-term means and variability. We suggest that pronounced oxygen depletion occurred in 2018 due to a distinct development of vertical stratification. Seasonal stratification developed early and was stronger in spring-summer 2018 than on average due to high heat flux and weak winds. Dominating northeasterly winds in early spring and summer supported the inflow of saltier waters from the Baltic Proper that created an additional deep pycnocline restricting vertical transport between the near-bottom layer (NBL) and the water column above. The estimated oxygen consumption rate in the NBL in spring-summer 2018 was about 1.7 mmol O(2)m(-2)h(-1), which exceeded the oxygen input to the NBL due to advection and vertical mixing. Such a consumption rate leads to near-bottom hypoxia in all years when vertical mixing in autumn reaches the seabed later than on average according to the long-term (1979-2018) meteorological conditions. The observed increase in phosphate concentrations in the NBL in summer 2018 suggests a significant sediment phosphorus release in hypoxic conditions counteracting the mitigation measures to combat eutrophication. Since climate change projections predict that meteorological conditions comparable to those in 2018 will occur more frequently, extensive hypoxia would be more common in the Gulf of Riga and other coastal basins with similar morphology and human-induced elevated input of nutrients.","[Stoicescu, Stella-Theresa; Laanemets, Jaan; Liblik, Taavi; Samlas, Oliver; Lips, Inga; Lips, Urmas] Tallinn Univ Technol, Dept Marine Syst, EE-19086 Tallinn, Estonia; [Skudra, Maris] Latvian Inst Aquat Ecol, LV-1007 Riga, Latvia; [Lips, Inga] EuroGOOS AISBL, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium",Tallinn University of Technology,"Stoicescu, ST (corresponding author), Tallinn Univ Technol, Dept Marine Syst, EE-19086 Tallinn, Estonia.",stella.stoicescu@taltech.ee,,"Lips, Urmas/0000-0002-9823-6294",Estonian Ministry of Education [IUT196]; Estonian Research Council [PRG602]; joint Baltic Sea research and development program (Art 185) [03F0773A],Estonian Ministry of Education; Estonian Research Council(Estonian Research Council); joint Baltic Sea research and development program (Art 185),"This work was supported by the Estonian Ministry of Education institutional research funding (grant no.

The concept of adaptation pathways, a diagnostic and analytical tool to assist in adaptive planning and decision-making, is gaining traction as a way of framing and informing climate adaptation. It provides decisionmakers a way to acknowledge the inter-temporal complexities and uncertainties associated with the novel dynamics of climate change and a mechanism to manage these challenges in the local context. In 2012, the Australian Government funded an 18-month program to provide decisionmakers in the coastal zone an opportunity to test the utility of the adaptation pathways concept for coastal climate adaptation. Using a selection of completed projects as case studies, we performed a document analysis to better understand the learnings from the projects. The main themes surrounded: (1) the utility of the adaptation pathway framework in developing options, (2) decision-making rationale and criteria, and (3) stakeholder participation in pathway development. A project participant survey was developed to further understand these themes. Our analysis reveals that adaptation pathways was generally framed narrowly and conservatively to emphasize extant economic, administrative and legal considerations over community, participatory, or exploratory ones. Although some case study projects were able to reach a point in the pathway discussion to actively involve stakeholders in their decision-making process, many case studies continued to build technical data as a method for defending policies and actions. These results indicate that coastal adaptation can take-up adaptation pathways as a useful concept for decision-making and planning; however, many councils may still require assistance in stakeholder communication processes in order to develop sociallyacceptable plans that take into account the full range of values affecting local coastal environments.","[Lin, Brenda B.] CSIRO Land & Water, PMB 1,107-121 Stn St, Aspendale, Vic 3195, Australia; [Capon, Tim; Langston, Art; Wise, Russ; Williams, Rachel; Lazarow, Neil] CSIRO Land & Water, Black Mt Labs, Black Mt, ACT, Australia; [Taylor, Bruce] CSIRO Land & Water, Ecol Sci Precinct, Dutton Pk, Qld, Australia",Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Lin, BB (corresponding author), CSIRO Land & Water, PMB 1,107-121 Stn St, Aspendale, Vic 3195, Australia.",bbclin@gmail.com,"Williams, Rachel/D-1597-2011; Lin, Brenda B/A-8834-2011; Lin, Brenda/O-3578-2019; Lazarow, Neil/C-6928-2015; Capon, Tim R/J-5911-2013; Wise, Russell M/G-5463-2010; Taylor, Bruce M/C-5771-2011","Lin, Brenda B/0000-0002-6011-9172; Lin, Brenda/0000-0002-6011-9172; Capon, Tim R/0000-0002-5443-6710; Wise, Russell M/0000-0002-5882-5123; Taylor, Bruce/0000-0002-7740-2898",,,,,56,26,27,3,37,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0892-0753,1521-0421,,COAST MANAGE,Coast.

In this paper, we design a novel automotive radar with 1m aperture, which is an order of magnitude larger aperture than state-of-the-art automotive radars, and thus achieves super high angular resolution of 0.1 degrees. The radar is designed to overcomes the major technical challenges of a wide aperture radar, which are: non-robust phase coherency over a wide aperture, spanning a wide aperture with sparse antenna elements, simultaneous non-interfering transmissions from a relatively large number of transmit antennas with unambiguous target speed estimation, and high complexity of near-field beamforming. We demonstrate the super high resolution performance of the radar in automotive scenarios, and show that it attains comparable results to a high resolution LIDAR at short range, and outperforms the LIDAR at long ranges. The wide aperture radar has the potential to enable autonomous driving at higher speed, and also to increase the operation of autonomous driving to more regions and climates.","[Bialer, Oded; Tirer, Tom] Gen Motors Adv Tech Ctr, IL-46733 Herzliyya, Israel; [Tirer, Tom] Tel Aviv Univ, Sch Elect Engn, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel",General Motors; Tel Aviv University,"Bialer, O (corresponding author), Gen Motors Adv Tech Ctr, IL-46733 Herzliyya, Israel.",oded.bialer8@gmail.com; amnonj@gmail.com; tirer.tom@gmail.com,,,,,,,38,7,7,4,8,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",1530-437X,1558-1748,,IEEE SENS J,IEEE Sens.

J,"Piccini, A",,,,"Piccini, Angela",,,"Locating Grid Technologies: Performativity, Place, Space: Challenging the Institutionalized Spaces of e-Science",DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"This paper arises out of a brief period in the early-to mid-2000s when the British funding and research climate facilitated a relationship between the technical, operational language of eScience and the creative and performing arts. It concerns the ways in which live creative practices produce media traces that are fractured across screens and networks to produce new spatial relations between live events and their records. The split and contradictory subjectivities produced in these highly mediatized environments bring to the fore creative tensions between the live event and the recorded document. That is, the discourses, technologies and practices (if we may separate these) of e-Science not only produce new, spatial connections between events and their archives, they enact the liveness of archives as they are accessed and recombined to produce new art forms. Locating Grid Technologies: Performativity, Place, Space, a research workshop series funded by the A& H e-Science Initiative in its 2006 round, aimed to investigate how eScience technologies might inform new understandings of space and time for distributed, creative research practices. Arts and technology researchers from the UK, US and Japan met to generate, analyze and re-use audio-visual documents of distributed practice-led research. Specifically, the project sought to combine and repurpose e-Science tools in order to investigate the spatial relationships produced between time-based, live events and their immediately mediatized traces. This paper investigates those performative fragmentations of place and space. It suggests that the potentialities and pitfalls of e-Science tools and technologies present fertile material for the arts researcher, particularly within the area of practice-based research: from the politics of surveillance to the aesthetics of video compression, from the ethics of multidisciplinary collaboration to the theoretical implications of mixing video time and space with the time and space of the performance event.","[Piccini, Angela] Univ Bristol, Bristol, Avon, England",University of Bristol,"Piccini, A (corresponding author), Univ Bristol, Bristol, Avon, England.",a.a.piccini@bristol.ac.uk,,,,,,,23,0,0,0,0,ALLIANCE DIGITAL HUMANITIES ORGANIZATIONS,BOSTON,"SNELL LIBRARY 213, NORTHEASTERN UNIV, BOSTON, MA 02115 USA",1938-4122,,,DIGIT HUMANITIES Q,DIGIT.

The high-resolution spatiotemporal change of precipitation is still unknown in many areas despite its importance. This study analyzed the spatiotemporal variation in precipitation in Beibu Gulf, South China, during the rainy season (from April to September) in the period of 1961-2016. The precipitation data were collected from 12 national standard rain-gauge observation stations. The spatiotemporal variation in precipitation was evaluated with incidence rate and contribution rate of precipitation. The tendency of variations was analyzed using the Mann Kendall method. The precipitation in the rainy season contributed 80% to the total annual precipitation. In general, there was an exponential decreasing tendency between the precipitation incidence rate and increased precipitation durations. The corresponding contribution rate showed a downward trend after an initial increase. The precipitation incidence rate decreased with the rising precipitation grades, with a gradual increase in contribution rate. The precipitation incidence rate and contribution rate of 7-9 d durations showed the significant downward trends that passed the 95% level of significance test. The results provide a new understanding of precipitation change in the last five decades, which is valuable for predicting future climate change and extreme weather prevention and mitigation.","[Liu, Zhanming; Yang, Hong; Wei, Xinghu] Foshan Univ, Res Ctr Ecol Civilizat Construct & Sustainable De, Foshan 528000, Peoples R China; [Yang, Hong] Univ Reading, Dept Geog & Environm Sci, Reading RG6 6AB, Berks, England",Foshan University; University of Reading,"Yang, H (corresponding author), Foshan Univ, Res Ctr Ecol Civilizat Construct & Sustainable De, Foshan 528000, Peoples R China.;Yang, H (corresponding author), Univ Reading, Dept Geog & Environm Sci, Reading RG6 6AB, Berks, England.",liuzhanminglzm@163.com; hongyanghy@gmail.com; weixinghu1964@163.com,"Hong, YANG/C-1739-2008","Hong, YANG/0000-0001-9940-8273","Natural Science Foundation of China [41571091]; Youth Fund of Humanistic and Social Sciences of the Ministry of Education of PRC in 2017 [17YJCZH114]; 13th Five-year Planning Item of Guangdong Philosophy and Social Sciences [GD16CGL10]; Opening fund of Key Laboratory of Environment Change and Resource Use in Beibu Gulf, Ministry of Education of PRC (Nanning Normal University) [2015BGERLKF03]; Foshan University Interdisciplinary Program in Art and Science; Foshan University Lingnan Visiting Professor scheme","Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Youth Fund of Humanistic and Social Sciences of the Ministry of Education of PRC in 2017; 13th Five-year Planning Item of Guangdong Philosophy and Social Sciences; Opening fund of Key Laboratory of Environment Change and Resource Use in Beibu Gulf, Ministry of Education of PRC (Nanning Normal University); Foshan University Interdisciplinary Program in Art and Science; Foshan University Lingnan Visiting Professor scheme","This study was financially supported by Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41571091); Youth Fund of Humanistic and Social Sciences of the Ministry of Education of PRC in 2017 (No. 17YJCZH114); the 13th Five-year Planning Item of Guangdong Philosophy and Social Sciences (No. GD16CGL10) and Opening fund of Key Laboratory of Environment Change and Resource Use in Beibu Gulf, Ministry of Education of PRC (Nanning Normal University) (2015BGERLKF03), Foshan University Interdisciplinary Program in Art and Science, and Foshan University Lingnan Visiting Professor scheme.",,105,3,3,1,13,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,APR,2020,4,,,,,,1170,10.3390/w12041170,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w12041170,,,19,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,LX0JR,,"Green Published, Green Accepted",,,12/21/22,WOS:000539527500247,View Full Record in Web of Science

Rapid and accurate icing detection allows proper control of wind turbines, including shutting down and clearing the ice, thus ensuring turbine safety. This article presents a wavelet-driven multiscale graph convolutional network (MWGCN), which is a supervised deep learning model for blade icing detection. The proposed model first uses wavelet decomposition to capture multivariate information in the time and frequency domains, and then employs a temporal graph convolutional network (GCN) to model the intervariable correlations of the decomposed multiscale wavelets and their temporal dynamics. In addition, this article introduces scale attention to the MWGCN for a further improvement of the model and proposes the method to address the class imbalance problem of the training data sets. Finally, the article conducts comprehensive experiments to evaluate the proposed model, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the model in blade icing detection and its better performance over eight state-of-the-art algorithms, with 17.2% and 11.3% higher F1 scores over the best state-of-the-art baseline on the labeled datasets.","[Lai, Zhichen; Cheng, Xu; Huang, Lizhen; Liu, Yongping] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Mfg & Civil Engn, N-2815 Gjovik, Norway; [Lai, Zhichen] Aalborg Univ, Dept Comp Sci, DK-9100 Aalborg, Denmark; [Liu, Xiufeng] Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Technol Management & Econ, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); Aalborg University; Technical University of Denmark,"Huang, LZ; Liu, YP (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Mfg & Civil Engn, N-2815 Gjovik, Norway.",zhla@cs.aau.dk; xu.cheng@ieee.org; xiuli@dtu.dk; lizhen.huang@ntnu.no; yongping.liu@ntnu.no,,"Cheng, Xu/0000-0002-5336-7952; Liu, Xiufeng/0000-0001-5133-6688; huang, lizhen/0000-0001-9387-7650",Chinese Scholarship Council; NTNU,Chinese Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council); NTNU,The work of Zhichen Lai was supported by both the Chinese Scholarship Council and NTNU.

A major challenge is scaling these fluxes to regional and global level to forge a unified understanding of both ecophysiology and flux exchange across all spatial scales. Furthermore, the ability of site fluxes to represent global vegetation and climate remains unquantified. The present study examines these questions using a process-based Land-Surface Model (LSM) containing state-of-the-art formulations of biophysical processes such as canopy light interception. The LSM is calibrated, forced and validated using a large and diverse range of established (e.g. FLUXNET) and novel (e.g. soil respiration, global river discharge and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) leaf area index and reflectance) observational datasets spanning different spatial scales. Multiple calibration datasets are expected to provide tighter model constraints, better global coverage and reduced observational bias. Uncertainties, estimated using a Monte-Carlo analysis, are quite large in the global simulation. Nevertheless, the present study reveals an inconsistency in measured carbon and water fluxes at site level compared to regional/global level. The model, once tuned at site-level, predicts a carbon sink of 20 +/- 14 Gt yr(-1) for the tropics which is inconsistent with atmospheric CO2 inversion and carbon inventory. Furthermore, evapotranspiration recorded at FLUXNET sites would have to be reduced by 30% to agree with measured global river discharge. Future modelling would benefit from complementary flux measurements in currently underrepresented global vegetation classes (tropical broadleaf forest and C4 grassland) and climate zones (tundra).

However, climate models differ in their representation of the freshwater sources. Recent improvements in altimetry-based detection of small icebergs and in estimates of the mass loss of Antarctica may help better constrain the values of Antarctic freshwater releases. We propose a model-based seasonal climatology of iceberg melt over the Southern Ocean using state-of-the-art observed glaciological estimates of the Antarctic mass loss. An improved version of a Lagrangian iceberg model is coupled with a global, eddy-permitting ocean/sea ice model and compared to small icebergs observations. Iceberg melt increases sea ice cover, about 10% in annual mean sea ice volume, and decreases sea surface temperature over most of the Southern Ocean, but with distinctive regional patterns. Our results underline the importance of improving the representation of Antarctic freshwater sources. This can be achieved by forcing ocean/sea ice models with a climatological iceberg fresh-water flux. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Four energy output scenarios were modeled on Umberto LCA software using primary data of mass and energy flows surrounding the six incinerators at the considered WtE plant and predefined processes from the Ecoinvent 3.6 database. The normalized LCA results suggest that by utilizing all the recovered energy as high-pressure steam, the WtE plant can avoid an equivalent annual environmental impact value of approximately 21200, 36800, 6700, 15800, 37000, and 6900 average European citizens in the impact categories 'climate change,' freshwater and terrestrial acidification,' freshwater eutrophication,' photochemical ozone creation,' respiratory effects, inorganics,' and 'terrestrial eutrophication,' respectively. The 'Electricity and Steam with CCS' scenario resulted in the most avoided environmental impact in the impact category 'climate change.' However, in all other impact categories, it resulted in less avoided environmental impact compared to the 'Steam' scenario. The comparative analysis showed that 19 out of the 24 LCA results varied by more than 50% between a region-specific and a region- and fuel-specific model, thus quantifying the influence of scenario uncertainty, introduced by the normative choice of substituted processes in LCA modeling. This study exemplifies the environmental benefit WtE technology can realize by substituting conventional energy production processes that are reliant on fossil resources, while performing its primary function that is reducing the volume of non-recyclable waste, destroying hazardous organic components it contains, and recovering useful materials from it.

The associated dynamics are analyzed using the 20th century ERA-20C reanalysis. It is found that the main climatic processes related to precipitation anomalies in Tropical South America are: (1) the intensity and position of the South Atlantic Convergence Zone (SACZ); (2) El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO); (3) the meridional position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), which is found to be related to Atlantic Sea Surface Temperature (SST) anomalies; and (4) anomalies in the strength of the South American Monsoon System, especially the South American Low-Level Jet (SALLJ). Interestingly, all of the analyzed anomalies are related to processes that operate from the Atlantic Ocean, except for ENSO. Results from the present study are in agreement with the state of the art literature about precipitation anomalies in the region. However, the added strength of the longer dataset and the larger study area improves the knowledge and gives new insights into how climate variability and the resulting dynamics are related to precipitation in Tropical South America.","[Cordova, Mario; Celleri, Rolando] Univ Cuenca, Dept Recursos Hidr & Ciencias Ambientales, Cuenca 010105, Ecuador; [Cordova, Mario; van Delden, Aarnout] Univ Utrecht, Inst Marine & Atmospher Res Utrecht IMAU, NL-3508 TA Utrecht, Netherlands; [Cordova, Mario; Celleri, Rolando] Univ Cuenca, Fac Ingn, Cuenca 010215, Ecuador",Universidad de Cuenca; Utrecht University; Universidad de Cuenca,"Cordova, M (corresponding author), Univ Cuenca, Dept Recursos Hidr & Ciencias Ambientales, Cuenca 010105, Ecuador.;Cordova, M (corresponding author), Univ Utrecht, Inst Marine & Atmospher Res Utrecht IMAU, NL-3508 TA Utrecht, Netherlands.;Cordova, M (corresponding author), Univ Cuenca, Fac Ingn, Cuenca 010215, Ecuador.",mario.cordovam@ucuenca.edu.ec; rolando.celleri@ucuenca.edu.ec; a.j.vandelden@uu.nl,,"Cordova, Mario/0000-0001-8026-0387",Utrecht University,Utrecht University,This research received no external funding and The APC was funded by Utrecht University.,,48,0,0,2,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4433,,ATMOSPHERE-BASEL,Atmosphere,JUN,2022,6,,,,,,972,10.3390/atmos13060972,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos13060972,,,13,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,2K0ZM,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000816073600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The present study aims to address the knowledge gap in the energy and daylighting performance of algae photobioreactor facade. The paper first studies the effects of algae windows on building energy saving through simulation analysis of an office building in Mashhad, Iran, with a cold semi-arid climate. It also presents a multi-objective optimization framework for the optimization of the energy and daylighting performance of algae windows integrated with an office building facade. Two optimization metrics include maximum Useful Daylight Illuminance (UDI) (%), and minimum Energy Use Intensity (EUI) (kWh/m(2)/yr), representing optimal daylighting and energy performance metrics, respectively. The results demonstrate that a microalgae window significantly reduces building energy consumption comparing with single-glazed, double-glazed, and water windows. The extent of energy savings varies with window size, algae density, and facade orientation. The proposed optimization framework helps increase the average values of energy performance metrics by 21.37%, 33.25%, 36.22%, 39.67%, and daylighting metrics by 4.60%, 14.43%, 13.34%,14.33%, in the north, south, east, and west, respectively and sequentially. Sensitivity analysis demonstrates that window size has the highest effect on two studied performance metrics for all orientations, while algae density has minimal effect on energy consumption and no considerable effect on daylighting performance. Building energy performance simulation is validated by ASHRAE140-2017.","[Talaei, Maryam; Mahdavinejad, Mohammadjavad] Tarbiat Modares Univ, Fac Art & Architecture, Dept Architecture, Jalal Ale Ahmad St,305,Second Floor,Post Box 1411, Tehran 14115111, Iran; [Azari, Rahman] Penn State Univ, Coll Arts & Architecture, State Coll, PA 16801 USA; [Prieto, Alejandro] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Architecture & Built Environm, Dept Architectural Engn Technol Architectural Fa, Julianalaan 134, NL-2628 BL Delft, Netherlands; [Sangin, Hamed] Tehran Univ Art, Coll Architecture & Urban Design, Sakhai St,Hafez Ave, Tehran 1136813518, Iran",Tarbiat Modares University; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Delft University of Technology,"Mahdavinejad, M (corresponding author), Tarbiat Modares Univ, Fac Art & Architecture, Dept Architecture, Jalal Ale Ahmad St,305,Second Floor,Post Box 1411, Tehran 14115111, Iran.",m-talaei@modares.ac.ir; mahdavinejad@modares.ac.ir; razari@psu.edu; A.I.PrietoHoces@tudelft.nl; Hamed.sangin@gmail.com,"Talaei, Maryam/ABG-4261-2021; Mahdavinejad, Mohammadjavad/H-8187-2017","Talaei, Maryam/0000-0002-9428-116X; Sangin, Hamed/0000-0002-1446-2500; Prieto, Alejandro/0000-0003-3386-7682; Mahdavinejad, Mohammadjavad/0000-0002-6454-6518; Azari, Rahman/0000-0002-4844-639X",,,,,113,9,9,5,16,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",,2352-7102,,J BUILD ENG,J.

This phenomenon termed masting or mast seeding has important consequences for plant reproductive success, ecosystem dynamics and plant-human interactions. Inspired by recent advances in the field, this special issue presents a series of articles that advance the current understanding of the ecology and evolution of masting. To provide a broad overview, we reflect on the state-of-the-art of masting research in terms of underlying proximate mechanisms, ontogeny, adaptations, phylogeny and applications to conservation. While the mechanistic drivers and fitness consequences of masting have received most attention, the evolutionary history, ontogenetic trajectory and applications to plant-human interactions are poorly understood. With increased availability of long-term datasets across broader geographical and taxonomic scales, as well as advances in molecular approaches, we expect that many mysteries of masting will be solved soon. The increased understanding of this global phenomenon will provide the foundation for predictive modelling of seed crops, which will improve our ability to manage forests and agricultural fruit and nut crops in the Anthropocene.

However, the environment is currently threatened by several types of automobile pollution. Various international organizations are adopting and enforcing regulatory measures that are getting stricter yearly to minimize automotive emissions. Therefore, steel components in automobiles are being replaced with light metals such as aluminum as a means to minimize emission. Though aluminum's major advantage is its high strength to weight ratio, it does suffer high wear and corrosion in automotive operations. Therefore, the aim of the present research is to synthesize graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) reinforced Ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) nanocomposite coatings on AA2028 Al alloy substrate to provide both wear and corrosion protection. To achieve uniform nanocomposite coating, GNPs and UHMWPE were solution mixed and deposited using the electrostatic spray method. The results showed that UHMWPE/1 wt. % GNPs coating performed best in terms of friction and wear rate reduction while UHMWPE/2 wt. % GNPs coating provided the highest corrosion resistant performance in 3.5 % NaCl solution.

Existing theoretical explanations of the circulation response can be grouped according to latitude. Here we test latitudinally dependent explanations of the circulation response to increased CO2 using slab ocean aquaplanet models with latitudinally dependent CO2 concentration. Quadrupling CO2 in the tropics (0-20 degrees) accounts for the strengthening and upward shift of the subtropical jet but does not account for the poleward shift of the Hadley cell edge or extratropical circulation. The tropical response is dominated by regions of descent. When CO2 is quadrupled in high latitudes (60-90 degrees), there is a negligible circulation response. The response to latitudinally dependent increased CO2 is mostly linear and increased CO2 in the midlatitudes (20-60 degrees) dominates. Within the midlatitudes, the subtropics (20-40 degrees) dominate. Thus, story lines explaining the circulation shift in response to increased CO2 should focus on the thermodynamic response in the subtropics. Plain Language Summary The atmospheric circulation controls the regional response to global warming. There are several robust responses to global warming according to state-of-the-art climate models: (1) the subtropical jet will strengthen and shift upward and (2) the Hadley cell edge, storm tracks, and jet stream will shift poleward. In contrast to the thermodynamic response to climate change, which includes warming of the troposphere, cooling of the stratosphere, warming aloft in the tropics, and Arctic amplification at the surface, robust physically based story lines of the circulation response are lacking. The lack of robust story lines occurs in part because there are many explanations put forward in the literature to explain the circulation response, which have not been properly compared. Here we test latitudinally dependent explanations of the circulation response to increased CO2 using idealized simulations with latitudinally dependent CO2 concentration. The results show that increased CO2 in the tropics accounts for the strengthening and upward shift of the subtropical jet and increased CO2 in midlatitudes accounts for the poleward shift of the Hadley cell edge, storm track, and jet stream. Within the midlatitudes the subtropics dominate.","[Shaw, Tiffany A.; Tan, Zhihong] Univ Chicago, Dept Geophys Sci, 5734 S Ellis Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",University of Chicago,"Shaw, TA (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Dept Geophys Sci, 5734 S Ellis Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",tas1@uchicago.edu,"Tan, Zhihong/I-5200-2019","Tan, Zhihong/0000-0002-7422-3317","National Science Foundation [AGS-1538944, AGS-1742944]; David and Lucile Packard Foundation",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); David and Lucile Packard Foundation(The David & Lucile Packard Foundation),T.

To estimate the order of magnitude of the potential changes in these processes, several assumptions and simplifications are made and, in most cases, they are assessed by using simple, empirical state-of-the-art expressions. The studied processes are grouped in three categories according to whether they affect beaches, harbors or coastal structures in general. The changes in these processes are estimated as a function of the deepwater variations of the main wave parameters: wave height (H (0)), wave period (T) and wave direction (theta (0)). A moderate range of variation is assumed for these parameters at deep water (+/- 10 or +/- 20 % in H (0) and its square root in T, and +/- 10A(0) in theta (0)), taking into account recent studies of future wave projections. The results indicate that potential changes in wave height will strongly affect overtopping discharge, stability and scouring of rubble-mound structures and, to a lesser extent, siltation, wave transmission and longshore sediment transport. Changes in wave direction will affect longshore sediment transport in particular and, at a lower magnitude, processes related to port operability (agitation and siltation). Siltation is the only process affected significantly by changes in T alone.","[Sierra, J.

The segments of the glass industry, e.g., container or flat glass, are quite diverse and attribute to different glass products with different requirements to product quality and various process options. To address the challenge of decarbonizing the glass industry, firstly, an inventory of current glass products, processes and applied technologies in terms of energy efficiency and CO2 emissions is conducted. Secondly, decarbonization options are identified and structured according to fuel substitution, waste heat recovery and process intensification. Due to the high share of energy-related CO2 emissions, electrical melting and hydrogen combustion, or a combination of both, are the most promising options to decarbonize the glass industry but further research, design adjustments and process improvements are necessary. Furthermore, electricity and hydrogen prices have to decrease or fossil fuels must become more expensive, to be cost-competitive relative to fossil fuels and respective infrastructures have to be constructed or adjusted. Various heat recovery options have great potential for CO2 savings but can be technically challenging or have not yet been considered for technoeconomic reasons.","[Zier, Michael; Stenzel, Peter; Kotzur, Leander; Stolten, Detlef] Julich Aachen Res Alliance, JARA Energy, Aachen, Germany; [Zier, Michael; Stenzel, Peter; Kotzur, Leander; Stolten, Detlef] Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Technoecon Syst Anal IEK 3, Wilhelm Johnen Str, D-52428 Julich, Germany; [Stolten, Detlef] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Chair Fuel Cells, Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Technoecon Syst Anal IEK 3, Wilhelm Johnen Str, D-52428 Julich, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Research Center Julich; Helmholtz Association; Research Center Julich; RWTH Aachen University,"Zier, M (corresponding author), Julich Aachen Res Alliance, JARA Energy, Aachen, Germany.",m.zier@fz-juelich.de,,,German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF),German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"The authors would like to thank the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) for funding provided within the Kopernikus -Power-to-X project.

While several scientific studies highlight the strong relation between fisheries and MSP, as well as ways in which fisheries could be included in MSP, the actual integration of fisheries into MSP often fails. In this article, we review the state of the art and latest progress in research on various challenges in the integration of fisheries into MSP. The reviewed studies address a wide range of integration challenges, starting with techniques to analyse where fishermen actually fish, assessing the drivers for fishermen's behaviour, seasonal dynamics and long-term spatial changes of commercial fish species under various anthropogenic pressures along their successive life stages, the effects of spatial competition on fisheries and projections on those spaces that might become important fishing areas in the future, and finally, examining how fisheries could benefit from MSP. This paper gives an overview of the latest developments on concepts, tools, and methods. It becomes apparent that the spatial and temporal dynamics of fish and fisheries, as well as the definition of spatial preferences, remain major challenges, but that an integration of fisheries is already possible today.

In architecture, using natural energy is one of the essential pillars of design because it was one of the criteria of designing, which was considered on climate and geography, and it has been a high performance of climate adaptation in the modeling of traditional houses. In this research, Azerbaijan (located in northwestern Iran) is selected to evaluate the practical features of traditional Iranian houses designed in the cold climate, and criteria for developing sensible solutions to achieve a suitable design model for energy saving are provided. The primary purpose of this paper is to evaluate and identify the features of climate design in traditional houses in a cold climate, which are suitable residential buildings for energy management, and to identify the components affecting energy saving. The data collection method is based on checklists, observation, considering the orientation, density, solar radiation angle in the region, documentary, analysis of maps, and adaptation of the architectural plan of the studied houses with the pattern of solar radiation in the area. This research discusses the design criteria for future structures and their adaptable measures based on the obtained results. Finally, it is declared that the traditional architectural design model follows the region's climatic conditions, and considering the current climate and energies, traditional houses were designed; therefore, the best model for maximum use of available energy is climatic design. As a result, suggestions are made regarding residential architecture design to save energy.","[Sharif, Amirmasood Nakhaee] Islamic Azad Univ Mashhad, Fac Art & Architecture, Dept Architecture, Mashhad, Razavi Khorasan, Iran; [Saleh, Sanaz Keshavarz] Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Architecture, Zanjan Branch, Zanjan, Iran; [Afzal, Sadegh] Univ Mohaghegh Ardabili, Dept Mech Engn, Ardebil, Iran; [Razavi, Niloofar Shoja] Imam Khomeini Int Univ IKIU, Dept Architecture & Urbanism, MA Grad Urban Dev, Qazvin, Iran; [Nasab, Mozhdeh Fadaei] Fac Payame Noor Univ Sirjan, Kerman, Iran; [Kadaei, Samireh] Bushehr Univ, Fac Art & Architecture, Dept Architecture, Bushehr, Iran",Islamic Azad University; Islamic Azad University; University of Mohaghegh Ardabili; Imam Khomeini International University; Persian Gulf University,"Kadaei, S (corresponding author), Bushehr Univ, Fac Art & Architecture, Dept Architecture, Bushehr, Iran.",samira.kadaei@gmail.com,,,,,,,57,0,0,1,1,WILEY-HINDAWI,LONDON,"ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FL, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, WIT 5HE, ENGLAND",1076-2787,1099-0526,,COMPLEXITY,Complexity,5-Sep,2022,,,,,,,3522883,10.1155/2022/3522883,http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2022/3522883,,,12,"Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Multidisciplinary Sciences",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Mathematics; Science & Technology - Other Topics,5P1IN,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000872913200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Originally focussed on Last Glacial to Interglacial Transition (LGIT: 22,000-11,500 years B.P.), the INTIMATE group has now extended its study period back to 60,000 years. As a first step, the INTIMATE event stratigraphy has now been extended to include 8000-48,000 b2k based on a combined NGRIP and GRIP isotope profile against a GICC05 chronology and key tephra horizons from Iceland and continental European volcanic sources. In this lead article of this INTIMATE special issue we introduce some of the recent achievements of the INTIMATE community and discuss the challenges associated with extending the INTIMATE approach back in time, focussing in particular on the chronological problems inherent in comparing different proxy records. The INTIMATE approach has thus far been limited predominantly to the North Atlantic and Australasian regions and we also discuss the potential to extend the INTIMATE protocol beyond these regions.

Using several metrics, GloSea5-GC2 shows similar skill to other state-of-the-art seasonal forecast systems. The prediction skill of the large-scale South Asian monsoon circulation is higher than that of Indian monsoon rainfall. Using multiple linear regression analysis we evaluate relationships between Indian monsoon rainfall and five possible drivers of monsoon interannual variability. Over the time period studied (1992-2011), the El Nio-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Indian Ocean dipole (IOD) are the most important of these drivers in both observations and GloSea5-GC2. Our analysis indicates that ENSO and its teleconnection with Indian rainfall are well represented in GloSea5-GC2. However, the relationship between the IOD and Indian rainfall anomalies is too weak in GloSea5-GC2, which may be limiting the prediction skill of the local monsoon circulation and Indian rainfall. We show that this weak relationship likely results from a coupled mean state bias that limits the impact of anomalous wind forcing on SST variability, resulting in erroneous IOD SST anomalies. Known difficulties in representing convective precipitation over India may also play a role. Since Indian rainfall responds weakly to the IOD, it responds more consistently to ENSO than in observations. Our assessment identifies specific coupled biases that are likely limiting GloSea5-GC2 Indian summer monsoon seasonal prediction skill, providing targets for model improvement.","[Johnson, Stephanie J.; Turner, Andrew; Woolnough, Steven] Univ Reading, Dept Meteorol, Natl Ctr Atmospher Sci, Earley Gate, Reading RG6 6BB, Berks, England; [Johnson, Stephanie J.] ECMWF, Reading RG2 9AX, Berks, England; [Martin, Gill; MacLachlan, Craig] Met Off Hadley Ctr, FitzRoy Rd, Exeter EX1 3PB, Devon, England",UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); NERC National Centre for Atmospheric Science; University of Reading; European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF); Met Office - UK; Hadley Centre,"Johnson, SJ (corresponding author), Univ Reading, Dept Meteorol, Natl Ctr Atmospher Sci, Earley Gate, Reading RG6 6BB, Berks, England.;Johnson, SJ (corresponding author), ECMWF, Reading RG2 9AX, Berks, England.",s.j.bush@reading.ac.uk,"Turner, Andrew G/D-2286-2009","Turner, Andrew G/0000-0002-0642-6876; MacLachlan, Craig/0000-0002-9151-9152; Woolnough, Steven/0000-0003-0500-8514; Johnson, Stephanie/0000-0002-0569-043X","Earth System Science Organization, Ministry of Earth Sciences, Government of India [MM/SERP/Univ_Reading_UK/2013/INT-13, MM/TURNER/RP/01]; National Centre for Atmospheric Sciences Climate directorate, a Natural Environment Research Council [R8/H12/83/001]; Joint UK DECC/Defra Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme [GA01101]; Natural Environment Research Council [ncas10009] Funding Source: researchfish","Earth System Science Organization, Ministry of Earth Sciences, Government of India; National Centre for Atmospheric Sciences Climate directorate, a Natural Environment Research Council; Joint UK DECC/Defra Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme; Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC))","S.J.J. would like to acknowledge Dr. Emanuel Dutra for his help accessing and understanding ERA-Interim/Land reanalysis data.

They are commonly characterized through a hierarchy of physical frames and contributing factors (biomass accumulation, climatic conditions, ignition parameters, development patterns), but the human dimension is often relegated to the background. Furthermore, most technical approaches address the wildfire problem on both a local and global scale but ignore the intermediate regional level, which is the most appropriate for analysing terrains and conditions that favour the development of fires. In contrast, I focus here on the Mediterranean Basin as a whole, an area considered particularly vulnerable. Studying wildfires across such an extended area entails a patchwork of geosystems that are subjected to different human pressures in the form of varying development patterns. I examined forest and other forms of wildfires that occurred in the region from 2001 to 2013 through combined MODIS derived data (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, Burned Areas and Land Cover Types). This approach, in addressing the critical need for mapping the entire area, produced new and more comprehensive insights into the basin than conventional segmented views. Statistical, time-series and hotspot analyses demonstrate that the importance of agricultural or pastoral use of prescribed fires is largely underrated. While public attention is mainly focused on megafires, the impacts of armed conflicts and political-economic turmoil are clearly evidenced, highlighting the complexity of human-based geosystems.","[Darques, Regis] Univ Montpellier 3, CNRS, UMR 5281, ART Dev, Site St Charles,Route Mende, FR-34090 Montpellier, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); CIRAD; Universite Paul-Valery; Universite Perpignan Via Domitia; Universite de Montpellier,"Darques, R (corresponding author), Univ Montpellier 3, CNRS, UMR 5281, ART Dev, Site St Charles,Route Mende, FR-34090 Montpellier, France.",regis.darques@univ-montp3.fr,"Darques, Régis/AAA-4308-2020","DARQUES, Regis/0000-0001-9827-113X",ART-Dev -Joint Research Unit of Montpellier [UMR 5281],ART-Dev -Joint Research Unit of Montpellier,"This research was supported by the UMR 5281 ART-Dev -Joint Research Unit of Montpellier Actors, resources, and territories in development.

This article gives an overview of the actual state of art for evaluating the environmental properties of timber buildings in Europe and shows how these methods could be used as a basis for estimating the influence of a possible shift from conventional buildings to timber buildings on the national Greenhouse Gas (GHG) budget, whereby Germany serves as an example. Results from up-to-date LCA calculations of residential buildings for Germany are shown on a building level. Then a scaling from the building level to a national level is presented. On the national scale, the potential GHG impact of wood consumption in the building sector is modeled based on an insinuated future increase of the market share of timber buildings. The deviation of future emissions and removals due to the biogenic carbon storage effects for changing scenarios is presented. The approach shows how increasing timber construction (mass timber and timber frame) can contribute to achieving climate protection targets.","[Hafner, Annette] Ruhr Univ Bochum, Dept Civ & Environm Engn, Resource Efficient Bldg, Univ Str 150 IC 5-159, D-44801 Bochum, Germany; [Rueter, Sebastian] Thunen Inst Wood Res, Unit Impact Wood Utilisat Environm & Climate, Leuschnerstr 91c, D-21031 Hamburg, Germany",Ruhr University Bochum; Johann Heinrich von Thunen Institute,"Hafner, A (corresponding author), Ruhr Univ Bochum, Dept Civ & Environm Engn, Resource Efficient Bldg, Univ Str 150 IC 5-159, D-44801 Bochum, Germany.",annette.hafner@rub.de; sebastian.rueter@thuenen.de,,,,,,,33,15,15,5,16,SOC WOOD SCI TECHNOL,MADISON,"ONE GIFFORD PINCHOT DR, MADISON, WI 53705 USA",0735-6161,,,WOOD FIBER SCI,Wood Fiber Sci.,AUG,2018,,,SI,,139,154,,10.22382/wfs-2018-047,http://dx.doi.org/10.22382/wfs-2018-047,,,16,"Forestry; Materials Science, Paper & Wood; Materials Science, Textiles",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Forestry; Materials Science,GQ5NJ,,Bronze,,,12/21/22,WOS:000441731700012,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, studying of the drought effects on GPP is still challenging, partly due to the lack of direct observations of GPP at large scales. Aiming to explore the potential of spaceborne sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) in monitoring vegetation droughts and quantifying the drought-induced GPP variabilities, we evaluated GOME-2 SIF with two state-of-art GPP products (i.e. FLUXCOM GPP and GLASS GPP) and flux tower observed GPP, using 2009 summer drought in Northeast China and 2010 spring drought in Southwest China as study cases. We found that SIF was a quantifying indicator of GPP and successfully characterized the temporal dynamics and spatial extents of GPP anomalies during the drought events, as well as accurately estimating the drought-induced GPP losses. Moreover, SIF (R-2 = 0.87) performed better than enhanced vegetation index (R-2 = 0.78) in capturing the photosynthesis changes induced by droughts, suggesting SIF was more sensitive to plant physiological changes. The strong positive correlations of SIF with Palmer drought severity index (PDSI) and root-zone soil moisture, further gave confidences on the capacity of SIF in vegetation drought monitoring. SIF had a time lag response to both PDSI and soil moisture, which might be attributable to the plants adaptation mechanisms for the drought occurrence and physiological recovery after water stress. Our study demonstrates that satellite-based SIF can achieve real-time vegetation drought monitoring and the assessment of drought-induced GPP anomalies at large scales, thus providing a unique opportunity to study the impacts of drought on vegetation carbon uptake.","[Chen, Shiliu; Huang, Yuefei; Wang, Guangqian] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Hydraul Engn, State Key Lab Hydrosci & Engn, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Chen, Shiliu] Harvard Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Huang, Yuefei] Qinghai Univ, State Key Lab Plateau Ecol & Agr, Xining 810016, Qinghai, Peoples R China",Tsinghua University; Harvard University; Qinghai University,"Chen, SL; Huang, YF (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Dept Hydraul Engn, State Key Lab Hydrosci & Engn, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",csl16@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn; yuefeihuang@tsinghua.edu.cn,,"Chen, Shiliu/0000-0002-1343-1008","National Natural Science Foundation of China [91647212]; Major Basic Research Development Program of the Science and Technology Agent, Qinghai Province [2019-SF-146]; China Scholarship Council [201906210310]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Major Basic Research Development Program of the Science and Technology Agent, Qinghai Province; China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council)","This work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 91647212) and Major Basic Research Development Program of the Science and Technology Agent, Qinghai Province (2019-SF-146).

However, large computational demands of state-of-the art hydrodynamic flood models makes multiple and real-time simulations unfeasible. This study presents a fast-dynamic GIS-based flood model, FloodStmem. FloodStroem generates a surface network of depressions (bluespots) and flow paths, and routes surcharged water from a subsurface drainage model through the network resulting in flood depth maps and associated damage costs. FloodStroem is tested on three sub-catchments in Elster Creek Catchment, Melbourne, Australia and benchmarked against the 2D distributed hydrodynamic model MIKE 21 and two other simplified models, RUFIDAM and CA-ffe. FloodStmem is robust to the number of bluespots included. For the three sub-catchments, FloodStroem can reproduce flooding time, pattern, depth, and damage costs sufficiently, but has a tendency to underestimate flooding upstream and overestimate flooding downstream. Performance is best for the large, steep sub-catchments and largest rainstorms, where FloodStroem performs better than the two other simplified models. The Critical Success Index (CSI) ranges from 23% for a 5-year storm event in a flat catchment to 65% for a 100-year return period for a steeper catchment. With respect to simulation time, FloodStroem is five orders of magnitude faster than the 2D hydrodynamic model, and 33 times faster when including the entire model setup time, which has potential for further reduction by optimization of the workflow.","[Thrysoe, Cecilie; Borup, Morten; Lowe, Roland; Arnbjerg-Nielsen, Karsten] Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Environm Engn, Climate & Monitoring Sect, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark; [Balstrom, Thomas] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Geosci & Nat Management, DK-1350 Copenhagen K, Denmark; [Jamali, Behzad] Univ New South Wales Sydney, Water Res Ctr, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia",Technical University of Denmark; University of Copenhagen; University of New South Wales Sydney,"Thrysoe, C (corresponding author), Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Environm Engn, Climate & Monitoring Sect, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark.",cethry@env.dtu.dk; tb@ign.ku.dk; morb@env.dtu.dk; rolo@env.dtu.dk; b.jamali@unsw.edu.au; karn@env.dtu.dk,"Balstrøm, Thomas/AHI-0567-2022; Loewe, Roland/AAQ-2793-2020; Arnbjerg-Nielsen, Karsten/J-7792-2012","Balstrøm, Thomas/0000-0002-5328-5914; Loewe, Roland/0000-0002-5549-5456; Arnbjerg-Nielsen, Karsten/0000-0002-6221-9505",Australian Government through the Cooperative Research Centre for Water Sensitive Cities; Innovation Fund Denmark through Water Smart Cities project under the Grand Solutions programme [5157-00009B]; Realdania through the Smart Cities Water Solutions project under the Klimaspring programme,Australian Government through the Cooperative Research Centre for Water Sensitive Cities; Innovation Fund Denmark through Water Smart Cities project under the Grand Solutions programme; Realdania through the Smart Cities Water Solutions project under the Klimaspring programme,"This research has been financially supported by the Australian Government through the Cooperative Research Centre for Water Sensitive Cities, Realdania through the Smart Cities Water Solutions project under the Klimaspring programme and the Innovation Fund Denmark through the Water Smart Cities project under the Grand Solutions programme (grant no 5157-00009B).

Hence the residents could both use the excavated soil and proper thermal conditions by creating a microclimate. Over the past few years, green cover of buildings have been developed as useful and beneficial elements in designing ceilings and facades. This paper considers the cooling effect of three systems of living walls with the help of Design Builder simulation software in hot-dry climate (sunken courtyard of old houses in Yazd). The findings show that the thermal difference of inner surface between noncovered and plant-covered walls is significant in type 2. In type 3, thermal difference at night reaches 12 centigrade in some hours. Thermal difference in the three systems, changes from 2 degrees C to at most 21 degrees C. Furthermore, the decrease of thermal changes is significant when living wall details are used (type 2 and 3). Given the results, the use of green architectural coating with different systems has a significant impact on the increase of the quality of interior air and consequently the decrease of cooling energy consumption.","[Vaezizadeh, Fatemeh] Islamic Azad Univ, Kerman Branch, Dept Art & Architecture, Kerman, Iran; [Rashidisharifabad, Siavash] Islamic Azad Univ, Shahrbabak Branch, Dept Art & Architecture, Shahrbabak, Iran; [Afhami, Reza] Tarbiat Modares Univ, Dept Art & Architecture, Tehran, Iran",Islamic Azad University; Islamic Azad University; Tarbiat Modares University,"Vaezizadeh, F (corresponding author), Islamic Azad Univ, Kerman Branch, Dept Art & Architecture, Kerman, Iran.",,"Sharifabad, Siavash Rashidi/AAO-3658-2021; Afhami, Reza/C-7221-2014","Afhami, Reza/0000-0002-7678-6164",,,,,11,4,4,0,18,EUROPEAN CENTER SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT,ROME,"VIA DEI FIORI 34, ROME, 00172, ITALY",2239-5938,2239-6101,,EUR J SUSTAIN DEV,Eur.

State-of-the-art models, however, show significant simulation biases. In this study, we assess the main uncertainty associated with model physics in snow cover modeling over the TP using ground-based observations and high-resolution snow cover satellite products from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and FengYun-3B (FY3B). We first conducted 10-km simulations using the Noah with multiparameterization (Noah-MP) land surface model by optimizing physics-scheme options, which reduces 8.2% absolute bias of annual snow cover fraction (SCF) compared with the default model settings. Then, five SCF parameterizations in Noah-MP were optimized and assessed, with three of them further reducing the annual SCF biases from around 15% to less than 2%. Thus, optimizing SCF parameterizations appears to be more important than optimizing physics-scheme options in reducing the uncertainty of snow modeling. As a result of improved SCF, the positive bias of simulated surface albedo decreases significantly compared to the GLASS albedo data, particularly in high-elevation regions. This substantially enhances the absorbed solar radiation and further reduces the annual mean biases of ground temperature from -3.5 to -0.8 degrees C and snow depth from 4.2 to 0.2 mm. However, the optimized model still overestimates SCF in the western TP and underestimates SCF in the eastern TP. Further analysis using a higher-resolution (4 km) simulation driven by topographically adjusted air temperature shows slight improvement, suggesting a rather limited contribution of the finer-scale land surface characteristics to SCF uncertainty.","[Jiang, Yingsha] Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Ecoenvironm & Resources, Key Lab Land Surface Proc & Climate Change Cold &, Lanzhou, Peoples R China; [Chen, Fei; He, Cenlin; Barlage, Michael] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Res Applicat Lab, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [Gao, Yanhong] Fudan Univ, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Gao, Yanhong] Fudan Univ, Inst Atmospher Sci, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Huang, Wubin] Lanzhou Cent Meteorol Observ, Lanzhou, Peoples R China",Chinese Academy of Sciences; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; Fudan University; Fudan University,"Gao, YH (corresponding author), Fudan Univ, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Shanghai, Peoples R China.;Gao, YH (corresponding author), Fudan Univ, Inst Atmospher Sci, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",gaoyh@fudan.edu.cn; barlage@ucar.edu,"He, Cenlin/AAC-8185-2021; Chen, Fei/B-1747-2009","He, Cenlin/0000-0002-7367-2815; Chen, Fei/0000-0003-2573-3828; gao, yan hong/0000-0002-0403-2929; Jiang, Yingsha/0000-0002-1567-2374","Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research (STEP) program [2019QZKK010314]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [91537211, 91537105]; NOAA [NA18OAR4590398, NA18OAR4310134]; NCAR Water System; National Science Foundation; Fudan University-Tibet University Joint Laboratory for Biodiversity and Global Change",Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research (STEP) program; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); NCAR Water System; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Fudan University-Tibet University Joint Laboratory for Biodiversity and Global Change,"We thank Zhaojun Zheng and Jianduo Li from the National Satellite Meteorological Centre (NSMC) of CMA for helping with the usage of FY3B MULSS snow cover data.

Metropolitan cities are centers for technical and economic advancement, but air pollution, overflowing of water, and other climate effects still pose significant problems related to nature, climate, and the environment. Cities are vulnerable to increasingly dense, diverse, and interdependent urban systems. A single extreme occurrence can contribute to a systemic break-up of a city's infrastructure, often like dominoes. In this paper, a dynamic integration-assisted population management solution (DI-PMS) has been proposed. DI-PMS recognizes that the latest facilities' optimal usage of knowledge and technologies is needed to increase urbanization. They are one of the critical priorities of the weather community. Such integrated urban weather, environmental, and climate services will help cities address dangers including storms, floods, heatwaves, and air pollution, especially in climate change. The goal is to create urban facilities that satisfy communities' unique needs by high-resolution forecasting and pollution reduction climate services, which allow the construction of durable, robust, and thriving cities that support the Sustainable Development Goals. Several recent international surveys to explore these topics have been undertaken. DI-PMS gives a brief description of urban hydrometeorological, climate and air pollution activities, outlines the new urban integrated weather and environmental services concept, and emphasizes the need for science to be implemented.","[Chai, Ning] Hunan Univ Technol & Business, Sch Publ Adm & Human Geog, Changsha 410205, Peoples R China; [Mao, Chun] Univ Malaya, Cultural Ctr, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia; [Chai, Ning; Mao, Chun] Hunan Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Architecture & Art Design, Xiangtan 411201, Peoples R China",Hunan University of Technology & Business; Universiti Malaya; Hunan University of Science & Technology,"Mao, C (corresponding author), Univ Malaya, Cultural Ctr, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia.;Mao, C (corresponding author), Hunan Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Architecture & Art Design, Xiangtan 411201, Peoples R China.",chainingzp@163.com; mosunsu@126.com,,,Hunan Provincial Natural Science Foundation [2019JJ50171]; Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China Humanities and Social Sciences Youth Foundation [18YJCZH008]; Hunan Provincial Philosophy and Social Science Fundation [17YBA165]; Kingfar International Inc.

They provide a synthesis of various heterogeneous observational systems and model simulations using a physical model together with a data assimilation scheme. Current reanalyses are mainly global, while regional reanalyses are emerging for North America, the polar region, and most recently for Europe. However, deep convection is still parameterized even in the regional reanalyses. A novel convective-scale regional reanalysis system for Central Europe (COSMO-REA2) has been developed by the Hans-Ertel Center for Weather Research - Climate Monitoring Branch. The system is based on the COSMO model and uses observational nudging for regional data assimilation. In addition to conventional observations, radar-derived rain rates are assimilated using latent heat nudging. With a horizontal grid-spacing of 2 km, the model runs without parameterization of deep moist convection. COSMO-REA2 produces horizontal wind fields that represent a realistic energy spectrum for horizontal scales above 14 km. COSMO-REA2 is currently available for seven years from 2007 to 2013. This study illustrates the improved representation of local precipitation over Germany by the convective-scale reanalysis COSMO-REA2 compared to coarser gridded European and global reanalyses. A systematic verification using rain gauge data reveals the added value of high-resolution regional atmospheric reanalyses on different time scales. On monthly to annual time scales, regional reanalyses yield better estimates of the spatial variability of precipitation patterns which can not be provided by coarser gridded global models. On hourly to daily time scales, the convective-scale reanalysis substantially improves the representation of local precipitation in two ways. On the one hand, COSMO-REA2 shows an enhanced representation of observed frequencies of local precipitation, especially for high precipitation events, which is mainly due to the high spatial resolution. On the other hand, the assimilation of radar data largely improves the spatial and temporal coherence between model output and local observations.

In addition, such electronic parts can often be simultaneously exposed to extreme surrounding temperatures between -65 degrees C and 200 degrees C after storage in non-climate-controlled conditions. Electronic equipment can be subjected to strain rates of 1 to 100 per second in shock and vibration. Many of the doped SAC soldering alloys in the electronic components, including SAC-Q, SAC-R, Innolot have found applications in long-term thermal exposure environments. Low temperature high strain-rate properties are needed to assure durability under high temperature storage followed by shock and vibration. There is scarcity of high strain-rate data on alloys exposed to high temperature aging operating at extreme low-temperatures and extremely-high temperatures. For this study, SAC-Q material was tested and analyzed at temperatures from -65 degrees C to 200 degrees C and at a strain rates of from 10 to 75 per second. Following the production and retrieval of the specimens, specimens were stored for isothermal aging for up to 6 months at 100 degrees C temperature, before performing tensile test experiments at various operating temperatures. Stress vs strain curves are formed for the wide range of strain rates and surrounding temperatures. In addition, test results and data were complemented by the Anand viscoplasticity model and by calculating stress-strain behavior, evaluated in a wide range of working temperatures and strains rates.","[Lall, Pradeep; Mehta, Vishal; Suhling, Jeff] Auburn Univ, NSF CAVE3 Elect Res Ctr, Dept Mech Engn, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Blecker, Ken] US Army Combat Capabil Dev Command Armament Ctr, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ USA",Auburn University System; Auburn University; National Science Foundation (NSF),"Lall, P (corresponding author), Auburn Univ, NSF CAVE3 Elect Res Ctr, Dept Mech Engn, Auburn, AL 36849 USA.",lall@auburn.edu,,,SERC titled -Characterization of Emerging Technologies in Military Environments from Combat Capabilities Development Command -Armament Center [ART-001],SERC titled -Characterization of Emerging Technologies in Military Environments from Combat Capabilities Development Command -Armament Center,"SERC ART-001 titled -Characterization of Emerging Technologies in Military Environments from Combat Capabilities Development Command -Armament Center, supported the project.

It requires a Mean Radiant Temperature (MRT) sensor and a humidity sensor. The MRT sensor is placed on the cabin compartment roof and points towards the dashboard and the windshield. Therefore it may be used to estimate windshield inner surface temperature. Combining this last piece of information with cabin relative humidity measured by the humidity sensor, the estimation algorithm forecasts fogging conditions so that the automatic thermal control system is able to take actions before fogging starts to appear. Centro Ricerche Fiat has already developed for Fiat Auto and patented a cabin thermal control that uses as feedback just MRT and blown air temperature one.

Here, oxidative differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was adopted to characterise BC from charcoal, soot, graphite, BC-containing soils, charred plant tissues and to compare its thermal stability to that of other carbonaceous materials (lignite and bituminous coal) and possible interfering substances (melanoidin, humic acid, shale and plant tissues). Peak temperatures were the most reliable attribute to characterise the thermal stability, increasing from wood (as the most stable non-BC material investigated, maximum peak temperatures T-p < 505 degrees C) < charred wood (Tp 500-513 degrees C) < charcoals (T-p 520-525 degrees C) < soots (T-p 620-630 degrees C) < graphite (T-p > 850 degrees C). From the comparison with NMR data, it is inferred that the oxidative stability of BC is more controlled by the degree of order (crystallinity) than by its aromaticity. Charring increased the oxidative stability of wood as indicated by a complete loss of thermally labile compounds below 400 degrees C and a shift of the stable peak from 484 degrees C up to 513 degrees C. However, thermal regions for charred and native wood interfered, thus preventing a definite assignment of BC in that temperature region. Bituminous coal (T-p 546 degrees C) was the only non-BC material interfering with BC peak temperatures in the charcoal region. Together, DSC measurements provided further evidence for a continuum of BC in terms of thermal stability. Standard addition experiments with charcoal and soot to soils revealed a strong linear relationship (R-2 0.99) between the amounts of BC added and peak height at the respective temperature, indicating that DSC is a suitable screening method for quantifying thermally stable BC in soil.

Here we present an analysis of new v7.0 SAGE II data which shows a smaller upper stratosphere ozone SCS, due to a more realistic ozone-temperature anticorrelation. New simulations from a state-of-art 3-D chemical transport model show a small SCS in the upper stratosphere, which is in agreement with SAGE v7.0 data and the shorter Halogen Occultation Experiment and Microwave Limb Sounder records. However, despite these improvements in the SAGE II data, there are still large uncertainties in current observational and meteorological reanalysis data sets, so accurate quantification of the influence of solar flux variability on the climate system remains an open scientific question.","[Dhomse, S.

For each value type, valuation approaches and examples of their application in Sub-Saharan African contexts are presented. The review is drawn from a series of recent methodological discussions, working papers and field research reports focusing on the benefits of locally determined and ecosystem-based adaptations under dryland climate extremes. The focus is on the challenges faced by practitioners and researchers tasked with developing benefit-cost assessments for investments in the adaptive management and conservation of dryland ecosystems, particularly in marginalized dry and drought-prone areas of Sub-Saharan Africa.

To create some new idea collisions on the efficient use of the light environment and promote the interpretation of such vernacular architectures for modern architects, the luminous environments of two typical vernacular architectures, one in China and one in the United States, were studied. By combining experimental measurements and computer simulations, the luminous environments were explored with a focus on the aspects of natural illumination conditions and the effects of windows and orientation. The illumination conditions of the China Meishan Cultural Park farmhouse (designated as the CMCP farmhouse) in China and the Magnolia Mound Plantation house (designated as the MMP house) in the United States were found to generally meet the IES standards. Furthermore, less artificial lighting and more uniform illumination across the entire gallery were advantages in the MMP house. The lateral windows of the house were beneficial in that they provided more natural lighting and were more conducive to the spread of illumination, but this was not the case for the dormer window. To some extent, the east-west orientation favoured more natural illumination, while the illumination distribution in the south-north orientation was more uniform.","[Ma, Ke; Chen, Feihu] Hunan Univ, Sch Design, Changsha 410082, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Ma, Ke; Huang, Yangan; Chen, Feihu] Hunan Univ, Sch Architecture, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China",Hunan University; Hunan University,"Ma, K (corresponding author), Hunan Univ, Sch Design, Changsha 410082, Hunan, Peoples R China.",ke.ma.198901@gmail.com,,,"School of Architecture, Hunan University; College of Art & Design, Louisiana State University","School of Architecture, Hunan University; College of Art & Design, Louisiana State University","This work and the exchange programme are supported by the cooperation between the School of Architecture, Hunan University and the College of Art & Design, Louisiana State University.",,24,1,1,0,2,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1751-2549,1756-2201,,ADV BUILD ENERGY RES,Adv.

The model is very simple, consisting of frequency-dependent polynomial coefficients describing the pressure and temperature dependence of absorption. Currently it is implemented for the halocarbon species required by the Radiative Forcing Model Intercomparison Project. In cases where cross-section data is available at a range of different temperatures and pressures, this approach offers practical advantages compared to previously available options, and is traceable, since the polynomial coefficients follow directly from the laboratory spectra. The new model is freely available and has several important applications, notably in remote sensing and in developing advanced radiation schemes for global circulation models that include halocarbon absorption. For demonstration, the model is applied to the problem of computing instantaneous clear-sky halocarbon radiative efficiencies and present day radiative forcing. Results are in reasonable agreement with earlier assessments that were carried out with the less explicit Pinnock method, and thus broadly validate that method. Plain Language Summary Chlorofluorocarbons and other related gases have dense and complicated absorption spectra that can be measured in the laboratory. We bring such measurements to a form that can be used for simulations of the transfer of radiation through the atmosphere. Then we use the new model to calculate new estimates of the climate impact of these man-made gases. The results broadly validate earlier calculations that were done with a less explicit method.","[Buehler, Stefan A.; Brath, Manfred; Lemke, Oliver; Larsson, Richard] Univ Hamburg, Fachbereich Erdsyst Wissensch, Fak Math Informat & Natur Wissensch, Meteorol Inst,Ctr Erdsyst & Nachhaltigkeitsforsch, Hamburg, Germany; [Hodnebrog, Oivind] Ctr Int Climate Res CICERO, Oslo, Norway; [Pincus, Robert] Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY USA; [Eriksson, Patrick] Chalmers Univ Technol, Dept Space Earth & Environm, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Gordon, Iouli] Harvard & Smithsonian, Atom & Mol Phys Div, Ctr Astrophys, Cambridge, MA USA",University of Hamburg; Columbia University; Chalmers University of Technology; Smithsonian Institution,"Buehler, SA (corresponding author), Univ Hamburg, Fachbereich Erdsyst Wissensch, Fak Math Informat & Natur Wissensch, Meteorol Inst,Ctr Erdsyst & Nachhaltigkeitsforsch, Hamburg, Germany.",stefan.boehler@uni-hamburg.de,"; Buehler, Stefan Alexander/A-4056-2009; Eriksson, Patrick/A-5321-2009; Hodnebrog, Oivind/F-5539-2015","Pincus, Robert/0000-0002-0016-3470; Buehler, Stefan Alexander/0000-0001-6389-1160; Gordon, Iouli/0000-0003-4763-2841; Eriksson, Patrick/0000-0002-8475-0479; Hodnebrog, Oivind/0000-0001-5233-8992; Lemke, Oliver/0000-0002-4823-2084",,,,,36,0,0,0,0,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",,1942-2466,,J ADV MODEL EARTH SY,J.

As illustrated by the acceleration of the number of publications and the abundance of review papers on this topic, this is now a mature study field. Thus, the objective of this keynote conference is not to add a review more on the state of the art concerning CFD modelling of greenhouses, but with respect to the other existing modelling approaches, to try listing the advantages and constraints of the numerical models for exploring the greenhouse crop system or to help mastering it, in line with the new constraints of sustainable production. The main modelling approaches and particularly CFD will be reminded, together with their objectives and application domains. Particular attention will be devoted to their ability to reproduce the various state variables characterising the system, together with their spatial distributions and dynamic evolutions. Their ability to be coupled with the other models allowing understanding of the greenhouse-crop-biotic agents system will be also carefully examined, as well as their use facilities. This analysis will pertain both for knowledge and applied models, in such various fields as greenhouse design improvement, greenhouse-crop system optimisation, greenhouse climate control, phytopathology and on line climate control. Finally, the main objectives involved in the sustainable development of greenhouses will be mentioned and the ability of greenhouse CFD modelling to help achieve them will be thoroughly examined.","INRA, Unite Rech Integrees Hort, UR880, F-06903 Sophia Antipolis, France",INRAE,"Boulard, T (corresponding author), INRA, Unite Rech Integrees Hort, UR880, 400 Route Chappes,BP 167, F-06903 Sophia Antipolis, France.",boulard@sophia.inra.fr,"Boulard, Thierry/B-5381-2011",,,,,,21,4,4,0,10,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-90-66050-47-1,ACTA HORTIC,,,2011,893,,,,145,153,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2011.893.9,http://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2011.893.9,,,9,Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BAS45,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000305385800009,View Full Record in Web of Science

Differences in land cover and climate regulate the evapotranspiration flux. Forests can have deep roots that access groundwater facilitating transpiration throughout the dry season independent of precipitation. This stable transpiration buffers the forest against precipitation variability. However, it is not known whether the buffering effect, already modeled for tropical forests, is common to all forests globally. Here we apply a state-of-the-art Lagrangian moisture tracking model (UTrack) to study whether forest land cover in the upwind precipitationshed can lead to a reduction in monthly precipitation variability downwind. We found a significant buffering effect of forests in the precipitation variability of 10 out of 14 biomes globally. On average, if 50% of precipitation originates from forest, then we find a reduction in the coefficient of variation of monthly precipitation of 60%. We also observed that a high fraction of precipitation from non-forest land sources tends to have the opposite effect, that is, no buffering effect. The average variation of monthly precipitation was 69% higher in areas where 50% of precipitation originates from non-forest land sources in the precipitationshed. Our results emphasize the importance of land cover composition in the precipitationshed to buffer precipitation variability downwind, in particular forest cover. Understanding the influence of land cover in a precipitationshed on atmospheric moisture transport is key for evaluating an area's water-climate regulatory ecosystem services and may become increasingly important due to continued changes in land cover and climate change.","[O'Connor, John C.; Dekker, Stefan C.; Staal, Arie; Tuinenburg, Obbe A.; Rebel, Karin T.] Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Dept Environm Sci, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Santos, Maria J.] Univ Zurich, Dept Geog, Zurich, Switzerland",Utrecht University; University of Zurich,"O'Connor, JC (corresponding author), Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Dept Environm Sci, Utrecht, Netherlands.",j.c.oconnor@uu.nl,"; Dekker, Stefan/F-5581-2013; Santos, Maria Joao/M-5034-2013","Staal, Arie/0000-0001-5409-1436; Dekker, Stefan/0000-0001-7764-2464; O'Connor, John/0000-0003-1431-0651; Tuinenburg, Obbe/0000-0001-6895-0094; Santos, Maria Joao/0000-0002-6558-7477","Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek [016.veni.171.019]; Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek --Graduate Program in Nature Conservation, Management and Restoration; University Research Priority Program in Global Change and Biodiversity, University of Zurich","Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)European Commission); Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek --Graduate Program in Nature Conservation, Management and Restoration; University Research Priority Program in Global Change and Biodiversity, University of Zurich","Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, Grant/ Award Number: 016.veni.171.019; Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek --Graduate Program in Nature Conservation, Management and Restoration; University Research Priority Program in Global Change and Biodiversity, University of Zurich",,52,9,9,10,30,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

In this regard, urban forests play a crucial role. The quantification of the ecosystem services is geo-specific and needs studies in different urban contexts. At this scope, we evaluated the urban forest of a neighborhood of a densely built-up Italian city (Perugia) with a low level of urban greenery management and with a tree inventory still in progress. Furthermore, we defined a tool helpful in tree-planting decisions and management. This paper involves citizens in field research for trees inventory. Then, it uses i-Tree Eco to evaluate four ecosystem services (carbon storage and sequestration, pollution removal, and runoff avoided) provided by 373 inventoried urban trees belonging to 57 species. Our results show that Italian Municipal tree inventories do not adequately represent their urban forest and that citizens' participation provides a cost-effective method for integrating field data.

Aiming to support all stakeholders in Australia's emerging wave energy industry, this study presents a revised assessment of Australia's national wave energy resource. The assessment is based on a state-of-the-art global wave hindcast, with higher resolution in the Australian region. Validation of the hindcast relative to in-situ wave buoy and satellite altimeter observations show better comparison than prior assessments. The total nationally available resource is similar in magnitude to earlier studies, but regional differences are evident. The total integrated energy flux across the 200 m contour is approximately 2730 TWh/yr, with estimates of resource along the north and eastern coasts being less than previously estimated. This revised pre-competitive resource information is delivered coincidently with marine management and alternative use (constraint layers), and energy infrastructure, spatial information via the open-access Australian Wave Energy Atlas (AWavEA), served through the Australian Renewable Energy Infrastructure (AREMI).

Model veracity was first tested against atmospheric Hg measurements. Most of the natural archive and atmospheric data came from the Canadian Greenland sectors of the Arctic, whereas spatial coverage was poor in other regions. In general, for the Canadian Greenland Arctic, models provided good agreement with atmospheric gaseous elemental Hg (GEM) concentrations and trends measured instrumentally. However, there are few instrumented deposition data with which to test the model estimates of Hg deposition, and these data suggest models over-estimated deposition fluxes under Arctic conditions. Reconstructed GEM data from glacial firn on Greenland Summit showed the best agreement with the known decline in global Hg emissions after about 1980, and were corroborated by archived aerosol filter data from Resolute, Nunavut The relatively stable or slowly declining firn and model GEM trends after 1990 were also corroborated by real-time instrument measurements at Alert, Nunavut, after 1995. However, Hg fluxes and trends in northern Canadian lake sediments and a southern Greenland peat bog did not exhibit good agreement with model predictions of atmospheric deposition since 1990, the Greenland firn GEM record, direct GEM measurements, or trends in global emissions since 1980. Various explanations are proposed to account for these discrepancies between atmosphere and archives, including problems with the accuracy of archive chronologies, climate-driven changes in Hg transfer rates from air to catchments, waters and subsequently into sediments, and post-depositional diagenesis in peat bogs. However, no general consensus in the scientific community has been achieved. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Goodsite, M. E.; Outridge, P.

Proposed methodology uses statistical reducers such as percentile, drought indexes, and map algebra at a geo big data scale. The daily precipitation data from the Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information Using Artificial Neural Networks-Climate Data Record and Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station Data were validated by comparison with ground station data. Extreme event maps were obtained from the use of high percentiles. Drought maps were obtained from the standardized precipitation index using low percentiles. The data were migrated to a geographic information system that allows interrelation with other geographic data. Its application to the study of the fortifications preserved in Andalusia classified all structures according to the level of exposure to these dangers and identified two areas of precipitation with different characteristics according to the influence of existing teleconnection patterns. Applied to the study of heritage landscapes, this methodological model minimizes the uncertainty associated with the use of satellite precipitation products, facilitates the planning of preventive conservation activities, and the management of existing resources in occurrence of extreme events.","[Moreno, M.; Ortiz, P.; Ortiz, R.] Pablo Olavide Univ, Dept Phys Chem & Nat Syst, Carretera Utrera Km 1, ES-41013 Seville, Spain; [Bertolin, C.] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Mech & Ind Engn, Gjovik, Norway",Universidad Pablo de Olavide; Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Moreno, M (corresponding author), Pablo Olavide Univ, Dept Phys Chem & Nat Syst, Carretera Utrera Km 1, ES-41013 Seville, Spain.",mmorfal@upo.es,"Ortiz, Rocio/L-3453-2014; Ortiz, Pilar/ABB-3015-2020","Ortiz, Rocio/0000-0002-0249-8821; Ortiz, Pilar/0000-0002-8547-7531; Moreno-Falcon, Monica/0000-0003-1178-1546","projects: Art-Risk (RETOS project of Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad and Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional (FEDER) [BIA2015-64878-R]; project of Consejeria de Fomento, Infraestructuras y Ordenacion del Territorio, Junta de Andalucia [UPO-03]; FENIX (project of Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion, Programas Estatales de Generacion de Conocimiento y Fortalecimiento Cientifico y Tecnologico del Sistema de I +D +i) [PID2019-107257RB-I00]; Diagnostico y Catalogacion del Patrimonio Arquitectonico Andaluz mediante Analisis de Riesgos y vulnerabilidad (project of Consejeria de fomento, infraestructuras y ordenacion del territorio de la Junta de Andalucia) [UPO.20- 01]; RESILIENT-TOURISM project of Consejeria de Transformacion Economica, Industria, Conocimiento y Universidades.

In this contribution, we present the results of a research that combined the state of the art for Uruguayan coastal archaeology with Holocene paleoenvironmental evolution and modern anthropogenic impact from a basin-wide perspective. Our findings identified a direct relationship between sea level evolution and climate dynamics with the scarcity of human evidences for the Greenlandian and Northgrippian stages in coastal environments, where harsher environmental conditions could have discouraged the exploitation of these landscapes but also erased these earlier evidences after sites abandonment. The prolific archaeological record for the Meghalayan was explained by the establishment of more favorable climatic conditions and relatively stable environments promoting the spread and settlement across coastal landscapes. Despite this fact, modern anthropogenic impact poses a growing threat to this cultural heritage, as market-driven real estate development over capes and dune fields and cropland expansion over grasslands are occupying critical areas. In this scenario, this work identified less impacted areas where exhaustive archaeological surveys coupled with other conservation measures are urgently needed.","[Ferrero, Hugo Inda; del Puerto, Laura] Univ Republ, CURE, Ruta 9 & Ruta 15, Rocha 27000, Uruguay","Universidad de la Republica, Uruguay","Ferrero, HI (corresponding author), Univ Republ, CURE, Ruta 9 & Ruta 15, Rocha 27000, Uruguay.",hinda@cure.edu.uy,,,ANII-SNI; Universidad de la Republica del Uruguay,ANII-SNI; Universidad de la Republica del Uruguay,"ANII-SNI and the PDT from the Universidad de la Republica del Uruguay provided financial support.

While it is clear that current urban water challenges need a more integrated approach, practitioners disagree on what such an integrated approach means exactly. Integration could therefore be described as a wicked problem, with practitioners having different understandings of integration, as well as the opportunities and challenges they should focus on; e.g., climate adaptation, resource recovery or collective replacement. This lack of consensus challenges decision-making, and thus the implementation of integration. To foster urban water systems integration, this study uses Q methodology to explore the different perspectives that Dutch urban water practitioners have on integration for future urban water systems. Our analysis reveals four salient perspectives: perspective 1 sees coordination as a means to make the system future-proof, perspective 2 focuses on climate adaptation, perspective 3 aims for recovery, and perspective 4 is all about efficiency and being in control. While all perspectives acknowledge that traditional urban water practices need to change, they differ on which sustainability challenges are considered most important and what means should be used. Practitioners need to understand these differences to deal effectively with the wicked nature of integration.","[Nieuwenhuis, Eva; Langeveld, Jeroen] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Civil Engn, Delft, Netherlands; [Nieuwenhuis, Eva] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Technol Policy & Management, Delft, Netherlands; [Cuppen, Eefje] Leiden Univ, Fac Governance & Global Affairs, Leiden, Netherlands; [Langeveld, Jeroen] Partners4UrbanWater, Nijmegen, Netherlands",Delft University of Technology; Delft University of Technology; Leiden University; Leiden University - Excl LUMC,"Nieuwenhuis, E (corresponding author), Delft Univ Technol, Fac Civil Engn, Delft, Netherlands.;Nieuwenhuis, E (corresponding author), Delft Univ Technol, Fac Technol Policy & Management, Delft, Netherlands.",e.m.nieuwenhuis@tudelft.nl,,,Dutch Kennisprogramma Urban Drainage (Urban Drainage Knowledge Programme),Dutch Kennisprogramma Urban Drainage (Urban Drainage Knowledge Programme),"This work was supported by the Dutch Kennisprogramma Urban Drainage (Urban Drainage Knowledge Programme).

Modification of the pavement thermal properties is a potential strategy to render pavements cooler with different cooling mechanisms. The thermal behavior of pavements is largely dependent on the different but interactive thermal properties of pavement materials such as thermal conductivity, specific heat capacity, density, albedo, thermal emissivity, and not on one single property alone. The objective of this research study was to investigate the thermophysical properties of different pavement systems through the development of a comprehensive methodology that can quantify contribution of thermal properties on urban climates from laboratory-based measurements. Six different paving mixtures including conventional dense-graded, asphalt-rubber, and cement concrete mixes were prepared encompassing 96 sample data points for the experimental program. With an increase in specific heat capacity, thermal conductivity, thermal diffusivity, and albedo, there was a decrease in the maximum pavement surface temperature of the various mixes. Although the investigation of thermal behavior of pavement materials is complex in nature, this laboratory study has attempted to investigate all major thermophysical properties of different pavement systems in a comprehensive manner. It is envisioned that this research study will help advance the state of the art and knowledge related to pavements' selection and contribution to urban climates, and in recommending a suitable UHI mitigation strategy from the pavements' perspective.","[Sreedhar, Shashwath; Biligiri, Krishna Prapoorna] Indian Inst Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Kharagpur 721302, W Bengal, India; [Sreedhar, Shashwath] Oregon State Univ, Sch Civil & Construct Engn, 101 Kearney Hall, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Kharagpur; Oregon State University,"Biligiri, KP (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Kharagpur 721302, W Bengal, India.",sreedhas@onid.oregonstate.edu; kpb@civil.iitkgp.ernet.in,"Biligiri, Krishna Prapoorna/R-3565-2019",,Government of India Ministry of Human Resource Development Department of Higher Education [4-22/2014-TS.I],Government of India Ministry of Human Resource Development Department of Higher Education,"The authors gratefully acknowledge the Government of India Ministry of Human Resource Development Department of Higher Education for their financial support vide Future of Cities research project grant number F.No.4-22/2014-TS.I, 23 January 2014.",,26,23,24,5,69,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0899-1561,1943-5533,,J MATER CIVIL ENG,J.

We used an efficient screening analysis technique to identify the subset of the most relevant input factors among the whole set of 227 model parameters. A quantitative UA/SA was then applied to this subset to rank the relevance of the parameters and to partition the variance of the model output among them by means of a nonlinear regression of the outcomes of 1,000 Monte Carlo simulations. The concentrations of four representative persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in two representative species of the coastal marine food web of the Lagoon of Venice (Italy) were taken as model outputs. The screening analysis showed that the ranking was remarkably different in relation to the species and chemical being considered. The subsequent Monte Carlo-based quantitative analysis pointed out that the relationships among some of the parameters and the model outputs were nonlinear. The nonlinear regression showed that the fraction of output variance accounted for by each parameter was strongly dependent on the range of the octanol-water partition coefficient (K-OW) values being considered. For the less hydrophobic chemicals, the main sources of model uncertainty were the parameters related to the respiratory bioaccumulation, whereas for the more hydrophobic ones, K-OW and the other parameters related to the dietary uptake explained the largest fractions of the variance of the chemical concentrations in the organisms. The analysis highlighted that efforts are still needed for reducing uncertainty of model parameters to get reliable results from the application of food web bioaccumulation models.","[Ciavatta, Stefano] Consorzio Venezia Ric, EuroMediterranean Ctr Climate Change, I-30175 Venice, Italy; [Ciavatta, Stefano; Pastres, Roberto] Univ Venice, Dept Phys Chem, I-30123 Venice, Italy; [Lovato, Tomas] Univ Venice, Dept Environm Sci, I-30123 Venice, Italy; [Ratto, Marco] Commiss European Communities, Joint Res Ctr, I-21027 Ispra, Italy",Centro Euro-Mediterraneo sui Cambiamenti Climatici (CMCC); Universita Ca Foscari Venezia; Universita Ca Foscari Venezia; European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site,"Ciavatta, S (corresponding author), Consorzio Venezia Ric, EuroMediterranean Ctr Climate Change, Via Liberta 12, I-30175 Venice, Italy.",ciavatta@unive.it,"Ciavatta, Stefano/AAL-1381-2020","Ciavatta, Stefano/0000-0001-7165-2805; PASTRES, Roberto/0000-0002-7572-3858; Ratto, Marco/0000-0003-4390-0175; LOVATO, Tomas/0000-0002-5188-6767",Euro-Mediterranean Centre for Climate Change (CMCC); Ministero delle Infrastrutture-Magistrato alle Acque di Venezia,Euro-Mediterranean Centre for Climate Change (CMCC); Ministero delle Infrastrutture-Magistrato alle Acque di Venezia,The authors thank Euro-Mediterranean Centre for Climate Change (CMCC) for partially funding the present study and Ministero delle Infrastrutture-Magistrato alle Acque di Venezia for making data and technical reports available.,,38,18,18,1,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0730-7268,1552-8618,,ENVIRON TOXICOL CHEM,Environ.

On the one hand, it is essential to provide a healthy indoor climate for museum staff and visitors; on the other hand, cultural assets have to be protected against deterioration. Building materials, preservatives and other products are possible sources of a number of hazardous compounds. In many cases, conservators handle cultural artifacts where the type of preservation is unknown. Therefore, systematic measurements of indoor pollutants in storage rooms of the Lower Saxony State Museum Hanover have been accomplished. Concentrations of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), formaldehyde and organic acids in the ambient air were determined by active sampling and chemical analysis. Semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) and selected elements were examined by sampling and analyzing settled dust. The climatic conditions (temperature and relative humidity) were recorded as well. Most of the VOCs detected in the ambient air are associated with packaging and building products used for furnishing magazines and building exhibition cases. Furthermore, they are associated with products used for preservation and restoration. Wooden shelves and drawers were identified as sources of terpenes and other VOCs. Compounds such as lindane and 1,4-dichlorobenzene are still used as preservatives against insects and fungi. In settled dust, increased concentrations of lead, arsenic and chlorine were found. This result also indicates the application of certain preservatives. The spectrum of detected air pollutants reflects the different application of chemicals and building products in the individual departments. The results have been evaluated with regard to possible adverse effects both on human health and on works of art. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

An analysis and discussion are also carried out over the general trajectory followed in recent years by the community working in this field, thereby highlighting the need for reaching a consensus and joining forces towards achieving valuable insights into the understanding of this family of optimization techniques.","[Del Ser, Javier] Univ Basque Country UPV EHU, Alameda Urquijo S-N, Bilbao 48013, Bizkaia, Spain; [Del Ser, Javier; Osaba, Eneko] TECNALIA, Derio 48160, Spain; [Del Ser, Javier] BCAM, Bilbao 48009, Spain; [Molina, Daniel; Herrera, Francisco] Univ Granada, DaSCI Andalusian Inst Data Sci & Computat Intelli, E-18071 Granada, Spain; [Yang, Xin-She] Middlesex Univ London, London NW4 4BT, England; [Salcedo-Sanz, Sancho] Univ Alcala, Alcala De Henares 28871, Spain; [Camacho, David] Univ Autonoma Madrid, E-28049 Madrid, Spain; [Das, Swagatam] Indian Stat Inst, Elect & Commun Sci Unit, Kolkata 700108, India; [Coello Coello, Carlos A.] IPN, CINVESTAV, Mexico City 07360, DF, Mexico; [Suganthan, Ponnuthurai N.] Nanyang Technol Univ, Singapore 639798, Singapore",University of Basque Country; Basque Center for Applied Mathematics (BCAM); University of Granada; Middlesex University; Universidad de Alcala; Autonomous University of Madrid; Indian Statistical Institute; Indian Statistical Institute Kolkata; CINVESTAV - Centro de Investigacion y de Estudios Avanzados del Instituto Politecnico Nacional; Instituto Politecnico Nacional - Mexico; Nanyang Technological University & National Institute of Education (NIE) Singapore; Nanyang Technological University,"Del Ser, J (corresponding author), Univ Basque Country UPV EHU, Alameda Urquijo S-N, Bilbao 48013, Bizkaia, Spain.",javier.delser@tecnalia.com,"Yang, Xin-She/I-5662-2019; Suganthan, Ponnuthurai Nagaratnam/A-5023-2011; Camacho, David/AAV-3665-2020; Osaba, Eneko/K-2171-2014; Cabrera, Daniel Molina/X-4025-2019; Yang, Xin-She/A-5769-2012; Das, Swagatam/AAG-6753-2019; yang, xin/HGU-9981-2022; Del Ser, Javier/AAA-2965-2021; Camacho, David/B-5779-2014; Coello Coello, Carlos/B-1845-2008","Yang, Xin-She/0000-0001-8231-5556; Suganthan, Ponnuthurai Nagaratnam/0000-0003-0901-5105; Osaba, Eneko/0000-0001-7863-9910; Cabrera, Daniel Molina/0000-0002-4175-2204; Yang, Xin-She/0000-0001-8231-5556; Das, Swagatam/0000-0001-6843-4508; Del Ser, Javier/0000-0002-1260-9775; Camacho, David/0000-0002-5051-3475; Coello Coello, Carlos/0000-0002-8435-680X","Basque Government; Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad (MINECO) of Spain [TIN2017-85887-C2-2-P, TIN2017-85727-C4-3-P]; Spanish Ministry of Science [TIN2016-8113-R, TIN2017-89517-P]; CONACYT [2016-01-1920]","Basque Government(Basque Government); Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad (MINECO) of Spain(Spanish Government); Spanish Ministry of Science(Ministry of Science and Innovation, Spain (MICINN)Spanish Government); CONACYT(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT))","Javier Del Ser and Eneko Osaba would like to thank the Basque Government for funding support received through the EMAITEK and ELKARTEK funding programs.

They have been coordinated through two organizations/programs: the Baltic Sea Operational Oceanographic System (BOOS) and the Baltic Sea Experiment (BALTEX) and its successor, the Baltic Earth Program (Earth system science for the Baltic Sea region), respectively. Although the two communities have archived significant progresses in their own fields since early 1990s, there were few interactions between the communities. Rapid advancements of operational oceanography on ocean monitoring, data sharing, modeling, and historical ocean state reconstruction in the last decade have provided a wide range of data, products and modeling tools which may be used in Earth system and climate change research. This is especially true when operational oceanography in the Baltic Sea is in a transition to a seamless service, i.e., from basin to local scales, from synoptic to climate scales and from physical to biogeochemical and biological systems. On the other hand, the Baltic Sea Earth system research can help to improve operational oceanography by contributing research observations and transferring their research achievements to the operational system. Based on a review of state-of-the-art of BOOS monitoring and modeling capabilities and on-going BOOS research, this paper will highlight topics and areas which are related to the Baltic Earth Grand Challenges, i.e., salinity dynamics, land-sea biogeochemical linkages, natural hazards and extreme events, sea level dynamics, coastal morphology and erosion, regional variability of water and energy exchanges, and multi-drivers of regional Earth system changes. Potential win-win cooperation and interaction between the BOOS and the Baltic Earth communities are also proposed and discussed.","[She, Jun; Huess, Vibeke] Danish Meteorol Inst, Dept Res & Dev, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Meier, H.

This study demonstrates that LDAS-Monde is able to detect, monitor and forecast the impact of extreme weather on land surface states. Firstly, LDAS-Monde is run globally at 0.25 degrees spatial resolution over 2010-2018. It is forced by the state-of-the-art ERAS reanalysis (LDAS_ERA5) from the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). The behaviour of the assimilation system is evaluated by comparing the analysis with the assimilated observations. Then the land surface variables (LSVs) are validated with independent satellite datasets of evapotranspiration, gross primary production, sun-induced fluorescence and snow cover. Furthermore, in situ measurements of SSM, evapotranspiration and river discharge are employed for the validation. Secondly, the global analysis is used to (i) detect regions exposed to extreme weather such as droughts and heatwave events and (ii) address specific monitoring and forecasting requirements of LSVs for those regions. This is performed by computing anomalies of the land surface states. They display strong negative values for LAI and SSM in 2018 for two regions: north-western Europe and the Murray-Darling basin in south-eastern Australia. For those regions, LDAS-Monde is forced with the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) high-resolution operational analysis (LDAS_HRES, 0.10 degrees spatial resolution) over 2017-2018. Monitoring capacities are studied by comparing openloop and analysis experiments, again against the assimilated observations. Forecasting abilities are assessed by initializing 4 and 8 d LDAS_HRES forecasts of the LSVs with the LDAS_HRES assimilation run compared to the open-loop experiment. The positive impact of initialization from an analysis in forecast mode is particularly visible for LAI that evolves at a slower pace than SSM and is more sensitive to initial conditions than to atmospheric forcing, even at an 8 d lead time. This highlights the impact of initial conditions on LSV forecasts and the value of jointly analysing soil moisture and vegetation states.","[Albergel, Clement; Zheng, Yongjun; Bonan, Bertrand; Munier, Simon; Meurey, Catherine; Calvet, Jean-Christophe] Univ Toulouse, CNRS, Meteo France, CNRM, Toulouse, France; [Dutra, Emanuel] Univ Lisbon, Fac Sci, IDL, Inst Dom Luiz, Lisbon, Portugal; [Rodriguez-Fernandez, Nemesio] Univ Toulouse, CNES, CNRS, CESBIO,IRD, Toulouse, France; [Draper, Clara] CIRES NOAA Earth Syst Res Labs, Boulder, CO USA; [de Rosnay, Patricia; Munoz-Sabater, Joaquin; Balsamo, Gianpaolo; Fairbairn, David] European Ctr Medium Range Weather Forecasts, Shinfield Rd, Reading RG2 9AX, Berks, England; [Albergel, Clement] European Space Agcy Climate Off, ECSAT, Harwell Campus, Didcot OX11 0FD, Oxon, England",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Meteo France; Universite de Toulouse; Universidade de Lisboa; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF),"Albergel, C (corresponding author), Univ Toulouse, CNRS, Meteo France, CNRM, Toulouse, France.;Albergel, C (corresponding author), European Space Agcy Climate Off, ECSAT, Harwell Campus, Didcot OX11 0FD, Oxon, England.",clement.albergel@meteo.fr,"Calvet, Jean-Christophe/A-8762-2012; Rodriguez-Fernandez, Nemesio/N-7710-2015; Dutra, Emanuel/A-3774-2010; Balsamo, Gianpaolo/I-3362-2013; de Rosnay, Patricia/M-8203-2013; Munier, Simon/D-3849-2011","Calvet, Jean-Christophe/0000-0001-6425-6492; Rodriguez-Fernandez, Nemesio/0000-0003-3796-149X; Dutra, Emanuel/0000-0002-0643-2643; Balsamo, Gianpaolo/0000-0002-1745-3634; Albergel, Clement/0000-0003-1095-2702; Munoz-Sabater, Joaquin/0000-0002-5997-290X; Bonan, Bertrand/0000-0002-8808-2201; de Rosnay, Patricia/0000-0002-7374-3820; Munier, Simon/0000-0001-7176-8584","RT Antoine de Saint-Exupery Foundation (POMME-V project) [CDT-R056-L00-T00]; Climate Change Initiative Programme Extension, Phase 1 - Climate Modeling User Group ESA [4000125156/18/I-NB]","RT Antoine de Saint-Exupery Foundation (POMME-V project); Climate Change Initiative Programme Extension, Phase 1 - Climate Modeling User Group ESA","This research has been supported by the RT Antoine de Saint-Exupery Foundation (POMME-V project, grant no.

This potential collateral damage has prompted calls for a just transition to a green economy. While the term, just transition, is increasingly prevalent in the public discourse, it remains under-discussed and poorly defined in legal literature, preventing it from helping catalyze fair decarbonization. This Article seeks to define the term, test its validity, and articulate its relationship with law so the idea can meet its potential. The Article is the first to disambiguate and assess two main rhetorical usages of just transition. I argue that legal scholars should recognize it as a term of art that evolved in the labor movement, first known as a superfund for workers. In the climate change context, I therefore define a just transition as the principle of easing the burden decarbonization poses to those who depend on high-carbon industries. This definition provides clarity and can help law engage with fields that already recognize just transitions as a labor concept. I argue further that the labor-driven just transition concept is both justified and essential in light of today's deep political polarization and jobs-versus-environment tensions. First, it can incorporate much-needed economic equity considerations into environmental decisionmaking. Second, it can inform a modernized alternative to the environmental law apparatus, which must evolve to transcend disciplines. Third, it offers an avenue for climate reform through coalition-building between labor and environmental interests. I offer guidance for effectuating the principle by synthesizing instances of its embodiment in law in the Trade Act of 1974 (assisting manufacturing communities), the President's Northwest Forest Plan (assisting timber communities), the Tobacco Transition Payment Program (assisting tobacco farmers), and the POWER Initiative (assisting coal communities), among other examples.","[Eisenberg, Ann M.] Univ South Carolina, Sch Law, Law, Columbia, SC 29208 USA",University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia,"Eisenberg, AM (corresponding author), Univ South Carolina, Sch Law, Law, Columbia, SC 29208 USA.",,,,,,,,251,11,11,4,21,UNIV SOUTHERN CALIF,LOS ANGELES,"LAW CENTER UNIV PARK, LOS ANGELES, CA 90089-0071 USA",0038-3910,,,SOUTH CALIF LAW REV,South.

J,"Lovins, AB",,,,"Lovins, Amory B.",,,How big is the energy efficiency resource?,ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS,,,English,Editorial Material,,,,,,increasing returns,DEMAND-SIDE SOLUTIONS; COST-EFFECTIVENESS; CLIMATE; TECHNOLOGY; IMPACTS; ART; US,"Most economic theorists assume that energy efficiency-the biggest global provider of energy services-is a limited and dwindling resource whose price- and policy-driven adoption will inevitably deplete its potential and raise its cost. Influenced by that theoretical construct, most traditional analysts and deployers of energy efficiency see and exploit only a modest fraction of the worthwhile efficiency resource, saving less and paying more than they should. Yet empirically, modern energy efficiency is, and shows every sign of durably remaining, an expanding-quantity, declining-cost resource. Its adoption is constrained by major but correctable market failures and increasingly motivated by positive externalities. Most importantly, in both newbuild and retrofit applications, its quantity is severalfold larger and its cost lower than most in the energy and climate communities realize. The efficiency resource far exceeds the sum of savings by individual technologies because artfully choosing, combining, sequencing, and timing fewer and simpler technologies can save more energy at lower cost than deploying more and fancier but dis-integrated and randomly timed technologies. Such 'integrative design' is not yet widely known or applied, and can seem difficult because it is simple, but is well proven, rapidly evolving, and gradually spreading. Yet the same economic models that could not predict the renewable energy revolution also ignore integrative design and hence cannot recognize most of the efficiency resource or reserves. This analytic gap makes climate-changemitigation look harder and costlier than it really is, diverting attention and investment to inferior options. With energy efficiency as its cornerstone and needing its pace redoubled, climate protection depends critically on seeing and deploying the entire efficiency resource. This requires focusing less on individual technologies than on whole systems (buildings, factories, vehicles, and the larger systems embedding them), and replacing theoretical assumptions about efficiency's diminishing returns with practitioners' empirical evidence of expanding returns.","[Lovins, Amory B.] Rocky Mt Inst, 22830 Two Rivers Rd, Basalt, CO 81621 USA",,"Lovins, AB (corresponding author), Rocky Mt Inst, 22830 Two Rivers Rd, Basalt, CO 81621 USA.",ablovins@rmi.org,,,,,,,151,22,22,4,14,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1748-9326,,,ENVIRON RES LETT,Environ.

The urban heat island (UHI) effect has exacerbated urban heat waves with serious consequences for urban energy and residents' health. Therefore, a better understanding of the dynamics of the UHI effect and the influencing factors is needed in the context of carbon neutrality and global warming. This study used long-term observation and statistical data to investigate the urban heat island intensity (UHII) over the past 39 years (1981-2019) and to analyze the temporal changes of the UHI effect and the relationship between the UHI effect and indicators of rapid urbanization in Zhengzhou, China. The results showed that Zhengzhou is warming 2.2-times faster than the global land warming trend of about +0.9 degrees C from 1981 to 2019. There is a clear phase characteristic of the heat island effect in Zhengzhou, and it offers a rapid upward trend after 2000 and a positive correlation with the urbanization process; it was found that the social and economic conditions of urban expansion in Zhengzhou have a significant relationship with UHII. We also found that the denser the urban built-up area, the more obvious the heat island effect. Compared with other countries, the influence of national policies on urban development is an indirect factor influencing the change of UHI specifically for Chinese cities. This research could provide a reference for understanding the temporal dynamics of UHI in an expanding large city for sustainable urban planning and mitigating urban warming and environmental problems.","[Li, Huawei; Tian, Guohang] Henan Agr Univ, Coll Landscape Architecture & Art, Zhengzhou 450002, Peoples R China; [Jombach, Sandor] Hungarian Univ Agr & Life Sci, Inst Landscape Architecture Urban Planning & Gard, Dept Landscape Planning & Reg Dev, H-1118 Budapest, Hungary; [Li, Yuanzheng] Henan Univ Econ & Law, Sch Resources & Environm, Zhengzhou 450046, Peoples R China; [Meng, Handong] Henan Prov Climate Ctr, Zhengzhou 450003, Peoples R China; [Meng, Handong] CMA Henan Key Lab Agrometeorol Support & Appl Tec, Zhengzhou 450003, Peoples R China",Henan Agricultural University; Hungarian University of Agriculture & Life Sciences; Henan University of Economics & Law,"Meng, HD (corresponding author), Henan Prov Climate Ctr, Zhengzhou 450003, Peoples R China.;Meng, HD (corresponding author), CMA Henan Key Lab Agrometeorol Support & Appl Tec, Zhengzhou 450003, Peoples R China.",menghd752@126.com,"郭, 青霞/GZH-2618-2022","Li, Huawei/0000-0001-7771-2194",Henan Province Young Talent Support Project [2019HYTP033]; Meteorological disaster risk assessment and microclimate simulation; Henan Overseas Expertise Introduction Center for Discipline Innovation,Henan Province Young Talent Support Project; Meteorological disaster risk assessment and microclimate simulation; Henan Overseas Expertise Introduction Center for Discipline Innovation,"This research was funded by Henan Province Young Talent Support Project (2019HYTP033), Meteorological disaster risk assessment and microclimate simulation and Henan Overseas Expertise Introduction Center for Discipline Innovation.",,76,0,0,2,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-445X,,LAND-BASEL,Land,OCT,2022,10,,,,,,1838,10.3390/land11101838,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land11101838,,,18,Environmental Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,5P5HB,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000873180600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Buildings, mobility, and energy systems are closely linked, and assessing their nexus by aiming for Zero Emission Neighborhoods (ZENs) provides a unique chance to contribute to climate change mitigation. We conducted a life-cycle assessment of a Norwegian ZEN and designed four scenarios to test the influence of the house size, household size, and energy used and produced in the buildings as well as mobility patterns. We ran our scenarios with different levels of decarbonization of the electricity mix over a period of 60 years. Our results show the importance of the operational phases of both the buildings and mobility in the neighborhood's construction, and its decline over time induced by the decarbonization of the electricity mix. At the neighborhood end-of-life, embodied emissions then become responsible for the majority of the emissions when the electricity mix is decarbonized. The choice of functional unit is decisive, and we thus argue for the use of a primary functional unit per neighborhood, and a second per person. The use of a per m(2) functional unit is misleading as it does not give credits to the precautionary use of floor area. To best mitigate climate change, climate-positive behaviors should be combined with energy efficiency standards that incorporate embodied energy, and absolute threshold should be combined with behavioral changes.","[Lausselet, Carine; Ellingsen, Linda Ager-Wick; Stromman, Anders Hammer; Brattebo, Helge] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, NTNU, Ind Ecol Program, Trondheim, Norway",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Lausselet, C (corresponding author), NTNU, Program Ind Okol, Hogskoleringen 5, NO-7034 Trondheim, Norway.",carine.lausselet@ntnu.no,"Lausselet, Carine/AAD-3048-2021; Stromman, Anders/AAE-9611-2019; Ellingsen, Linda Ager-Wick/AAW-8363-2021; Ellingsen, Linda Ager-Wick/B-7057-2014","Stromman, Anders/0000-0003-2987-5583; Ellingsen, Linda Ager-Wick/0000-0003-1639-3163; Lausselet, Carine/0000-0001-6908-2284",Research Council of Norway; Research Centre on Zero Emission Neighborhoods in Smart Cities (FME ZEN),Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway); Research Centre on Zero Emission Neighborhoods in Smart Cities (FME ZEN),The authors gratefully acknowledge the support from the Research Council of Norway and several partners through the Research Centre on Zero Emission Neighborhoods in Smart Cities (FME ZEN).,,89,16,16,9,46,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1088-1980,1530-9290,,J IND ECOL,J.

There is, however inadequate information on these resources for the purposes of planning, decision-making and management. This paper explores the potential for using a state of the art hydrological model (WRF-Hydro) in a fully coupled (i.e. land surface hydrology-atmosphere) mode to assess these water resources, particularly the Tono basin in Ghana. The WRFHydro model is an enhanced version of the Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF) which allows simulating river discharge. A 2-domain configuration is chosen: an outer domain at 25 km horizontal resolution encompassing the West African Region and an inner domain at 5 km horizontal resolution centered on the Tono basin. The infiltration partition parameter and Manning's roughness parameter were calibrated to fit the WRF-Hydro simulated discharge with the observed data. The simulations were done from 1999 to 2003, using 1999 as a spin-up period. The results were compared with TRMM precipitation, CRU temperature and available observed hydrological data. The WRF-Hydro model captured the attributes of the observed streamflow estimate; with Nash-Sutcliff efficiency (NSE) of 0.78 and Pearson's correlation of 0.89. Further validation of model results is based on using the output from the WRF-Hydro model as input into a water balance model to simulate the dam levels. WRF-Hydro has shown the potential for use in water resource planning (i.e. with respect to streamflow and dam level estimation). However, the model requires further improvement with respect to calibration of model parameters (e.g. baseflow and saturated hydraulic conductivity) considering the effect of the accumulation of model bias in dam level estimation.","[Naabil, E.; Olufayo, A.] FUTA, WACS, Akure, Ondo State, Nigeria; [Naabil, E.] Bolgatanga Polytech, Dept Agr Engn, Bolgatanga, Ghana; [Lamptey, B.

Near Alcoota station in central Australia is a late Miocene fossil mammal site for Alcoota (10 Ma) and Ongeva (8 Ma) local faunas. The Alcoota fauna includes the largest known land bird (Dromornis stirtoni) and early diprotodontid (Kolopsis torus), but the geologically younger Ongeva fauna has a larger diprotodontid (Zygomaturus gilli). These faunas are evolutionary predecessors of Australian Pleistocene megafauna. Calcareous paleosols recorded a marked turn toward aridity compared with underlying thick lateritic duricrusts which lack fossils. Laterites of likely middle Miocene age are evidence of wet (> 1100 mm mean annual precipitation) tropical (> 17 degrees C mean annual temperature) paleoclimates, but these were deeply eroded and redeposited by the time of the late Miocene mammals. A succession of 19 paleosols of 5 pedotypes were recognized in the 19 m thick section, with shallow calcareous nodule (Bk) horizons as evidence of mean annual precipitation ranges from 100 to 400 mm, and mean annual range of precipitation of 50 mm, very similar to the modern climate of Alcoota (296 mm precipitation with 56 mm difference between wet and dry month). This was neither a rainforest nor monsoonal paleoclimate, and vegetation inferred from paleosols was open woodland and gallery woodland similar to that of today. Central Australia was not covered by monsoon rainforest during the late Miocene and its paleoclimatic history of Neogene desertification matches well that of other parts of the world.","[Mao, Xuegang] Fujian Normal Univ, Inst Geog, Fuzhou 350007, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Mao, Xuegang; Retallack, Gregory] Univ Oregon, Dept Earth Sci, Eugene, OR 97403 USA",Fujian Normal University; University of Oregon,"Retallack, G (corresponding author), Univ Oregon, Dept Earth Sci, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.",gregr@uoregon.edu,,"Retallack, Gregory/0000-0003-4356-9240; Mao, Xuegang/0000-0001-5855-5576","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41602184, 41772180]; Scientific grants of Fujian province [2015R1034-5, 2017J01655, U1405281]; Fujian Normal University [IRTL1705]; Education department of Fujian Province",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Scientific grants of Fujian province; Fujian Normal University; Education department of Fujian Province,"This work is financially supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41602184, 41772180), Scientific grants of Fujian province (Grant No. 2015R1034-5, 2017J01655, U1405281), creative group grant from Fujian Normal University (IRTL1705), and scholarship from Education department of Fujian Province.

In a dynamical model, precipitation is resulted from the formation of clouds. The cloud formation and its processes occur at a micro scale. Current state-of-the-art dynamical models lack proper representation of the cloud processes, particularly at high resolutions for which the cloud processes are parameterized, thereby poorly resolving the precipitation. This study aims at examining the impact of the cloud parameters on the simulation of Indian summer monsoon precipitation in Regional Climate Model version 4 (RegCM4). The autoconversion coefficient which determines the conversion of cloud water into precipitation in the Explicit Moisture Convergence scheme is adjusted in the RegCM4. The impact of autoconversion is experimented with ten different values and it is found that it has a significant effect on the simulation of precipitation during summer monsoon season. The experiments are conducted by changing autoconversion from 1.5x10(-4) to 7.5x10(-4)/s along with the default value of 2.5x10(-4)/s. On changing the autoconversion values from 60 to 300% of the default value, the precipitation pattern improves over most parts of India. The model simulates the rainfall better when the autoconversion coefficient is changed to 7.5x10(-4)/s. With the best outcome with the adjusted autoconversion and control configuration, the model is simulated for seventeen monsoon seasons and the analyses of RegCM4 simulated vertically integrated moisture transport, convective available potential energy and atmospheric moisture budget suggest that the model efficacy is enhanced in higher autoconversion value than the control one. Statistical evaluations using bias, correlation coefficients, comprehensive rating matrices and skill score confirm the suitability of higher autoconversion rate for summer monsoon simulations. The model with adjusted autoconversion coefficient (at 7.5x10(-4)/s) has improved the representation of seasonal precipitation distribution and its year-to-year variation including other derived features. The rainfall pattern is improved over North West India and North East India especially, the monsoon core regions. The mean seasonal rainfall is in phase 94% of the time with the modeler-adjusted moisture as compared to 82% in the control in the long term simulation.","[Mohanty, M. R.; Sinha, P.; Maurya, R. K.

Material properties evolve at even moderate temperatures after a long period of storage, according to previous studies on undoped SAC alloys. To reduce the aging effects, a number of alloy formulations have been proposed. Data on the mechanical properties of lead free solder alloys used for interconnection in electronic packaging at high strain rates and high storage temperatures is very important for design optimization of electronic package sustainability at extreme temperatures, since SAC soldiers have shown degradation of mechanical properties after prolonged exposure to storage temperature. The use of dopants in SAC solder has been proposed as a solution to minimize degradation. In this study, After keeping the samples in storage at 50 degrees C for 1-8 months, a doped SAC solder called SAC-R (Ecolloy) was subjected to high strain rate testing. Uniaxial impact hammer tensile tests were conducted on samples with no aging and samples that had been aged for up to 8 months to assess the mechanical properties of SAC-R at high and low operating temperatures ranging from -65 degrees C to 200 degrees C and the Mechanical properties has been compared with an undoped solder SAC 105. The constants for the Anand Visco-Plasticity model were calculated using the material data for SAC-R.

The present work made a patent analysis of advanced hydrogen production techniques comparing it with similar prior art in China, Japan, the Republic of Korea, the European Union and the United States (U.S.) The aims were to find the scope, competitiveness of prior art, as well as the technology trend on biohydrogen production methods. The patents value was assessed its geographic scope and competitiveness indicators such as green image, low cost, energy efficiency and equipment design. It was found that most of the hydrogen production methods and associated technologies are developed by academic institutions, however their patents are reduced to a local level, and few are patented at international level, which reduces their competitiveness. The China (P.R.C.) is the biggest patent contributor worldwide in terms of hydrogen production methods by academic institutions. Japan is a huge patent contributor, in terms of methods aiming rear-end products application of hydrogen by private companies. The biggest amount of prior art found that the most popular methods of pretreatment and dark fermentation produced coincide with the time of energetic crisis and the green movement to find alternative fuels. Finally, patent analysis of this study can help to discern the current technology trend and to develop the next generation of biohydrogen processes and associated technologies.

J,"Ruf, F",,,,"Ruf, Francois",,,"Covid-19, Living income differential and decline in income of cocoa producers in Cote d'Ivoire",CAHIERS AGRICULTURES,,,French,Article,,,,,,Covid-19; inflation; cooperatives; climate change; gold mining,,"Cocoa farmers in Cote d'Ivoire are mostly below the poverty line. In September 2019, the Ivorian and Ghanaian governments imposed the Living Income Differential (LID) on private companies, an additional $ 400 per ton compared to the international market price, passed on to the producer price (farm gate price). At the beginning of 2020, the Covid-19 arose. In this dual context, how did prices change? Has the hope of increased income been achieved? Three approaches are used: a) monitoring of the selling price of cocoa beans and monitoring of the price of purchased cocoa farming inputs and basic necessities for households; b) monthly monitoring of farm gate cocoa price in 2020-2021; c) an analysis of national production data from Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana, the world price, variations in the demand for beans by the grinding industry, and the price paid to producers, over 20 years. The first result is a very temporary and limited rise in the farm gate price of cocoa at the end of 2020, then its fall in 2021 as the price of inputs and basic necessities soar. The 2021-2022 campaign is even more harmful with a tightening of the price scissor. It is therefore the failure of the LID, but the role of Covid-19 in this failure is very nuanced with regard to the declarations of the State and the multinationals. The drop in prices and the loss of income for cocoa farmers in 2020-2022 rather fits into the economic theory of games. Without control of their supply, an agreement between two companies or countries cannot work. The failure is part of a largely endogenous structural change: demographic growth, policies to encourage migration and deforestation, opacity of the sector and finally continued growth of the supply of cocoa from Cote d'Ivoire on the international market.","[Ruf, Francois] CIRAD, UMR ART DEV, Abidjan, Cote Ivoire; [Ruf, Francois] Univ Montpellier, ART DEV, Montpellier, France",CIRAD; Universite de Montpellier,"Ruf, F (corresponding author), CIRAD, UMR ART DEV, Abidjan, Cote Ivoire.;Ruf, F (corresponding author), Univ Montpellier, ART DEV, Montpellier, France.",francois.ruf@cirad.fr,,,,,,,29,0,0,3,3,EDP SCIENCES S A,LES ULIS CEDEX A,"17, AVE DU HOGGAR, PA COURTABOEUF, BP 112, F-91944 LES ULIS CEDEX A, FRANCE",1166-7699,1777-5949,,CAH AGRIC,Cah.

Traditionally, biogeographic inference has relied on distinct lines of evidence, including DNA sequences, fossils and hindcasted ecological niche models. In this review we propose that the development of integrative modeling approaches that leverage multiple distinct data types from diverse disciplines has the potential to revolutionize the field of biogeography. Although each data type contains information on a distinct aspect of species' biogeographic histories, few studies formally integrate multiple types in analysis. For example, post hoc congruence among analyses based on different data types (e.g. fossils and genetics) is commonly assumed to indicate likely biogeographic histories. Unfortunately, analyses of different data often reach discordant conclusions. Thus, fundamental and unresolved debates continue regarding speed and timing of postglacial migration, location and size of glacial refugia, and degree of long distance dispersal. Formal statistical integration can help address these issues. More specifically, formal integration can leverage all available evidence, account for inherent biases associated with different data types, and quantify data and process uncertainty. Novel, quantitative integration of data and models across fields is now possible due to recent advances in cyberinfrastructure, spatial modeling, online and aggregated ecological databases, data processing and quantitative methods. Our purpose is to make the case for and give examples of rigorous integration of genetic, fossil and environmental/occurrence data for inferring biogeographic history. In particular, we 1) review the need for such a framework; 2) explain common data types and approaches used to infer biogeographic history (and the challenges with each); 3) review state-of-the-art examples of data integration in biogeography; 4) lay out a series of novel, suggested improvements on current methods; and 5) provide an outlook on technical feasibility and future opportunities.","[Hoban, Sean] Morton Arboretum, Ctr Tree Sci, Lisle, IL 60532 USA; [Dawson, Andria] Mt Royal Univ, Dept Gen Educ, Calgary, AB, Canada; [Robinson, John D.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Smith, Adam B.] Missouri Bot Garden, Ctr Conservat & Sustainable Dev, St Louis, MO USA; [Strand, Allan E.] Coll Charleston, Dept Biol, Grice Marine Lab, Charleston, SC 29424 USA",Mount Royal University; Michigan State University; Missouri Botanical Gardens; College of Charleston,"Hoban, S (corresponding author), Morton Arboretum, Ctr Tree Sci, Lisle, IL 60532 USA.",shoban@mortonarb.org,"Smith, Adam B./H-6906-2019","Robinson, John/0000-0002-9782-1598",,,,,186,12,12,1,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0906-7590,1600-0587,,ECOGRAPHY,Ecography,DEC,2019,12,,SI,,1991,2011,,10.1111/ecog.04327,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ecog.04327,,,21,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,JU0HZ,,Bronze,,,12/21/22,WOS:000501362200002,View Full Record in Web of Science

State of the art machine learning methods for spatial data which involve a reduction of spatial overfitting, handling of extrapolation situations and a spatially explicit error assessment, however, are currently mostly implemented in local computation frameworks. Here we present a workflow that combines the improved processing capabilities of the cloud computation platform openEO with state-of-the-art machine learning model development in R. OpenEO is used for standardized imagery acquisition and preprocessing to provide predictors for model training. To reduce overfitting, predictors which are meaningful for the mapping are identified via spatial variable selection as implemented in R packages. The mapping accuracy is assessed via spatial cross-validation and predictions are limited to the 'Area of Applicability' of the model. The workflow is designed to enhance and assess the spatial transferability of machine learning models which is demonstrated by a case study of a landcover classification based on Sentinel-2 imagery.","[Ludwig, Marvin; Bahlmann, Jonathan; Meyer, Hanna] Univ Munster, Inst Landscape Ecol, Munster, Germany; [Ludwig, Marvin; Bahlmann, Jonathan; Pebesma, Edzer] Univ Munster, Inst Geoinformat, Munster, Germany",University of Munster; University of Munster,"Ludwig, M (corresponding author), Univ Munster, Inst Landscape Ecol, Munster, Germany.;Ludwig, M (corresponding author), Univ Munster, Inst Geoinformat, Munster, Germany.",marvin.ludwig@uni-muenster.de; jbahlmann@uni-muenster.de; edzer.pebesma@uni-muenster.de; hanna.meyer@uni-muenster.de,"Meyer, Hanna/HDO-5170-2022","Meyer, Hanna/0000-0003-0556-0210; Pebesma, Edzer/0000-0001-8049-7069; Ludwig, Marvin/0000-0002-3010-018X",Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action of Germany [50EE2009],Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action of Germany,The work was supported by the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action of Germany (project number 50EE2009).

This is particularly important when their preservation and planned maintenance is the primary aim. Today museums, and particularly historical buildings converted to museums, should be considered as places where precious artefacts should have first-rate protection and conservation. It is a question of solving the compromise between protection, conservation and comfort for works of art and/or visitors, with the consequence that preservation and planned maintenance criteria must prevail over use requirements. Refurbishment and conservation of a building, and requirements for visitor presence and works of art need different thermo-physical indoor parameter values. The present paper concerns the thermal and air velocity analysis of the Salone dei Duecento (the Hall of the Two Hundred of the Palazzo Vecchio (Old Palace)) in Florence. In this paper an appropriate transient 3D model by Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software based on the finite element method (FEM) was used. Variations and interaction between indoor and outdoor microclimatic conditions, and thermo-physical behaviour of the building connected to lighting, visitor presence and cooling-heating fan coils system were considered. The 3D modelling method provided by the present paper can be applied to several situations where there is interaction between outdoor and indoor climate variations and the building structure. It can be very useful for defining measures to preserve tapestries, understanding deterioration processes, and developing new conservation techniques and strategies for care and exhibition.

The temporal and spatial scales that give rise to the present-day residual mean circulation are here investigated by calculating the Meridional Overturning Circulation (MOC) in density coordinates from an eddy-permitting global model. The region sensitive to the temporal decomposition is located between 38 degrees S and 63 degrees S, associated with the eddy-induced transport. The Bolus'' component of the residual circulation corresponds to the eddy-induced transport. It is dominated by timescales between 1 month and 1 year. The temporal behavior of the transient eddies is examined in splitting the Bolus'' component into a Seasonal'', an Eddy'' and an Inter-monthly'' component, respectively representing the correlation between density and velocity fluctuations due to the average seasonal cycle, due to mesoscale eddies and due to large-scale motion on timescales longer than one month that is not due to the seasonal cycle. The Seasonal'' bolus cell is important at all latitudes near the surface. The Eddy'' bolus cell is dominant in the thermocline between 50 degrees S and 35 degrees S and over the whole ocean depth at the latitude of the Drake Passage. The Inter-monthly'' bolus cell is important in all density classes and is maximal in the Brazil-Malvinas Confluence and the Agulhas Return Current. The spatial decomposition indicates that a large part of the Eulerian mean circulation is recovered for spatial scales larger than 11.25 degrees, implying that small-scale meanders in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), near the Subantarctic and Polar Fronts, and near the Subtropical Front are important in the compensation of the Eulerian mean flow.

We introduce an approximate method for the activity coefficient calculation that directly relates aerosol activity coefficients to the ambient relative humidity, assuming chemical equilibrium. We demonstrate that this method provides an alternative for the computationally expensive iterative activity coefficient calculation methods presently used in thermodynamic gas/aerosol models. The gain of our method is that the entire system of the gas/aerosol equilibrium partitioning can be solved noniteratively, a substantial advantage in global modeling. We show that our equilibrium simplified aerosol model (EQSAM) yields results similar to those of current state-of-the-art equilibrium models.","Max Planck Inst Chem, D-55020 Mainz, Germany; Commiss European Communities, Joint Res Ctr, Inst Environm & Sustainabil, I-21020 Ispra, Italy; Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Engn & Publ Policy, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA",Max Planck Society; European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site; Carnegie Mellon University,"Metzger, S (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Chem, POB 3060, D-55020 Mainz, Germany.",metzger@mpch-mainz.mpg.de; frank.dentener@jrc.it; spyros@andrew.cmu.edu; lelieveld@mpch-mainz.mpg.de,"Pandis, Spyros/D-3680-2013; Studies, Center for Atmospheric Particle/AAR-6731-2020; Metzger, Swen M./P-9107-2018; Pandis, Spyros/AAW-3089-2021; Lelieveld, Johannes (Jos)/A-1986-2013","Metzger, Swen M./0000-0002-3623-7160; Pandis, Spyros/0000-0001-8085-9795; Lelieveld, Johannes (Jos)/0000-0001-6307-3846",,,,,67,22,22,0,6,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",2169-897X,2169-8996,,J GEOPHYS RES-ATMOS,J.

These impacts involve sectors as diverse as tourism, fisheries and energy production. Projections of future marine climate change come from global models. Modelling at the global scale is required to capture the feedbacks and largescale transport of physical properties such as heat, which occur within the climate system, but global models currently cannot provide detail in the shelf seas. Version 2 of the regional implementation of the Shelf Sea Physics and Primary Production (S2P3-R v2.0) model bridges the gap between global projections and local shelf-sea impacts. S2P3-R v2.0 is a highly simplified coastal shelf model, computationally efficient enough to be run across the shelf seas of the whole globe. Despite the simplified nature of the model, it can display regional skill comparable to state-of-the-art models, and at the scale of the global (excluding high latitudes) shelf seas it can explain >50% of the interannual sea surface temperature (SST) variability in similar to 60% of grid cells and >80% of interannual variability in similar to 20% of grid cells. The model can be run at any resolution for which the input data can be supplied, without expert technical knowledge, and using a modest off-the-shelf computer. The accessibility of S2P3-R v2.0 places it within reach of an array of coastal managers and policy makers, allowing it to be run routinely once set up and evaluated for a region under expert guidance. The computational efficiency and relative scientific simplicity of the tool make it ideally suited to educational applications. S2P3R v2.0 is set up to be driven directly with output from reanalysis products or daily atmospheric output from climate models such as those which contribute to the sixth phase of the Climate Model Intercomparison Project, making it a valuable tool for semi-dynamical downscaling of climate projections. The updates introduced into version 2.0 of this model are primarily focused around the ability to geographical relocate the model, model usability and speed but also scientific improvements. The value of this model comes from its computational efficiency, which necessitates simplicity. This simplicity leads to several limitations, which are discussed in the context of evaluation at regional and global scales.","[Halloran, Paul R.; McWhorter, Jennifer K.; Arellano Nava, Beatriz] Univ Exeter, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Exeter, Devon, England; [McWhorter, Jennifer K.] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Marsh, Robert] Univ Southampton, Natl Oceanog Ctr, Southampton, Hants, England; [Skirving, William] NOAA, Coral Reef Watch, College Pk, MD USA; [Skirving, William] ReefSense Pty Ltd, Cranbrook, Qld, Australia",University of Exeter; University of Queensland; NERC National Oceanography Centre; University of Southampton; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Halloran, PR (corresponding author), Univ Exeter, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Exeter, Devon, England.",p.halloran@exeter.ac.uk,"Halloran, Paul/G-3965-2012","Halloran, Paul/0000-0002-9227-0678",UK Research Council [NE/V00865X/1]; QUEX Institute; University of Exeter; University of Queensland; European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [820989]; NOAA [NA19NES4320002],UK Research Council; QUEX Institute; University of Exeter; University of Queensland(University of Queensland); European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme; NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA),"Paul Halloran received funding by the UK Research Council (grant no.

We extend the probabilistic framework to also consider empirical prior information, which allows to train even on highly incomplete data. Moreover, we devise a way to make discrete MRFs predict continuous values via state superposition.

Robust, long-lead forecasts would therefore be valuable for managing policy responses. But despite decades of effort, forecasting ENSO events at lead times of more than one year remains problematic(2). Here we show that a statistical forecast model employing a deep-learning approach produces skilful ENSO forecasts for lead times of up to one and a half years. To circumvent the limited amount of observation data, we use transfer learning to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) first on historical simulations(3) and subsequently on reanalysis from 1871 to 1973. During the validation period from 1984 to 2017, the all-season correlation skill of the Nino3.4 index of the CNN model is much higher than those of current state-of-the-art dynamical forecast systems. The CNN model is also better at predicting the detailed zonal distribution of sea surface temperatures, overcoming a weakness of dynamical forecast models. A heat map analysis indicates that the CNN model predicts ENSO events using physically reasonable precursors. The CNN model is thus a powerful tool for both the prediction of ENSO events and for the analysis of their associated complex mechanisms.","[Ham, Yoo-Geun; Kim, Jeong-Hwan] Chonnam Natl Univ, Dept Oceanog, Gwangju, South Korea; [Luo, Jing-Jia] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Inst Climate & Applicat Res ICAR CICFEM KLME ILCE, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Luo, Jing-Jia] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Earth Environm, SKLLQG, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China","Chonnam National University; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Earth Environment, CAS","Ham, YG (corresponding author), Chonnam Natl Univ, Dept Oceanog, Gwangju, South Korea.",ygham@jnu.ac.kr,"Luo, Jing-Jia/T-9612-2019","Luo, Jing-Jia/0000-0003-2181-0638",Korea Meteorological Administration Research and Development Program [KMI2018-03214]; Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education [NRF-2016R1A6A1A03012647]; 'The Startup Foundation for Introducing Talent' of NUIST,"Korea Meteorological Administration Research and Development Program(Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA)); Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education(National Research Foundation of KoreaMinistry of Education (MOE), Republic of KoreaNational Research Council for Economics, Humanities & Social Sciences, Republic of Korea); 'The Startup Foundation for Introducing Talent' of NUIST",This study is funded by the Korea Meteorological Administration Research and Development Program under grant KMI2018-03214.

However, the extent to which this association constrains adaptation or diversification into new habitats remains unclear. We studied habitat evolution in the hyper-diverse angiosperm clade Saxifragales. Methods We used species-level phylogenies for approx. 950 species to analyse the evolution of habitat shifts as well as their influence on plant diversification. We combined habitat characterization based on floristic assignments and state-of-the art phylogenetic comparative methods to estimate within-and across-habitat diversification patterns. Key Results Our analyses showed that Saxifragales diversified into multiple habitats from a forest-inhabiting ancestor and that this diversification is governed by relatively rare habitat shifts. Lineages are likely to stay within inferred ancestral ecological conditions. Adaptation to some habitat types (e. g. aquatic, desert) may be canalizing events that lineages do not escape. Although associations between increased diversification rates and shifts in habitat preferences are occasionally observed, extreme macroevolutionary rates are closely associated with specific habitats. Lineages occurring in shrubland, and especially tundra and rock cliffs, exhibit comparatively high diversification, whereas forest, grassland, desert and aquatic habitats are associated with low diversification. Conclusions The likelihood of occupation of new habitats appears to be asymmetric. Shifts to aquatic and desert habitats may be canalizing events. Other habitats, such as tundra, might act as evolutionary sources, while forests provide the only habitat seemingly colonized easily by lineages originating elsewhere. However, habitat shifts are very rare, and any major environmental alteration is expected to have dramatic evolutionary consequences.","[Rubio de Casas, Rafael] EEZA CSIC, Estn Expt Zonas Aridas, Carretera Sacramento S-N, Almeria 04120, Spain; [Rubio de Casas, Rafael] Univ Paul Valery 7 Montpellier, CEFE UMR 5175, CNRS, Univ Montpellier,EPHE, 1919 Route Mende, F-34293 Montpellier 05, France; [Rubio de Casas, Rafael] Univ Granada, Fac Ciencias, Dept Ecol, Avda Fuentenueva S-N, E-18071 Granada, Spain; [Mort, Mark E.] Univ Kansas, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 1200 Sunnyside Ave, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Mort, Mark E.] Univ Kansas, Biodivers Inst, 1200 Sunnyside Ave, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Soltis, Douglas E.] Univ Florida, Dept Biol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Soltis, Douglas E.] Univ Florida, Florida Museum Nat Hist, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Estacion Experimental de Zonas Aridas (EEZA); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); UDICE-French Research Universities; PSL Research University Paris; Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes (EPHE); Universite de Montpellier; University of Granada; University of Kansas; University of Kansas; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"de Casas, RR (corresponding author), EEZA CSIC, Estn Expt Zonas Aridas, Carretera Sacramento S-N, Almeria 04120, Spain.;de Casas, RR (corresponding author), Univ Paul Valery 7 Montpellier, CEFE UMR 5175, CNRS, Univ Montpellier,EPHE, 1919 Route Mende, F-34293 Montpellier 05, France.;de Casas, RR (corresponding author), Univ Granada, Fac Ciencias, Dept Ecol, Avda Fuentenueva S-N, E-18071 Granada, Spain.;Soltis, DE (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Dept Biol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.;Soltis, DE (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Florida Museum Nat Hist, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",rafa.rubiodecasas@gmail.com; dsoltis@ufl.edu,"de Casas, Rafael Rubio/AAA-6912-2019; Soltis, Douglas/L-5957-2015","de Casas, Rafael Rubio/0000-0003-4276-4968; ","NESCent [EF-0905606]; 'TEE-OFF' (European Commission/Marie Curie Actions) [MC-IIF-2011-300026]; 'Bet-hedging, trade-offs and the evolution of seed dispersal and dormancy' (Talentia program; Junta de Andalucia/E-P7)","NESCent(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)); 'TEE-OFF' (European Commission/Marie Curie Actions); 'Bet-hedging, trade-offs and the evolution of seed dispersal and dormancy' (Talentia program; Junta de Andalucia/E-P7)","R.

The main objective of JOYCE is to provide observations, which improve our understanding of the cloudy boundary layer in a midlatitude environment. Continuous and temporally highly resolved measurements that are specifically suited to characterize the diurnal cycle of water vapor, stability, and turbulence in the lower troposphere are performed with a special focus on atmosphere-surface interaction. In addition, instruments are set up to measure the micro- and macrophysical properties of clouds in detail and how they interact with different boundary layer processes and the large-scale synoptic situation. For this, JOYCE is equipped with an array of state-of-the-art active and passive remote sensing and in situ instruments, which are briefly described in this scientific overview. As an example, a 24-h time series of the evolution of a typical cumulus cloud-topped boundary layer is analyzed with respect to stability, turbulence, and cloud properties. Additionally, we present longer-term statistics, which can be used to elucidate the diurnal cycle of water vapor, drizzle formation through autoconversion, and warm versus cold rain precipitation formation. Both case studies and long-term observations are important for improving the representation of clouds in climate and numerical weather prediction models.","[Loehnert, U.; Schween, J.

What are the varying economic, governance, and energy and climate sustainability aspects associated with the diffusion of smart meters for electricity? What lessons can be learned from the ongoing rollouts of smart meters around the world? Based on an original dataset twice as comprehensive as the current state of the art, this study examines smart meter deployment across 41 national programs and 61 subnational programs that collectively target 1.49 billion installations involving 47 countries. In addition to rates of adoption and the relative influence of factors such as technology costs, we examine adoption requirements, modes of information provision, patterns of incumbency and management, behavioral changes and energy savings, emissions reductions, policies, and links to other lowcarbon transitions such as energy efficiency or renewable energy. We identify numerous weak spots in the literature, notably the lack of harmonized datasets as well as inconsistent scope and quality within national costbenefit analyses of smart meter programs. Most smart meters have a lifetime of only 20 years, leading to future challenges concerning repair, care, and waste. National-scale programs (notably China) account for a far larger number of installations than subnational ones, and national scale programs also install smart meters more affordably, i.e. with lower general costs. Finally, the transformative effect of smart meters may be oversold, and we find that smart electricity meters are a technology that is complementary, rather than disruptive or transformative, one that largely does not challenge the dominant practices and roles of electricity suppliers, firms, or network operators.","[Sovacool, Benjamin K.; Hook, Andrew] Univ Sussex, Sch Business Management & Econ, Sci Policy Res Unit SPRU, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Sovacool, Benjamin K.] Aarhus Univ, Dept Business Dev & Technol, Ctr Energy Technol, Aarhus, Denmark; [Sareen, Siddharth] Univ Bergen, Dept Geog, Bergen, Norway; [Sareen, Siddharth] Univ Bergen, Ctr Climate & Energy Transformat, Bergen, Norway; [Geels, Frank W.] Univ Manchester, Manchester Inst Innovat Res, Manchester, Lancs, England",University of Sussex; Aarhus University; University of Bergen; University of Bergen; University of Manchester,"Sovacool, BK (corresponding author), Univ Sussex, Sci Policy Res Unit SPRU, Jubilee Bldg,Room 367, Falmer BN1 9SL, E Sussex, England.",B.Sovacool@sussex.ac.uk,"Sareen, Siddharth/W-7168-2018; Geels, Frank/B-5771-2012","Sareen, Siddharth/0000-0002-0826-7311; Geels, Frank/0000-0001-8778-4757",UK Research and Innovation through the Centre for Research into Energy Demand Solutions [EP/R035288/1],UK Research and Innovation through the Centre for Research into Energy Demand Solutions,"The authors gratefully acknowledge support from UK Research and Innovation through the Centre for Research into Energy Demand Solutions, grant reference number EP/R035288/1.

A set of state-of-the-art broadband radiometers and sun/sky photometers were deployed along with launched radiosonde. In this paper, we compared the simulated solar irradiances by using the SBDART radiative transfer model with those from the ground-based measurements for 69 selected cases of 7 days. It was shown that the averaged aerosol optical depth at 500 nm (AOD(500)) is 0.18 +/- 0.09 with AOD(500) less than 0.5 for all cases. The single-scattering albedo and asymmetry factor at 675 nm are 0.928 +/- 0.035, 0.712 +/- 0.023, respectively. The AODs retrieved from the CIMEL sun photometer at various wavelengths agree well with those from the PREDE sky radiometer, and the columnar water vapor contents from CIMEL also agree well with radiosonde observations. In the radiative closure experiment, we used a collocated thermopile pyrgeometer with a shadow and ventilator to correct the thermal dome offset of diffuse irradiance measurement. The mean differences between model and measurements are -9.1 Wm(-2) (-2.6%) for the direct irradiance, +3.1 Wm(-2) (+2.8%) for diffuse irradiance, and -6.0 Wm(-2) (-13%) for global irradiance, which indicates an excellent radiative closure. Aerosol shortwave direct radiative forcing (ARF) and radiative heating rate are also investigated. The daily mean ARF ranges from -4.8 to +0.4 Wm(-2) at the top of the atmosphere, -5.2 to -15.6 Wm(-2) at the surface, and 5.2 to 10.8 Wm(-2) in the atmosphere. The corresponding radiative heating rates for the whole atmosphere due to dust aerosols are 0.07, 0.11, 0.14, 0.11, 0.10, 0.08, and 0.07 K/day for the 7 selected cloudless days. These solar radiative forcing can be considered as the representative impact of background dust aerosol in Northwestern China. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we apply a linear response theory approach to 16 state-of-the-art ice sheet models to estimate the Antarctic ice sheet contribution from basal ice shelf melting within the 21st century. The purpose of this computation is to estimate the uncertainty of Antarctica's future contribution to global sea level rise that arises from large uncertainty in the oceanic forcing and the associated ice shelf melting. Ice shelf melting is considered to be a major if not the largest perturbation of the ice sheet's flow into the ocean. However, by computing only the sea level contribution in response to ice shelf melting, our study is neglecting a number of processes such as surface-mass-balance-related contributions. In assuming linear response theory, we are able to capture complex temporal responses of the ice sheets, but we neglect any self-dampening or self-amplifying processes. This is particularly relevant in situations in which an instability is dominating the ice loss. The results obtained here are thus relevant, in particular wherever the ice loss is dominated by the forcing as opposed to an internal instability, for example in strong ocean warming scenarios. In order to allow for comparison the methodology was chosen to be exactly the same as in an earlier study (Levermann et al., 2014) but with 16 instead of 5 ice sheet models. We include uncertainty in the atmospheric warming response to carbon emissions (full range of CMIP5 climate model sensitivities), uncertainty in the oceanic transport to the Southern Ocean (obtained from the time-delayed and scaled oceanic subsurface warming in CMIP5 models in relation to the global mean surface warming), and the observed range of responses of basal ice shelf melting to oceanic warming outside the ice shelf cavity. This uncertainty in basal ice shelf melting is then convoluted with the linear response functions of each of the 16 ice sheet models to obtain the ice flow response to the individual global warming path. The model median for the observational period from 1992 to 2017 of the ice loss due to basal ice shelf melting is 10.2 mm, with a likely range between 5.2 and 21.3 mm For the same period the Antarctic ice sheet lost mass equivalent to 7.4 mm of global sea level rise, with a standard deviation of 3.7 mm (Shepherd et al., 2018) including all processes, especially surface-mass-balance changes. For the unabated warming path, Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5), we obtain a median contribution of the Antarctic ice sheet to global mean sea level rise from basal ice shelf melting within the 21st century of 17 cm, with a likely range (66th percentile around the mean) between 9 and 36 cm and a very likely range (90th percentile around the mean) between 6 and 58 cm. For the RCP2.6 warming path, which will keep the global mean temperature below 2 degrees C of global warming and is thus consistent with the Paris Climate Agreement, the procedure yields a median of 13 cm of global mean sea level contribution. The likely range for the RCP2.6 scenario is between 7 and 24 cm, and the very likely range is between 4 and 37 cm. The structural uncertainties in the method do not allow for an interpretation of any higher uncertainty percentiles. We provide projections for the five Antarctic regions and for each model and each scenario separately. The rate of sea level contribution is highest under the RCP8.5 scenario. The maximum within the 21st century of the median value is 4 cm per decade, with a likely range between 2 and 9 cm per decade and a very likely range between 1 and 14 cm per decade.","[Levermann, Anders; Winkelmann, Ricarda; Albrecht, Torsten; Calov, Reinhard; Garbe, Julius; Meinshausen, Malte] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Potsdam, Germany; [Levermann, Anders] Columbia Univ, LDEO, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Levermann, Anders; Winkelmann, Ricarda; Garbe, Julius] Univ Potsdam, Inst Phys & Astron, D-14476 Potsdam, Germany; [Goelzer, Heiko; van de Wal, Roderik S.

Different kinds of domestic hot-water production systems exist. The operational cost, environmental effect and performance of these systems differ according to various energy sources, climates, system types and system designs. Hence, the proper choice of a domestic hot-water system could save energy, protect nature and reduce operational costs, significantly. This paper illustrates, to the best of the author's knowledge, the existing water-heating systems all along with the principle, advantages, disadvantages and state-of-the-art for each. Six different categories were presented, namely wood, oil/gas, electric, heat pump, solar and instantaneous systems. The heat-pump systems were further classified into several groups, namely air source, ground source, solar assisted, ground source-solar assisted, photovoltaic-thermal and gas-engine driven systems.

Cloud properties retrieved from satellite observations, such as cloud vertical placement, cloud water path and cloud particle size, play an important role for such studies. In order to give climate and weather researchers more confidence in the quality of these retrievals their validity needs to be determined and their error characteristics must be quantified. The purpose of the Cloud Retrieval Evaluation Workshop (CREW), held from 15-18 Nov. 2011 in Madison, Wisconsin, USA, is to enhance knowledge on state-of-art cloud properties retrievals from passive imaging satellites, and pave the path towards optimizing these retrievals for climate monitoring as well as for the analysis of cloud parameterizations in climate and weather models. CREW also seeks to observe and understand methods used to prepare daily and monthly cloud parameter climatologies. An important workshop component is discussion on results of the algorithm and sensor comparisons and validation studies. Hereto a common database with about 12 different cloud properties retrievals from passive imagers (MSG, MODIS, AVHRR, POLDER and/or AIRS), complemented with cloud measurements that serve as a reference (CLOUDSAT, CALIPSO, AMSU, MISR), was prepared for a number of golden days. The passive imager cloud property retrievals were inter-compared and validated against Cloudsat, Calipso and AMSU observations. In our presentation we summarize the outcome of the inter-comparison and validation work done in the framework of CREW, and elaborate on reasons for observed differences. More in depth discussions were held on retrieval principles and validation, and utilization of cloud parameters for climate research. This was done in parallel breakout sessions on cloud vertical placement, cloud physical properties, and cloud climatologies. We present the recommendations of these sessions, propose a way forward to establish international partnerships on cloud research, and summarize actions defined to tailor CREW activities to missions of international programs, such as the Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX) and Sustained, Co-Ordinated Processing of Environmental Satellite Data for Climate Monitoring (SCOPE-CM). Finally, attention is given to increase the traceability and uniformity of different long-term and homogeneous records of cloud parameters.","[Roebeling, Rob] EUMETSAT, D-64295 Darmstadt, Germany",European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites,"Roebeling, R (corresponding author), EUMETSAT, Eumetsat Allee 1, D-64295 Darmstadt, Germany.",,"Hamann, Ulrich/G-5388-2016; Heidinger, Andrew/F-5591-2010","Hamann, Ulrich/0000-0001-8091-722X; Heidinger, Andrew/0000-0001-7631-109X",,,,,3,2,2,0,2,AMER INST PHYSICS,MELVILLE,"2 HUNTINGTON QUADRANGLE, STE 1NO1, MELVILLE, NY 11747-4501 USA",0094-243X,,978-0-7354-1155-5,AIP CONF PROC,,,2013,,,,,416,419,,10.1063/1.4804795,http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4804795,,,4,"Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences; Physics, Applied",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences; Physics,BFO62,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000320763100101,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this study, we characterized the diversity and community composition of active microorganisms inhabiting the vascular plant rhizosphere in two sites with contrasting vegetation cover in King George Island, Western Antarctic Peninsula. We assessed the interplay between soil physicochemical properties and microbial diversity and composition, evaluating the effect of an in situ experimental warming on the microbial communities of the rhizosphere from D. antarctica and C. quitensis. Bacteria and Eukarya showed different responses to warming in both sites, and the effect was more noticeable in microbial eukaryotes from the low vegetation site. Furthermore, important changes were found in the relative abundance of Tepidisphaerales (Bacteria) and Ciliophora (Eukarya) between warming and control treatments. Our results showed that rhizosphere eukaryal communities are more sensitive to in situ warming than bacterial communities. Overall, our results indicate that vegetation drives the response of the active fraction of the microbial communities from the rhizosphere of Antarctic vascular plants to soil warming.","[Parada-Pozo, Genesis; Abades, Sebastian; Alfaro, Fernando D.; Trefault, Nicole] Univ Mayor, Fac Ciencias, Ctr GEMA Genom, Ecologia Medio Ambiente, Santiago 8580745, Chile; [Bravo, Leon A.] Univ La Frontera, Fac Ciencias Agropecuarias Medioambiente, Dept Ciencias Agronom Recursos Natur, Temuco 4811230, Chile; [Saez, Patricia L.] Univ Concepcion, Fac Ciencias Forest, Dept Silvicultura, Ctr Biotecnol, Concepcion 4070386, Chile; [Saez, Patricia L.; Cavieres, Lohengrin A.] Inst Ecologia Biodiversidad IEB, Santiago 775000, Chile; [Cavieres, Lohengrin A.] Univ Concepcion, Fac Ciencias Natur & Oceanograf, Dept Botan, Concepcion 4070386, Chile; [Reyes-Diaz, Marjorie] Univ La Frontera, Fac Ingn & Ciencias, Dept Ciencias Quim Recursos Natur, Temuco 4811230, Chile; [Reyes-Diaz, Marjorie] Univ La Frontera, Ctr Plant, Soil Interact & Nat Resources Biotechnol, Sci & Technol Bioresource Nucleus BIOREN, Temuco 4811230, Chile; [De la Iglesia, Rodrigo] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Genet Mol Microbiologia, Santiago 8320000, Chile",Universidad Mayor; Universidad de La Frontera; Universidad de Concepcion; Universidad de Concepcion; Universidad de La Frontera; Universidad de La Frontera; Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile,"Trefault, N (corresponding author), Camino Piramide 5750,Huechuraba, Santiago 8580745, Chile.",nicole.trefault@umayor.cl,"Bravo, León/AAO-8437-2020; Cavieres, Lohengrin/A-9542-2010","Bravo, León/0000-0003-4705-4842; Cavieres, Lohengrin/0000-0001-9122-3020; De la Iglesia, Rodrigo/0000-0002-2000-8697; Abades, Sebastian/0000-0001-5704-4037; Saez, Patricia L./0000-0002-8594-7329; Alfaro Ayllon, Fernando Daniel/0000-0003-2922-1838","Associative Research Program of CONICYT [CONICYT-PIA ART-1102]; INACH [AN-02-12]; FONDECYT [1190879, INACH RT_34-17]; ANID/BASAL [FB210006]",Associative Research Program of CONICYT; INACH; FONDECYT(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT); ANID/BASAL,"This work was supported by The Associative Research Program of CONICYT (CONICYT-PIA ART-1102), INACH (AN-02-12), FONDECYT No 1190879, INACH RT_34-17 and ANID/BASAL FB210006.",,82,0,0,10,10,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0168-6496,1574-6941,,FEMS MICROBIOL ECOL,FEMS Microbiol.

In particular, sea level rise associated with climate change can drastically affect wetlands and beaches which are important foraging and nesting areas of these organisms. SLAMM 5 (Sea Level Affecting Marshes Model) is widely used to simulate wetland conversion and shoreline modification for the purpose of habitat vulnerability assessment and decision making, but concerns regarding the suitability of the model due to the uncertainty involved in selecting many of the model's empirical input parameters have been expressed. This paper applies a generic evaluation framework consisting of a state-of-the-art screening and variance-based global sensitivity and uncertainty analyses to simulate changes in the coastal habitats of the barrier island in Eglin Air Force Base, Florida in order to: (1) identify the important input factors and processes that control SLAMM 5's output uncertainty; (2) quantify SLAMM 5's global output uncertainty and apportion it to the direct contributions and interactions of the important input factors; and (3) evaluate this new methodology to explore the potential fate of the coastal habitats of the study area. Results showed that four input factors (DEM vertical error for the lower elevation range, historic trend of sea level rise, accretion, and sedimentation rates) controlled 88-91% of SLAMM 5's output variance in predicting changes in the beach habitat of Eglin Air Force Base. The most dominant processes governing the fate of the coastline of the study area were inundation (i.e. reduction in elevation due to sea level rise) and accretion/sedimentation. Interestingly, for lower elevation habitats (salt marsh, tidal flat, and beach), results showed possible gain or loss of these habitats depending on the relative strength of these processes resulting from the combination of input factors within their proposed uncertainty ranges. Higher-elevation habitats (swamps and inland fresh marsh) showed decrease in area over 100 years of simulation. These findings are important to implement managerial schemes in the area to protect threatened Plover birds (Charadrius sp.) communities. This generic model evaluation framework is model-independent and can be used to evaluate a wide range of environmental models. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Chu-Agor, M.

The study focused on productivity rates in animal numbers (RN) and meat weights (RW) estimated from a herd growth model, which were compared with FAOSTAT-based estimates. The uncertainty analysis contained the following two steps: uncertainty propagation and a global sensitivity analysis. The analysis was based on a state-of-the-art of the current knowledge and a set of available data on the herd performances. The calculations used Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the 95% confidence intervals (CI) of RN and RW and the standardized regression coefficients method to estimate the contribution of the input variables to the outputs variances. The mean rate RN was estimated to 0.127 animal/animal-year with a 95% CI of (0.091, 0.163) and the mean rate RW to 11.7 kg/animal-year with a 95% CI of (8.8, 14.7), corresponding to relative variation around the mean of about +/- 29% and +/- 25%, respectively. The input variables that contributed most to the variance of RN (almost 76% of the output variance) were the calving rate, the adult female mortality rate and the female proportion in the population (determined by the pattern of the male offtake in the herds). The input variables that contributed most to the variance of RW were the same as those for RN plus the adult live weights. The CI ranges that were estimated in this article indicate that productivity rates based on literature data or expert estimations of the herd performances should be considered with caution. Research efforts based on gold-standard herd monitoring protocols accounting for temporal and spatial variations should be undertaken in future to decrease the knowledge gaps on the input variables that contribute most to these ranges.","[Lesnoff, M.] CIRAD, UMR SELMET, F-34398 Montpellier 5, France",CIRAD,"Lesnoff, M (corresponding author), CIRAD, UMR SELMET, Campus Int Baillarguet,TA C-112-A, F-34398 Montpellier 5, France.",matthieu.lesnoff@cirad.fr,,,,,,,30,3,3,0,3,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1751-7311,1751-732X,,ANIMAL,Animal,NOV,2015,11,,,,1888,1896,,10.1017/S175173111500124X,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S175173111500124X,,,9,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Veterinary Sciences",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture; Veterinary Sciences,CW5HL,26189686,"Green Submitted, hybrid, Green Published",,,12/21/22,WOS:000365026200019,View Full Record in Web of Science

The project was based on the concept of risk governance. It was implemented in the case study region of the District of Cologne, which was represented by its departments for regional development, immission control and water management. Within a broader scope of analysis, special attention was paid to critical infrastructures. For regional planning those risks and hazards are most important that require a cross-sectoral, regional response (see Art. 1 1 and Art. 8 6 Federal Regional Planning Act), as their impacts or related response strategies are of regional character. Therefore, the following four hazards were selected: river flooding, earthquakes, major accident hazards and heat. For these four potential dangers hazard and susceptibility classes were defined in accordance with a concept of risk analysis developed by the Federal Office for Civil Protection and Crisis Prevention. Hazard and susceptibility were merged into an integrated risk index. The categorization into hazard classes was the result of a consensus-building process among the project team and the participating experts of the District of Cologne. Furthermore, the team collaboratively defined specific susceptibilities for each land-use function (e.g. residential areas, transport infrastructure etc.) regarding each of the four selected types of hazards. On this conceptual basis, a GIS-based analysis of the risks that are caused by the selected hazards was conducted. Main results are hazard, susceptibility and risk maps for river floods, earthquakes and major accident hazards-both for the entire region and (with a finer resolution) for selected hot spots. Moreover, the project developed recommendations for regulations on risk management as a basis for the necessary weighting up of risk prevention against other planning concerns. Finally, a roadmap for spatial risk management as an integrated part of a comprehensive regional plan was derived. The District of Cologne will use the project's results as an evidence basis for the forthcoming update of the regional plan. This is of particular importance in view of the recent amendment of the EU Environmental Impact Assessment Directive (2014/52/EU) that widened the scope of this assessment to climate change and catastrophic risks.","[Greiving, Stefan] TU Dortmund, Fak Raumplanung, Inst Raumplanung, August Schmidt Str 10, D-44227 Dortmund, Germany; [Hartz, Andrea; Saad, Sascha] Agl Angew Geog Landschafts Stadt & Raumplanung Ha, Grossherzog Friedrich Str 16-18, D-66111 Saarbrucken, Germany; [Hurth, Florian] Plan Risk Consult, Raumplanung & Umweltforsch, Stockumer Str 435-437, D-44227 Dortmund, Germany",Dortmund University of Technology,"Greiving, S (corresponding author), TU Dortmund, Fak Raumplanung, Inst Raumplanung, August Schmidt Str 10, D-44227 Dortmund, Germany.",stefan.greiving@tu-dortmund.de; andreahartz@agl-online.de; hurth@plan-risk-consult.de; saschasaad@agl-online.de,,,,,,,45,4,4,0,20,SCIENDO,WARSAW,"DE GRUYTER POLAND SP Z O O, BOGUMILA ZUGA 32A STR, 01-811 WARSAW, POLAND",0034-0111,1869-4179,,RAUMFORSCH RAUMORDN,Raumforsch.

By using a process-based ecosystem model, the Dynamic Land Ecosystem Model (DLEM), in conjunction with the newly developed driving information on multiple environmental factors (climate, atmospheric CO2, tropospheric ozone, nitrogen deposition, and land cover/land use change), we quantified spatial and temporal patterns of net primary production (NPP) and soil organic carbon storage (SOC) across China's croplands during 19802005 and investigated the underlying mechanisms. Simulated results showed that both crop NPP and SOC increased from 1980 to 2005, and the highest annual NPP occurred in the Southeast (SE) region (0.32 Pg C yr-1, 35.4% of the total NPP) whereas the largest annual SOC (2.29 Pg C yr-1, 35.4% of the total SOC) was found in the Northeast (NE) region. Land management practices, particularly nitrogen fertilizer application, appear to be the most important factor in stimulating increase in NPP and SOC. However, tropospheric ozone pollution and climate change led to NPP reduction and SOC loss.

Comprised of curatorial statement, academic response and artist's manifesto, it considers how we may think, and rethink, the work of performance art and performance epistemology in an anthropocene age, through anthroposcenic actions. It also meditates on how indigenous Pacific ways of thinking about the relation between land and sea, people and elements, deep history and our increasingly perilous future contribute to this work. While the effect of climate change on our oceans is already incontrovertible and alarming, Sea-change' proposed that addressing it requires us to think Oceanically: attuned to the relational, networked and fluid realities of our condition, assuming (like a marine navigator) a position of unknowing', one not of epistemic mastery over the environment but of vulnerable, urgent attention. Bringing together performance practitioners, local and tribal authorities, activists and scholars from three continents, Sea-change' explored climate change (so often figured as a distant, global abstraction) as an intimate, embodied, highly local and profoundly historical experience.","[Werry, Margaret] Univ Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Werry, M (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",,,,,,,,1,1,1,0,2,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1352-8165,1469-9990,,PERFORM RES,Perform.

The retrospective forecasts are initialized in January, April, July, and November of each year, and ensembles of 6 forecasts are run for each initial month, yielding a total of 408 1-yr predictions. In generating the ensemble members, perturbations are added to the atmospheric initial state only. The skill of the prediction system is analyzed from both a deterministic and a probabilistic perspective, it is then compared to the operational NOAA Climate Forecast System (CFS), and the forecasts are combined with CFS to produce a multimodel prediction system. While the skill scores for each model are highly dependent on lead time and initialization month, the overall level of skill of the individual models is quite comparable. The multimodel combination (i.e., the unweighted average of the forecast), while not always the most skillful, is generally as skillful as the best model, using either deterministic or probabilistic skill metrics.","[Kirtman, Ben P.; Min, Dughong] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Kirtman, Ben P.] Ctr Ocean Land Atmosphere Studies, Calverton, MD USA",University of Miami,"Kirtman, BP (corresponding author), Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, 4600 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA.",bkirtman@rsmas.miami.edu,,,"Office of Science (BER); U.S. DOE [DE-FG0207ER64473]; NSF [ATM-0653123, OCI-0749165, ATM-0754341]; NOAA [NA17RJ1226, NA080AR4320889]",Office of Science (BER)(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); U.S. DOE(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA),"This research was supported by the Office of Science (BER), U.S. DOE DE-FG0207ER64473, NSF Grants ATM-0653123, OCI-0749165, and ATM-0754341 and NOAA Grants NA17RJ1226 and NA080AR4320889.

Marine bacteria are major drivers of biogeochemical nutrient cycles and energy fluxes(1); hence, understanding their performance under projected climate change scenarios is crucial for assessing ecosystem functioning. Whereas genetic and physiological responses of phytoplankton to ocean acidification are being disentangled(2-4), corresponding functional responses of bacterioplankton to pH reduction from elevated CO2 are essentially unknown. Here we show, from metatranscriptome analyses of a phytoplankton bloom mesocosm experiment, that marine bacteria responded to lowered pH by enhancing the expression of genes encoding proton pumps, such as respiration complexes, proteorhodopsin and membrane transporters. Moreover, taxonomic transcript analysis showed that distinct bacterial groups expressed different pH homeostasis genes in response to elevated CO2. These responses were substantial for numerous pH homeostasis genes under low-chlorophyll conditions (chlorophyll a <2.5 mu g l(-1)); however, the changes in gene expression under high-chlorophyll conditions (chlorophyll a >20 mu g l(-1))were low. Given that proton expulsion through pH homeostasis mechanisms is energetically costly, these findings suggest that bacterioplankton adaptation to ocean acidification could have long-term effects on the economy of ocean ecosystems.","[Bunse, Carina; Lundin, Daniel; Karlsson, Christofer M.

The ages obtained from glacial deposits indicate glacial periods at 85 +/- 5 ka, 64 +/- 11 ka, and 36 +/- 3 la (from glacial till) and 20 +/- 3 ka (from loess). The fluvial drainage system, fed by glaciers in the headwaters, developed extensive terrace systems in the Cinca River valley at 178 +/- 21 ka, 97 +/- 16 ka, 61 +/- 4 ka, 47 +/- 4 ka, and 11 +/- 1 ka, and in the Gallego River valley at 151 +/- 11 ka, 68 +/- 7 ka, and 45 +/- 3 ka. The times of maximum geomorphic activity related to cold phases coincide with Late Pleistocene marine isotope stages and Heinrich events. The maximum extent of glaciers during the last glacial occurred at 64 +/- 11 ka, and the terraces correlated with this glacial phase are the most extensive in both the Cinca (61 +/- 4 ka) and Gallego (68 +/- 7 ka) valleys, indicating a strong increase in fluvial discharge and availability of sediments related to the transition to deglaciation. The global Last Glacial Maximum is scarcely represented in the south central Pyrenees owing to dominantly dry conditions at that time. Precipitation must be controlled by the position of the Iberian Peninsula with respect to the North Atlantic atmospheric circulation system. The glacial systems and the associated fluvial dynamic seem sensitive to 1) global climate changes controlled by insolation, 2) North Atlantic thermohaline circulation influenced by freshwater pulses into the North Atlantic, and 3) anomalies in atmospheric circulation in the North Atlantic controlling precipitation on the Iberian Peninsula. Our scenario of glacial and fluvial evolution during the Late Pleistocene in northern Spain could be extrapolated to other glaciated mountainous areas in southern Europe. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We investigated whether different nesting resources and possibility of performing periparturient nest-building influenced (a) the parturition, (b) the vitality and survival of neonates, and (c) maternal stress and behaviour. Individually housed female mink (all provided with wood shavings in the nest box) had either (1) restricted possibility of nest building (NON; n = 60), (2) restricted possibility of nest building, but an artificial plastic nest available (ART; n = 60), (3) full possibility of nest building using straw (STR; n = 60), or (4) full possibility of nest building using straw and an artificial plastic nest available (ART + STR; n = 60). The experimental period began on average 11 days before the deliveries (range: 5-21 days) and lasted until 7 days after birth of each individual litter. The access to straw for nest building reduced the variation in inter-birth intervals between kits (P = 0.044; S.D. STR: 36 min versus NON: 58 min and ART: 53 min), but did not affect the total duration of parturition. The average body weight of kits was significantly reduced in NON litters after 7 days (P = 0.025), with no differences on Day I after delivery. In addition, the mortality of live-born kits was highest in the NON litters (P < 0.001). Female stress hormone metabolites, measured non-invasively in faeces, tended to differ between treatment groups after delivery (P = 0.064), with a lower concentration in ART and ART + STR than in NON. In a maternal reactivity test, ART + STR females were quicker than NON females to retrieve their 5-day-old kit to the home nest (P = 0.027). In conclusion, an artificial nest alone or in combination with ad libitum access to straw tended to reduce maternal stress postpartum, and the combination significantly enhanced maternal kit retrieval. For the kit vitality and survival, an artificial nest appeared as good as a nest of straw created by the dam, due to an improved in-nest climate postpartum. However, access to straw for nest building resulted in a less variable parturition, whereas the feedback from an artificial nest had no such effect. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

He says that geoengineering is not the solution to global warming because of its many risks and unknowns. He notes that some of the technology that would be required to implement geoengineering has not been developed and that many socio-political questions would have to be resolved before it could be put into practice. The world would have to reach agreement on a target temperature and on what entity should do the implementing. Robock's biggest fear with regard to geoengineering is that disputes over these questions could escalate into nuclear war which in turn could cause nuclear winter, producing global famine among other effects. He goes on to describe his meeting with former Cuban President Fidel Castro and discuss the role of the arts in addressing existential threats.",,,,,"Robock, Alan/B-6385-2016","Robock, Alan/0000-0002-6319-5656",,,,,0,2,2,2,19,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0096-3402,1938-3282,,B ATOM SCI,Bull.

The Global warming has several adverse effects on our climate, our health and our communities. The resulting climate changes due to global warming produce significant changes in the weather patterns. It is also argued that the climate changes occurring due to global warming is responsible for the various geological hazards occurring in the world, like earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, tsunamis (Gutenberg and Richter, 1954; Turcotte and Schubert, 2002; Wu and Johnston, 2000; Wu and Hasegawa, 1996a; Wu and Hasegawa, 1996b; Wu, 1997). McGuire in his book (McGuire, 2012) has explained in detail the interlink between the climate changes occurring due to global warming and the occurrence of geological disasters like earthquakes, volcanoes and tsunamis. Looking back to the past, when the climate changed naturally and our planet emerged from the ice age, the huge pressure exerted on the Earth's crust suddenly disappeared causing the Earth's crust to bounce back, the increased stress on the Earth's crust activated earthquakes, tremors and volcanic eruptions along the pre-existing fault lines. Currently, our planet, the Earth is still responding to the end of the last ice age some 20,000 or more years ago when the temperatures began to rise, huge masses of ice-sheets disappeared resulting from the melting of large masses of ice. Thus the rising temperature may be related to the anomalous emanation of soil radon-222 gas prior to an earthquake. The prime focus of this paper is to search for any cross correlation existing between the daily land-surface temperature anomalies and the soil radon concentration using a robust state of art method, Multifractal detrended cross correlation analysis (MF-DXA). The data sets for both the series used for the analysis are for a period from 2005 to 2014. The analysis shows that these two time series are not only cross correlated but having the cross correlation coefficient gamma(x) = 0.012 +/- 0.01, which clearly indicates a strong correlation between the soil radon-222 anomalies and the daily land-surface temperature anomalies.

Design/methodology/approach-A literature review of published, conference proceedings, agency reports, books, and web site documents was conducted, aiming at the identification of the diverging strategies and practices undertaken by transportation stakeholders in order to be able to generate initial meaningful insights about a sustainable transportation system. Findings-Sustainable transportation systems are in certain way a new paradigm where a business-as-usual approach is not possible. Vehicle makers produce more energy efficient vehicles. Nevertheless, fossil fuel is still the predominant source of energy. Regarding the level of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, non-motorized transport modes are preferable over motorized transport modes, and public transportation modes preferable to private transportation modes. It is also import to include environmental consideration along the design, construction, maintenance, and operation of the transportation infrastructure. While vehicles powered by alternate fuel such as biofuel, electricity, and/or fuel cell are becoming more popular, shifting to more sustainable transport modes would also require changes on commuter behaviors and individual preferences. Practical implications-The paper discusses the efforts that are underway for decoupling transport and CO2 emissions, being useful for transportation stakeholders to implement or improve the effectiveness of their potential or current sustainability transport initiatives through the identification of strategies, opportunities, and barriers. Originality/value-Although there is plenty of good information about sustainability and transportation modes in literature, most of the articles analyzed focus on specific factors of the whole transportation system. The originality/value of this paper is found in the holistic perspective, here presented, of the state of the art issues that a sustainable transport system would encompass.","[Velazquez, Luis; Munguia, Nora E.; Zavala, Andrea G.] Univ Sonora, Dept Ind Engn, Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico; [Velazquez, Luis] Univ Massachusetts Lowell, Dept Work Environm, Lowell, MA USA; [Will, Markus; Delakowitz, Bernd] Univ Appl Sci Zittau Gorlitz, Fac Math Nat Sci, Gorlitz, Germany; [Patricia Verdugo, Sara] Univ Sonora, Dept Ind Engn, Sustainabil Master, Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico; [Giannetti, Biagio] Univ Paulista, Dept Post Grad Proc Engn, Sao Paulo, Brazil",Universidad de Sonora; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Lowell; Technische Universitat Dresden; Universidad de Sonora; Universidade Paulista,"Velazquez, L (corresponding author), Univ Sonora, Dept Ind Engn, Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico.",Luis_Velazquez@industrial.uson.mx,"Velazquez, Luis E/H-3269-2018; Giannetti, Biagio F./AAC-8306-2019","Giannetti, Biagio Fernando/0000-0002-2337-4457",,,,,105,24,24,2,7,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1477-7835,1758-6119,,MANAG ENVIRON QUAL,Manag.

The aim of the present study was to establish terroir zones in a steep slope region in Switzerland based on vine and berry physiology. The study area, Villette in the AOC Lavaux, was a unique experimental site due to the homogeneity of plant material in a relatively small microclimate (140 ha) and a multiplicity of different expositions, soil types and altitudes. Vine and berry physiology as well as temperature of twenty-two plots were monitored during three consecutive seasons to investigate whether a link with pedoclimatic parameters can be established. The annual temporal variation of the average temperature was 142 growing degree days (GDD) over all years. Remarkably, spatial temperature variability was twice as high, with a variation between most extreme plots of 395 GDDs on average over all years. PCA and hierarchical clustering of assessed vine and berry physiological parameters resulted in a vintage dependent grouping of plots differing between years, which was not congruent with geological entities. This highlights the importance of the vintage effect, which had a large influence on vine and berry physiology and impacted terroir zones more than soil groups. Important differences in budburst and flowering were observed between plots, whereas altitude was the main driver of precocity in all years, being relatively independent of the vintage, which confirms the importance of topography in viticultural terroirs. The results of the present study help point out the potential and limits of vine and berry physiology-based terroir mapping. Furthermore, the study provides important information regarding the ripening kinetics of Chasselas grapes in relation to different pedoclimatic conditions, and it highlights the considerable spatial variability of the ripening potential of steep slope vineyards. Our study provides important information to growers in terms of the adaptation of plant material and agronomic strategies of different plots in view of global warming.","[Rienth, Markus; Lamy, Frederic; Schoenenberger, Patrik; Noll, Dorothea] Univ Sci & Art Western Switzerland, Changins Coll Viticulture & Enol, Changins, Route Duillier 60, CH-1260 Nyon, Switzerland; [Lorenzini, Fabrice] Agroscope, Route Duillier 50, CH-1260 Nyon, Switzerland; [Zufferey, Vivian] Agroscope, Ave Rochettaz 21, CH-1009 Pully, Switzerland; [Viret, Olivier] Serv Agr & Viticulture SAVI, Ave Marcelin 29, CH-1110 Morges, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Research Station Agroscope; Swiss Federal Research Station Agroscope,"Rienth, M (corresponding author), Univ Sci & Art Western Switzerland, Changins Coll Viticulture & Enol, Changins, Route Duillier 60, CH-1260 Nyon, Switzerland.",markus.rienth@changins.ch,"Rienth, Markus/AAI-5448-2021; Rienth, Markus/AAK-3241-2021","Rienth, Markus/0000-0002-6302-6297",la Federation vaudoise des vignerons (FVV),la Federation vaudoise des vignerons (FVV),"We are grateful to Sandrine Belcher for performing the FTIR analysis, and to the students Alexia Henny, Pierre Durand and Axel Vacheron for their help during the data acquisition in the field.

Automatic cloud type classification of images continuously observed by the ground-based imagers could help climate researchers find the relationship between cloud type variations and climate change. However, by far it is still a huge challenge to design a powerful discriminative classifier for cloud categorization. To tackle this difficulty, in this paper, we present an improved method with region covariance descriptors (RCovDs) and the Riemannian bag-of-feature (BoF) method. RCovDs model the correlations among different dimensional features, which allows for a more discriminative representation. BoF is extended from Euclidean space to Riemannian manifold by k-means clustering, in which Stein divergence is adopted as a similarity metric. The histogram feature is extracted by encoding RCovDs of the cloud image blocks with a BoF-based codebook. The multiclass support vector machine (SVM) is utilized for the recognition of cloud types. The experiments on the ground-based cloud image datasets show that a very high prediction accuracy (more than 98 % on two datasets) can be obtained with a small number of training samples, which validate the proposed method and exhibit the competitive performance against state-of-the-art methods.","[Tang, Yuzhu] Nanjing Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Nanjing 210094, Peoples R China; [Yang, Pinglv; Zhou, Zeming; Zhao, Xiaofeng] Natl Univ Def Technol, Coll Meteorol & Oceanol, Nanjing 211101, Peoples R China; [Pan, Delu] Southern Marine Sci & Engn Guangdong Lab Guangzho, Guangzhou 511458, Peoples R China; [Tang, Yuzhu; Pan, Delu; Chen, Jianyu] Second Inst Oceanog, State Key Lab Satellite Ocean Environm Dynam, Hangzhou 310012, Peoples R China",Nanjing University of Science & Technology; National University of Defense Technology - China; Hong Kong Branch of the Southern Marine Science & Engineering Guangdong Laboratory (Guangzhou); Ministry of Natural Resources of the People's Republic of China; Second Institute of Oceanography (SIO),"Zhou, ZM (corresponding author), Natl Univ Def Technol, Coll Meteorol & Oceanol, Nanjing 211101, Peoples R China.;Chen, JY (corresponding author), Second Inst Oceanog, State Key Lab Satellite Ocean Environm Dynam, Hangzhou 310012, Peoples R China.",tangyuzhu9293@163.com; zhou_zeming@nudt.edu.cn; chenjianyu@sio.org.cn,,,"National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFC1400903]; Key Special Project for Introduced Talents Team of Southern Marine Science and Engineering Guangdong Laboratory (Guangzhou) [GML2019ZD0602]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [61473310, 41174164, 41376184, 40976109, 41775027]",National Key Research and Development Program of China; Key Special Project for Introduced Talents Team of Southern Marine Science and Engineering Guangdong Laboratory (Guangzhou); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This research has been supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (grant no. 2016YFC1400903), the Key Special Project for Introduced Talents Team of Southern Marine Science and Engineering Guangdong Laboratory (Guangzhou) (grant no.

Higher operating temperatures of PV modules cause degradation of conversion efficiency and long-term reliability. To overcome this drawback, active or passive cooling methods using heat pipe, natural/forced air flow, forced water flow, phase change material, direct liquid immersion/submerging, and passive heat sink have been studied. In this paper, the methodologies and cooling effects of various cooling methods in the literature are summarized to provide a comprehensive overview of the current cooling technologies. Then, the performance of the radiative cooling method, which is simple and passive (zero power consumption) method, is quantitatively evaluated based on a detailed heat transfer model considering sky radiation properties in four typical climate conditions. Daily heat budgets of the PV modules with different surface emissivity spectra are simulated to estimate the solar cell temperature. The results indicate that modification of the surface emissivity spectrum hardly contribute to the radiative cooling enhancement under any climate conditions, as compared to the conventional glass cover. The present findings serve as a guide for future research and development of better cooling methods.","[Sato, Daisuke] Nagaoka Univ Technol, Dept Energy & Environm Sci, 1603-1 Kamitomioka, Nagaoka, Niigata 9402188, Japan; [Yamada, Noboru] Nagaoka Univ Technol, Dept Mech Engn, 1603-1 Kamitomioka, Nagaoka, Niigata 9402188, Japan",Nagaoka University of Technology; Nagaoka University of Technology,"Sato, D (corresponding author), Nagaoka Univ Technol, Dept Energy & Environm Sci, 1603-1 Kamitomioka, Nagaoka, Niigata 9402188, Japan.",sato_daisuke@stn.nagaokaut.ac.jp; noboru@nagaokaut.ac.jp,"Yamada, Noboru/T-7333-2019","Yamada, Noboru/0000-0003-2432-0079; Sato, Daisuke/0000-0002-9224-4701",,,,,73,77,78,21,179,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",1364-0321,,,RENEW SUST ENERG REV,Renew.

For that purpose, SSH-aerosol was developed to represent the evolution of the mass and number concentrations of primary and secondary particles, across different scales, using state-of-the-art modules, taking into account processes that are usually not considered in air-quality or climate modelling. For example, the particle mixing state and the growth of ultra-fine particles are taken into account in the aerosol dynamics, the affinity of semi-volatile organic compounds with water and viscosity are taken into account in the partitioning between the gas and particle phases of organics and the formation of extremely low-volatility organic compounds from biogenic precursors is represented. SSH-aerosol is modular and can be used with different levels of complexity. It may be used as standalone to analyse chamber measurements. It is also designed to be easily coupled to 3D models, adapting the level of complexity to the spatial scale studied.","[Sartelet, Karine; Wang, Zhizhao; Flageul, Cedric; Kim, Youngseob] CEREA, Joint Lab, Ecole Ponts ParisTech & EdF R&D, F-77455 Marne La Vallee, France; [Couvidat, Florian; Wang, Zhizhao] INERIS, Inst Natl Environm Ind & Risques, F-60550 Verneuil En Halatte, France",Ecole des Ponts ParisTech; Institut National de l'Environnement Industriel et des Risques (INERIS),"Sartelet, K (corresponding author), CEREA, Joint Lab, Ecole Ponts ParisTech & EdF R&D, F-77455 Marne La Vallee, France.",karine.sartelet@enpc.fr; florian.couvidat@ineris.fr; zhizhao.wang@enpc.fr; cedric.flageul@enpc.fr; youngseob.kim@enpc.fr,"Sartelet, Karine/AAO-4276-2020","Sartelet, Karine/0000-0002-8165-2128; WANG, Zhizhao/0000-0002-2334-6173; Kim, Youngseob/0000-0001-5963-5666",DIM QI2; Ministry of Ecology,DIM QI2; Ministry of Ecology,"The authors acknowledge funding from DIM QI2 with support from the Ile-de-France region for the internship of ZhizhaoWang, as well as funding from the Ministry of Ecology.

Throughout technological improvements, climate researchers have gradually adapted their scientific tools to study the isotope content of the impurities present in it, with the hope to gather more and better information of the Earth's shattered history. In this chapter, we present an overview of the techniques and studies which use stable isotope analysis to gain new insight. This domain has become so vast that we have limited our presentation to the recent analysis of the two major oxy-anions present in snow: sulfate and nitrate. These species are characteristic of the sulfur and nitrogen cycles. Describing the results obtained on ice without discussing the present atmosphere make little sense as ice is precisely used as a proxy for our past atmosphere. Consequently, beyond the analytical methods to measure the sulfur, nitrogen and oxygen isotopes of sulfate and nitrate, this chapter presents the results obtained at the interface between atmosphere, snow and ice with a focus on polar regions. The current state-of-the-art is presented for these two oxy-anions, including their non-mass-dependent isotope effects.","[Savarino, Joel] Univ Grenoble 1, Lab Glaciol & Geophys Environm, F-38402 St Martin Dheres, France; [Savarino, Joel; Morin, Samuel] CNRS, Inst Natl Sci Univers, Grenoble, France; [Morin, Samuel] Meteo France, CNRM GAME, Ctr Etud Neige, St Martin Dheres, France",UDICE-French Research Universities; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Meteo France,"Savarino, J (corresponding author), Univ Grenoble 1, Lab Glaciol & Geophys Environm, F-38402 St Martin Dheres, France.",jsavarino@lgge.obs.ujf-grenoble.fr,"Morin, Samuel/E-8005-2011; Savarino, Joel/H-9730-2012","Morin, Samuel/0000-0002-1781-687X; Savarino, Joel/0000-0002-6708-9623",,,,,244,8,8,1,11,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",,,978-3-642-10636-1,ADV ISOTOP GEOCHEM,,,2011,,,,,835,864,,10.1007/978-3-642-10637-8_39,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-10637-8_39,10.1007/978-3-642-10637-8,,30,Geochemistry & Geophysics,Book Citation Index – Science (BKCI-S),Geochemistry & Geophysics,BZC58,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000301099200039,View Full Record in Web of Science

Whereas traditional agricultural systems mainly rely on scarce ground-survey data, freely available multi-temporal and multi-spectral remote sensing images are excellent tools to support these vulnerable systems by accurately monitoring and estimating crop yields before harvest. In this context, we introduce the use of Sentinel-2 (S2) imagery, with a medium spatial, spectral and temporal resolutions, to estimate rice crop yields in Nepal as a case study. Firstly, we build a new large-scale rice crop database (RicePAL) composed by multi-temporal S2 and climate/soil data from the Terai districts of Nepal. Secondly, we propose a novel 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) adapted to these intrinsic data constraints for the accurate rice crop yield estimation. Thirdly, we study the effect of considering different temporal, climate and soil data configurations in terms of the performance achieved by the proposed approach and several state-of-the-art regression and CNN-based yield estimation methods. The extensive experiments conducted in this work demonstrate the suitability of the proposed CNN-based framework for rice crop yield estimation in the developing country of Nepal using S2 data.","[Fernandez-Beltran, Ruben; Pla, Filiberto] Univ Jaume 1, Inst New Imaging Technol, Castellon De La Plana 12071, Spain; [Baidar, Tina] Govt Nepal, Survey Dept, NP-44600 Kathmandu, Nepal; [Kang, Jian] Soochow Univ, Sch Elect & Informat Engn, Suzhou 215006, Peoples R China",Universitat Jaume I; Soochow University - China,"Kang, J (corresponding author), Soochow Univ, Sch Elect & Informat Engn, Suzhou 215006, Peoples R China.",rufernan@uji.es; al383661@uji.es; jiankang@suda.edu.cn; pla@uji.es,"kang, jian/V-3055-2019; Pla, Filiberto/AAD-1208-2022; Fernandez-Beltran, Ruben/GLT-5907-2022","kang, jian/0000-0001-6284-3044; Pla, Filiberto/0000-0003-0054-3489; Fernandez-Beltran, Ruben/0000-0003-1374-8416","Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities of Spain [RTI2018-098651-B-C54]; Valencian Government [GV/2020/167]","Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities of Spain(Spanish Government); Valencian Government","This work was supported by the Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities of Spain (RTI2018-098651-B-C54) and the Valencian Government (GV/2020/167).",,77,12,12,7,27,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2072-4292,,REMOTE SENS-BASEL,Remote Sens.,APR,2021,7,,,,,,1391,10.3390/rs13071391,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs13071391,,,25,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,RL2HU,,"gold, Green Published",,,12/21/22,WOS:000638801500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Ten studies entered final analysis [HIV/AIDs (5), climate change (1), sexual health (3), and croup (1)]. ST techniques included digital ST (DST), written ST, verbal ST, and use of professional writers. Of the ten studies, seven used ST to change KAB/P; the remainder used ST to extract insights. Follow-up and evaluation were very limited.Conclusion: ST reveals insights and serves as an intervention in public health. Benefits of ST largely outweigh the limitations, but more follow-up/evaluation is needed.

Estimates of oceanic flow are currently made on the basis of space-borne measurements of the sea surface, and monitoring of the ocean interior. Satellite altimetry and acoustic tomography are complementary for this purpose(1), as the former provides detailed horizontal coverage of the surface, and the latter the requisite vertical sampling of the interior. High-quality acoustic-tomographic(2) and altimetric(3) data are now available to test the combined power of these technologies for estimating oceanic flows. Here we demonstrate that, with the aid of state-of-the-art numerical models, it is possible to recover from these data a detailed spatio-temporal record of flow over basin-scale volumes of fluid.

Accurate forecasting of such events relies on the understanding of the spatiotemporal evolution processes in climate system. Learning from climate science data has been a challenging task, because the variations among spatial, temporal and multivariate spaces have created a huge amount of features and complex regularities within the data. In this study we developed a framework for learning patterns from the spatiotemporal system and forecasting extreme weather events. In this framework, we learned patterns in a hierarchical manner: in each level, new features were learned from data and used as the input for the next level. Firstly, we summarized the temporal evolution process of individual variables by learning the location-based patterns. Secondly, we developed an optimization algorithm for summarizing the spatial regularities, SCOT, by growing spatial clusters from the location-based patterns. Finally, we developed an instance-based algorithm, SPC, to forecast the extreme events through classification. We applied this framework to forecasting extreme rainfall events in the eastern Central Andes area. Our experiments show that this method was able to find climatic process patterns similar to those found in domain studies, and our forecasting results outperformed the state-of-art model.","[Wang, Dawei; Ding, Wei] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Comp Sci, Boston, MA 02125 USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Boston,"Ding, W (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Dept Comp Sci, Boston, MA 02125 USA.",dawei.wang@umb.edu; wei.ding@umb.edu,,"Ding, Wei/0000-0002-3383-551X",,,,,22,12,13,0,3,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",1550-4786,,978-1-4673-9503-8,IEEE DATA MINING,,,2015,,,,,1021,1026,,10.1109/ICDM.2015.93,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICDM.2015.93,,,6,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Information Systems",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BF3GO,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000380541000126,View Full Record in Web of Science

Different groups of hunter-gatherers dwelt in this place since the Late Pleistocene until Late Holocene, leaving many vestiges of their passage. Charcoal samples from its upper archaeological assemblage, at Sector West of the site (dated c. 2000-3500 BP), and from its intermediate archaeological assemblage, at Sector East (dated c. 9000-10000 BP), were analyzed according to standard anthracological methods. Samples of dispersed charcoal from four archaeological levels were analyzed in the former, and from eight combustion structures in the latter. Despite the heterogeneity in the assemblages, interesting palaeoenvironmental and palaeoethnobotanical results were produced. During the late Holocene the shelter was surrounded by a semideciduous forest similar to the present one, under similar climate. Similar conditions might have occurred in the early Holocene, or the vegetation could have been a more open cerrado physiognomy, thus under a drier climate. Firewood gathering strategies in both periods involved the opportunistic collection of dead wood. Evidence of firewood selection is presented for bamboo in the late Holocene and for Anadenanthera in the early and in late Holocene. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

The protected agriculture has given many advantages for the care and improvement in the production of almost any food. This work is focused on improving a control system for climate variables. The decision for activating an actuator for the correct care of the crop is very important. A sorting network technique with predefined compare-interchange operations and designed to order data very efficiently is proposed. This approach has been applied to the process of handling actuators within a control system. An advantage of using the sorting networks is that it has an inflexibility when processing a data list; it always takes the same units of time and is executed in the same number of operations for an input size of n. Sorting network-based applications are scarce in the state-of-the-art because there are not many techniques that are effective for sorting very small data sizes.

We aimed to improve the understanding of the degree to which large-scale versus local environmental dynamics regulate phytoplankton dynamics by analyzing time series at the Baltic Sea scale. We used dynamic factor analysis to study if there are common patterns of interannual variation that are shared (common trends) among summer phytoplankton total and class-level biomass time series observed across Baltic Sea latitudinal gradients in salinity and temperature. We evaluated alternative hypotheses regarding common trends among summer phytoplankton biomass: Baltic Sea-wide common trends; common trends by geography (latitude and basin); common trends differing among functional groups (phytoplankton classes); or common trends driven by both geography and functional group. Our results indicated little support for a common trend in total summer phytoplankton biomass. At a finer resolution, classes had common trends that were most closely associated with the cryptophyte and cyanobacteria time series with patterns that differed between northern and southern sampling stations. These common trends were also very sensitive to two anomalous years (1990, 2008) of cryptophyte biomass. The Baltic Sea Index, a regional climate index, was correlated with two common class trends that shifted in mean state around the mid-1990s. The limited coherence in phytoplankton biomass variation over time despite known, large-scale, ecosystem shifts suggests that stochastic dynamics at local scales limits the ability to observe common trends at the scale of monitoring data collection.","[Griffiths, Jennifer R.; Winder, Monika] Stockholm Univ, Dept Ecol, Environm, Plant Sci, Stockholm, Sweden; [Lehtinen, Sirpa; Suikkanen, Sanna] Marine Res Ctr, Finnish Environm Inst, Helsinki, Finland",Stockholm University; Finnish Environment Institute,"Winder, M (corresponding author), Stockholm Univ, Dept Ecol, Environm, Plant Sci, Stockholm, Sweden.",monika.winder@su.se,,"Winder, Monika/0000-0001-9467-3035; Suikkanen, Sanna/0000-0002-0768-8149; Lehtinen, Sirpa/0000-0001-7784-8497",Stockholm University Postdoctoral Fellowship; BONUS (Art 185) - EU; BONUS (Art 185) - Swedish Research Council FORMAS,Stockholm University Postdoctoral Fellowship; BONUS (Art 185) - EU; BONUS (Art 185) - Swedish Research Council FORMAS(Swedish Research Council Formas),"JRG received funding from a Stockholm University Postdoctoral Fellowship.

Given that main fraction of energy consumption in buildings operation is due to HVAC systems, advances in its design and operation conditions are required. One key element for energy demand control is passive design of buildings. On this purpose, different recent studies and publications analyse natural ventilation systems potential to provide indoor air quality and comfort conditions minimizing electric power consumption. In these passive systems are of special relevance their capacities as passive cooling systems as well as air renovation systems, especially in high-density occupied spaces. With adequate designs, in warm/mild climates natural ventilation systems can be used along the whole year, maintaining indoor air quality and comfort conditions with small support of other heating/cooling systems. In this paper is analysed the state of the art of natural ventilation systems applied to high density occupied spaces with special focus on school buildings. The paper shows the potential and applicability of these systems for energy savings and discusses main criteria for their adequate integration in school building designs.","[Gil-Baez, Maite; Barrios-Padura, Angela; Molina-Huelva, Marta; Chacartegui, Ricardo] Univ Seville, Avda Reina Mercedes 2, E-41012 Seville, Spain",University of Sevilla,"Gil-Baez, M (corresponding author), Univ Seville, Avda Reina Mercedes 2, E-41012 Seville, Spain.",,"Huelva, Marta Molina/G-4437-2013; Chacartegui, Ricardo/F-2647-2016; Barrios-Padura, Angela/M-2763-2014","Huelva, Marta Molina/0000-0002-6402-2327; Chacartegui, Ricardo/0000-0001-7285-8661; Barrios-Padura, Angela/0000-0003-1054-010X",European Regional Development Funds [SOE1/P3/P0429EU]; Andalusian Government; APAE secondary schools,European Regional Development Funds(European Commission); Andalusian Government; APAE secondary schools,"This study has been performed as part of the ClimACT project (SOE1/P3/P0429EU) within the Interreg Sudoe Programme, funded by European Regional Development Funds.

Besides obvious mechanical influencing quantities, a main concern is the detection of climate induced damages. Changes in the relative humidity cause inner strain, which may lead to defect formations and damages. White light fringe projection was applied to detect object changes due to variations of the relative humidity. First measurements indicated a sensitivity down to a relative humidity change of 6 %.

We performed a systematic review about active revegetation after mining and identified 203 relevant studies. Most studies were performed in the USA (34%), in regions with a temperate climate (59%) and in abandoned coal mines (45%). The studies were focused on the plantation of woody species (59%) or sowing of herbaceous species (39%). The most widely evaluated treatments were the addition of amendments (24%) and fertilizers (21%), mainly with positive and neutral effects; in general, organic amendments presented more positive effects than inorganic amendments and fertilizers. We also identified studies on the effects of plowing, inoculation of microorganisms, nurse plants, herbivore exclusion and watering. The results of these treatments should be taken with caution, because they can vary according to the functional strategies of the introduced species and the local context, such as the degree of nutrient limitation in the mining area and abiotic conditions. Further research is needed in non-temperate climates, involving long-term monitoring and with detailed descriptions of the interventions to better interpret results and general implications of active revegetation of mining areas.","[Navarro-Ramos, Silvia E.; Sparacino, Javier; Rodriguez, Juan M.; Filippini, Edith; Marsal-Castillo, Benjamin E.; Garcia-Cannata, Leandro; Renison, Daniel; Torres, Romina C.] Univ Nacl Cordoba, Fac Ciencias Exactas Fis & Nat, Ctr Ecol & Recursos Nat Renovables, Ave Velez Sarsfield 1611, RA-5016 Cordoba, Argentina; [Navarro-Ramos, Silvia E.; Rodriguez, Juan M.; Filippini, Edith; Garcia-Cannata, Leandro; Renison, Daniel; Torres, Romina C.] IIByT CONICET Univ Nacl Cordoba, Inst Invest Biol & Tecnol, Ave Velez Sarsfield 1611, RA-5016 Cordoba, Argentina; [Sparacino, Javier; Rodriguez, Juan M.; Renison, Daniel; Torres, Romina C.] NGO Ecosistemas Argentinos, 27 Abril, RA-2050 Cordoba, Argentina; [Marsal-Castillo, Benjamin E.] IDEA CONICET Univ Nacl Cordoba, Inst Divers & Ecol Anim, Ave Velez Sarsfield 299, RA-5000 Cordoba, Argentina",National University of Cordoba,"Navarro-Ramos, SE (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Cordoba, Fac Ciencias Exactas Fis & Nat, Ctr Ecol & Recursos Nat Renovables, Ave Velez Sarsfield 1611, RA-5016 Cordoba, Argentina.;Navarro-Ramos, SE (corresponding author), IIByT CONICET Univ Nacl Cordoba, Inst Invest Biol & Tecnol, Ave Velez Sarsfield 1611, RA-5016 Cordoba, Argentina.",silnara134@gmail.com,,"Sparacino, Javier/0000-0003-4059-4117; Renison, Daniel/0000-0002-1817-6552; Marsal Castillo, Benjamin E./0000-0001-6576-3621; Torres, Romina C./0000-0002-4755-4428; Rodriguez, Juan Manuel/0000-0002-2638-8467",M.

These years the model has been successfully optimized on a wide variety of clustered compute nodes connected with high speed interconnects. This is currently the most used hardware architecture for high-performance computing (Shainer et al., 2009). As such, understanding the influence of hardware like the CPU, its interconnects, or the software on WRFs performance is crucial for saving computing time. This is important because computing time in general is rare, resource intensive, and hence very expensive. This paper evaluates the influence of different compilers on WRFs performance, which was found to differ up to 26%. The paper also evaluates the performance of different Message Passing Interface library versions, a software which is needed for multi CPU runs, and of different WRF versions. Both showed no significant influence on the performance for this test case on the used High Performance Cluster (HPC) hardware. Emphasis is also laid on the applied non-standard method of performance measuring, which was required because of performance fluctuations between identical runs on the used HPC.

To a large extent, although not limited to it, this is due to their energy consumption; in the EU this accounts for some 40% of the total final energy consumption. The EU therefore set a goal to reduce energy use by 20% by 2020, as part of the five headline targets of the European 20-20-20 Strategy. The goal was risen to 27% by 2030, as part of the new and more ambitious goals that were presented in 2018. Moreover, the European Commission has established since 2002 a common policy for sustainable buildings and low environmental impact materials, promoting energy efficiency and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), expressed by means of a series of directives and regulations. The legislative framework for GHG emissions is supported by a series of international standards such as the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Initiative and the ISO 14064-65 series of standards which are fully compatible with the GHG Protocol and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The Directive 2012/27/EU on Energy Efficiency is also important to mention, as it introduces obligatory Energy Audits in companies and organizations, as a major tool towards improving efficiency and promoting sustainability. Goal of the paper is to present and analyse the results of the integrated evaluation based on the energy and environmental audit of a very interesting public building, namely the Onassis Cultural Centre, in Athens, Greece. The building presented a real challenge with its daring architecture, the variety of uses it hosts and the state of the art equipment it features. Based on the audit's outcome, the analysis the carbon footprint indicator was performed. The methodology followed will be presented in the paper, along with the opportunities we detected for improvements in the energy and environmental management, which was admittedly already at a very high level. From a scientific point it was very interesting to understand the patterns of energy use and to define the processes which contribute to more energy efficient and sustainable buildings, ensuring the low ecological footprint that is definitely part of integrated design of buildings. Finally, effective energy conservation and low carbon measures for public buildings are introduced and related to operating and production costs for buildings, making them hence more competitive.","[Giama, Effrosyni; Manoloudis, Athanasios; Papadopoulos, Agis M.] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Mech Engn, Proc Equipment Design Lab, Thessaloniki, Greece",Aristotle University of Thessaloniki,"Giama, E (corresponding author), Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Mech Engn, Proc Equipment Design Lab, Thessaloniki, Greece.",fgiama@auth.gr,"Papadopoulos, Agis/AAO-3274-2021; GammaIotaAlphaMuAlpha, EpsilonUpsilonPhiRhoOmicronSigmaUpsilonNuEta/AAO-3254-2021",,,,,,8,0,0,1,6,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1755-1307,,,IOP C SER EARTH ENV,IOP Conf.

In Europe, the total primary energy consumption attained the level of 1.3 ExaJoules in 2003. The pulp and paper industry, including recycling processes, also produces energy, as well as by-products that can be used for energy generation. It already generates enough to cover approximately 50% of its own energy needs. A significant share of this energy is renewable CO2 neutral biomass. Energy costs, energy supply and climate change are other important issues impacting the future of the forest-based industry. They will have impacts on the manufacturing costs, as well as on the allocation of investments around the globe. It seems, however, that at an industrial level crucial knowledge on the state-of-the-art is still missing. The chain of the energetic sector very often lacks a correct management strategy and, therefore, it is not optimally efficient.

It attracts attention because it is one of the rare translations of Winckelman into Serbian and is interesting because it has no title, no closer allusions about the source and no information on the translator. The authorial principles are no different from other attempts to translate Winckelman into Serbian both in the 19(th) and in the 20(th) centuries. Although it briefly pointed to many new subjects in the Serbian artistic literature of the time (the relationship of the artist, the piece and the observer, the evaluation), the text showed no serious knowledge of Winckelman's work on the side of the translator, no clear publisher's intention, no persistence of preparation and no respect for the original. It was just one paragraph which, at a first glance, left the impression of a slightly longer aphorism. The source can easily be identified as Winckelman's text Erinerung uber die Betrachtung der Werke der Kunst from 1759. The word for word analysis of the source and the translation leads us to conclude that the Serbian translation from 1848 is an abbreviated, concise and simplified version of Winckelman's article on the observation of artistic pieces, which does not transfer most of the content and meaning of the original text and can, therefore, sooner be called an adaptation than translation. The cause of such great difference between the original and the translation (adaptation) lies in the history of text creation, but also in the intellectual climate and essential differences between Winckelman's way of thinking about art, expressed in his texts during the 18(th) century, and the state of affairs in the Serbian theory of art one hundred years later. Winckelman built his theory completely dedicating his life to science and interpretation of art, relying on the contemplation and learning, working systematically and intensely in the course of ten years. Serbian authors wrote about art in addition to their main educational, historic, artistic, linguistic, religious and other topics, relying on experience and feelings for art and certain interests, working without establishing connections for a long time in an unconnected manner for almost a hundred years until they built their version of the history of art. Then they turned towards Winckelman's texts which in the meantime became theoretically obsolete and could be used only as a source of practical and anecdotal sections and of concise thoughts which became aphorisms about art.",,,,,,,,,,,28,0,0,0,0,MATICA SRPSKA,NOVI SAD,"MATICE SRPSKE 1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",0352-6844,,,ZB MATICE SRP LIKOVN,Zb.

Moreover, GOOS can be seen as a decision support system and a management tool for ocean governance. Sustainability is a key concept in international, national and local policy-making for the coming decades. However, the concept is also highly normative, value loaded, and subject to many interpretations. Yet, the various definitions have in common that they emphasise the need to address human development and environmental imperatives simultaneously.

A comprehensive comparison of low-latitude waves is presented for the December-January-February period using high-frequency data from nine GCMs participating in the GCM Reality Intercomparison Project for Stratospheric Processes and Their Role in Climate (GRIPS; SPARC). Quantitative measures of the wavenumber-frequency structure of resolved waves and their impacts on the zonal mean circulation are given. Space-time spectral analysis reveals that the wave spectrum throughout the middle atmosphere is linked to the variability of convective precipitation, which is determined by the parameterized convection. The variability of the precipitation spectrum differs by more than an order of magnitude among the models, with additional changes in the spectral distribution (especially the frequency). These differences can be explained primarily by the choice of different cumulus parameterizations: quasi-equilibrium mass-flux schemes tend to produce small variability, while the moist-convective adjustment scheme is the most active. Comparison with observational estimates of precipitation variability suggests that the model values are scattered around the observational estimates. Among the models, only those that produce the largest precipitation variability can reproduce the equatorial quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO). This implies that in the real atmosphere, the forcing from the waves, which are resolvable with the typical resolutions of present-day GCMs, is insufficient to drive the QBO. Parameterized cumulus convection also impacts the nonmigrating tides in the equatorial region. In most of the models, momentum transport by diurnal nonmigrating tides in the mesosphere is comparable to or larger than that by planetary-scale Kelvin waves, being more significant than has been thought. It is shown that the westerly accelerations in the equatorial semi-annual oscillation in the models examined are driven mainly by gravity waves with periods shorter than 3 days, with some contribution from parameterized gravity waves, and that the contribution from the wavenumber-1 Kelvin waves is negligible. These results provide a state-of-the-art assessment of the links between convective parameterizations and middle-atmospheric waves in present-day middle-atmosphere climate models.","Kyoto Univ, Radio Sci Ctr Space & Atmosphere, Uji 6110011, Japan; NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Data Assimilat Off, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; Univ Maryland Baltimore Cty, Goddard Earth Sci & Technol Ctr, Baltimore, MD 21228 USA; Meteorol Res Inst, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305, Japan; Free Univ Berlin, D-1000 Berlin, Germany; Max Planck Inst Meteorol, Hamburg, Germany; Inst Nazl Geofis & Vulcanol, Bologna, Italy; NCAR, Boulder, CO USA; GFDL, Princeton, NJ USA; Univ Hawaii Manoa, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; York Univ, Toronto, ON M3J 2R7, Canada; Met Off, Bracknell, Berks, England",Kyoto University; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland Baltimore County; Meteorological Research Institute - Japan; Free University of Berlin; Max Planck Society; Istituto Nazionale Geofisica e Vulcanologia (INGV); National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; York University - Canada; Met Office - UK,"Horinouchi, T (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Radio Sci Ctr Space & Atmosphere, Uji 6110011, Japan.",horinout@kurasc.kyoto-u.ac.jp,"Pawson, Steven/I-1865-2014; Manzini, Elisa/H-5760-2011; Horinouchi, Takeshi/K-8535-2012","Pawson, Steven/0000-0003-0200-717X; Horinouchi, Takeshi/0000-0002-2296-1975; Hamilton, Kevin/0000-0002-3560-8097; Sassi, Fabrizio/0000-0002-9492-7434",,,,,60,88,88,0,21,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0022-4928,1520-0469,,J ATMOS SCI,J.

If the stratospheric QBO systematically (and significantly) affects the tropospheric circulation, it potentially provides a predictable signal useful for seasonal forecasting. The stratospheric QBO itself is generally not well represented in current numerical models, however, including those used for seasonal prediction and this potential may not be exploited by current numerical-model based forecast systems. The purpose of the present study is to ascertain if a knowledge of the state of the QBO can contribute to extratropical boreal winter seasonal forecast skill and, if so, to motivate further research in this area. The investigation is in the context of the second Historical Forecasting Project (HFP2), a state-of-the-art multimodel two-tier ensemble seasonal forecasting system. The first tier, consisting of a prediction of sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTAs), is followed by the second tier which is a prediction of the state of the atmosphere and surface using an AGCM initialized from atmospheric analyses and using the predicted SSTs as boundary conditions. The HFP2 forecasts are successful in capturing the extratropical effects of sea surface temperature anomalies in the equatorial Pacific to the extent that a linear statistical correction based on the NINO3.4 index does not provide additional extratropical skill. By contrast, knowledge of the state of the stratospheric QBO can be used statistically to add extratropical skill centred in the region of the North Atlantic Oscillation. Although the additional skill is modest, the result supports the contention that taking account of the QBO could improve extratropical seasonal forecasting skill. This might be done statistically after the fact, by forcing the QBO state into the forecast model as it runs or, preferably, by using models which correctly represent the physical processes and behaviour of the QBO.","[Boer, G.

Duchamp selected Argentina because of its remoteness, deliberately removing himself from the artistic and political climates of Paris and New York. While in Buenos Aires Duchamp worked on the Large Glass, among other pieces, and did not involve himself with the local intellectual community, but rather spent most of his time playing chess. Duchamp refers to the place of travel in his work as a spirit of expatriation and his production in Argentina is characterized by an aesthetic of dislocation. His voyage of self-exile culminated in his Unhappy Readymade, in which he instructed his sister Suzanne and her husband Jean Crotti to hang a geometry textbook from their balcony in Paris and document the book's deterioration. This transnational readymade denies the presence of the artist as creator, pushing the boundaries of reproducibility beyond Duchamp's previous readymades, which imbued found objects with artistic value. While the Unhappy Readymade intentionally negates the art object, it also displaces Argentina, paradoxically incorporating the country into the European avant-garde circuit through this negation.",,,,,,,,,,,43,0,0,0,0,EDITIONS RODOPI B V,AMSTERDAM,"TIJNMUIDEN 7, 1046 AK AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1387-3008,,978-90-420-3160-9,AVANT-GARDE CRIT STU,,,2010,,,,,77,93,,,,,,17,Art; Literary Theory & Criticism,Book Citation Index – Social Sciences & Humanities (BKCI-SSH),Art; Literature,BWG78,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000293860800005,View Full Record in Web of Science

This activity became feasible also thanks to the increasing availability of long time series of high-quality in situ and remotely-sensed observations. Retrospective analyses (or simply reanalyses or ocean syntheses), indeed combine quality controlled reprocessed ocean observations with a state-of-the-art ocean general circulation model (OGCM) using data assimilation methods to estimate the time-varying, three-dimensional state of the ocean. Ocean reanalyses benefit from data assimilation algorithms that are usually inherited from operational oceanography, although they require specific treatment in order to avoid spurious drifts stemming from instrumental or model biases. Unlike observation-only products, ocean reanalyses take advantage of time-varying atmospheric forcing, usually coming from an atmospheric reanalysis, and dynamical and physical balances implied by the OGCM. Here we give an excursus on the availability of global and regional ocean reanalyses, their applications, their strengths and weaknesses, and their future developments foreseen at the present time.","[Masina, Simona; Storto, Andrea] Fdn Ctr Euromediterraneo Cambiamenti Climatici CM, I-40127 Bologna, Italy; [Masina, Simona] Ist Nazl Geofis & Vulcanol, Sez Bologna, I-40128 Bologna, Italy",Istituto Nazionale Geofisica e Vulcanologia (INGV),"Masina, S (corresponding author), Fdn Ctr Euromediterraneo Cambiamenti Climatici CM, I-40127 Bologna, Italy.;Masina, S (corresponding author), Ist Nazl Geofis & Vulcanol, Sez Bologna, I-40128 Bologna, Italy.",simona.masina@ingv.it,"Storto, Andrea/AAH-3823-2019","Storto, Andrea/0000-0003-3856-8905; MASINA, Simona/0000-0001-6273-7065",,,,,141,7,7,0,4,SEARS FOUNDATION MARINE RESEARCH,NEW HAVEN,"YALE UNIV, KLINE GEOLOGY LAB, 210 WHITNEY AVENUE, NEW HAVEN, CT 06520-8109 USA",0022-2402,1543-9542,,J MAR RES,J.

ET can be limited by energy or water availability. The transition between water- and energy-limited regimes is marked by the critical soil moisture (CSM), which is traditionally derived from small-sample laboratory analyses. Here, we aim to determine the CSM at a larger spatial scale relevant for climate modeling, using state-of-the-art gridded data sets. For this purpose, we introduce a new correlation-difference metric with which the CSM can be accurately inferred using multiple data streams. We perform such an analysis at the continental scale and determine a large-scale CSM as an emergent property. In addition, we determine small-scale CSMs at the grid cell scale and find substantial spatial variability. Consistently from both analyses we find that soil texture, climate conditions, and vegetation characteristics are influencing the CSM, with similar respective importance. In contrast, comparable CSMs are found when applying alternative large-scale energy and vegetation data sets, highlighting the robustness of our results.

However, when solving large-scale weather prediction simulations, state-of-the-art CPU and GPU implementations suffer from limited performance and high energy consumption. These implementations are dominated by complex irregular memory access patterns and low arithmetic intensity that pose fundamental challenges to acceleration. To overcome these challenges, we propose and evaluate the use of near-memory acceleration using a reconfigurable fabric with high-bandwidth memory (HBM). We focus on compound stencils that are fundamental kernels in weather prediction models. By using high-level synthesis techniques, we develop NERO, an FPGA+HBM-based accelerator connected through IBM CAPI2 (Coherent Accelerator Processor Interface) to an IBM POWER9 host system. Our experimental results show that NERO outperforms a 16-core POWER9 system by 4.2x and 8.3x when running two different compound stencil kernels. NERO reduces the energy consumption by 22x and 29x for the same two kernels over the POWER9 system with an energy efficiency of 1.5 GFLOPS/Watt and 17.3 GFLOPS/Watt. We conclude that employing near-memory acceleration solutions for weather prediction modeling is promising as a means to achieve both high performance and high energy efficiency.","[Singh, Gagandeep; Stuijk, Sander; Corporaal, Henk] Eindhoven Univ Technol, Eindhoven, Netherlands; [Singh, Gagandeep; Gomez-Luna, Juan; Mutlu, Onur] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Zurich, Switzerland; [Singh, Gagandeep; Diamantopoulos, Dionysios; Hagleitner, Christoph] IBM Res Europe, Zurich, Switzerland",Eindhoven University of Technology; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Singh, G (corresponding author), Eindhoven Univ Technol, Eindhoven, Netherlands.;Singh, G (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Zurich, Switzerland.;Singh, G (corresponding author), IBM Res Europe, Zurich, Switzerland.",,"Hagleitner, Christoph/A-7498-2012","Stuijk, Sander/0000-0002-2518-6847",European Commission under Marie Sklodowska-Curie Innovative Training Networks European Industrial Doctorate [676240]; H2020 research and innovation programme [732631]; Google; Huawei; Intel; Microsoft; SRC; VMware,European Commission under Marie Sklodowska-Curie Innovative Training Networks European Industrial Doctorate; H2020 research and innovation programme; Google(Google Incorporated); Huawei(Huawei Technologies); Intel(Intel Corporation); Microsoft(Microsoft); SRC; VMware,"This work was performed in the framework of the Horizon 2020 program for the project Near-Memory Computing (NeMeCo).

Watersheds and coasts were traditionally regarded as two separate areas with a contact point in which the output of the watershed constitutes the input of the coastal area. However, the open literature of the last two decades recognized the importance of adopting a holistic perspective in the analysis of these two systems. Such a point of view is so consolidated that nowadays the whole body is designated as the Watershed-Coast continuum (WCC). Despite the fact that this is a consolidated and recognized concept, there are still limited holistic observations. In this review article, we summarize the main findings of the researches on the WCC. Specifically, we provide a state-of-the-art of the researches focusing on the identification of morphological evolutionary trends that are relevant to civil engineering applications by distinguishing three kinds of works: monitoring studies; modelling studies; and monitoring of anthropogenic actions. This article emphasizes the need of developing adequate methodologies for describing the WCC dynamics and suggests planning future monitoring activities by adopting a global perspective.","[Malara, Giovanni; Arena, Felice] Mediterranea Univ Reggio Calabria, NOEL, I-89122 Reggio Di Calabria, Italy; [Zema, Demetrio Antonio; Bombino, Giuseppe; Zimbone, Santo Marcello] Mediterranea Univ Reggio Calabria, Dept AGR, I-89122 Reggio Di Calabria, Italy",Universita Mediterranea di Reggio Calabria; Universita Mediterranea di Reggio Calabria,"Zema, DA (corresponding author), Mediterranea Univ Reggio Calabria, Dept AGR, I-89122 Reggio Di Calabria, Italy.",dzema@unirc.it,"Zema, Demetrio/K-4327-2017; Malara, Giovanni/AAF-5597-2021; Bombino, Giuseppe/AAR-4485-2020","Zema, Demetrio/0000-0002-5743-3996; Malara, Giovanni/0000-0002-8761-4528; ",,,,,78,5,5,2,19,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0012-8252,1872-6828,,EARTH-SCI REV,Earth-Sci.

As the urbanization expands, and the green spaces diminish, the heat islands begin to emerge. An old technique used during the past centuries-in both hot and dry climates of the central cities of Iran-was the moderation of microclimates via water and plants. With a diachronic approach to the study of the historical Chahar Bagh Street in Isfahan, this paper investigates the impact of the structural changes on its microclimate in three different scenarios, i.e., the street with its features during the Safavid Era (from 1501 to 1736); the street in its current status; and finally a probable critical condition resulting from complete elimination of natural elements from the environment. The mixed strategy used in this study relies on logical reasoning and software-assisted evaluation for comparing the three scenarios. The predicted mean vote (PMV) model was used for measuring thermal comfort. The results indicate that the evaluated comfort-providing area in the Safavid scenario is 7-17 times more favorable than the others. Moreover, the temperature in the contemporary era was found to be 1.5 degrees Celsius cooler than that of the critical status scenario.","[Habibi, Kyoumars] Univ Kurdistan, Fac Art & Architecture, Dept Urban Planning & Design, Sanandaj 6617715175, Iran; [Hoseini, Seyedeh Maryam] Iran Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Art & Architecture, Dept Urban Planning & Design, Tehran 1684613114, Iran; [Dehshti, Majid] Shahab Danesh Univ, Fac Art & Architecture, Dept Urban Planning & Design, Qom 3711687764, Iran; [Khanian, Mojtaba] Islamic Azad Univ, Hamedan Branch, Young Researchers & Elite Club, Hamadan 6518764811, Hamadan, Iran; [Mosavi, Amir] Tech Univ Dresden, Fac Civil Engn, D-01069 Dresden, Germany; [Mosavi, Amir] Duy Tan Univ, Inst Res & Dev, Da Nang 550000, Vietnam; [Mosavi, Amir] J Selye Univ, Dept Informat, Komarno 94501, Slovakia",University of Kurdistan; Iran University Science & Technology; Islamic Azad University; Technische Universitat Dresden; Duy Tan University; J.

One foreseeable consequence of such restrictions is that the user can save only a small fraction of complex simulation data to disk for subsequent analysis. An alternative is to fit statistical models to data in situ, that is, inside the simulation as it runs. This option requires extremely fast statistical estimation to avoid slowing down the simulation. Gaussian processes (GPs) have state-of-the-art predictive performance for modeling spatial data. However, standard estimation methods for GPs scale quite poorly to large data sets as parameter estimation requires inverting a covariance matrix to the size of the data set. In the presented work, we use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict the GP parameters for a spatial data set, from a simulation or otherwise, rather than optimize the parameters directly. Our presented case study models spatial data from E3SM, the Department of Energy's Exascale climate model. The CNN is trained on synthetic data simulated from GP models with known parameters and then applied to data from the climate simulation. In the presented examples, the neural network scheme produces parameter estimates that compare well with standard methods such as maximum likelihood estimation in predictive performance but is obtained four orders of magnitude faster.","[Banesh, Divya; Panda, Nishant; Biswas, Ayan; Van Roekel, Luke; Oyen, Diane; Grosskopf, Michael; Wolfe, Jonathan; Lawrence, Earl] Los Alamos Natl Lab, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA; [Urban, Nathan] Brookhaven Natl Lab, Upton, NY 11973 USA",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Los Alamos National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Brookhaven National Laboratory,"Banesh, D (corresponding author), Los Alamos Natl Lab, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA.",,,"Grosskopf, Michael/0000-0002-7838-3609; Panda, Nishant/0000-0001-9754-2794",Laboratory Directed Research and Development program of Los Alamos National Laboratory [20200065DR],Laboratory Directed Research and Development program of Los Alamos National Laboratory,Research presented in this paper was supported by the Laboratory Directed Research and Development program of Los Alamos National Laboratory under project number 20200065DR.

The standard simplified joint probability approach used in England and Wales can result in an underestimation of flood risk unless correction factors are applied. This paper describes the application of a state-of-the-art multivariate extreme value model to offshore winds, waves and sea levels around the coast of England. The methodology overcomes the limitations of the traditional method. The output of the new statistical analysis is a Monte-Carlo (MC) simulation comprising many thousands of offshore extreme events and it is necessary to translate all of these events into overtopping rates for use as input to flood risk assessments. It is computationally impractical to transform all of these MC events from the offshore to the nearshore. Computationally efficient statistical emulators of the SWAN wave transformation model have therefore been constructed. The emulators translate the thousands of MC events offshore. Whilst the methodology has been applied for national flood risk assessment, it has the potential to be implemented for wider use, including climate change impact assessment, nearshore wave climates for detailed local assessments and coastal flood forecasting.","[Gouldby, Ben; Wyncoll, David; Panzeri, Mike; Tozer, Nigel; Hames, Dominic; Pullen, Tim; Hawkes, Peter] HR Wallingford Ltd, Benson Lane, Wallingford, Oxon, England; [Franklin, Mark; Hunt, Tim; Dornbusch, Uwe] Environm Agcy, Ergon House,Horseferry Rd, London, England",HR Wallingford Limited,"Gouldby, B (corresponding author), HR Wallingford Ltd, Benson Lane, Wallingford, Oxon, England.",b.gouldby@hrwallingford.com,"Dornbusch, Uwe/I-3870-2019","Dornbusch, Uwe/0000-0002-7299-7220",,,,,18,0,0,0,4,E D P SCIENCES,CEDEX A,"17 AVE DU HOGGAR PARC D ACTIVITES COUTABOEUF BP 112, F-91944 CEDEX A, FRANCE",2267-1242,,,E3S WEB CONF,,,2016,,,,,,,1007,10.1051/e3sconf/20160701007,http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/20160701007,,,6,"Engineering, Environmental; Engineering, Civil; Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Regional & Urban Planning; Water Resources",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Public Administration; Water Resources,BG8GU,,"Green Published, Green Submitted, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000392270100007,View Full Record in Web of Science

PIC has financed a research project conducted by the Coastal and Air Pollution Program's research staff at the Kuwait Institute for Scientific Research to assess the impact of pollution control strategies implemented to maintain a healthy productive environment in and around the manufacturing premises. The project was completed in three phases: the first phase included the pollution monitoring of the melting and prilling units in full operation, the second phase covered the complete shutdown period where production was halted completely and granulation units were installed, and the last phase encompassed the current modified status with granulation units in full operation. There was substantial decrease in ammonia emissions, about 72%, and a 52.7% decrease in urea emissions with the present upgrading of old melting and prilling units to a state-of-the-art technology granulation process for a final finished product. The other pollutants, sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), have not shown any significant change, as the present modification has not affected the sources of these pollutants. Implications: Petrochemical Industries Company (PIC) in Kuwait has ammonia urea industries, and there were complaints about ammonia and urea dust pollution. PIC has resolved this problem by replacing melting and prilling unit of final product urea prills by more environmentally friendly granulation unit. Environmental Pollution and Climate Program has been assigned the duty of assessing the outcome of this change and how that influenced ammonia and urea dust emissions from the urea manufacturing plant.","[Khan, A.

The key step in the provision of required tools for the society to tackle the complex air quality problem is to characterize it in a comprehensive manner with a long-term perspective. Here, we describe a continuous and comprehensive observation station and its accompanying state-of-the-art instrumentation that was established to investigate the complex urban atmospheric environment in a rapidly developing Chinese Megacity. The station, located in downtown Beijing, aims to study air quality by identifying the major atmospheric pollutants and key processes determining their formation and loss mechanisms. A few hundreds of parameters are continuously measured with the state-of-the-art instruments, including trace gas concentrations, aerosol particle size distributions, and mass concentrations, covering aerosol particle chemical composition from molecules to micrometer-sized aerosol particles. This produced long-term, comprehensive big data with around 1 x 10 11 bytes per year. In this paper, we provide an overview on the facilities of the station, the instrumentation used, the workflow of continuous observations and examples of results from 2018 to 2019 and a basis for establishing a modern long-term, comprehensive atmospheric urban observation station in other megacities.","[Liu, Yongchun;

Solid biomass can constitute an alternative to fossil fuels as a renewable and carbon-neutral source of energy but there are some aspects to biomass combustion in small-scale domestic appliances that can compromise the environmental sustainability of this renewable energy source in terms of burden on air quality. The priority pollutants in this respect are particulate matter and nitrogen oxides. While particulate matter emissions are often discussed, nitrogen oxides emissions from domestic heating appliances are relatively less in the center of attention. The aim of the present study is to review the literature regarding the nitrogen oxides emissions from this emission source discussing the main formation mechanisms and the state-of-the-art control techniques, as well as the influence of fuel composition (especially fuel bound nitrogen), heating appliance type and operating conditions with the help of the gathered experimental emission factors data. The review crosslinks several aspects usually treated separately in scientific papers (e.g., only laboratory tests with basic theory or only field tests on emission levels etc.), providing thus a quick reference tool to the state-of-the-art knowledge on this topic.","[Ozgen, S.] Lab Energy & Environm Piacenza LEAP, Milan, Italy; [Cernuschi, S.; Caserini, S.] Politecn Milan, Dept Civil & Environm Engn DICA, Milan, Italy",Polytechnic University of Milan,"Ozgen, S (corresponding author), Lab Energy & Environm Piacenza LEAP, Milan, Italy.",senem.ozgen@polimi.it; stefano.cernuschi@polimi.it; stefano.caserini@polimi.it,,"ozgen, senem/0000-0002-9774-561X",,,,,98,46,46,10,39,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",1364-0321,1879-0690,,RENEW SUST ENERG REV,Renew.

In addition, climate change requires the conversion of the energy system to 100% renewable energy. Therefore, we need resources to prevent the climate crisis from worsening, but at the same time, we are suffering from a worsening resource crisis. State-of-the-art technologies, such as silicon-based photovoltaic or wind power plants, are harnessing renewable energy but causing problems and resource losses at the end of their useful life. This alarming situation must be addressed with renewable energy technologies that can be used longer, repaired and remanufactured, and properly recycled at the end of their useful life. An emerging technology that can complement the established systems is dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Their production is less energy intensive and they can be manufactured without toxic materials. In line with the concept of the circular economy, the service life of all products must be improved in order to reduce resource consumption. Therefore, we investigated the potential for remanufacturing DSSCs by taking apart old DSSCs, cleaning the components, and building new DSSCs from the remanufactured components. The remanufactured DSSCs have the same or higher efficiencies and can be remanufactured multiple times.","[Schoden, Fabian; Detzmeier, Joscha; Schnatmann, Anna Katharina; Schwenzfeier-Hellkamp, Eva] Bielefeld Univ Appl Sci, Inst Tech Energy Syst ITES, D-33619 Bielefeld, Germany; [Blachowicz, Tomasz] Silesian Tech Univ, Ctr Sci & Educ, Inst Phys, PL-44100 Gliwice, Poland",Bielefeld University of Applied Sciences; Silesian University of Technology,"Schoden, F (corresponding author), Bielefeld Univ Appl Sci, Inst Tech Energy Syst ITES, D-33619 Bielefeld, Germany.",fabian.schoden@fh-bielefeld.de; joscha.detzmeier@fh-bielefeld.de; anna_katharina.schnatmann@fh-bielefeld.de; tomasz.blachowicz@polsl.pl; eva.schwenzfeier-hellkamp@fh-bielefeld.de,"Schoden, Fabian/AAN-7282-2020","Schoden, Fabian/0000-0002-2481-7141; BLACHOWICZ, Tomasz/0000-0002-6569-124X","State of NRW in scope of the project CirQuality OWL; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) [490988677]; Bielefeld University of Applied Sciences","State of NRW in scope of the project CirQuality OWL; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Bielefeld University of Applied Sciences","This research was funded by the State of NRW in scope of the project CirQuality OWL and the APC was funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) 490988677 and Bielefeld University of Applied Sciences.",,59,3,3,1,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,MAY,2022,9,,,,,,5670,10.3390/su14095670,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14095670,,,14,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,1E7RI,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000794680400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The reactive compounds emitted and formed due to biomass fires drive ozone and organic aerosol formation, affecting both air quality and climate. Direct hydroxyl (OH) Reactivity measurements quantify total gaseous reactive pollutant loadings and comparison with measured compounds yields the fraction of unmeasured compounds. Here, we quantified the magnitude and composition of total OH reactivity in the north-west Indo-Gangetic Plain. More than 120% increase occurred in total OH reactivity (28 s(-1) - to 64 s(-1)) and from no missing OH reactivity in the normal summertime air, the missing OH reactivity fraction increased to -40 % in the post-harvest summertime period influenced by large scale biomass fires highlighting presence of unmeasured compounds. Increased missing OH reactivity between the two summertime periods was associated with increased concentrations of compounds with strong photochemical source such as acetaldehyde, acetone, hydroxyacetone, nitromethane, amides, isocyanic acid and primary emissions of acetonitrile and aromatic compounds. Currently even the most detailed state-of-the art atmospheric chemistry models exclude formamide, acetamide, nitromethane and isocyanic acid and their highly reactive precursor alkylamines (e.g. methylamine, ethylamine, dimethylamine, trimethylamine). For improved understanding of atmospheric chemistry-air quality-climate feedbacks in biomass-fire impacted atmospheric environments, future studies should include these compounds.","[Kumar, V.; Chandra, B.

Participating university students (N=174) during the 2012 fall semester had a mean age of 21.74 years. The data were obtained using the California Critical Thinking Disposition Inventory and the Torrance Test of Creative Thinking. A quantitative research method was used for collection, analysis and interpretation of data. According to the results, there was a significant positive correlation between creative thinking and critical thinking skills of students in the low level. The strength of this correlation varied from medium to significant in the Visual Arts Education and Religion & Ethics Education departments; however, it was not significant in Mathematics Education or Preschool Education departments. Accordingly, it can be concluded that the significant relationship between creative and critical thinking of students pursuing degrees within the departments of Visual Arts or Religion & Ethics Education originates from the tendency of these students to use non-routine problem solving processes resulting from the nature of their learning climate and educational outcomes. Thus, it can be put forward that the use of non-routine problem solving processes plays a vital role in the significant correlation between creative thinking and critical thinking skills of students.","[Ulger, Kani] Cumhuriyet Univ, Fac Educ, Sivas, Turkey",Cumhuriyet University,"Ulger, K (corresponding author), Cumhuriyet Univ, Fac Educ, Sivas, Turkey.",kulger@gmail.com,"Ulger, Kani/L-6859-2019","Ulger, Kani/0000-0001-7435-175X",,,,,72,18,20,1,42,HACETTEPE UNIV,ANKARA,"HACETTEPE UNIV, ANKARA, 6532, TURKEY",1300-5340,,,HACET UNIV EGIT FAK,Hacet.

Here, an alternative FLEXPART model version has been developed and tailored to use with the meteorological output data generated by the CMIP5-version of the Norwegian Earth System Model (NorESM1-M). The atmospheric component of the NorESM1-M is based on the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM4); hence, this FLEXPART version could be widely applicable and it provides a new advanced tool to directly analyse and diagnose atmospheric transport properties of the state-of-the-art climate model NorESM in a reliable way. The adaptation of FLEXPART to NorESM required new routines to read meteorological fields, new post-processing routines to obtain the vertical velocity in the FLEXPART coordinate system, and other changes. These are described in detail in this paper. To validate the model, several tests were performed that offered the possibility to investigate some aspects of offline global dispersion modelling. First, a comprehensive comparison was made between the tracer transport from several point sources around the globe calculated online by the transport scheme embedded in CAM4 and the FLEXPART model applied offline on output data. The comparison allowed investigating several aspects of the transport schemes including the approximation introduced by using an offline dispersion model with the need to transform the vertical coordinate system, the influence on the model results of the sub-grid-scale parameterisations of convection and boundary layer height and the possible advantage entailed in using a numerically non-diffusive Lagrangian particle solver. Subsequently, a comparison between the reference FLEXPART model and the FLEXPART-NorESM/CAM version was performed to compare the well-mixed state of the atmosphere in a 1-year global simulation. The two model versions use different methods to obtain the vertical velocity but no significant difference in the results was found. However, for both model versions there was some degradation in the well-mixed state after 1 year of simulation with the buildup of a bias and an increased scatter. Finally, the capability of the new combined modelling system in producing realistic, backward-in-time transport statistics was evaluated calculating the average footprint over a 5-year period for several measurement locations and by comparing the results with those obtained with the reference FLEXPART model driven by re-analysis fields. This comparison confirmed the effectiveness of the combined modelling system FLEXPART with NorESM in producing realistic transport statistics.","[Cassiani, Massimo; Stohl, Andreas; Pisso, Ignacio] NILU Norwegian Inst Air Res, POB 100, N-2027 Kjeller, Norway; [Olivie, Dirk; Seland, Oyvind; Iversen, Trond] Norwegian Meteorol Inst, POB 43, N-0313 Oslo, Norway; [Bethke, Ingo] Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, Uni Res Climate, POB 7810, N-5020 Bergen, Norway",Norwegian Institute for Air Research; Norwegian Meteorological Institute; Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research,"Cassiani, M (corresponding author), NILU Norwegian Inst Air Res, POB 100, N-2027 Kjeller, Norway.",mc@nilu.no,"Cassiani, Massimo/I-3001-2017; Stohl, Andreas/A-7535-2008; Pisso, Ignacio/B-1357-2017; Bethke, Ingo/I-1339-2018","Cassiani, Massimo/0000-0003-1625-629X; Stohl, Andreas/0000-0002-2524-5755; Pisso, Ignacio/0000-0002-0056-7897; Bethke, Ingo/0000-0002-6836-9838","Research Council of Norway [229771]; Nordforsk through the Nordic Centers of Excellence ESTICC [57001]; project CRAICC; European Commission [FP7-ENV-2010-265148, FP7-ENV-2010-265863]",Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway); Nordforsk through the Nordic Centers of Excellence ESTICC; project CRAICC; European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre),"This work has been supported by the Research Council of Norway through the projects EarthClim and EVA (grant no. 229771), by Nordforsk through the Nordic Centers of Excellence ESTICC (grant no. 57001) and the project CRAICC, and through the European Commission FP7 projects PEGASOS (FP7-ENV-2010-265148), and ACCESS (FP7-ENV-2010-265863).

Ecosystem functions depend on environmental conditions and the traits of species that comprise the ecological communities(4). However, the axes of variation of ecosystem functions are largely unknown, which limits our understanding of how ecosystems respond as a whole to anthropogenic drivers, climate and environmental variability(4,5). Here we derive a set of ecosystem functions(6) from a dataset of surface gas exchange measurements across major terrestrial biomes. We find that most of the variability within ecosystem functions (71.8%) is captured by three key axes. The first axis reflects maximum ecosystem productivity and is mostly explained by vegetation structure. The second axis reflects ecosystem water-use strategies and is jointly explained by variation in vegetation height and climate. The third axis, which represents ecosystem carbon-use efficiency, features a gradient related to aridity, and is explained primarily by variation in vegetation structure. We show that two state-of-the-art land surface models reproduce the first and most important axis of ecosystem functions. However, the models tend to simulate more strongly correlated functions than those observed, which limits their ability to accurately predict the full range of responses to environmental changes in carbon, water and energy cycling in terrestrial ecosystems(7,8).","[Migliavacca, Mirco; Musavi, Talie; Mahecha, Miguel D.; Nelson, Jacob A.; Caldararu, Silvia; Carvalhais, Nuno; El-Madany, Tarek S.; Gomarasca, Ulisse; Goeckede, Mathias; Jung, Martin; Kattge, Jens; Martini, David; Pabon-Moreno, Daniel E.; Weber, Ulrich; Zaehle, Soenke; Reichstein, Markus] Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, Jena, Germany; [Migliavacca, Mirco; Mahecha, Miguel D.; Kattge, Jens; Reichstein, Markus] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Halle, Germany; [Mahecha, Miguel D.; Kraemer, Guido] Univ Leipzig, Remote Sensing Ctr Earth Syst Res, Leipzig, Germany; [Mahecha, Miguel D.] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Leipzig, Germany; [Knauer, Juergen] CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Baldocchi, Dennis D.; Keenan, Trevor F.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Perez-Priego, Oscar] Univ Cordoba, Dept Forest Engn, ERSAF Res Grp, Cordoba, Spain; [Christiansen, Rune; Peters, Jonas] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Math Sci, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Anderson, Karen] Univ Exeter, Environm & Sustainabil Inst, Penryn, England; [Bahn, Michael; Wohlfahrt, Georg] Univ Innsbruck, Dept Ecol, Innsbruck, Austria; [Black, T.

For this reason, current land surface models include phenology parameterizations and related biophysical and biogeochemical processes. In this work, the climatology of the beginning and end of the growing season, simulated by the land component of seven state-of-the-art European Earth system models participating in the CMIP6, is evaluated globally against satellite observations. The assessment is performed using the vegetation metric leaf area index and a recently developed approach, named four growing season types. On average, the land surface models show a 0.6-month delay in the growing season start, while they are about 0.5 months earlier in the growing season end. The difference with observation tends to be higher in the Southern Hemisphere compared to the Northern Hemisphere. High agreement between land surface models and observations is exhibited in areas dominated by broadleaf deciduous trees, while high variability is noted in regions dominated by broadleaf deciduous shrubs. Generally, the timing of the growing season end is accurately simulated in about 25 % of global land grid points versus 16 % in the timing of growing season start. The refinement of phenology parameterization can lead to better representation of vegetation-related energy, water, and carbon cycles in land surface models, but plant phenology is also affected by plant physiology and soil hydrology processes.

Over the years, transformation of these animals from draft to dairy was deliberately carried out through genetic improvement program leading to the development of buffalo-based enterprises. Buffalo production is now getting more attention and interest from buffalo raisers due to its socioeconomic impact as well as its contribution to propelling the livestock industry in many developing countries. Reproduction of buffaloes, however, is confronted with huge challenge and concern as being generally less efficient to reproduce compared with cattle due to both intrinsic and extrinsic factors such as poor estrus manifestation, silent heat, marked seasonal infertility, postpartum anestrus, long calving interval, delayed puberty, inherently low number of primordial follicles in their ovaries, high incidence of atresia, and apoptosis. Assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) are major interventions for the efficient utilization of follicle reserve in buffaloes. The present review focuses on estrus and ovulation synchronization for fixed time artificial insemination, in vitro embryo production, intracytoplasmic sperm injection, cryopreservation of oocytes and embryos, somatic cell nuclear transfer, the factors affecting utilization in various ARTs, and future perspectives in buffaloes.","[Srirattana, Kanokwan; Theerakittayakorn, Kasem; Parnpai, Rangsun] Suranaree Univ Technol, Embryo Technol & Stem Cell Res Ctr, Sch Biotechnol, Inst Agr Technol, Nakhon Ratchasima, Thailand; [Hufana-Duran, Danilda; Atabay, Eufrocina P.; Duran, Peregrino G.; Atabay, Edwin C.] Dept Agr Philippine Carabao Ctr, Reprod & Physiol Sect, Sci City Of Munoz, Nueva Ecija, Philippines; [Hufana-Duran, Danilda; Duran, Peregrino G.; Atabay, Edwin C.] Cent Luzon State Univ, Dept Anim Sci, Sci City Of Munoz, Nueva Ecija, Philippines; [Lu, Kehuan] Guangxi Univ, Anim Reprod Inst, Nanning, Guangxi, Peoples R China; [Liang, Yuanyuan] Liuzhou Gen Hosp, Dept Reprod Med, Liuzhou, Guangxi, Peoples R China; [Chaikhun-Marcou, Thuchadaporn] Mahanakorn Univ Technol, Fac Vet Med, Obstet Gynecol Androl & Anim Biotechnol Clin, Bangkok, Thailand",Suranaree University of Technology; Central Luzon State University; Guangxi University; Mahanakorn University of Technology,"Parnpai, R (corresponding author), Suranaree Univ Technol, Embryo Technol & Stem Cell Res Ctr, Sch Biotechnol, Nakhon Ratchasima 30000, Thailand.",rangsun@g.sut.ac.th,,"Theerakittayakorn, Kasem/0000-0001-9997-7417",Suranaree University of Technology (SUT); Thailand Science Research and Innovation (TSRI); SUT Postdoctoral Research Fellowship,Suranaree University of Technology (SUT); Thailand Science Research and Innovation (TSRI); SUT Postdoctoral Research Fellowship,This work was supported by Suranaree University of Technology (SUT) and by Thailand Science Research and Innovation (TSRI).

The measurements show that although irradiation at the floor level increases temperature and reduces relative humidity in the interior of the church, the effect out of the heated zone and for the surfaces sheltered from irradiation is very limited, i.e. their extent is comparable with natural fluctuations inherent to the local climate of the church. The radiant heaters proved to generate little convectional flow of the air. Therefore, the heating system was not found to increase the concentration of SPM indoors; in particular, no re-suspension of particles already present in the church was observed. This work has demonstrated that the overhead radiant heaters are capable of providing localised heat to the areas where people congregate without adversely affecting painted walls and the works of arts displayed in churches. Care, however, should be taken that sensitive works of art are not exposed to the direct infrared radiation. (C) 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS.

We compared the supply of cooling ecosystem services in Boston measured through an indicator of high resolution evapotranspiration modeling, with the demand for benefits from cooling measured as a heat exposure risk score based on exposure, hazard and population character-istics. The resulting evapotranspiration indicator follows a pattern similar to conventional greenspace indicators based on vegetation abundance, except in warmer areas such as those with higher levels of impervious surface. We identified demand-supply mismatch areas across the city of Boston, some coinciding with affordable housing complexes and long term care facilities.

This paper aims at filling this gap by clarifying the key points of HVAC sensing, the main technologies, and their pros and cons. The advancement in this sector is fueled by the premium performance of the embedded systems exploited as sensors and their beneficial features. The state of the art of the available solutions has been summarized with the purpose of fueling and better organizing the research effort on this hot topic.

In comparison to other renewable fuels, hydrogen does obviously not produce CO2 emissions. In this work, two concepts of hydrogen internal combustion engines (H-2-ICEs) are investigated experimentally. One approach is the modification of a state-of-the-art gasoline passenger car engine using hydrogen direct injection. It targets gasoline-like specific power output by mixture enrichment down to stoichiometric operation. Another approach is to use a heavy-duty diesel engine equipped with spark ignition and hydrogen port fuel injection. Here, a diesel-like indicated efficiency is targeted through constant lean-burn operation. The measurement results show that both approaches are applicable. For the gasoline engine-based concept, stoichiometric operation requires a three-way catalyst or a three-way NOX storage catalyst as the primary exhaust gas aftertreatment system. For the diesel engine-based concept, state-of-the-art selective catalytic reduction (SCR) catalysts can be used to reduce the NOx emissions, provided the engine calibration ensures sufficient exhaust gas temperature levels. In conclusion, while H-2-ICEs present new challenges for the development of the exhaust gas aftertreatment systems, they are capable to realize zero-impact tailpipe emission operation.","[Sterlepper, Stefan; Fischer, Marcus; Classen, Johannes; Pischinger, Stefan] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Thermodynam Energy Convers Syst, D-52074 Aachen, Germany; [Huth, Verena] FEV Europe GmbH, D-52078 Aachen, Germany",RWTH Aachen University,"Sterlepper, S (corresponding author), Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Thermodynam Energy Convers Syst, D-52074 Aachen, Germany.",Sterlepper_s@tme.rwth-aachen.de; fischer_ma@tme.rwth-aachen.de; classen_joh@tme.rwth-aachen.de; huth_v@fev.com; Pischinger_s@tme.rwth-aachen.de,"Sterlepper, Stefan/ABG-6270-2021; Fischer, Marcus/AAC-2954-2022","Sterlepper, Stefan/0000-0001-5956-5848; Fischer, Marcus/0000-0003-1713-4067",German Science Council Wissenschaftsrat (WR); German Research Foundation Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG),German Science Council Wissenschaftsrat (WR); German Research Foundation Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),The presented research work was carried out at the Center for Mobile Propulsion (CMP) of RWTH Aachen University with funding by the German Science Council Wissenschaftsrat (WR) and the German Research Foundation Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG).,,46,3,3,9,14,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1996-1073,,ENERGIES,Energies,DEC,2021,23,,,,,,8166,10.3390/en14238166,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en14238166,,,13,Energy & Fuels,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Energy & Fuels,XW1JE,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000735383700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

We systematically evaluate the current state-of-the art on the models and tools that are utilised for the optimum allocation, design and efficiency evaluation of NBS for five HMRs (flooding, droughts, heatwaves, landslides, and storm surges and coastal erosion). We found that methods to assess the complex issue of NBS efficiency and cost-benefits analysis are still in the development stage and they have only been implemented through the methodologies developed for other purposes such as fluid dynamics models in micro and catchment scale contexts. Of the reviewed numerical models and tools MIKE-SHE, SWMM (for floods), ParFlow-TREES, ACRU, SIMGRO (for droughts), WRF, ENVI-met (for heatwaves), FUNWAVE-TVD, BROOK90 (for landslides), TELEMAC and ADCIRC (for storm surges) are more flexible to evaluate the performance and effectiveness of specific NBS such as wetlands, ponds, trees, parks, grass, green roof/ walls, tree roots, vegetations, coral reefs, mangroves, sea grasses, oyster reefs, sea salt marshes, sandy beaches and dunes. We conclude that the models and tools that are capable of assessing the multiple benefits, particularly the performance and cost-effectiveness of NBS for HMR reduction and management are not readily available. Thus, our synthesis of modelling methods can facilitate their selection that can maximise opportunities and refute the current political hesitation of NBS deployment compared with grey solutions for HMR management but also for the provision of a wide range of social and economic co-benefits. However, there is still a need for bespoke modelling tools that can holistically assess the various components of NBS from an HMR reduction and management perspective. Such tools can facilitate impact assessment modelling under different NBS scenarios to build a solid evidence base for upscaling and replicating the implementation of NBS. (c) 2021 The Author(s).

Arguments about China's drought persist and little work has utilized agricultural drought survey area to evaluate the impact of natural drought on agriculture. Based on a newly revised self-calibrating Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) model driven with air-relative-humidity-based two-source (ARTS) E-0 (PDSIARTS; Yan et al., 2014), spatial and temporal variations of drought were analyzed for 1982-2011 in China, which indicates that there was nonsignificant change of drought over this interval but with an extreme drought event happened in 2000-2001. However, using air temperature (T-a)-based Thornthwaite potential evaporation (E-P_Th) and Penman-Monteith potential evaporation (E-P_PM) to drive the PDSI model, their corresponding PDSITh and PDSIPM all gave a significant drying trend for 1982-2011. This suggests that PDSI model was sensitive to E-P parameterization in China. Annual drought-covered area from agriculture survey was initially adopted to evaluate impact of PDSI drought on agriculture in China during 1982-2011. The results indicate that PDSIARTS drought area (defined as PDSIARTS<-0.5) correlated well with the agriculture drought-covered area and PDSIARTS successfully detected the extreme agriculture drought in 2000-2001 during 1982-2011, i.e., climate factors dominated the interannual changes of agriculture drought area, while PDSITh and PDSIPM drought areas had no relationship with the agriculture drought-covered area and overestimated the uptrend of agriculture drought This study highlights the importance of coupling PDSI with drought survey data in evaluating the impact of natural drought on agriculture.","[Yan, Hao; Lu, Hou-Quan; Guo, An-Hong] China Meteorol Adm, Natl Meteorol Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Yan, Hao; Shugart, Herman H.] Univ Virginia, Dept Environm Sci, Clark Hall, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA; [Wang, Shao-Qiang; Wang, Jun-Bang] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Zai-Chun] Peking Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Dept Ecol, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Myneni, Ranga B.] Boston Univ, Dept Earth & Environm, Boston, MA 02215 USA","China Meteorological Administration; University of Virginia; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Peking University; Boston University","Yan, H (corresponding author), China Meteorol Adm, Natl Meteorol Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Yan, H (corresponding author), Univ Virginia, Dept Environm Sci, Clark Hall, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA.",yanhaon@hotmail.com,"Myneni, Ranga B./AAU-6088-2021; Myneni, Ranga B/F-5129-2012; Zhu, Zaichun/ABD-2040-2021; Shugart, Herman/C-5156-2009; Zhu, Zaichun/I-5374-2014","Myneni, Ranga B/0000-0002-0234-6393; Zhu, Zaichun/0000-0001-5235-5194; Shugart, Herman/0000-0002-1766-8379; Zhu, Zaichun/0000-0001-5235-5194; yan, hao/0000-0002-5287-3298","National Basic Research Program of China [2013CB430205]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41571327, 41171284]; Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA05050602-1]; University of Virginia's Programs of Distinction grant",National Basic Research Program of China(National Basic Research Program of China); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); University of Virginia's Programs of Distinction grant,"We acknowledge the use of the global LAI3g data sets available at Department of Earth and Environment of Boston University (http://sites.bu.edu/cliveg/datacodes/), the agricultural drought-covered area data investigated by National Bureau of Statistics of China (http://data.stats.gov.cn/), climate data from National Meteorological Information Center (NMIC) of Chinese Meteorological Administration (http://cdc.nmic.cn/home.do), the Global Gridded Soil Data and ISLSCP II NOAA monthly albedo from Oak Ridge National Laboratory Distributed Active Archive Center (http://www.daac.ornl.gov).

The cultural roles and meanings of the museum as an institution are changing in relationship to local and global currents. Factors include the adoption of digital technologies, the repatriation of cultural artifacts, and the opening of new blockbuster museums. This special issue of Museum Anthropology builds upon a nodal taxonomic model for classifying museum practices, audiences, and the organization of evidence. The collected articles juxtapose cross-cultural case studies drawn from Africa, Europe, and the United States. Topics include the use of evidence in the global circulation of popular African art, discussions of repatriation and decolonization in German museums, the museum boom in Poland's new political climate, and the development of a unique local museum based on minimalist art near the US-Mexican border. The comparative cases demonstrate how museums of different types respond to civic contestations, public debates, and institutional transformations. Curatorial narratives support the use of evidence in contrasting ways as museums build and revitalize their collections. These shifts influence the interpretation of evidence and the display of artifacts both within individual museums and across the global museum landscape.","[Jules-Rosette, Bennetta] Univ Calif San Diego, San Diego, CA 92103 USA; [Osborn, J.

Information Overload arises when extensive and redundant information is available and it is difficult or sometimes even impossible for humans to understand and manage it. As a significant portion of data is not structured, unique analytical tools are required to assert intelligence through unsupervised learning and categorization methods. Though, the art, science, and tools of handling such data have advanced dramatically, there is still a need to structure learning methods by using the state of the art text classification and categorization techniques with the information retrieval tools such that the categories are also semantically associated with each other.

In this research, we present a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) supported by a Bibliometric Performance and Network Analysis (BPNA) of the use of A4.0 technologies and PA techniques in the coffee sector. To perform the SLR, 87 documents published since 2011 were extracted from the Scopus and Web of Science databases and processed through the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyzes (PRISMA) protocol. The BPNA was carried out to identify the strategic themes in the field of study. The results present 23 clusters with different levels of development and maturity. We also discovered and presented the thematic network structure of the most used A4.0 technologies in the coffee sector. Our findings shows that Internet of Things, Machine Learning and geostatistics are the most used technologies in the coffee sector, we also present the main challenges and trends related to technological adoption in coffee systems. We believe that the demonstrated results have the potential to be considered by researchers in future works and decision making related to the field of study.","[Sott, Michele Kremer; Furstenau, Leonardo Bertolin; Kipper, Liane Mahlmann] Univ Santa Cruz do Sul, Grad Program Ind Syst & Proc, BR-96816501 Santa Cruz Do Sul, RS, Brazil; [Sott, Michele Kremer; Giraldo, Faber D.] Univ Quindio, Fac Engn, SINFOCI Res Grp, Armenia 630004, Colombia; [Kipper, Liane Mahlmann; Lopez-Robles, Jose Ricardo] Autonomous Univ Zacatecas, Postgrad Program Engn & Appl Technol, Natl Lab CONACYT SEDEAM, Zacatecas 98000, Zacatecas, Mexico; [Cobo, Manuel J.] Univ Cadiz, Dept Comp Engn, Cadiz 11519, Spain; [Zahid, Adnan; Abbasi, Qammer H.; Imran, Muhammad Ali] Univ Glasgow, James Watt Sch Engn, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland",Universidade de Santa Cruz do Sul; Universidad del Quindio; Universidad Autonoma de Zacatecas; Universidad de Cadiz; University of Glasgow,"Sott, MK (corresponding author), Univ Santa Cruz do Sul, Grad Program Ind Syst & Proc, BR-96816501 Santa Cruz Do Sul, RS, Brazil.",sott.mk@gmail.com,"Cobo Martín, Manuel Jessús/AFU-2021-2022; imran, muhammad/HDM-5119-2022; Sott, Michele Kremer/AAX-1472-2020; López-Robles, José Ricardo/N-8593-2018; Abbasi, Qammer H./I-8644-2019; Furstenau, Leonardo Bertolin/ACV-1506-2022; Cobo, Manuel Jesús/C-5581-2011; Giraldo, Faber D./Q-1135-2018","Cobo Martín, Manuel Jessús/0000-0001-6575-803X; Sott, Michele Kremer/0000-0002-7428-3993; Abbasi, Qammer H./0000-0002-7097-9969; Furstenau, Leonardo Bertolin/0000-0001-8984-7774; Cobo, Manuel Jesús/0000-0001-6575-803X; Giraldo, Faber D./0000-0002-6111-3055; zahid, Adnan/0000-0001-5364-6057; Imran, Muhammad Ali/0000-0003-4743-9136","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) Doctoral Training Grant (DTG) [EP/N509668/1 Eng]; Master in Industrial Systems and Processes of the University of Santa Cruz do Sul, Brazil; Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES), Brazil [001]; National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq), Brazil [303934/2019-0]; Feder funds from the Spanish Government [TIN2016-75850-R]; Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACYT); Direccion General de Relaciones Exteriores (DGRI), Mexico; Master in Engineering with emphasis on Software Engineering of the University of Quindio, Colombia","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) Doctoral Training Grant (DTG)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Master in Industrial Systems and Processes of the University of Santa Cruz do Sul, Brazil; Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES), Brazil(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq), Brazil(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); Feder funds from the Spanish Government; Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACYT)(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)); Direccion General de Relaciones Exteriores (DGRI), Mexico; Master in Engineering with emphasis on Software Engineering of the University of Quindio, Colombia","This work was supported in part by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) Doctoral Training Grant (DTG) under Grant EP/N509668/1 Eng, in part by the double degree agreement between the Master in Industrial Systems and Processes of the University of Santa Cruz do Sul, Brazil, in part by the Master in Engineering with emphasis on Software Engineering of the University of Quindio, Colombia, in part by the Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES), Brazil, under Grant 001, in part by the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq), Brazil, under Grant 303934/2019-0, in part by the Feder funds from the Spanish Government under Grant TIN2016-75850-R, in part by the Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACYT), and in part by the Direccion General de Relaciones Exteriores (DGRI), Mexico.",,118,46,46,5,48,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2020,,,,,149854,149867,,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3016325,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3016325,,,14,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,ND7JO,,"Green Submitted, Green Accepted, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000562079400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The change can be quantified from observations of the fauna, flora and weather conditions. To do observations at sufficient spatial and temporal resolution, ground-based observation nodes with sensors are needed. However, the arctic tundra is resource-limited with regards to energy, data networks, and humans. There are also regulatory and practical obstacles. Consequently, observation nodes must be small and unobtrusive, have a year or longer operational lifetime from small batteries, and be able to report results and receive software updates over scarce back-haul networks. We describe the architecture, design, and implementation of prototype observation nodes deployed to the arctic tundra for the periods August 2019 to July 2020 and August 2020 to July 2021. For the 2019 deployment, ten nodes were each placed inside ten existing camera traps. A camera trap is a box with a wildlife camera taking pictures of rodents when they enter the box from tunnels under snow and ice. For the 2020 deployment, eight nodes were located pairwise inside four camera traps. Each node measures carbon dioxide level and temperature inside the camera trap during the winter season. A node reports its state and observational data each night over a commercial low power IoT telecom back-haul network, if available. We report on the issues encountered doing actual deployments of the prototype nodes. For each issue, we describe the reason for why it happened, relate it to the architecture, design and implementation, and explain what we did about it.","[Murphy, Michael J.; Tveito, Oystein; Rais, Issam; Bjorndalen, John Markus; Anshus, Otto] UiT Arctic Univ Norway, Dept Comp Sci, Tromso, Norway; [Kleiven, Eivind Flittie; Soininen, Eeva M.] UiT Arctic Univ Norway, Dept Arctic & Marine Biol, Tromso, Norway",UiT The Arctic University of Tromso; UiT The Arctic University of Tromso,"Murphy, MJ (corresponding author), UiT Arctic Univ Norway, Dept Comp Sci, Tromso, Norway.",michael.j.murphy@uit.no; oystein.tveito@uit.no; eivind.f.kleiven@uit.no; issam.rais@uit.no; eeva.soininen@uit.no; john.markus.bjorndalen@uit.no; otto.anshus@uit.no,,"Rais, Issam/0000-0002-5420-2674",Climate-ecological Observatory for Arctic Tundra (COAT); Distributed Arctic Observatory (DAO); Research Council of Norway [270672],Climate-ecological Observatory for Arctic Tundra (COAT); Distributed Arctic Observatory (DAO); Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway),"This project is funded by the Climate-ecological Observatory for Arctic Tundra (COAT) (https://www.coat.no/en/) under the COAT Tools program, and by the Distributed Arctic Observatory (DAO) (https://site.uit.no/dao/).DAO is sponsored by the Research Council of Norway (https://www.forskningsradet.no/en/) under the IKTPLUSS programme, grant no. 270672. fieldwork; Irma Trane for lending her cabin and her hospitality; Dorothee Ehrich for help with mapping; and Arne MunchEllingsen and Telenor Research for donating data plans for the CO2 observation units and for navigating the red tape to provide us with useful cell tower data.

The process aims at ensuring that AIJ projects provide additionality of financing and of carbon-emissions reduction to the host country. Within this AIJ/JI context, Renewable Energy Technologies (RETs) face two special challenges. In the first instance, the markets for RETs are still evolving, and therefore demand-creation costs can be significant. The second issue is that because of this evolving market development, RET promotion is supported through incentives worldwide. It is, therefore, difficult to establish a baseline against which the additionality of emissions reductions and of financial investments due to AIJ-based RET projects can be measured. Such projects will therefore need to be assessed against the existing energy-use patterns and incentive structure in the host country in order to identify appropriate opportunities. From the host country's perspective, the opportunities for the AIJ/JI-based transfer of RETs can be conceptualized to occur through three types of technology transfer. The first is the expansion of current (incentive-based) RET programmes in the host countries, through either support to Government incentives or to private sector investment without utilizing Government incentives. The second is the introduction of state-of-the-art RETs with higher performance levels than those currently available in the host country; and the third type involves the introduction of state-of-the-art RETs that are not currently available in the host country. An assessment of these three classes of technology transfer indicates that AIJ projects need to assess both direct cost-effectiveness of emissions reductions, as well as the transaction costs of the verification of reductions. Verifiability costs are least for electricity-generating RETs, while direct cost effectiveness is best for RETs that are already commercially available in the host country, but have a better performance than that of existing technology (i.e., the second class of technology transfer).","Tata Energy Res Inst, India Habitat Ctr, Div Energy Technol, New Delhi, India",,"Mathur, A (corresponding author), Tata Energy Res Inst, India Habitat Ctr, Div Energy Technol, Lodi Rd, New Delhi, India.",,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,PERGAMON PRESS LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD LANGFORD LANE KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",,,0-08-043325-1,,,,1998,,,,,523,528,,10.1016/B978-008043325-7/50079-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-008043325-7/50079-8,,,6,Environmental Sciences,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BM86J,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000079959900075,View Full Record in Web of Science

The effect of CO2 concentration on C-13/C-12 ratios is currently debated, yet crucial to reconstructing ancient environments and quantifying the carbon cycle. Here we compare high-resolution ice core measurements of atmospheric CO2 with fossil plant and faunal isotope records. We show the effect of pCO(2) during the last deglaciation is stronger for gymnosperms (-1.4 +/- 1.2%) than angiosperms/fauna (-0.5 +/- 1.5%), while the contributions from changing MAP are -0.3 +/- 0.6% and -0.4 +/- 0.4%, respectively. Previous studies have assumed that plant C-13/C-12 ratios are mostly determined by MAP, an assumption which is sometimes incorrect in geological time. Atmospheric effects must be taken into account when interpreting terrestrial stable carbon isotopes, with important implications for past environments and climates, and understanding plant responses to climate change.","[Hare, Vincent J.; Loftus, Emma; Jeffrey, Amy; Ramsey, Christopher Bronk] Univ Oxford, Sch Archaeol, Res Lab Archaeol & Hist Art, 1 South Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3TG, England; [Hare, Vincent J.] Univ Rochester, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, 601 Elmwood Ave, Rochester, NY 14627 USA; [Loftus, Emma] Univ Oxford, Merton Coll, Merton St, Oxford OX1 4JD, England",University of Oxford; University of Rochester; University of Oxford,"Hare, VJ (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Sch Archaeol, Res Lab Archaeol & Hist Art, 1 South Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3TG, England.;Hare, VJ (corresponding author), Univ Rochester, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, 601 Elmwood Ave, Rochester, NY 14627 USA.",vincent.john.hare@gmail.com,"Ramsey, Christopher Bronk/AAQ-2227-2021; Ramsey, Christopher Bronk/A-3277-2012","Ramsey, Christopher Bronk/0000-0002-8641-9309; Ramsey, Christopher Bronk/0000-0002-8641-9309; Hare, Vincent/0000-0002-4475-4109; Loftus, Emma Jessica/0000-0003-4442-8511","Clarendon Fund, University of Oxford; UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); Oxford University's RCUK Open Access Block Grant","Clarendon Fund, University of Oxford; UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Oxford University's RCUK Open Access Block Grant","We thank Sarah Eggleston, Ben Hmiel, Lee Murray, and Vinesh Rajpaul for their advice, and Patrick Roberts for his suggestions and critical reading.

While physical-state variables are assimilated in reconstruction simulations, land and ocean biogeochemical state variables adjust to the state acquired through this assimilation indirectly instead of being assimilated themselves. In the absence of comprehensive biogeochemical reanalysis products, such an approach is pragmatic. Here we evaluate a potential advantage of having perfect carbon cycle observational products to be used for direct carbon cycle reconstruction. Within an idealized perfect-model framework, we reconstruct a 50-year target period from a control simulation. We nudge variables from this target onto arbitrary initial conditions, mimicking an assimilation simulation generating initial conditions for hindcast experiments of prediction systems. Interested in the ability to reconstruct global atmospheric CO2, we focus on the global carbon cycle reconstruction performance and predictive skill. We find that indirect carbon cycle reconstruction through physical fields reproduces the target variations. While reproducing the large-scale variations, nudging introduces systematic regional biases in the physical-state variables to which biogeochemical cycles react very sensitively. Initial conditions in the oceanic carbon cycle are sufficiently well reconstructed indirectly. Direct reconstruction slightly improves initial conditions. Indirect reconstruction of global terrestrial carbon cycle initial conditions are also sufficiently well reconstructed by the physics reconstruction alone. Direct reconstruction negligibly improves air-land CO2 flux. Atmospheric CO2 is indirectly very well reconstructed. Direct reconstruction of the marine and terrestrial carbon cycles slightly improves reconstruction while establishing persistent biases. We find improvements in global carbon cycle predictive skill from direct reconstruction compared to indirect reconstruction. After correcting for mean bias, indirect and direct reconstruction both predict the target similarly well and only moderately worse than perfect initialization after the first lead year. Our perfect-model study shows that indirect carbon cycle reconstruction yields satisfying initial conditions for global CO2 flux and atmospheric CO2. Direct carbon cycle reconstruction adds little improvement to the global carbon cycle because imperfect reconstruction of the physical climate state impedes better biogeochemical reconstruction. These minor improvements in initial conditions yield little improvement in initialized perfectmodel predictive skill. We label these minor improvements due to direct carbon cycle reconstruction trivial, as mean bias reduction yields similar improvements. As reconstruction biases in real-world prediction systems are likely stronger, our results add confidence to the current practice of indirect reconstruction in carbon cycle prediction systems.","[Spring, Aaron; Dunkl, Istvan; Li, Hongmei; Brovkin, Victor; Ilyina, Tatiana] Max Planck Inst Meteorol, Hamburg, Germany; [Spring, Aaron; Dunkl, Istvan] Int Max Planck Res Sch Earth Syst Modelling, IMPRS, Hamburg, Germany; [Brovkin, Victor] Univ Hamburg, Ctr Earth Syst Res & Sustainabil, Hamburg, Germany",Max Planck Society; Max Planck Society; University of Hamburg,"Spring, A (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Meteorol, Hamburg, Germany.;Spring, A (corresponding author), Int Max Planck Res Sch Earth Syst Modelling, IMPRS, Hamburg, Germany.",aaron.spring@mpimet.mpg.de,"Brovkin, Victor/C-2803-2016; Li, Hongmei/L-2204-2015; Ilyina, Tatiana/ABE-9164-2020","Brovkin, Victor/0000-0001-6420-3198; Li, Hongmei/0000-0003-2912-1837; Ilyina, Tatiana/0000-0002-3475-4842; Spring, Aaron/0000-0003-0216-2241; Dunkl, Istvan/0000-0002-1503-3783","European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme [821003, 820989, 641816]",European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme,"We acknowledge funding from European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme under grant agreement no. 821003 Climate-Carbon Interactions in the Current Century (4C), no. 820989 COMFORT and no. 641816 CRESCENDO.

Specifically, the application of the native and traditional basis of past architecture can be highly significant for the improvement of contemporary architecture (Fathy, 1986). Zavareh is one of the most important and ancient cities of Iran which has partially retained its vernacular architectural structural texture. Historical factors such as social change and evolution, urban changes and climatic-morphological changes have all influenced its architecture (yang and Grout, 2004). Wind is an important climatic factor for the ventilation of buildings, the provision of cooling and even the ventilation of the entire city. Therefore wind has played an important role in the city's architecture. This paper considers the role of wind and its influence on residential architecture. Climatic changes are concluded to be a predominant factor in the creation of new styles within recent periods.

Based on this Saharan dust case, we discuss the advantages of a scanning aerosol LiDAR and validate a method to determine LiDAR ratios independently. The LiDAR measurements at 355 nm showed that the dust particles had backscatter coefficients of 0.86 +/- 0.14 Mm(-1) sr(-1), extinction coefficients of 40 +/- 0.8 Mm(-1), a LiDAR ratio of 46 +/- 5 sr, and a linear particle depolarisation ratio of 0.27 +/- 0.023. These values are in good agreement with those obtained in previous studies of Saharan dust plumes in Western Europe. Compared to the remote sensing measurements, the transport model predicted the plume arrival time, its layer height, and its structure quite well. The comparison of dust plume backscatter values from the ICON-ART model and observations for two days showed a correlation with a slope of 0.9 +/- 0.1 at 355 nm.

Extreme droughts, which are more often prolonged, can increase the risk of forest fires, not only in southern Europe but also, in Central Europe. Nonetheless, catastrophic fire events are not well recognized in the Central European Lowlands (CEL), where large forest complexes are located. Knowledge of past fire activity in this part of Europe is scarce, although several fires have occurred in this area during the previous millennia. Large coniferous forest monocultures located in the CEL are highly susceptible to fires and other disturbances. Here, we present a case study from the Tuchola Pinewoods (TP; northern Poland), where large pine monocultures are present. The main aim of this study is to document the potential effects past land management has on modern day disturbance regimes using state-of-the-art paleoecological data, historical documents and cartographic materials. We then present a protocol that will help forest managers utilize long-term paleoecological records. Based on paleoecological investigations, historical documents, and cartographic materials, our results show that, in the past 300 years, the TP witnessed not only disastrous fires and but also windfalls by tornados and insect outbreaks. A change in management from Polish to Prussian/German in the 18th century led to the transformation of mixed forests into Scots pine monocultures with the purpose to allow better economic use of the forest. Those administrative decisions led to an ecosystem highly susceptible to disturbances. This article provides a critical review of past forest management as well as future research directions related to the impacts of fire risk on land management and ecosystem services: (a) habitat composition and structure (biodiversity); (b) natural water management; and (c) mitigation of climate changes. Designated forest conditions, management, and future fire risk are a controversial and highly debated topic of forest management by Forestry Units. More research will allow the gathering of reliable information pertinent to management practices with regard to the current fire risks. It is necessary to develop a dialog between scientists and managers to reduce the risk of fires in projected climate change.","[Slowinski, Michal; Lucow, Dominika; Brykala, Dariusz; Tyszkowski, Sebastian] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Geog & Spatial Org, Dept Environm Resources & Geohazards, Twarda 51-55, PL-00818 Warsaw, Poland; [Lamentowicz, Mariusz; Lucow, Dominika; Barabach, Jan; Marcisz, Katarzyna] Adam Mickiewicz Univ, Lab Wetland Ecol & Monitoring, Bogumila Krygowskiego 10, PL-61680 Poznan, Poland; [Lamentowicz, Mariusz; Lucow, Dominika; Barabach, Jan; Marcisz, Katarzyna] Adam Mickiewicz Univ, Dept Biogeog & Paleoecol, Bogumila Krygowskiego 10, PL-61680 Poznan, Poland; [Pienczewska, Anna; Snieszko, Zbigniew] Kazimierz Wielki Univ, Inst Geog, PL Koscieleckich 8, PL-85033 Bydgoszcz, Poland; [Dietze, Elisabeth] Alfred Wegener Inst Helmholtz Ctr Polar & Marine, Res Unit Potsdam, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany; [Ott, Florian; Brauer, Achim] GFZ German Res Ctr Geosci, Sect 5 2 Climate Dynam & Landscape Evolut, Telegrafenberg C, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany; [Jazdzewski, Krzysztof] Museum Koscierzyna Land, Rynek 9, PL-83400 Koscierzyna, Poland; [Obremska, Milena] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Geol Sci, Twarda 51-55, PL-00818 Warsaw, Poland; [Ott, Florian] Max Planck Inst Sci Human Hist, Kahla Str 10, D-07743 Jena, Germany","Polish Academy of Sciences; Adam Mickiewicz University; Adam Mickiewicz University; Kazimierz Wielki University; Helmholtz Association; Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar & Marine Research; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Center Potsdam GFZ German Research Center for Geosciences; Polish Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geological Sciences of the Polish Academy of Sciences","Slowinski, M (corresponding author), Polish Acad Sci, Inst Geog & Spatial Org, Dept Environm Resources & Geohazards, Twarda 51-55, PL-00818 Warsaw, Poland.",michal.slowinski@geopan.torun.pl,"Marcisz, Katarzyna/C-4021-2013; Lamentowicz, Mariusz/E-8784-2010; Obremska, Milena/O-2501-2013; Barabach, Jan/I-9162-2019; Dietze, Elisabeth/AFJ-4450-2022; Brykała, Dariusz/L-2091-2017; Dietze, Elisabeth/AAF-4616-2022; Słowiński, Michał/B-6546-2011; Słowiński, Michał/O-8029-2019","Marcisz, Katarzyna/0000-0003-2655-9729; Lamentowicz, Mariusz/0000-0003-0429-1530; Obremska, Milena/0000-0002-3465-1894; Barabach, Jan/0000-0003-1615-1113; Dietze, Elisabeth/0000-0003-4817-8441; Brykała, Dariusz/0000-0002-0105-4153; Dietze, Elisabeth/0000-0003-4817-8441; Słowiński, Michał/0000-0002-3011-2682; Słowiński, Michał/0000-0002-3011-2682; Brauer, Achim/0000-0002-6655-9451; Lucow, Dominika/0000-0001-9966-7478; Tyszkowski, Sebastian/0000-0001-7861-5492","National Science Centre (Poland) [2015/17/B/ST10/01656, 2015/17/B/ST10/03430]","National Science Centre (Poland)(National Science Centre, Poland)",The research was funded by the National Science Centre (Poland) grants 2015/17/B/ST10/01656 and 2015/17/B/ST10/03430.

The large diversity of available scenario projections leads to a recognizable variability in impacts on land ecosystems and the levels of services provided. We evaluated 16 projections of future LULC until 2040 that reflected different assumptions regarding socioeconomic demands and modeling protocols. By using these LULC projections in a state-of-the-art dynamic global vegetation model, we simulated their effect on selected ecosystem service indicators related to ecosystem productivity and carbon sequestration potential, agricultural production and the water cycle. We found that although a common trend for agricultural expansion exists across the scenarios, where and how particular LULC changes are realized differs widely across models and scenarios. They are linked to model-specific considerations of some demands over others and their respective translation into LULC changes and also reflect the simplified or missing representation of processes related to land dynamics or other influencing factors (e.g., trade, climate change). As a result, some scenarios show questionable and possibly unrealistic features in their LULC allocations, including highly regionalized LULC changes with rates of conversion that are contrary to or exceed rates observed in the past. Across the diverging LULC projections, we identified positive global trends of net primary productivity (+10.2% +/- 1.4 %), vegetation carbon (+9.2% +/- 4.1 %), crop production (+31.2% +/- 12.2 %) and water runoff (+9.3% +/- 1.7 %), and a negative trend of soil and litter carbon stocks (-0.5% +/- 0.4 %). The variability in ecosystem service indicators across scenarios was especially high for vegetation carbon stocks and crop production. Regionally, variability was highest in tropical forest regions, especially at current forest boundaries, because of intense and strongly diverging LULC change projections in combination with high vegetation productivity dampening or amplifying the effects of climatic change. Our results emphasize that information on future changes in ecosystem functioning and the related ecosystem service indicators should be seen in light of the variability originating from diverging projections of LULC. This is necessary to allow for adequate policy support towards sustainable transformations.","[Bayer, Anita D.; Fuchs, Richard; Anthoni, Peter; Arneth, Almut] Karlsruhe Inst Technol KIT, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Atmospher Environm Res, D-82467 Garmisch Partenkirchen, Germany; [Mey, Reinhard] Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res WSL, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Krause, Andreas] Tech Univ Munich, TUM Sch Life Sci Weihenstephan, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; [Verburg, Peter H.] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands","Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape Research; Technical University of Munich; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam","Bayer, AD (corresponding author), Karlsruhe Inst Technol KIT, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Atmospher Environm Res, D-82467 Garmisch Partenkirchen, Germany.",anita.bayer@kit.edu,"Krause, Andreas/E-9665-2018; Verburg, Peter/A-8469-2010","Krause, Andreas/0000-0003-3345-2989; Verburg, Peter/0000-0002-6977-7104; Mey, Reinhard/0000-0003-3702-0366","European Commission's 7th Framework Programme [308393, 603542]; Helmholtz Association and its ATMO research program",European Commission's 7th Framework Programme(European Commission); Helmholtz Association and its ATMO research program(Helmholtz Association),"This research has been supported by the European Commission's 7th Framework Programme (grant no. 308393, OPERAs, and grant no. 603542, LUC4C), and the Helmholtz Association and its ATMO research program.",,110,4,5,5,17,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",2190-4979,2190-4987,,EARTH SYST DYNAM,Earth Syst.

Detrimental to this debate, estimates of the change in total solar irradiance (TSI) since the Maunder minimum, an extended period of weak solar activity preceding the industrial revolution, differ markedly, ranging from a drop of 0.75 W m(-2)to a rise of 6.3 W m(-2). Consequently, the exact contribution by solar forcing to the rise in global temperatures over the past centuries remains inconclusive. Adopting a novel approach based on state-of-the-art solar imagery and numerical simulations, we establish the TSI level of the Sun when it is in its least-active state to be 2.0 +/- 0.7 W m(-2)below the 2019 level. This means TSI could not have risen since the Maunder minimum by more than this amount, thus restricting the possible role of solar forcing in global warming. Plain Language Summary How the amount of energy the Earth receives from the Sun varied since preindustrial times is an important consideration in the climate change debate. Detrimental to this debate, it is not known whether the Sun grew brighter or dimmer since the 16th century, and by how much. As a consequence, the exact contribution by fluctuations in the brightness of the Sun to the rise in global temperatures over the past centuries remains controversial. It is established that the Sun was particularly inactive over much of the 16th century. Adopting a novel approach based on state-of-the-art solar imagery and computer models, we determined the brightness of the Sun when it is in its least-active state possible. This places a strict limit on how much the Sun could have grown brighter since the lull in solar activity over the 16th century, restricting the possible role the Sun could have played in global warming.","[Yeo, K.

The fate of SOC in cropland soils plays a significant role in both sustainable agricultural production and climate change mitigation. The spatiotemporal changes of soil organic carbon in croplands in response to different carbon (C) input management and environmental conditions across the main global cereal systems were studied using a modeling approach. We also identified the key variables that drive SOC changes at a high spatial resolution (0.1 degrees x 0.1 degrees) and over a long timescale (54 years from 1961 to 2014). A widely used soil C turnover model (RothC) and state-of-the-art databases of soil and climate variables were used in the present study. The model simulations suggested that, on a global average, the cropland SOC density increased at annual rates of 0.22, 0.45 and 0.69 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) under crop residue retention rates of 30, 60 and 90 %, respectively. Increasing the quantity of C input could enhance soil C sequestration or reduce the rate of soil C loss, depending largely on the local soil and climate conditions. Spatially, under a specific crop residue retention rate, relatively higher soil C sinks were found across the central parts of the USA, western Europe, and the northern regions of China. Relatively smaller soil C sinks occurred in the high-latitude regions of both the Northern and Southern hemispheres, and SOC decreased across the equatorial zones of Asia, Africa and America. We found that SOC change was significantly influenced by the crop residue retention rate (linearly positive) and the edaphic variable of initial SOC content (linearly negative). Temperature had weak negative effects, and precipitation had significantly negative impacts on SOC changes. The results can help guide carbon input management practices to effectively mitigate climate change through soil C sequestration in croplands on a global scale.","[Wang, Guocheng; Zhang, Wen; Li, Tingting] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, State Key Lab Atmospher Boundary Layer Phys & Ato, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Sun, Wenjuan] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China; [Han, Pengfei] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, State Key Lab Numer Modeling Atmospher Sci & Geop, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Botany, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS","Wang, GC; Zhang, W (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, State Key Lab Atmospher Boundary Layer Phys & Ato, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.",wanggc@mail.iap.ac.cn; zhw@mail.iap.ac.cn,"Han, Pengfei/F-9082-2018; Wang, Yuesi/AAF-3186-2019; LAPC, IAP/AAI-6991-2020; Zhang, Wen/AAH-6060-2020; WANG, YUE/GWQ-9256-2022; Wang, Guocheng/AAJ-6674-2020","LAPC, IAP/0000-0002-0025-3484; Zhang, Wen/0000-0001-6670-3057; Wang, Guocheng/0000-0002-4141-4395; sun, wenjuan/0000-0002-9667-1882; Li, Tingting/0000-0002-6338-2769","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41590870, 31370492]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant no. 41590870, 31370492).",,63,9,13,5,33,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1680-7316,1680-7324,,ATMOS CHEM PHYS,Atmos.

It is thus necessary to incorporate UV radiation for an integrated earth modeling system to predict interactions between climate, chemistry and ecosystem processed. The widely-used NCAR TUV (Tropospheric Ultraviolet and Visible) radiation model has been coupled with the state-of-the-art mesoscale CWRF (Climate extension of the Weather Research and Forecasting model) to predict the UV dependence of local climate conditions and its impacts on air quality and crop growth. The original TUV v4.2 has been significantly improved by (1) replacing the core radiation transfer solver, DISORT v1.1 with the latest v2.Obeta; (2) adding a new aerosol scheme based on the Shettle (1989); (3) recoding the entire model to follow the CWRF F90 standard with dynamic memory allocation and modular design; and (4) developing a flexible interface for coupling with CWRF. Given the lack of detailed cloud information in observations, this study focuses on validation of the TUV module in a standalone mode against the USDA UV-B data under clear-sky conditions. To facilitate this, a cloud detection scheme based on Long and Ackerman (2000) is incorporated to distinguish clear versus cloudy sky conditions from the UV-B observations. The model input includes in situ measurements of the column ozone and total aerosol optical depth; TOMS retrievals of the column ozone (in case missing in situ) and climatologically surface reflectivity; and the NARR (North American Regional Analysis) meteorological conditions. The TUV results agree well with the UV-B measurements at 7 narrow spectral bands (300, 305, 311, 317, 325, 332, 368 nn).","Univ Illinois, Illinois State Water Survey, Urbana, IL USA",Illinois State Water Survey; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Xu, M (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Illinois State Water Survey, Urbana, IL USA.",minxu@uiuc.edu,"Gao, Wei/GXH-0380-2022","Xu, Min/0000-0003-3443-0300",,,,,21,2,2,1,6,SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING,BELLINGHAM,"1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010 USA",0277-786X,1996-756X,0-8194-6377-9,PROC SPIE,,,2006,,,,,,,62980N,10.1117/12.680122,http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.680122,,,8,Ecology; Remote Sensing,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Remote Sensing,BFM14,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000243026400016,View Full Record in Web of Science

CCS is now considered to be one of the key options for climate change mitigation. This perspective provides a brief summary of the state of the art regarding CCS development and discusses the implications for the further development of CCS, particularly with respect to climate change policy. The aim is to provide general perspectives on CCS, although examples used to illustrate the prospects for CCS are mainly taken from Europe. The rationale for developing CCS should be the over-abundance of fossil fuel reserves (and resources) in a climate change context. However, CCS will only be implemented if society is willing to attach a sufficiently high price to CO2 emissions. Although arguments have been put forward both in favor and against CCS, the author of this perspective argues that the most important outcome from the successful commercialization of CCS will be that fossil-fuel-dependent economies will find it easier to comply with stringent greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction targets. In contrast, failure to implement CCS will require that the global community agrees almost immediately to start phasing out the use of fossil fuels; such an agreement seems more unrealistic than reaching a global agreement on stringent GHG reductions. Thus, in the near term, it is crucial to initiate demonstration projects, such as those supported by the EU. If this is not done, there is a risk that the introduction of CCS will be significantly delayed. Among the stakeholders in CCS technologies (R&D actors in industry and academia), the year 2020 is typically considered to be the year in which CCS will be commercially available. Considering the lead times for CCS development and the slow pace of implementation of climate policy (post-Copenhagen), the target year of 2020 seems rather optimistic.

One way to reduce significantly building energy consumption is to adopt energy efficiency technologies and strategies. Due to environmental concerns and high cost of energy in current years there has been a renewed interest in building energy efficiency. Advanced control strategies provide a more efficient way of minimizing energy demand of buildings and maintaining indoor environmental quality in accordance with global principle of sustainability, which has also proven reliable for diverse applications such as Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) control and thermal comfort control etc. The objective of this paper is to review the control strategies in buildings, particularly focusing on low energy buildings (LEB), in recent 10 years. Present work consists of why to use control strategies in buildings, categories of control strategies, research literature for building performance affected by diverse control strategies from the perspective of theoretical modelling, physical experimental study and numerical simulation investigation. Following that, more than 20 parameters affecting control performance have been analyzed and evaluated. The literature has illustrated that the best overall performance of control strategy is proportional integral derivative control-model predictive control (PID-MPC); the effects of those parameters on control performance are completely different, depending on which exact initial conditions and the interaction between different factors.

This is a unique environment where natural and anthropogenic aerosols and a semipermanent and widespread stratocumulus (Sc) cloud deck are found. The project aims to understand the dynamical, chemical, and radiative processes involved in aerosol-cloud-radiation interactions over land and ocean and under various meteorological conditions. The AEROCLO-sA field campaign was conducted in August and September of 2017 over Namibia. An aircraft equipped with active and passive remote sensors and aerosol in situ probes performed a total of 30 research flight hours. In parallel, a ground-based mobile station with state-of-the-art in situ aerosol probes and remote sensing instrumentation was implemented over coastal Namibia, and complemented by ground-based and balloonborne observations of the dynamical, thermodynamical, and physical properties of the lower troposphere. The focus laid on mineral dust emitted from salty pans and ephemeral riverbeds in northern Namibia, the advection of biomass-burning aerosol plumes from Angola subsequently transported over the Atlantic Ocean, and aerosols in the marine boundary layer at the ocean-atmosphere interface. This article presents an overview of the AEROCLO-sA field campaign with results from the airborne and surface measurements. These observations provide new knowledge of the interactions of aerosols and radiation in cloudy and clear skies in connection with the atmospheric dynamics over southern Africa. They will foster new advanced climate simulations and enhance the capability of spaceborne sensors, ultimately allowing a better prediction of future climate and weather in southern Africa.","[Formenti, Paola;

It is generally recognised that wetlands are and remain fragile ecosystems that should be subject to sustainable conservation and management through the use of sustainable tools. In this paper, we propose a synthesis of the state of art concerning coupled hydrologic and hydraulic models for floodplains assessments in Africa. Case studies reviewed in this paper have pointed out the potential of applying coupled hydrologic and hydraulic models and the opportunities present to be used in Africa especially for data scarce and large basin for floodplain assessments through the use of available open access models, coupling frameworks and remotely sensed datasets. To our knowledge this is the first case study review of this kind on this topic. A Hydrological model coupled with Hydraulic Model of the floodplain provides improvements in floodplain model simulations and hence better information for floodplain management. Consequently, this would lead to improved decision-making and planning of adaption and mitigation measures for sound floodplain wetland management plans and programmes especially with the advent of climate change and variability.","[Chomba, Innocent C.; Banda, Kawawa E.; Mataa, Mulema; Ngwenya, Victoria; Nyambe, Imasiku A.] Univ Zambia, Integrated Water Resources Management Ctr, Sch Mines, Dept Geol, Lusaka 32379, Zambia; [Winsemius, Hessel C.] Water Resources Delft Univ Technol, Fac Civil Engn & Geosci, NL-5048 Delft, Netherlands; [Chomba, Machaya J.; Ellender, Bruce] Worldwide Fund Nat WWF Zambia, Plot 4978,Los Angeles Blvd,Lusaka 50051RW, Longacres, Zambia; [Sichingabula, Henry M.] Univ Zambia, Sch Nat Sci, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, Lusaka 32379, Zambia",University of Zambia; University of Zambia,"Chomba, IC (corresponding author), Univ Zambia, Integrated Water Resources Management Ctr, Sch Mines, Dept Geol, Lusaka 32379, Zambia.",2018269976@student.unza.zm; kawawa.banda@unza.zm; hessel.winsemius@deltares.nl; mchomba@wwfzam.org; 2018270109@student.unza.zm; 2018245280@student.unza.zm; sichingabula@unza.zm; inyambe@unza.zm; bellender@wwfzam.org,,"Banda, Kawawa/0000-0001-7083-3014; Chomba, Innocent C./0000-0003-0410-8492; Winsemius, H.C./0000-0001-5471-172X","Worldwide Fund for Nature (WWF) Zambia under Upper Zambezi Programme through theWetland Assessment and Ecosystem Services Project (WASP) at The University of Zambia, Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM)-Centre [40001528]","Worldwide Fund for Nature (WWF) Zambia under Upper Zambezi Programme through theWetland Assessment and Ecosystem Services Project (WASP) at The University of Zambia, Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM)-Centre","This work was funded by Worldwide Fund for Nature (WWF) Zambia, grant number 40001528 under Upper Zambezi Programme through theWetland Assessment and Ecosystem Services Project (WASP) at The University of Zambia, Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM)-Centre hosted in the Geology Department, School of Mines.",,60,10,11,6,11,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2306-5338,,HYDROLOGY-BASEL,Hydrology,MAR,2021,1,,,,,,44,10.3390/hydrology8010044,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/hydrology8010044,,,12,Water Resources,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Water Resources,RC9OL,,"gold, Green Published",,,12/21/22,WOS:000633121200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The major findings are that there have been major advances in the fields understanding of the structure of corrosion patina, in particular their layered structure and the presence of compact layers, local corrosion attacks have been found to be a significant process in atmospheric corrosion and experiments under droplets are leading to new understanding of the criticality of drop size in regulating atmospheric corrosion processes. Further research is indicating that zinc oxide within corrosion products may promote the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and that, in porous oxides, the ORR would control pore chemistry and may promote oxide densification.

Urban energy and carbon models are emerging as a vital tool for local authorities that wish to understand the greenhouse gas emissions of their city and how to reduce them. The linkage between policy processes and tools is rarely recognized and tools are deployed ad hoc. A set of policy-relevant assessment criteria is proposed and used to review the emergent state-of-the-art in UK urban energy and carbon modelling. Drawing on the authors' own experience and the literature, a differentiation is made between accounting-style inventory tools and policy modelling tools. It is argued that although part of the same overall policy process, these two approaches lack consistency in methods and implementation. A comparison with local air pollution modelling makes this contrast apparent. A lack of clarity exists for the use of modelling in urban energy and carbon policy processes. A normalized urban modelling practice would ensure consistency while preserving local flexibility.","[Calderon, Carlos] Newcastle Univ, Sch Architecture Planning & Landscape, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England; [Keirstead, James] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, London SW7 2AZ, England",Newcastle University - UK; Imperial College London,"Calderon, C (corresponding author), Newcastle Univ, Sch Architecture Planning & Landscape, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England.",carlos.calderon@ncl.ac.uk; j.keirstead@imperial.ac.uk,,"Calderon, Carlos/0000-0003-1201-7160",Newcastle University and Newcastle City Council; BP,Newcastle University and Newcastle City Council; BP,The authors would like to acknowledge the support of Newcastle University and Newcastle City Council in conducting this research.

Pinatubo eruption: reconciling models and observations,ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,STRATOSPHERIC SUDDEN WARMINGS; VOLCANIC-ERUPTIONS; ATMOSPHERIC CIRCULATION; EL-CHICHON; PART I; CLIMATE; TEMPERATURE; AEROSOL; IMPACT; VARIABILITY,"It has been suggested, and is widely believed, that the anomalous surface warming observed over the Northern Hemisphere continents in the winter following the 1991 eruption of Mt. Pinatubo was, in fact, caused by that eruption, via a stratospheric pathway that involves a strengthening of the polar vortex. However, most studies that have examined multiple, state-of-the-art, coupled climate models report that, in the ensemble mean, the models do not show winter warming after the Mt. Pinatubo eruption. This lack of surface warming in the multi-model mean, concomitant with a frequent lack of strengthening of the polar vortex, is often interpreted as a failure of the models to reproduce the observations. In this paper we show that this interpretation is erroneous, as averaging many simulations from different models, or from the same model, is not expected to yield surface anomalies similar to the observed ones, even if the models were highly accurate, owing to the presence of strong internal variability. We here analyze three large ensembles of state-of-theart, coupled climate model simulations and show that, in all three, many individual ensemble members are able to produce post-Pinatubo surface warming in winter that is comparable to the observed one. This establishes that current-generation climate models are perfectly capable of reproducing the observed surface post-eruption warming. We also confirm the bulk of previous studies, and show that the surface anomaly is not statistically different from zero when averaged across ensembles of simulations, which we inter- pret as the simple fact that the volcanic impact on continental winter temperatures is tiny compared to internal variability. We also carefully examine the stratospheric pathway in our models and, again confirming previous work, show that any strengthening of the polar vortex caused by the Mt. Pinatubo eruption is very small (of the order of a few meters per second at best). Such minuscule anomalies of the stratospheric circulation are completely overwhelmed by the tropospheric variability at midlatitudes, which is known to be very large: this explains the lack of surface winter warming in the ensemble means. In summary, our analysis and interpretation offer compelling new evidence that the observed warming of the Northern Hemisphere continents in the winter 1991-1992 was very likely unrelated to the 1991 Mt. Pinatubo eruption.","[Polvani, Lorenzo M.; Banerjee, Antara] Columbia Univ, Dept Appl Phys & Appl Math, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Polvani, Lorenzo M.; Banerjee, Antara] Columbia Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Polvani, Lorenzo M.] Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY 10964 USA; [Schmidt, Anja] Univ Cambridge, Dept Chem, Lensfield Rd, Cambridge CB2 1EW, England; [Schmidt, Anja] Univ Cambridge, Dept Geog, Downing Pl, Cambridge CB2 3EN, England",Columbia University; Columbia University; Columbia University; University of Cambridge; University of Cambridge,"Polvani, LM (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Dept Appl Phys & Appl Math, New York, NY 10027 USA.;Polvani, LM (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, New York, NY 10027 USA.;Polvani, LM (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY 10964 USA.",lmp@columbia.edu,"Polvani, Lorenzo M/E-5949-2011; Schmidt, Anja/ABD-7113-2021; Banerjee, Antara/ABC-1903-2020","Schmidt, Anja/0000-0001-8759-2843; ","US National Science Foundation [AGS 14-02931, AGS1322449]; NERC [NE/S000887/1] Funding Source: UKRI",US National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),This research has been supported by the US National Science Foundation (grant nos.

Despite technical advances in the past decade, there are still misconceptions about DAC's current and long-term costs as well as energy, water and area demands. This could undermine DAC's anticipated role in a neutral or negative greenhouse gas emission energy system, and influence policy makers. In this study, a literature review and techno-economic analyses of state-of-the-art DAC technologies are performed, wherein, DAC technologies are categorised as high temperature aqueous solutions (HT DAC) and low temperature solid sorbent (LT DAC) systems, from an energy system perspective. DAC capital expenditures, energy demands and costs have been estimated under two scenarios for DAC capacities and financial learning rates in the period 2020 to 2050. DAC system costs could be lowered significantly with commercialisation in the 2020s followed by massive implementation in the 2040s and 2050s, making them cost competitive with point source carbon capture and an affordable climate change mitigation solution. It is concluded that LT DAC systems are favourable due to lower heat supply costs and the possibility of using waste heat from other systems. CO2 capture costs of LT DAC systems powered by hybrid PV-Wind-battery systems for Moroccan conditions and based on a conservative scenario, without/with utilisation of free waste heat are calculated at 222/133, 105/60, 69/40 and 54/32 (sic)/t(CO2) in 2020, 2030, 2040 and 2050, respectively.

While warmer temperatures are believed to increase rates of weathering, weathering in cool climates can be accelerated by increased mineral exposure due to mechanical weathering by ice. In this study, chemical weathering of silicate minerals is investigated in a small temperate watershed. The Jamieson Creek watershed is covered by mature coniferous forest and receives high annual precipitation (4000 mm), mostly in the form of rainfall, and is underlain by quartz diorite bedrock and glacial till. Analysis of pore water concentration gradients indicates that weathering in hydraulically unsaturated ablation till is dominated by dissolution of plagioclase and hornblende. However, a watershed scale solute mass balance indicates high relative fluxes of K and Ca, indicating preferential leaching of these solutes possibly from the relatively unweathered lodgement till. Weathering rates for plagioclase and hornblende calculated from a watershed scale solute mass balance are similar in magnitude to rates determined using pore water concentration gradients. When compared to the Rio Icacos basin in Puerto Rico, a pristine tropical watershed with similar annual precipitation and bedrock, but with dissimilar regolith properties. fluxes of weathering products in stream discharge from the warmer site are 1.8 to 16.2-fold higher, respectively, and regolith profile-averaged plagioclase weathering rates are 3.8 to 9.0-fold higher. This suggests that the Arrhenius effect, which predicts a 3.5- to 9-fold increase in the dissolution rate of plagioclase as temperature is increased from 3.4 degrees to 22 degrees C, may explain the greater weathering fluxes and rates at the Rio Icacos site. However, more modest differences in K and Ca fluxes between the two sites are attributed to accelerated leaching of those solutes from glacial till at Jamieson Creek. Our findings suggest that under conditions of high rainfall and favorable topography, weathering rates of silicate minerals in warm tropical systems will tend to be higher than in cool temperate systems, even if the temperate system is has been perturbed by an episode of glaciation that deposits regolith high in fresh mineral surface area.

In this regard, the professional and scientific potential of regenerative architecture can only be fully realized by the identification of the key barriers to projects design, construction and operation. In this paper, we compare two state of the art buildings to address the critical steps in the transition from the negative impact reduction architecture to the positive impact regenerative architecture, utilizing life cycle analysis.

However, stricter discharge standards, changes in wastewater compounds, high emissions of greenhouse gases, and elevated land prices have led to their replacements in many places. This review aims at delivering a comprehensive overview of the historical development and current state of WSPs, and providing further insights to deal with their limitations in the future. The 21st century is witnessing changes in the way of approaching conventional problems in pond technology, in which WSPs should no longer be considered as a low treatment technology. Advanced models and technologies have been integrated for better design, control, and management. The roles of algae, which have been crucial as solar-powered aeration, will continue being a key solution. Yet, the separation of suspended algae to avoid deterioration of the effluent remains a major challenge in WSPs while in the case of high algal rate pond, further research is needed to maximize algal growth yield, select proper strains, and optimize harvesting methods to put algal biomass production in practice. Significant gaps need to be filled in understanding mechanisms of greenhouse gas emission, climate change mitigation, pond ecosystem services, and the fate and toxicity of emerging contaminants. From these insights, adaptation strategies are developed to deal with new opportunities and future challenges.","[Ho, Long; Goethals, Peter L.

In this study, a drought forecasting system based on eight state-of-the-art climate models from the North American Multi-Model Ensemble (NMME) and a Distributed Time-Variant Gain Hydrological Model (DTVGM) was established and assessed over the upstream and midstream of Heihe River basin (UHRB and MHRB), a typical arid endorheic basin. The 3-month Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI3) and 1-month Standardized Streamflow Index (SSI1) were used to capture meteorological and hydrological drought, and values below - 1 indicate drought events. The skill of the forecasting systems was evaluated in terms of anomaly correlation (AC) and Brier score (BS) or Brier skill score (BSS). The predictability for meteorological drought was quantified using AC and BS with a perfect model assumption, referring to the upper limit of forecast skill. The hydrological predictability was to distinguish the role of initial hydrological conditions (ICs) and meteorological forcings, which was quantified by root-mean-square error (RMSE) within the ESP (Ensemble Streamflow Prediction) and reverse ESP framework. The UHRB and MHRB showed season-dependent meteorological drought predictability and forecast skill, with higher values during winter and autumn than that during spring. For hydrological forecasts, the forecast skill in the UHRB was higher than that in MHRB. Predicting meteorological droughts more than 2 months in advance became difficult because of complex climate mechanisms. However, the hydrological drought forecasts could show some skills up to 3-6 lead months due to memory of ICs during cold and dry sea-sons. During wet seasons, there are no skillful hydrological predictions from lead month 2 onwards because of the dominant role of meteorological forcings. During spring, the improvement of hydrological drought predictions was the most significant as more streamflow was generated by seasonal snowmelt. Besides meteorological forcings and ICs, human activities have reduced the hydrological variability and increased hydrological drought predictability during the wet seasons in the MHRB.","[Ma, Feng; Ye, Aizhong; Duan, Qingyun] Beijing Normal Univ, Fac Geog Sci, State Key Lab Earth Surface & Ecol Resources, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Ma, Feng; Luo, Lifeng] Michigan State Univ, Dept Geog Environm & Spatial Sci, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Beijing Normal University; Michigan State University,"Ye, AZ (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, Fac Geog Sci, State Key Lab Earth Surface & Ecol Resources, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",azye@bnu.edu.cn,"Duan, Qingyun/C-7652-2011","Duan, Qingyun/0000-0001-9955-1512; ye, aizhong/0000-0002-5272-134X; Luo, Lifeng/0000-0002-2829-7104","Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA19070104, XDA20060401]; Natural Science Foundation of China [51879009, 41475093]; State Key Laboratory of Earth Surface Processes and Resource Ecology Open Research Program [2017-KF-17]; Water Science Network WaterCube Program at Michigan State University",Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); State Key Laboratory of Earth Surface Processes and Resource Ecology Open Research Program; Water Science Network WaterCube Program at Michigan State University,"This work was supported by the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (no.

These sites cover different climatic conditions, land use and land cover, and water management practices. Here we present the initial analysis of the measurements taken at seven sites mainly focusing on the year 2017, quantifying for the first time the remarkable contrasts in evaporative fraction across the seasons, climate zones and land management practices of the Indian subcontinent. With the exception of Jaisalmer which is the driest of the places studied, all the sites maintain values of evaporative fraction above 0.5 after the monsoon through to November. By contrast, for those sites with natural vegetation or rain-fed agriculture, evaporative fraction remains below 0.3 for the dry January-May period. In the middle Gangetic Plain area, irrigation and pre-monsoon showers together maintain evaporative fraction above 0.5 between January and June. It is also observed that different variables exhibit different intraseasonal variation characteristics even at one site. Except for Samastipur which is situated in the middle Indo-Gangetic Plains, wind speed shows spectral peak at a smaller time-scale compared to sensible and latent heat fluxes.","[Bhat, G.

The model is forced by two high-resolution (30 km) regional climate models (RegCM3 and WRF) output in the Euro-Mediterranean region for the period 2002-2007. First a validation of the regional models surface climatology is conducted in comparison to gridded meteorological station data and to other state of the art regional models. Then annual cycles and interannual variability of latent and sensible heat, gross primary production, and net ecosystem exchange are compared to in situ experimental data provided from the CARBOEUROPE network. Six sites were chosen across the Euro-Mediterranean region, representing different forest environments. Results show that ORCHIDEE is able to reproduce the annual cycle of heat and carbon fluxes, with errors comparable with the measurement uncertainties. The interannual variations appear more problematic. While the variations of sensible heat are at least of the same sign as observed, latent heat is less well reproduced, while there is hardly any skill in reproducing carbon fluxes. The main difference between the two regional models used for forcing is an excessive precipitation produced on average by RegCM3. This causes errors in the latent heat and gross primary production of ORCHIDEE.","[Anav, Alessandro; D'Andrea, Fabio] Ecole Normale Super, IPSL, Lab Meteorol Dynam, F-75231 Paris 05, France; [Viovy, Nicolas; Vuichard, Nicolas] Lab Sci Climat & Environm, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France",UDICE-French Research Universities; PSL Research University Paris; Ecole Normale Superieure (ENS); Sorbonne Universite; Universite Paris Cite; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; CEA; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Anav, A (corresponding author), Ecole Normale Super, IPSL, Lab Meteorol Dynam, 24 Rue Lhomond, F-75231 Paris 05, France.",alessandro.anav@lmd.polytechnique.fr; dandrea@lmd.ens.fr; nicolas.viovy@lsce.ipsl.fr; nicolas.vuichard@lsce.ipsl.fr,"Viovy, Nicolas/S-2631-2018; Anav, Alessandro/P-2284-2018; Vuichard, Nicolas/A-6629-2011","Viovy, Nicolas/0000-0002-9197-6417; Anav, Alessandro/0000-0002-4217-7563; D'Andrea, Fabio/0000-0002-6249-3168; Vuichard, Nicolas/0000-0002-3397-7948",ENSEMBLES; ECAD,ENSEMBLES; ECAD,"We especially thank the investigators and the teams managing the Hainich, Tharandt, Hyytiala, Soro, Loobos, and Hesse eddy-flux sites.

METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of births involving gestational surrogacy in Utah from 2009 to 2018. Data were obtained from birth certificates. State and country of residence were collected for intended parents, and the legal climates of these locations were assessed by reviewing laws at the time. Sociodemographic characteristics were compared among intended parents, parents with pregnancies resulting from assisted reproductive technology (ART) without gestational surrogacy, and parents with spontaneous pregnancies. RESULTS: A total of 361 gestational carrier pregnancies resulted in the birth of at least one liveborn neonate during the study period, involving 715 intended parents. Additionally, 50,434 parents delivered children after nonsurrogacy ART, and 950,460 parents delivered children after spontaneous fertilization. Many intended parents (17.2%) lived in countries outside of the United States, the majority of which (69.9%) had laws against surrogacy. Of those who lived within the United States, 57.4% lived outside of Utah, but only 15.9% lived in states that banned compensated surrogacy. Statutes in Utah support compensated and uncompensated gestational surrogacy. Intended parents were significantly older than parents with both nonsurrogacy ART pregnancies and spontaneous pregnancies (median age 38, 31, and 29 years, respectively) and had higher levels of education; 70.2% of intended parents had a bachelor's degree or above, compared with 48.2% of parents with nonsurrogacy ART pregnancies and 33.1% of parents with spontaneous pregnancies. DISCUSSION: A majority of intended parents live outside of Utah, which may be an important consideration for health care professionals caring for women with gestational carrier pregnancies. However, most intended parents live in places that do not have laws banning surrogacy, suggesting that there may be other reasons that intended parents travel for delivery.","Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Obstet Gynecol & Reprod Sci, Div Maternal Fetal Med, San Francisco, CA USA; Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Pediat, Div Med Genet, San Francisco, CA USA; Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Obstet Gynecol & Reprod Sci, San Francisco, CA USA; Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, San Francisco, CA USA; Univ Utah, Ctr Reprod Med, Salt Lake City, UT USA; Univ Utah Hlth, Div Maternal Fetal Med, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Salt Lake City, UT USA",University of California System; University of California San Francisco; University of California System; University of California San Francisco; University of California System; University of California San Francisco; University of California System; University of California San Francisco; Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah; Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah,"Swanson, K (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Div Maternal Fetal Med, Dept Obstet Gynecol & Reprod Sci, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.",katherine.swanson@ucsf.edu,,"Swanson, Kate/0000-0003-1174-1501; Einerson, Brett/0000-0003-1928-4333",,,,,9,0,0,0,8,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",0029-7844,,,OBSTET GYNECOL,Obstet.

This study assesses and discusses the current state of the art and trends in NTFP yield modelling in Europe and the integration of the models in multi-functional forest management planning at different spatial scales. Recent Findings Climate-sensitive empirical yield models already exist not only for a variety of NTFPs that are economically important to forest owners (e.g. cork and pine nuts) but also for wild-gathered berries and mushrooms, the harvesting of which cannot be controlled by the forest landowner in all European countries. Several studies on multi-functional forest management planning consider the economic profitability of the joint production of timber and NTFP. Harvesting NTFPs can create significant additional incomes for forest owners, compared with timber production only. However, maximizing the economic returns from the joint production of timber and NTFPs often calls for changes in forest management practices. Continued efforts in modelling and predicting the yields of NTFPs have enabled forest managers to further expand the analyses of multi-functional forest planning and management in Europe. Climate-sensitive models also allow analyses on the potential effects of climate change on NTFP yields. New models and forest management practices are still needed for tree fruits, birch sap, a wider variety of wild edible mushrooms, specialty mushrooms cultivated on live trees as well as medicinal and edible forest herbs harvested for commercial value in Europe.","[Miina, Jari; Kurttila, Mikko] Nat Resources Inst Finland Luke, Yliopistokatu 6 B, Joensuu 80100, Finland; [Calama, Rafael] Forest Res Ctr, CIFOR, INIA, Ctra A Coruna Km 7-5, Madrid 28040, Spain; [de-Miguel, Sergio] Univ Lleida, Dept Crop & Forest Sci, Ave Alcalde Rovira Roure 191, Lleida 25198, Spain; [de-Miguel, Sergio] Agrotecnio, Joint Res Unit CTFC, Ctra St Llorenc Morunys Km 2, Solsona 25280, Spain; [Pukkala, Timo] Univ Eastern Finland, Sch Forest Sci, Fac Sci & Forestry, POB 111, Joensuu 80101, Finland",Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke); Instituto Nacional Investigacion Tecnologia Agraria Alimentaria (INIA); Universitat de Lleida; University of Eastern Finland,"Miina, J (corresponding author), Nat Resources Inst Finland Luke, Yliopistokatu 6 B, Joensuu 80100, Finland.",jari.miina@luke.fi; mikko.kurttila@luke.fi; rcalama@inia.es; sergio.demiguel@udl.cat; timo.pukkala@uef.fi,"de Miguel, Sergio/B-8358-2016","de Miguel, Sergio/0000-0002-9738-0657","Natural Resources Institute Finland (LUKE); PROPINEA [CC16-095]; Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities, Government of Spain [RTI2018-099315-A-I00]; European Commission's Horizon 2020 programme [774632]","Natural Resources Institute Finland (LUKE); PROPINEA; Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities, Government of Spain; European Commission's Horizon 2020 programme","Open access funding provided by Natural Resources Institute Finland (LUKE).

The design of an optimal irrigation management plan, based on state-of-the-art measuring and modeling tools, can effectively contribute towards water saving efforts and potentially address the water scarcity issue in the region. This paper describes the development and application of an integrated decision-making system for the management of water resources of olive and citrus crops in the North of Chania. Crete, Greece. The system integrates different field measurements, for example 2088 soil moisture measurements taken within the study area, and modeling approaches to simulate flow in the unsaturated zone. After the successful calibration and validation of the model, the spatio-temporal representation of soil moisture and pore water pressure were used as guidance for developing optimal irrigation plans, taking into account the water needs of olive and citrus crops, aiming to maximize crop yield, agricultural income, and promote water saving efforts. According to the results, water use can be reduced by up to 36% during the dry season, compared to conventional irrigation practices for citrus trees. Similarly, for olive trees, the reduction in water use can reach up to 41%. The proposed methodology can also be cost-effective in terms of water value, saving about 40% from the typical water cost for irrigation in the study area. The impact of dimate change on water resources availability in the area and water conservation efforts were also investigated for the period of (2019-2030).

This reflective self-study explores how two literacy instructors tried to demonstrate an ethic of care in a Language Arts methods course, a site where issues of equity are complicated by dominant and often exclusionary definitions of literacy within a larger, standards-based climate. Seeking to generate conversations about equity in literacy education while 'caring for' our students, we applied developing educational principles of Universal Design. In this paper, we discuss the complicated considerations encountered as we integrated inclusive literacy practices within an ethic of care while tending to the pedagogical needs of pre-service literacy teachers.","[Holbrook, Teri; Moore, Christi] Georgia State Univ, Dept Early Childhood Educ, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Zoss, Michelle] Georgia State Univ, Dept Early Childhood Educ, Dept Middle Secondary Educ & Instruct Technol, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia State University; University System of Georgia; Georgia State University,"Holbrook, T (corresponding author), Georgia State Univ, Dept Early Childhood Educ, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA.",tholbrook@gsu.edu,,,,,,,31,1,1,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1462-3943,1470-1103,,REFLECT PRACT,Reflect.

The photocatalytic reduction of CO2 into hydrocarbon fuels is a promising way to recycle CO2 as a fuel feedstock by taking advantage of the readily available solar energy. This article reviews the basics of CO2 photoreduction mechanisms, limiting steps, possible strategies to enhance photoreduction efficiency, and the state-of-the-art photocatalytic systems for CO2 reduction.

Here we present a process-based model designed to correctly represent the main thermal, hydrological, and biogeochemical processes related to these emissions for general land surface modeling. We propose a new multilayer soil carbon and gas module within the Interaction Soil-Biosphere-Atmosphere (ISBA) land-surface model (LSM). This module represents carbon pools, vertical carbon dynamics, and both oxic and anoxic organic matter decomposition. It also represents the soil gas processes for CH4, CO2, and O-2 through the soil column. We base CH4 production and oxydation on an O-2 control instead of the classical water table level strata approach used in state-of-the-art soil CH4 models. We propose a new parametrization of CH4 oxydation using recent field experiments and use an explicit O-2 limitation for soil carbon decomposition. Soil gas transport is computed explicitly, using a revisited formulation of plant-mediated transport, a new representation of gas bulk diffusivity in porous media closer to experimental observations, and an innovative advection term for ebullition. We evaluate this advanced model on three climatically distinct sites : two in Greenland (Nuuk and Zackenberg) and one in Siberia (Chokurdakh). The model realistically reproduces methane and carbon dioxide emissions from both permafrosted and nonpermafrosted sites. The evolution and vertical characteristics of the underground processes leading to these fluxes are consistent with current knowledge. Results also show that physics is the main driver of methane fluxes, and the main source of variability appears to be the water table depth.","[Morel, X.; Decharme, B.; Delire, C.] CNRS, Meteo France, UMR 3589, CNRM, Toulouse, France; [Krinner, G.] Lab Glaciol & Geophys Environm, Grenoble, France; [Lund, M.; Mastepanov, M.] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, Arctic Res Ctr, Roskilde, Denmark; [Hansen, B.

The role of the atmospheric energy transport in this extreme melt event is explored using the state-of-the-art ERA-Interim reanalysis data. We find that in summer 2007 there was an anomalous atmospheric flow of warm and humid air into the region that suffered severe melt. This anomaly was larger than during any other year in the data (1989-2008). Convergence of the atmospheric energy transport over this area led to positive anomalies of the downward longwave radiation and turbulent fluxes. In the region that experienced unusual ice melt, the net anomaly of the surface fluxes provided enough extra energy to melt roughly one meter of ice during the melting season. When the ocean successively became ice-free, the surface-albedo decreased causing additional absorption of shortwave radiation, despite the fact that the downwelling solar radiation was smaller than average. We argue that the positive anomalies of net downward longwave radiation and turbulent fluxes played a key role in initiating the 2007 extreme ice melt, whereas the shortwave-radiation changes acted as an amplifying feedback mechanism in response to the melt.","[Graversen, Rune G.; Drijfhout, Sybren] Royal Netherlands Meteorol Inst, NL-3732 GK De Bilt, Netherlands; [Mauritsen, Thorsten] Max Planck Inst Meteorol, Hamburg, Germany; [Tjernstrom, Michael; Martensson, Sebastian] Stockholm Univ, Dept Meteorol, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden",Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute; Max Planck Society; Stockholm University,"Graversen, RG (corresponding author), Royal Netherlands Meteorol Inst, Wilhelminalaan 10, NL-3732 GK De Bilt, Netherlands.",graversen@knmi.nl,"Drijfhout, Sybren/I-4230-2016; Tjernström, Michael/AAF-3481-2020; Graversen, Rune G/C-3956-2016; Mauritsen, Thorsten/G-5880-2013","Mauritsen, Thorsten/0000-0003-1418-4077; Graversen, Rune/0000-0003-4899-553X; Tjernstrom, Michael/0000-0002-6908-7410","Ministry of Transport, Public Works and Water Management, The Netherlands; International Meteorological Institute (IMI), Sweden; EU","Ministry of Transport, Public Works and Water Management, The Netherlands; International Meteorological Institute (IMI), Sweden; EU(European Commission)","The authors are thankful to Per Pemberton, SMHI, for providing sea-ice model data and to John Walsh, Mxolisi Shongwe, Frank Selten, and Robert Pickart for useful comments on the manuscript.

Upon reaching the East Baltic, crops like wheat and barley were exposed to a different environment consisting of a continental climate with very distinct seasonal patterns, different soils, vernalization and photoperiod patterns that were crucial for plant development and growth. In this paper I take previously postulated ideas on the delay of agriculture in north-west Europe and the Alpine region of Eurasia to suggest that similar reasons could have been responsible for the delay of cereal cultivation in the eastern Baltic region. Here I argue that the slow introduction rate of cereal cultivation occurred not only due to human choice, as alternative wild resources were available, but due to the time it took for crops to adjust to environmental changes. In addition, the establishment of an ultimate crop species package was an important development that allowed better plant adaptation to novel environmental conditions and the reduction of crop failure. In this publication the term geographical margin is used not in the sense of climatic hostility and difficulties for human subsistence but rather from the perspective of plant species of south-west Asian origin.","[Matuzeviciute, Giedre Motuzaite] Vilnius Univ, Hist Fac, Dept Archaeol, 7 Univ G, LT-01122 Vilnius, Lithuania",Vilnius University,"Matuzeviciute, GM (corresponding author), Vilnius Univ, Hist Fac, Dept Archaeol, 7 Univ G, LT-01122 Vilnius, Lithuania.",giedre.motuzaite@gmail.com,"Motuzaite Matuzeviciute, Giedre/AAK-2928-2021","Motuzaite Matuzeviciute, Giedre/0000-0001-9069-1551","European Social Fund [09.3.3-LMT-K-712]; Estonian Academy of Sciences; Institute of History and Archaeology at the University of Tartu; Institute of History, Archaeology and Art History of Tallinn University","European Social Fund(European Social Fund (ESF)); Estonian Academy of Sciences; Institute of History and Archaeology at the University of Tartu; Institute of History, Archaeology and Art History of Tallinn University","This research is funded by the European Social Fund according to the activity 'Improvement of researchers' qualification by implementing world-class R&D projects' of Measure No. 09.3.3-LMT-K-712.

In the highly dynamic coastal ocean, the presence of small-scales processes. the lack of real-time data, and the limited skill of operational models at the meso-scale have so far limited the application of SE methods. Here, we report results from state-of-the-art super-ensemble techniques in which SEPTR (a trawl-resistant bottom mounted instrument platform transmitting data in near real-time) temperature profile data are combined with outputs from eight ocean models run in a coastal area during the Dynamics of the Adriatic in Real-Time (DART) experiment in 2006. New Kalman filter and particle filter based SE methods, which allow for dynamic evolution of weights and associated uncertainty, are compared to standard SE techniques and numerical models. Results show that dynamic SE are able to significantly improve prediction skill. In particular, the particle fitter SE copes with non-Gaussian error statistics and provides robust and reduced uncertainty estimates. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Concurrently, the poleward heat transport from the North Atlantic Ocean into the Arctic has increased, partly contributing to the loss of sea ice. Increasing the horizontal resolution of general circulation models (GCMs) improves their ability to represent the complex interplay of processes at high latitudes. Here, we investigate the impact of model resolution on Arctic sea ice and Atlantic Ocean heat transport (OHT) by using five different state-of-the-art coupled GCMs (12 model configurations in total) that include dynamic representations of the ocean, atmosphere and sea ice. The models participate in the High Resolution Model Intercomparison Project (HighResMIP) of the sixth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). Model results over the period 1950-2014 are compared to different observational datasets. In the models studied, a finer ocean resolution drives lower Arctic sea-ice area and volume and generally enhances Atlantic OHT. The representation of ocean surface characteristics, such as sea-surface temperature (SST) and velocity, is greatly improved by using a finer ocean resolution. This study highlights a clear anticorrelation at interannual time scales between Arctic sea ice (area and volume) and Atlantic OHT north of 60.N in the models studied. However, the strength of this relationship is not systematically impacted by model resolution. The higher the latitude to compute OHT, the stronger the relationship between sea-ice area/volume and OHT. Sea ice in the Barents/Kara and Greenland-Iceland-Norwegian (GIN) Seas is more strongly connected to Atlantic OHT than other Arctic seas.","[Docquier, David; Ponsoni, Leandro; Massonnet, Francois; Fichefet, Thierry] Catholic Univ Louvain, Earth & Life Inst, Louvain La Neuve, Belgium; [Grist, Jeremy P.] Univ Southampton, Natl Oceanog Ctr, Southampton, Hants, England; [Roberts, Malcolm J.; Roberts, Christopher D.] Met Off, Hadley Ctr, Exeter, Devon, England; [Roberts, Christopher D.] European Ctr Medium Range Weather Forecasts, Shinfield Pk, Reading, Berks, England; [Semmler, Tido; Sidorenko, Dmitry; Sein, Dmitry V.] Helmholtz Ctr Polar & Marine Res, Alfred Wegener Inst, Bremerhaven, Germany; [Sein, Dmitry V.] Russian Acad Sci, Shirshov Inst Oceanol, Moscow, Russia; [Iovino, Doroteaciro; Bellucci, Alessio] Fdn Ctr Euromediterraneo Cambiamenti Climat CMCC, Bologna, Italy","Universite Catholique Louvain; NERC National Oceanography Centre; University of Southampton; Met Office - UK; Hadley Centre; European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF); Helmholtz Association; Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar & Marine Research; Russian Academy of Sciences; Shirshov Institute of Oceanology; Centro Euro-Mediterraneo sui Cambiamenti Climatici (CMCC)","Docquier, D (corresponding author), Catholic Univ Louvain, Earth & Life Inst, Louvain La Neuve, Belgium.",david.docquier@uclouvain.be,"Sein, Dmitry/AAI-1352-2021; Jeremy, Grist P/B-4517-2012; Docquier, David/P-5635-2019; Ponsoni, Leandro/AAC-9301-2019; Roberts, Christopher D/GRR-4034-2022; Sein, Dmitry V./P-6419-2018; Roberts, Christopher David/AAA-6692-2020; Sein, Dmitry V/GLS-0252-2022; iovino, Doroteaciro/E-9759-2015","Sein, Dmitry/0000-0002-1190-3622; Jeremy, Grist P/0000-0003-1068-9211; Ponsoni, Leandro/0000-0002-2218-271X; Roberts, Christopher D/0000-0002-2958-6637; Sein, Dmitry V./0000-0002-1190-3622; Roberts, Christopher David/0000-0002-2958-6637; IOVINO, Doroteaciro/0000-0001-5132-7255; Docquier, David/0000-0002-5720-4253; Sidorenko, Dmitry/0000-0001-8579-6068; BELLUCCI, Alessio/0000-0003-3766-1921","EU Horizon 2020 PRIMAVERA project [641727]; Natural Environment Research Council of the UK [NE/N018044/1]; Joint UK BEIS/Defra Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme [GA01101]; EU Horizon 2020 APPLICATE project [727862]; Fonds National de la Recherche Scientifique (FNRS, Belgium); state assignment of FASO Russia [0149-2019-0015]; US National Science Foundation; UK Natural Environment Research Council; Ministerio de Economia, Industria y Competitividad (MINECO, Spain); NERC [NE/N018044/1, noc010010] Funding Source: UKRI","EU Horizon 2020 PRIMAVERA project; Natural Environment Research Council of the UK(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Joint UK BEIS/Defra Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme; EU Horizon 2020 APPLICATE project; Fonds National de la Recherche Scientifique (FNRS, Belgium)(Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique - FNRS); state assignment of FASO Russia; US National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); UK Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Ministerio de Economia, Industria y Competitividad (MINECO, Spain); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC))","David Docquier, Jeremy P.

When a powerful interface between poem and reader is achieved, the poem is apprehended by both the mind and heart. This type of learning often has staying power and sparks higher electrical activity in the brain.[1] How can teachers combat the negative reputation poetry has developed for today's English Language students? Pop culture is rife with poetry. Even tweets use a condensed form of language having a derivative foothold in the land of poems. Clearly, hip-hop, rap and spoken word capture the imagination of young audiences around the world. Under-served communities of learners, English language learners and reluctant students can be opened to poetry in the English classroom with the use of spoken word, visuals, performance and classics from many traditions. In this paper, we will present learning activities for student-based success with the poetic form and will show how frequent poetry exposure increases reading fluency.[2] We will show how the classroom can become a vibrant mash-up of virtual performance, the lone human voice, voices in unison and words on the page. English Language Learners embrace poetry for its underlying musical qualities and all learners can open up to reading and writing in this genre which can be politically ardent and sometimes fraught with the emotions of our human condition. Questions arise when suggesting poetry as a valid educational tool in a world of non-fiction worship. In the United States alone, the Common Core standards currently adopted by most states, marginalizes poetry and fiction. Are we to be a world of educated persons adept at reading operating instructions and descriptions of mechanical entities alone? Our global challenge includes being able to communicate with one another and to understand a multitude of perspectives. How do we achieve precision in our speech and in our writing and understanding of what we are trying to say? All humans have suffered from the frustration of not feeling understood or what William Wordsworth calls, The sad incompetence of human speech.[3] Do we as educators have a mandate to keep our species moving toward eloquence and understanding. If so, how do we accomplish this? With poetry as a vehicle we are catapulted to levels of empathy and incisiveness. In poetry this happens by means of repetition and the direct manipulation of sound and imagery so that the brain experiences bursts of insight. This paper critically examines the meaning and use of the heightened language of poetry. How does intensity in language differ from exaggeration? Do we, as humans, have a psychic need for originality? Can we recognize original thought or are we losing touch with it through the repeated bombardment of media cliches? These questions will be addressed in more depth in the paper.","[Tramonte, Barbara; Mahar, Donna] SUNY Empire State Coll, Saratoga Springs, NY 12866 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; SUNY Empire State College,"Tramonte, B (corresponding author), SUNY Empire State Coll, Saratoga Springs, NY 12866 USA.",,,,,,,,22,0,0,1,2,IATED-INT ASSOC TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION A& DEVELOPMENT,VALENICA,"LAURI VOLPI 6, VALENICA, BURJASSOT 46100, SPAIN",2340-1095,,978-84-617-2484-0,ICERI PROC,,,2014,,,,,6358,6365,,,,,,8,Education & Educational Research,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Education & Educational Research,BE0US,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000367082906060,View Full Record in Web of Science

To study effects of climate change on a macroalga-herbivore interaction, we exposed three rangemargin Baltic Sea populations of Fucus (60 degrees N 39 degrees E, 61 degrees N 21 degrees E, 62 degrees N 21 degrees E) in September 2015 to current (15.1 degrees C; 5.2 PSU) and predicted future (17.5 degrees C; 2.6 PSU) environments for 7 months. After 6 weeks we tested the indirect effect of climate change through food quality on growth, survival and food consumption of the isopod Idotea balthica while after 7 months we tested the direct effect on algal inducible defenses. We predicted that future stressful conditions impair constitutive and inducible defense traits in Fucus thus resulting in a higher susceptibility to herbivores. The short-term climate stress did decrease thallus toughness of Fucus in one population but isopod food consumption and performance remained unchanged. After 7 months, throughout the populations, Fucus grown in future conditions was softer and more consumed. The grazing attack induced resistance in two populations but irrespective of climate change. Our results show that Fucus can cope with short-term (6 weeks) stress without indirect effects on the interactions with herbivores. However, long-term (7 months) stressed Fucus was consumed more by isopods likely due to a decrease in constitutive resistance traits rather than changes in inducible resistance. This suggests that in near future, marginal populations of Fucus might become more vulnerable to grazing losses, with possibly adverse effects on the abundance and persistence of these populations.","[Rothausler, Eva; Haavisto, Fiia; Jormalainen, Veijo] Univ Turku, Dept Biol, Turku, Finland",University of Turku,"Rothausler, E (corresponding author), Univ Turku, Dept Biol, Turku, Finland.",evanro@utu.fi,"Jormalainen, Veijo/B-2073-2008","Jormalainen, Veijo/0000-0001-6346-2585; Rothausler, Eva/0000-0002-3185-4290",BONUS; European Union [273623]; Academy of Finland [273623],BONUS; European Union(European Commission); Academy of Finland(Academy of Finland),"This research was funded by BONUS, the joint Baltic Sea research and development programme (Art 185), funded jointly from the European Union's Seventh Programme for research, technological development and demonstration and from the Academy of Finland (decision # 273623) for the project BAMBI-Baltic Sea Marine Biodiversity.

Ecological time-series obtained from sedimentary ancient DNA (sedaDNA) are essential for understanding past ecosystem and biodiversity dynamics on the Tibetan Plateau and their responses to climate change at a high taxonomic resolution. Hitherto only few but promising studies have been published on this topic. The potential and limitations of using sedaDNA on the Tibetan Plateau are not fully understood. Here, we (i) provide updated knowledge of and a brief introduction to the suitable archives, region-specific taphonomy, state-of-the-art methodologies, and research questions of sedaDNA on the Tibetan Plateau; (ii) review published and ongoing sedaDNA studies from the Tibetan Plateau; and (iii) give some recommendations for future sedaDNA study designs. Based on the current knowledge of taphonomy, we infer that deep glacial lakes with freshwater and high clay sediment input, such as those from the southern and southeastern Tibetan Plateau, may have a high potential for sedaDNA studies. Metabarcoding (for microorganisms and plants), metagenomics (for ecosystems), and hybridization capture (for prehistoric humans) are three primary sedaDNA approaches which have been successfully applied on the Tibetan Plateau, but their power is still limited by several technical issues, such as PCR bias and incompleteness of taxonomic reference databases. Setting up high-quality and open-access regional taxonomic reference databases for the Tibetan Plateau should be given priority in the future. To conclude, the archival, taphonomic, and methodological conditions of the Tibetan Plateau are favorable for performing sedaDNA studies. More research should be encouraged to address questions about long-term ecological dynamics at ecosystem scale and to bring the paleoecology of the Tibetan Plateau into a new era.

Here a biogeography-based archaeological model for northern Patagonia is presented, taking into consideration information on current topography, climate, and ecology. The model is focused on hunter-gatherer societies, although it is also useful for societies with low-level food production. The northwestern Patagonian landscape is stratified into geographically circumscribed areas with high herbivore carrying capacity and spatially unrestricted areas with low carrying capacity.

Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) emerge as state-of-the-art power sources for all modern consumer electronic devices. This way, the recovery of components plays an important role in the spent LIBs recycling processes. Also, the challenge of research and development of industries is to develop a high number of valuables using the minimum number of experiments, providing low-cost processes. Two models to be employed in flat sheet supported liquid membranes (FSSLMs) to estimate the behavior of ion concentrations during operation are proposed. Applying the simplified model it is possible to predict the behavior of the system, based on few experiments. This advance can be exciting in industry, such as in the lithium recovery from LIBs using membranes.","[Regufe, Maria Joao; Ribeiro, Ana Mafalda; Ferreira, Alexandre Filipe P.; Loureiro, Jose Miguel] Univ Porto, LSRE LCM Lab Separat & React Engn, Lab Catalysis & Mat, Associate Lab,Fac Engn,Chem Engn Dept, Rua Dr Roberto Frias, P-4200465 Porto, Portugal",Universidade do Porto,"Regufe, MJ; Loureiro, JM (corresponding author), Univ Porto, LSRE LCM Lab Separat & React Engn, Lab Catalysis & Mat, Associate Lab,Fac Engn,Chem Engn Dept, Rua Dr Roberto Frias, P-4200465 Porto, Portugal.",mjregufe@fe.up.pt; loureiro@fe.up.pt,"Ribeiro, Ana Cristina/HHN-7466-2022; Ribeiro, Ana/C-9502-2011","Ribeiro, Ana Cristina/0000-0002-0493-8376; Regufe, Maria Joao/0000-0003-2774-8302; Ferreira, Alexandre/0000-0002-6746-8973; Ribeiro, Ana/0000-0003-4269-1420","Project LIMEX - Innovative Membrane Extraction of Lithium for Spent Lithium-Ion Battery Recycling - FCT - FundacAo para a Ciencia e Tecnologia through ERA-NET - European Research Area Networks Programme [ERA-MIN/0004/2018]; FCT/MCTES (PIDDAC) [LA/P/0045/2020, UIDB/50020/2020, UIDP/50020/2020]",Project LIMEX - Innovative Membrane Extraction of Lithium for Spent Lithium-Ion Battery Recycling - FCT - FundacAo para a Ciencia e Tecnologia through ERA-NET - European Research Area Networks Programme; FCT/MCTES (PIDDAC),"This work was financially supported by the Project LIMEX - Innovative Membrane Extraction of Lithium for Spent Lithium-Ion Battery Recycling funded by FCT - FundacAo para a Ciencia e Tecnologia through ERA-NET - European Research Area Networks Programme (ERA-MIN/0004/2018) and also by LA/P/0045/2020 (ALiCE), UIDB/50020/2020 and UIDP/50020/2020 (LSRE-LCM), funded by national funds through FCT/MCTES (PIDDAC).

For this dataset, tropospheric temperature variations contribute approximately 33 W m(-2) OLR variability. tropospheric relative humidity variations 8.5 W m(-2), and vertical structure 2.3-3.4 W m(-2). Of these, 0.3-1.0 W m(-2) are due to structures on a vertical scale smaller than 4 km, which cannot be resolved by conventional remote-sensing instruments. It was also found that the poor absolute accuracy of current humidity data in the upper troposphere, approximately 40% relative error in relative humidity, leads to a significant uncertainty in OLR of about 3.8 W m(-2) (for a midlatitude summer atmosphere), which should be put in the context of the double CO(2) effect of only 2.6 W m(-2) (for the same atmosphere).","Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Miami, FL 33149 USA; Univ Bremen, Inst Environm Phys, Bremen, Germany; Lulea Tech Univ, Dept Space Sci, Kiruna, Sweden; EUMETSAT, Darmstadt, Germany; Chalmers, S-41296 Gothenburg, Sweden; Univ Cologne, Inst Phys 1, D-5000 Cologne, Germany; Univ Bern, Inst Phys Appl, Bern, Switzerland; Alfred Wegener Inst Polar & Marine Res, D-2850 Bremerhaven, Germany","University of Miami; University of Bremen; Lulea University of Technology; European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites; Chalmers University of Technology; University of Cologne; University of Bern; Helmholtz Association; Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar & Marine Research","John, VO (corresponding author), Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, 4600 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA.",vojohn@rsmas.miami.edu,"John, Viju/S-6989-2019; König-Langlo, Gert/K-5048-2012; Buehler, Stefan Alexander/A-4056-2009; John, Viju/A-4558-2008; Eriksson, Patrick/A-5321-2009","König-Langlo, Gert/0000-0002-6100-4107; Buehler, Stefan Alexander/0000-0001-6389-1160; Eriksson, Patrick/0000-0002-8475-0479; John, Viju/0000-0002-8640-8810",,,,,34,9,9,0,3,JOHN WILEY & SONS LTD,CHICHESTER,"THE ATRIUM, SOUTHERN GATE, CHICHESTER PO19 8SQ, W SUSSEX, ENGLAND",0035-9009,,,Q J ROY METEOR SOC,Q.

This non-native grass under constant growth temperatures has been shown negatively affect the growth of the only two native Antarctic vascular plants, Deschampsia antarctica and Colobanthus quitensis, under constant growth temperatures. However, whether there are changes in the interaction between these species under warmer conditions is an important question. In cold ecosystems, soil nutrient status directly affects plant responses to increases in temperature and Antarctic soils are highly variable in nutrient supply. Thus, in this study we experimentally assessed the interaction between the non-native Poa with the two native Antarctic vascular plant species at two different temperatures and levels of nutrient availability. Individual mats of the study species were collected in King George Island, and then transported to Concepcion where we conducted competition experiments. In the first experiment we used soil similar to that of Antarctica and plants in competition were grown at two temperatures: 5 degrees/2 degrees and 11 degrees/5 degrees C (day/ night temperature). In a second experiment plants were grown in these two temperature regimes, but we varied nitrogen (N) availability by irrigating plants with Hoagland solutions that contained 8000 or 300 mu M of N. Overall, Poa exerted a competitive effect on Deschampsia but only at the higher temperature and higher N availability. At 5 degrees/11 degrees C the competitive response of Deschampsia to Poa was of similar magnitude to the competitive effect of P. Deschatnpsia, and the competitive effect was greater with at low N. The competitive effect of Poa was similar to the competitive response of Colobanthus to Poa at both temperatures and N levels. Thus, at low temperatures and N soil content the native Antarctic species might withstand Poa invasion, but this might change with climate warming.","[Cavieres, Lohengrin A.; Karen Sanhueza, Ana; Torres-Mellado, Gustavo] Univ Concepcion, Dept Bot, Fac Ciencias Nat & Oceanog, Concepcion, Chile; [Cavieres, Lohengrin A.; Karen Sanhueza, Ana] IEB, Santiago, Chile; [Casanova-Katny, Angelica] Univ Catolica Temuco, NEA, Fac Recursos Nat, Temuco, Chile",Universidad de Concepcion; Universidad Catolica de Temuco,"Cavieres, LA (corresponding author), Univ Concepcion, Dept Bot, Fac Ciencias Nat & Oceanog, Concepcion, Chile.",lcaviere@udec.cl,"Cavieres, Lohengrin/A-9542-2010; Casanova-Katny, Angelica/M-3994-2014","Cavieres, Lohengrin/0000-0001-9122-3020; Casanova-Katny, Angelica/0000-0003-3860-1445","FONDECYT [1120895]; CONICYT [PIA-ART 11-06, PFB-023]",FONDECYT(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT); CONICYT(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)),Many thanks to Prof. Ray Callaway for helping us with English edition.

Forward ice sheet models are promising tools for estimating future ice sheet behavior, yet confidence is low because evaluation of historical simulations is challenging due to the scarcity of continental-wide data for model evaluation. Recent advancements in processing of Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) data using Bayesianc-onstrained mass concentration (mascon) functions have led to improvements in spatial resolution and noise reduction of monthly global gravity fields. Specifically, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's JPL RL05M GRACE mascon solution (GRACE_JPL) offers an opportunity for the assessment of model-based estimates of ice sheet mass balance (MB) at similar to 300 km spatial scales. Here, we quantify the differences between Greenland monthly observed MB (GRACE_JPL) and that estimated by state-of-the-art, high-resolution models, with respect to GRACE_JPL and model uncertainties. To simulate the years 2003-2012, we force the Ice Sheet System Model (ISSM) with anomalies from three different surface mass balance (SMB) products derived from regional climate models. Resulting MB is compared against GRACE_JPL within individual mascons. Overall, we find agreement in the northeast and southwest where MB is assumed to be primarily controlled by SMB. In the interior, we find a discrepancy in trend, which we presume to be related to millennial-scale dynamic thickening not considered by our model. In the northwest, seasonal amplitudes agree, but modeled mass trends are muted relative to GRACE_JPL. Here, discrepancies are likely controlled by temporal variability in ice discharge and other related processes not represented by our model simulations, i.e., hydrological processes and ice-ocean interaction. In the southeast, GRACE_JPL exhibits larger seasonal amplitude than predicted by the models while simultaneously having more pronounced trends; thus, discrepancies are likely controlled by a combination of missing processes and errors in both the SMB products and ISSM. At the margins, we find evidence of consistent intra-annual variations in regional MB that deviate distinctively from the SMB annual cycle. Ultimately, these monthly-scale variations, likely associated with hydrology or ice-ocean interaction, contribute to steeper negative mass trends observed by GRACE_JPL. Thus, models should consider such processes at relatively high (monthly-to-seasonal) temporal resolutions to achieve accurate estimates of Greenland MB.","[Schlegel, Nicole-Jeanne] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Schlegel, Nicole-Jeanne; Wiese, David N.; Larour, Eric Y.; Watkins, Michael M.] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Box, Jason E.] Geol Survey Denmark & Greenland GEUS, Oster Voldgade 10, DK-1350 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Fettweis, Xavier] Univ Liege, Dept Geog, B-4000 Liege, Belgium; [van den Broeke, Michiel R.] Univ Utrecht, Inst Marine & Atmospher Res Utrecht IMAU, Utrecht, Netherlands",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; California Institute of Technology; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL); Geological Survey Of Denmark & Greenland; University of Liege; Utrecht University,"Schlegel, NJ (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.;Schlegel, NJ (corresponding author), CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",nicole-jeanne.schlegel@jpl.nasa.gov,"Van den Broeke, Michiel R./F-7867-2011; Box, Jason/H-5770-2013; Box, Jason E/AAE-1654-2019","Van den Broeke, Michiel R./0000-0003-4662-7565; Box, Jason/0000-0003-0052-8705; Box, Jason E/0000-0003-0052-8705; Wiese, David/0000-0001-7035-0514; Fettweis, Xavier/0000-0002-4140-3813; Schlegel, Nicole-Jeanne/0000-0001-8035-448X",Geocenter Denmark; NSF [ANT-0424589]; NASA [NNX10AT68G],Geocenter Denmark; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)),"This work was performed at the California Institute of Technology's Jet Propulsion Laboratory under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Cryosphere Program.

The study is based on a weaving settlement in Bargarh district of Odisha, which is globally acclaimed for its Ikkat style of weaving. Design/methodology/approach A hierarchical framework of sustainability resting on the three pillars of ecological, economical and environmental dimensions is derived from existing theoretical research. This framework of 22 indicators is subsequently assigned to assess the sustainability of the vernacular weavers' settlement through quantitative evaluation. A qualitative assessment through observation and deduction also verifies the result. Findings Since the vernacular weavers settlement performs very well on the sustainability scorecard, the paper suggests that its best practices can be incorporated while designing affordable housing so that social, cultural and heritage values are retained and a climate conscious, energy-efficient sustainable approach is ensured. Practical implications The recommendations from the assessment has many lessons while framing policies for rural affordable housing as it cannot have one size that fits all settlement typology irrespective of the occupational, climatic and social needs. Originality/value The sustainable design and planning principles embedded in this vernacular settlement offers a valuable blueprint to re-imagine the affordable housing in rural areas which can be myopic if it does not take into account the occupational needs and life style of craftsmen dwellers.","[Panda, Sudha; Ray, Soumyendu Shankar] KIIT Univ, Sch Architecture & Planning, Bhubaneswar, India",Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology (KIIT),"Panda, S (corresponding author), KIIT Univ, Sch Architecture & Planning, Bhubaneswar, India.",sudhapanda@hotmail.com,,,"INTACH (Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage, Ministry of Culture, Government of India)","INTACH (Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage, Ministry of Culture, Government of India)","This research has been funded by INTACH (Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage, Ministry of Culture, Government of India).",,26,0,0,4,7,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",2044-1266,2044-1274,,J CULT HERIT MANAG S,J.

This is one of the major objectives of the BALTEX program. For the period 1988-1993, results of a 3D ice-ocean model forced with observed atmospheric surface fields are compared with results of a fully coupled atmosphere-ice-ocean model using re-analysis data at the lateral boundaries. The state-of-the-art coupled model system has been developed for climate study purposes in the Nordic countries. The model domain of the atmosphere model covers Scandinavia, Europe and parts of the North Atlantic whereas the ocean model is limited to the Baltic Sea. The annual and monthly mean heat budgets for the Baltic Sea are calculated from the dominating surface fluxes, i.e. sensible heat, latent heat, net longwave radiation and solar radiation to the open water or to the sea ice. The main part of the freshwater inflow to the Baltic is the river runoff. A smaller part of about 11 % is added from net precipitation. The heat and water cycles are compared with the results of a long-term simulation (1980-1993) using the stand-alone Baltic Sea model forced with observed atmospheric surface fields. In general, both approaches, using the uncoupled or coupled Baltic Sea model, give realistic estimates of the heat and water cycles and are in good agreement with results of other studies. However, in the coupled model the parameterizations of the latent heat flux and the incoming longwave radiation need to be improved.","Swedish Meteorol & Hydrol Inst, Rossby Ctr, SE-60176 Norrkoping, Sweden",Swedish Meteorological & Hydrological Institute,"Meier, HEM (corresponding author), Swedish Meteorol & Hydrol Inst, Rossby Ctr, SE-60176 Norrkoping, Sweden.",markus.meier@smhi.se,,,,,,,17,27,27,0,5,FINNISH ENVIRONMENT INST,HELSINKI,"P O BOX 140, FIN-00251 HELSINKI, FINLAND",1239-6095,1797-2469,,BOREAL ENVIRON RES,Boreal Environ.

However, whether the decline trend of summer rainfall is anthropogenic or natural remains unknown. Here, we show evidences that the drying trend is dominated by anthropogenic change of the subtropical westerly jet (SWJ; referring exclusively to the active center located over Central Asia). Using 10 global climate models participating in the Detection and Attribution Model Intercomparison Project (DAMIP) under different forcings, we find that the observed changes in the SWJ are attributable to the combined contributions of greenhouse gases and anthropogenic aerosols. Enhanced emissions of greenhouse gases favor an equatorial shift of the SWJ, while increased Asian pollution and reduced European aerosol emissions weaken the SWJ. Both of these factors strengthen the descending motion and decrease the precipitation over NCA. Plain Language Summary The northern Central Asia (NCA) is facing a crisis of water resources shortage. And the reduction of summer rainfall since the 1950s has resulted in severe drought and the degradation of vegetation over there. Understanding why precipitation changes in this droughtprone region is of vital importance for the agriculture, ecosystems and economies therein. Based on 10 state-of-art climate coupled models forced by natural (including solar activity and volcanic aerosols) and/ or external forcings (including greenhouse gases and anthropogenic aerosols), we show evidence that the drying trend is dominated by anthropogenic change of the atmospheric circulation evinced in the southward shift and weakening of the subtropical westerly jet (SWJ). Enhanced emissions of greenhouse gases favor an equatorial shift of the SWJ, while increased Asian pollution and reduced European aerosol emissions weaken the SWJ. Our results highlight the impacts of human activities on the fragile Central Asian ecosystem, not only directly, e.g., the construction of dams, diversion of waterways and wasting of water, but also indirectly by influencing the local hydrological cycle.","[Jiang, Jie; Zhou, Tianjun] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, State Key Lab Numer Modeling Atmospher Sci & Geop, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Jie; Zhou, Tianjun] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Earth & Planetary Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Tianjun] Chinese Acad Sci, CAS Ctr Excellence Tibetan Plateau Earth Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences","Zhou, TJ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, State Key Lab Numer Modeling Atmospher Sci & Geop, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Zhou, TJ (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Earth & Planetary Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Zhou, TJ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, CAS Ctr Excellence Tibetan Plateau Earth Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.",zhoutj@lasg.iap.ac.cn,"Jiang, Jie/Y-8371-2019; ZHOU, Tianjun/C-3195-2012","Jiang, Jie/0000-0002-2095-4667; ZHOU, Tianjun/0000-0002-5829-7279",Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA20060102]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41988101],Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This work is supported by Chinese Academy of Sciences under Grant No. XDA20060102 and National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 41988101.,,44,8,8,7,26,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",0094-8276,1944-8007,,GEOPHYS RES LETT,Geophys.

This study describes how tobacco companies influence policymaking in a highly regulated environment such as Singapore's, where there is a strong government commitment to Article 5.3. Methods Analysis of internal tobacco industry documents detailing the industry's lobbying activities in Singapore, retrieved via snowball searches in the Truth Tobacco Industry Documents Library. Subsequently, we conducted one-on-one interviews with key informants from sectors mentioned in the documents (academia, arts, government, public health, media, trade, education) to fill gaps in information and provide context to events described in the documents. Results In the 1980s and 1990s, tobacco companies observed that, to influence policy within Singapore's 'hostile' environment, they needed to use 'behind the scenes' tactics, targeting influential individuals at social functions or industry-sponsored events. Tobacco companies used arts and education sponsorships primarily for political purposes, to gain visibility with policymakers. Tobacco companies cultivated relationships with academic researchers and the media to avoid smoke-free legislation in the 1990s and, in the 2010s, appear to have used similar tactics to challenge Singapore's e-cigarette ban. Conclusions Countries with a strong commitment to Article 5.3 should consider the tobacco industry's potential interference in policymaking beyond relationships in the government sector, particularly in academia, arts, education and the media, and the more subtle or indirect manners in which these relationships are built.","[van der Eijk, Yvette; Tan, Grace Ping Ping] Natl Univ Singapore, Saw Swee Hock Sch Publ Hlth, Singapore, Singapore",National University of Singapore,"van der Eijk, Y (corresponding author), Natl Univ Singapore, Singapore 119077, Singapore.",yvette.eijk@nus.edu.sg,,"van der Eijk, Yvette/0000-0002-8095-1214",Singapore Ministry of Education Tier 1 Academic Research Fund [R-608-000-226-114],"Singapore Ministry of Education Tier 1 Academic Research Fund(Ministry of Education, Singapore)",This project was funded by a Singapore Ministry of Education Tier 1 Academic Research Fund (R-608-000-226-114).,,89,0,0,0,0,BMJ PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"BRITISH MED ASSOC HOUSE, TAVISTOCK SQUARE, LONDON WC1H 9JR, ENGLAND",0964-4563,1468-3318,,TOB CONTROL,Tob.

Its strength and variability, however, are not well known. The South Atlantic transports are evaluated for four state-of-the-art global ocean reanalyses (ORAs) and two free-running models (FRMs) in the period 1997-2010. All products employ the Nucleus for European Modelling of the Oceans (NEMO) model, and the ORAs share very similar configurations. Very few previous works have looked at ocean circulation patterns in reanalysis products, but here we show that the ORA basin interior transports are consistently improved by the assimilated in situ and satellite observations relative to the FRMs, especially in the Argo period. The ORAs also exhibit systematically higher meridional transports than the FRMs, which is in closer agreement with observational estimates at 35 and 11 ffi S. However, the data assimilation impact on the meridional transports still greatly varies among the ORAs, leading to differences up to similar to 8 Sv and 0.4PW in the South Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation and the MHTs, respectively. We narrow this down to large inter-product discrepancies in the western boundary currents (WBCs) at both upper and deep levels explaining up to similar to 85% of the inter-product differences in MHT. We show that meridional velocity differences, rather than temperature differences, in the WBCs drive similar to 83% of this MHT spread. These findings show that the present ocean observation network and data assimilation schemes can be used to consistently constrain the South Atlantic interior circulation but not the overturning component, which is dominated by the narrow western boundary currents. This will likely limit the effectiveness of ORA products for climate or decadal prediction studies.","[Mignac, Davi] Univ Reading, Postgrad Program Atmosphere Oceans & Climate, Reading, Berks, England; [Mignac, Davi; Ferreira, David; Haines, Keith] Univ Reading, Dept Meteorol, Reading, Berks, England",University of Reading; University of Reading,"Mignac, D (corresponding author), Univ Reading, Postgrad Program Atmosphere Oceans & Climate, Reading, Berks, England.;Mignac, D (corresponding author), Univ Reading, Dept Meteorol, Reading, Berks, England.",d.mignaccarneiro@pgr.reading.ac.uk,,,"CAPES Foundation, Ministry of Education of Brazil [BEX 1386/15-8]; Natural Environment Research Council [nceo020004, NE/M005119/1, NE/R016518/1] Funding Source: researchfish; NERC [nceo020004, NE/M005119/1] Funding Source: UKRI","CAPES Foundation, Ministry of Education of Brazil(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC))","The first author would like to acknowledge the financial support of the CAPES Foundation, Ministry of Education of Brazil (proc.

We tested this assumption by studying the co-variation of archaeological and palaeoenvironmental records during the Holocene in eastern Fennoscandia. The reconstruction of population history is based on the summed probability distribution of archaeological radiocarbon dates, and environmental changes are tracked with locally available, high-resolution biological and physical proxies that are relevant in terms of hunter-gatherer food availability and population dynamics. The results show major population growth during the period of high summer temperature and high productivity of the terrestrial, lacustrine and marine ecosystems that occurred during 7500-5700 cal. yr BP. The growth was followed by an abrupt decline during 5500-4000 cal. yr BP correlating with the onset of late-Holocene cooling and a major forest ecosystem change brought about by the expansion of Norway spruce and the associated change from species-rich mixed forests to a conifer-dominated boreal ecosystem. Forest ecosystem changes likely enforced the negative effects of decreasing productivity on hunter-gatherer food availability. The link between population and environmental proxies breaks down along with the intensification of agriculture after 3500 cal. yr BP, which indicates that agriculture weakened the environmental forcing on long-term human population dynamics.","[Tallavaara, Miikka] Univ Helsinki, Dept Philosophy Hist Culture & Art Studies, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland",University of Helsinki,"Tallavaara, M (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Dept Philosophy Hist Culture & Art Studies, POB 59, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",miikka.tallavaara@helsinki.fi,,"Seppa, Heikki/0000-0003-2494-7955; Tallavaara, Miikka/0000-0001-9252-7309",Kone Foundation; Finnish Academy of Science and Letters; Academy of Finland,Kone Foundation; Finnish Academy of Science and Letters(Academy of Finland); Academy of Finland(Academy of Finland),MT thanks Kone Foundation and the Finnish Academy of Science and Letters for their support and HS acknowledges the financial support by The Academy of Finland (project QVR).,,93,66,67,0,23,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0959-6836,1477-0911,,HOLOCENE,Holocene,FEB,2012,2,,,,215,225,,10.1177/0959683611414937,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683611414937,,,11,"Geography, Physical; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;HCI),Physical Geography; Geology,871OG,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000298746900008,View Full Record in Web of Science

When implemented in coastal environments, olivine weathering is expected to increase seawater alkalinity, thus resulting in additional CO2 uptake from the atmosphere. However, the mechanisms of marine olivine weathering and its effect on seawater-carbonate chemistry remain poorly understood. Here, we present results from batch reaction experiments, in which forsteritic olivine was subjected to rotational agitation in different seawater media for periods.of days to months. Olivine dissolution caused a significant increase in alkalinity of the seawater with a consequent DIC increase due to CO2 invasion, thus confirming viability of the basic concept of enhanced silicate weathering. However, our experiments also identified several important challenges with respect to the detailed quantification of the CO2 sequestration efficiency under field conditions, which include nonstoichiometric dissolution, potential pore water saturation in the seabed, and the potential occurrence of secondary reactions. Before enhanced weathering of olivine in coastal environments can be considered an option for realizing negative CO2 emissions for climate mitigation purposes, these aspects need further experimental assessment.","[Montserrat, Francesc; Leermakers, Martine; Meysman, Filip J.

We tested the hypothesis that use of the state-of-the-art rational thermal indices, the Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI), might provide an improvement in predicting heat-related mortality with respect to other predictors. Data regarding very elderly people (>= 75 years) who died in inland and coastal cities from 2006 to 2008 (May-October) and meteorological and air pollution were obtained from the regional mortality and environmental archives. Rational (UTCI) and direct thermal indices represented by a set of bivariate/multivariate apparent temperature indices were assessed. Correlation analyses and generalized additive models were applied. The Akaike weights were used for the best model selection. Direct multivariate indices showed the highest correlations with UTCI and were also selected as the best thermal predictors of heat-related mortality for both inland and coastal cities. Conversely, the UTCI was never identified as the best thermal predictor. The use of direct multivariate indices, which also account for the extra effect of wind speed and/or solar radiation, revealed the best fitting with all-cause, very-elderly mortality attributable to heat stress.","[Morabito, Marco; Orlandini, Simone] Univ Florence, Dept Agrifood Prod & Environm Sci, I-50144 Florence, Italy; [Morabito, Marco; Messeri, Alessandro; Modesti, Pietro Amedeo; Gensini, Gian Franco; Orlandini, Simone] Univ Florence, Interdepartmental Ctr Bioclimatol, I-50144 Florence, Italy; [Morabito, Marco; Orlandini, Simone] Univ Florence, CESPRO, Ctr Civil Protect & Risk Studies, I-50134 Florence, Italy; [Crisci, Alfonso; Capecchi, Valerio] Inst Biometeorol, Natl Res Council, I-50145 Florence, Italy; [Modesti, Pietro Amedeo; Gensini, Gian Franco] Univ Florence, Clin Med & Cardiol, I-50134 Florence, Italy",University of Florence; University of Florence; University of Florence; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Biometeorologia (IBIMET-CNR); University of Florence,"Morabito, M (corresponding author), Univ Florence, Dept Agrifood Prod & Environm Sci, Piazzale Cascine 18, I-50144 Florence, Italy.",marco.morabito@unifi.it,"Crisci, Alfonso/AAX-3314-2020; Modesti, Pietro Amedeo/B-2638-2012; Capecchi, Valerio/AAC-2210-2020; Morabito, Marco/AAX-7261-2020; orlandini, simone/L-7880-2015","Modesti, Pietro Amedeo/0000-0002-9511-2173; Capecchi, Valerio/0000-0003-3168-3310; Morabito, Marco/0000-0002-8799-4866; Crisci, Alfonso/0000-0002-5495-6695; orlandini, simone/0000-0001-6290-9752","Regional MeteoSalute Project, Regional Health System of Tuscany; Smart Healthy ENV Project Smart Monitoring Integrated System for a Healthy Urban ENVironment in Smart Cities, POR CReO FESR","Regional MeteoSalute Project, Regional Health System of Tuscany; Smart Healthy ENV Project Smart Monitoring Integrated System for a Healthy Urban ENVironment in Smart Cities, POR CReO FESR","This study was supported and funded by the Regional MeteoSalute Project, Regional Health System of Tuscany, and the Smart Healthy ENV Project Smart Monitoring Integrated System for a Healthy Urban ENVironment in Smart Cities, POR CReO FESR 2007/2013.

One of the most ancient arts of Iranians is the art of gardening which is valuable tradition and has spiritual power. The appearance of Persian garden so far has been utterly consistent with the nature and amount of the water. Given the variety of climate conditions in Iran, with few changes, Persian garden has been emerged in various forms. Since Safavid era, Gardens all over the city have been considered as elements of shaping the physical structure of the city. All the evidence from that period indicates that there was plenty of water in Isfahan, Zayanderud (river) was a natural axis and water was sent to all parts of the city. There were gardens which had created by using water streams (called MADI). In fact architecture of Isfahan in Safavid era was formed in its city and nature substrates. chaharbagh Abbasi avenue is one of the historic avenues in Isfahan which is located between Darvazeh Dolat and Si-O-Se pol. The avenue was designed in Shah Abbas I era. Shah Abbas I was the king who changed his capital from Qazvin to Isfahan and decided to gather all artistic wealth of the county into that central spot which has been called Nesfe Jahan or Half of the World for centuries. The chief architect of this urban design was Shaykh Bahai (Baha' ad-Din al-' Amili), who focused the program on two key features of Shah Abbas's master plan: Chaharbagh avenue-flanked at either side by all the prominent institutions of the city and the residences of all foreign dignitaries-and Naqsh-e Jahan Square. The public boulevard is about 1,650 meters long and consists of four quadripartite gardens arranged along the north-south axis that slopes towards the south. Each quadripartite unit is composed of two squares and two rectangular plots separated by pathways. Also, they are considered as a single boulevard with a central promenade flanked by axial garden shapes. The gardens have since been converted into roadways, with pine trees lining to either side. Running along the center of the promenade was a water channel with cascades; the promenade now only features circular flower beds and light posts. This avenue is one of the most prominent ones in the architectural history of Iran and in this era. Since Chaharbagh avenue is the most important and praiseworthy identity feature of the historic city of Isfahan with unique art, we should not be inattentive to the details of its changes and transitions. The research method is based on studies and the highlights mentioned in travelers' itineraries and analysis of their contents as the most important historical sources. The objective of the present research is to recognize the physical structure of Chaharbagh Abbasi avenue in Safavid era and to similarly regenerate its design according to traveler's statements. Since the physical elements of the avenue have still been remained-based on the available information from related documents, especially itineraries- we can illustrate its imaginary images and can respond to questions such as what characteristics this avenue had and what changes have been occurred in relation to it in different periods. The study is through descriptive-historical method by using written sources and documents of travelers in a comparison-oriented one. Moreover, introducing the images of each traveler's statements help identify the avenue better. The ideas illustrated in these documents, in approval and completion of written and pictorial sources, provide us with the arrangements of the elements in this avenue and the social relations among people in Safavid and Qajar eras. It can be concluded that the avenue has encountered some changes in each traveler's visiting period particularly in each era of Safavid and Qajar; for instance, the avenue's planting system: In Safavid era there were two rows of plantain trees but in Qajar era they increased to four rows. In addition, in Qajar era distinctively in the period of Zill al-Sultan-ruler of Isfahan-numerous damages occurred to this avenue.","[Gholipour, Soudabeh] Art Univ Isfahan, Architectural Studies, Esfahan, Iran",,"Gholipour, S (corresponding author), Art Univ Isfahan, Architectural Studies, Esfahan, Iran.",s.gholipoor@gmail.com,,,,,,,17,3,3,0,0,NAZAR RESEARCH CENTER ART ARCHITECTURE & URBANISM,TEHRAN,"NO 3, DR QARIB ST AZADI AVE, TEHRAN, 14198-43311, IRAN",1735-9635,2251-7197,,BAGH E NAZAR,Bagh e Nazar,JUN,2014,29,,,,37,50,,,,,,14,"Humanities, Multidisciplinary",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Arts & Humanities - Other Topics,VH0RZ,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000450015500004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Accurate projections of ice-sheet dynamics and global sea-level rise therefore require information of future ocean warming in the vicinity of the large ice sheets. Here we use a set of 19 state-of-the-art climate models to quantify this ocean warming in the next two centuries. We find that in response to a mid-range increase in atmospheric greenhouse-gas concentrations, the subsurface oceans surrounding the two polar ice sheets at depths of 200-500m warm substantially compared with the observed changes thus far(6-8). Model projections suggest that over the course of the twenty-first century, the maximum ocean warming around Greenland will be almost double the global mean, with a magnitude of 1.7-2.0 degrees C. By contrast, ocean warming around Antarctica will be only about half as large as global mean warming, with a magnitude of 0.5-0.6 degrees C. A more detailed evaluation indicates that ocean warming is controlled by different mechanisms around Greenland and Antarctica. We conclude that projected subsurface ocean warming could drive significant increases in ice-mass loss, and heighten the risk of future large sea-level rise.","[Yin, Jianjun; Overpeck, Jonathan T.; Russell, Joellen L.] Univ Arizona, Dept Geosci, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Griffies, Stephen M.; Stouffer, Ronald J.] Princeton Univ, NOAA, Geophys Fluid Dynam Lab, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA; [Hu, Aixue] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Boulder, CO 80305 USA",University of Arizona; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Princeton University; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA,"Yin, JJ (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Dept Geosci, 1040 E 4th St, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",yin@email.arizona.edu,"Griffies, Stephen Matthew/N-9144-2019; Hu, Aixue/E-1063-2013","Griffies, Stephen Matthew/0000-0002-3711-236X; Hu, Aixue/0000-0002-1337-287X; Russell, Joellen/0000-0001-9937-6056",,,,,30,63,66,0,35,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,NEW YORK,"75 VARICK ST, 9TH FLR, NEW YORK, NY 10013-1917 USA",1752-0894,1752-0908,,NAT GEOSCI,Nat.

Compared to art unshaded greenhouse, the dry shade cloth reduced the rate of energy gain by about 26%, less than one-half the amount suggested by the shade raring. At the same time, electrical energy consumption was also reduced by about 8% due to reduced operation of the cooling equipment in the shaded house. Under the wet cloth, the reduction in rate of energy gain improved to about 41%, of which 3.5% was attributable to the increased shading provided by the water film. Air temperature rise along the house was reduced by 18% under the dry cloth and 40% under the wet cloth. Leaf temperature rise was reduced by only about 9% under the dry cloth; however the value is misleading because leaf temperatures were reduced nearly uniformly along the house whereas air temperatures were reduced primarily at the exhaust end.

Drawing on a comprehensive literature review, combined with individual co-author in-depth experience in research and practice in Ghana, we searched academic database such as SCOPUS, Web of Science, Springer, Taylor and Francis, Science Direct and Google scholar for recent studies. Our results, on the basis of 33 articles, indicate that poor urban planning and development (number of reported articles, n = 18), poor and inadequate drainage facilities (n = 11), poor environmental attitude (n = 10) and extreme rainfall (n = 8) are the top causes of urban flood in Ghana. The most commonly reported impacts/effects were physical cost (n = 7), destruction of economic infrastructure (n = 5) and health concerns (n = 4). The most reported coping strategies were relocation and protection of properties ( n = 9) and construction of drains (n = 8).

But other sources of energy may need to be added, because hydro energy is subject to good rain patterns, threatened by the spectre of climate change, as already indicated by the current prolonged hours of load shedding by state-owned, Zambia Electricity Supply Company. This research looks at state-of-art mining technologies and collaborative business processes that leverage on the expected ramp in copper and cobalt (Cu-Co) global demand post-Covid-19, to help design resilient business systems by manufacturing, source goods and services within the Southern African Development Community (SADC) region to lower Cu-Co production costs, and maximise profits through shared resources and bilateral trade agreements. With evidence, projection and predictions by global leaders in the Cu-Co industry, this study evaluates the preparedness and resilience of the Zambian mining industry for sustainable energy supply, environmental sustainability, and suggests some possible business collaborations within the SADC region to share the following resources: metal refineries, transportation of goods and services, expertise and energy supplies within SADC, to enhance business sustainability. The study shows that the resilience of Cu-Co business in resource-rich nations like Zambia is complex and is heavily influenced by investment decisions, stakeholder interests, copper ore grades and extractive process types, reliable power supply, and socio-economic and political issues. The significance of this study is that it proposes some business collaborations within SADC that can increase energy reliability and supply, Cu-Co production, increase business resilience, improve global competitiveness and sustainability by exploring energy efficiency and generation-mix strategy.","[Imasiku, K.; Ntagwirumugara, E.] Univ Rwanda, African Ctr Excellence Energy Sustainable Dev, Coll Sci & Technol, Kigali, Rwanda; [Imasiku, K.] Southern African Sci Serv Ctr Climate Change & Ad, Windhoek, Namibia",University of Rwanda,"Imasiku, K (corresponding author), Univ Rwanda, African Ctr Excellence Energy Sustainable Dev, Coll Sci & Technol, Kigali, Rwanda.;Imasiku, K (corresponding author), Southern African Sci Serv Ctr Climate Change & Ad, Windhoek, Namibia.",katunduimasiku@gmail.com,,"Imasiku, Katundu/0000-0002-4428-4805",,,,,38,0,0,1,12,"UNIV CAPE TOWN, ENERGY RES CENTRE",CAPE TOWN,"LIBRARY RD, MENZIES BLDG, 6TH FLR ROOM 6 41 PRIVATE BAG X3, RONDEBOSCH, CAPE TOWN, WESTERN CAPE 7701, SOUTH AFRICA",1021-447X,,,J ENERGY SOUTH AFR,J.

Understanding the implications of a temperature overshoot is thus an increasingly relevant research topic. Here we explore the carbon cycle feedbacks over land and ocean in the SSP5-3.4-OS overshoot scenario by using an ensemble of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6 Earth system models. Models show that after the CO2 concentration and air temperature peaks, land and ocean are decreasing carbon sinks from the 2,040s and become sources for a limited time in the 22nd century. The decrease in the carbon uptake precedes the CO2 concentration peak. The early peak of ocean uptake stems from its dependency on the atmospheric CO2 growth rate. The early peak of the land uptake occurs due to a larger increase in ecosystem respiration than the increase in gross primary production, as well as due to a concomitant increase in land-use change emissions primarily attributed to the wide implementation of biofuel croplands. The carbon cycle feedback parameters amplify after the CO2 concentration and temperature peaks due to inertia of the Earth system so that land and ocean absorb more carbon per unit change in the atmospheric CO 2 change (stronger negative feedback) and lose more carbon per unit temperature change (stronger positive feedback) compared to if the feedbacks stayed unchanged. The increased negative CO2 feedback outperforms the increased positive climate feedback. This feature should be investigated under other scenarios. Plain Language Summary A large gap between required and currently planned greenhouse gas emission reductions makes possible overshooting the 2 degrees C target of the Paris Agreement before the temperature can return below the target levels. We explore the response of the global carbon cycle to overshoot by analyzing the simulations of state-of-art models under an overshoot pathway, where the emissions increase until the 2,030s and exhibit a steep reduction thereafter. The land and ocean continue to take up carbon from the atmosphere throughout the 21st century, albeit at a reduced rate. The decrease in the ocean carbon uptake occurs before the CO2 concentration peak due to its dependence on the rate of the atmospheric CO2 change, and the decrease in the land uptake occurs due to a stronger increase in the ecosystem respiration than in the photosynthetic carbon absorption and simultaneous large landuse-change emissions from the expansion of biofuel crops. After the peaks, land and ocean absorb more carbon from the atmosphere due to higher CO2 concentration and lose more carbon due to warmer temperatures. The influence of higher CO2 concentration wins over the influence of warming, allowing land and ocean to remain carbon sinks till the end of the 21st century.

Due to the high density of settlements in these areas, these natural hazards constitute a risk element for the local populations, therefore risk management is fundamental. The options for the management of these hazards consist in structural measures, land use planning and ecosystem-based solutions (EbS). Structural technical measures, such as avalanche snow bridges or rockfall nets, while immediately effective, have emerged as insufficiently adaptable to changes in environmental conditions. On the contrary, EbS have the potential to adjust to the challenges driven by global environmental change. This is the reason why, over the past few years, EbS have increasingly gained attention. In this review, we address the role of EbS in Disaster Risk Reduction (Eco-DRR) in the European Alpine Space. The review is composed by two main parts: (i) a quantitative bibliometric analysis followed by (ii) a qualitative review. The first part focused on the quantitative analysis of peer-reviewed publications (Scopus database) to investigate general publication trends. This bibliometric analysis served as a basis to select articles for the subsequent qualitative analysis in which the parameters addressed were mainly: the type of natural hazard studied, the characteristics of the EbS, the development of alternative scenarios, the involvement of the stakeholders and the monetary evaluation of the measures. The results highlight a strongly increasing number of EbS-related publications from 1980 to 2019, particularly since the turn of the millennium. The qualitative analysis, however, revealed that the involvement of stakeholders and the economic evaluation of EbS is still lacking. We conclude that filling this research gap might help to foster a wider adoption of ecosystem-based solutions for disaster risk reduction across mountainous areas.","[Poratelli, Francesca; Accastello, Cristian; Brun, Filippo] Univ Turin, Dept Agr Forest & Food Sci DISAFA, Largo Braccini 2, I-10095 Grugliasco, TO, Italy; [Cocuccioni, Silvia; Steger, Stefan; Schneiderbauer, Stefan] Eurac Res, Inst Earth Observat, Viale Druso 1, I-39100 Bolzano, BZ, Italy",University of Turin; European Academy of Bozen-Bolzano,"Poratelli, F (corresponding author), Univ Turin, Dept Agr Forest & Food Sci DISAFA, Largo Braccini 2, I-10095 Grugliasco, TO, Italy.",francesca.poratelli@unito.it,,"Cocuccioni, Silvia/0000-0003-1992-5401; Schneiderbauer, Stefan/0000-0001-7587-849X; Steger, Stefan/0000-0003-0886-5191; Brun, Filippo/0000-0001-5042-1469","Interreg Alpine Space, one of the 15 transnational cooperation programmes covering the whole of the European Union (EU)","Interreg Alpine Space, one of the 15 transnational cooperation programmes covering the whole of the European Union (EU)","This research was conducted in the context of the GreenRisk4Alps project.

This review is the first to merge and present available information and baseline data for the FP7 BONUS BaltHealth project: Baltic Sea multilevel health impacts on key species of anthropogenic hazardous substances. Understanding the spread, prevalence and effects of wildlife pathogens is important for the understanding of animal and ecosystem health, ecosystem function and services, as well as human exposure to zoonotic diseases. This review summarises the occurrence of parasites, viruses and bacteria over the past six decades, including severe outbreaks of Phocine Distemper Virus (PDV), the seroprevalence of Influenza A and the recent increase in seal parasites. We show that Baltic high trophic key species are exposed to multiple bacterial, viral and parasitic diseases. Parasites, such as C. semerme and P. truncatum present in the colon and liver Baltic grey seals, respectively, and anisakid nematodes require particular monitoring due to their effects on animal health. In addition, distribution of existing viral and bacterial pathogens, along with the emergence and spread of new pathogens, need to be monitored in order to assess the health status of key Baltic species. Relevant bacteria are Streptococcus spp., Brucella spp., Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, Mycoplasma spp. and Leptospira interrogans; relevant viruses are influenza virus, distemper virus, pox virus and herpes virus. This is of special importance as some of the occurring pathogens are zoonotic and thus also pose a potential risk for human health. Marine mammal handlers, as well as civilians that by chance encounter marine mammals, need to be aware of this risk. It is therefore important to continue the monitoring of diseases affecting key Baltic species in order to assess their relationship to population dynamics and their potential threat to humans. These infectious agents are valuable indicators of host ecology and can act as bioindicators of distribution, migration, diet and behaviour of marine mammals and birds, as well as of climate change and changes in food web dynamics. In addition, infectious diseases are linked to pollutant exposure, overexploitation, immune suppression and subsequent inflammatory disease. Ultimately, these diseases affect the health of the entire ecosystem and, consequently, ecosystem function and services. As global warming is continuously increasing, the impact of global change on infectious disease patterns is important to monitor in Baltic key species in the future.","[Sonne, Christian; Desforges, Jean-Pierre; Eulaers, Igor; Galatius, Anders; Andersen-Ranberg, Emilie U.; Dietz, Rune] Aarhus Univ, Fac Sci & Technol, Arctic Res Ctr, Dept Biosci, Frederiksborgvej 399,POB 358, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark; [Lakemeyer, Jan; Stokholm, Iben; Gross, Stephanie; Gonnsen, Katharina; Lehnert, Kristina; Siebert, Ursula] Univ Vet Med Hannover, Inst Terr & Aquat Wildlife Res, Werftstr 6, D-25761 Buesum, Germany; [Persson, Sara] Swedish Museum Nat Hist, Dept Environm Res & Monitoring, Box 50007, SE-10405 Stockholm, Sweden; [Stokholm, Iben; Olsen, Morten Tange] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Biol, Nat Hist Museum Denmark, Evolutionary Genom, Oster Voldgade 5-7, DK-1350 Copenhagen K, Denmark; [Andersen-Ranberg, Emilie U.] Univ Copenhagen, Fac Hlth, Dept Vet Clin Sci, Dyrlaegevej 16, DK-1870 Frederiksberg C, Denmark","Aarhus University; University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover, Foundation; Swedish Museum of Natural History; University of Copenhagen; University of Copenhagen","Siebert, U (corresponding author), Univ Vet Med Hannover, Inst Terr & Aquat Wildlife Res, Werftstr 6, D-25761 Buesum, Germany.",cs@bios.au.dk; Jan.Lakemeyer@tiho-hannover.de; jpd@bios.au.dk; ie@bios.au.dk; sara.persson@nrm.se; ibens@snm.ku.dk; agj@bios.au.dk; Stephanie.Gross@tiho-hannover.de; Katharina.Gonnsen@tiho-hannover.de; Kristina.Lehnert@tiho-hannover.de; emilie.ranberg@sund.ku.dk; morten.olsen@bio.ku.dk; rdi@bios.au.dk; Ursula.Siebert@tiho-hannover.de,"Eulaers, Igor/AAJ-5912-2020; Galatius, Anders/AAM-9028-2020; Desforges, Jean-Pierre W/B-9217-2016; Dietz, Rune/F-9154-2015; Galatius, Anders/AGG-7831-2022; Sonne, Christian/I-7532-2013; Olsen, Morten Tange/J-4783-2013; Persson, Sara/C-1620-2015","Eulaers, Igor/0000-0002-7130-9932; Galatius, Anders/0000-0003-1237-2066; Desforges, Jean-Pierre W/0000-0002-6816-7697; Dietz, Rune/0000-0001-9652-317X; Sonne, Christian/0000-0001-5723-5263; Stokholm, Iben/0000-0003-4097-251X; Olsen, Morten Tange/0000-0001-6716-6345; Lakemeyer, Jan/0000-0002-9037-9733; Persson, Sara/0000-0003-4700-0553; Gross, Stephanie/0000-0002-7734-1466","BONUS (Art. 185) - EU, Innovation Fund Denmark [6180-00001B, 6180-00002B]; Forschungszentrum Julich GmbH; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research [FKZ 03F0767A]; Academy of Finland [311966]; Swedish Foundation for Strategic Environmental Research (MISTRA)","BONUS (Art. 185) - EU, Innovation Fund Denmark; Forschungszentrum Julich GmbH; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); Academy of Finland(Academy of Finland); Swedish Foundation for Strategic Environmental Research (MISTRA)(Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research)","BONUS BALTHEALTH has received funding from BONUS (Art. 185), funded jointly by the EU, Innovation Fund Denmark (grants 6180-00001B and 6180-00002B), Forschungszentrum Julich GmbH, German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (grant FKZ 03F0767A), Academy of Finland (grant 311966) and Swedish Foundation for Strategic Environmental Research (MISTRA).

Compared to CMIP3 models, more CMIP5 models simulated the northward propagation of BSISO. The majority of the models could not simulate the spatial pattern of BSISO variance over the Asian summer monsoon (ASM) region and many of them failed to capture all the three peak centers of BSISO variance over the Indian summer monsoon region. Many of the models underestimated the BSISO variance over the equatorial Indian Ocean, and it is associated with the seasonal mean dry biases over this region. A reasonable representation of the intraseasonal sea surface temperature and its coupling to the convection over the equatorial Indian Ocean and an equatorial eastward propagation of convective anomalies beyond 100(degrees)E assure realistic simulation of BSISO over the ASM domain. We found that the models MIROC5, IPSL-CM5A-LR, GFDL-CM3, CMCC-CM, and MPI-ESM-LR are able to represent reasonable BSISO characteristics and can be used to unravel the modulation of BSISO characteristics due to various projected climate changes.","[Sabeerali, C.

A multidisciplinary research team with expertise in architecture, ecology, economics, engineering, design, and public art surveyed existing coastal structures to elucidate criteria for a multifunctional performance assessment of these structures in South Florida. Eight coastal survey sites were evaluated to understand their function. Two key variables that affect the coastal structure function are the spatial extent of the structure and the age of the structure. The functional performance was ranked as poor, fair, or good based on (1) ecological functionality (rugosity, minimization of pollution, and coastal plant diversity), (2) engineering functionality (storm, wave, and flood resilience and affordability), and (3) stakeholder functionality (waterfront access, views, and wildlife views). These aspects of functionality were equally weighted to evaluate the impact of each component on the coastal environs. Generally, coastal structure design considers primarily engineering functionality, and these designs consequently have poor ecological functionality. Multifunctionality improved with the horizontal extent of the structure, the occurrence of coastal plants in a buffer zone, and increased public access and use.","[Sealey, Kathleen Sullivan] Univ Miami, Dept Biol, Coral Gables, FL 33146 USA; [Andiroglu, Esber; Suraneni, Prannoy] Univ Miami, Coll Engn, Coral Gables, FL 33146 USA; [Lamere, Joel] Univ Miami, Sch Architecture, Coral Gables, FL 33146 USA; [Sobczak, James] Univ Miami, Univ Miami Lib, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA",University of Miami; University of Miami; University of Miami; University of Miami,"Sealey, KS (corresponding author), Univ Miami, Dept Biol, Coral Gables, FL 33146 USA.",ksealey@miami.edu,,"Suraneni, Prannoy/0000-0002-0899-2601; Sobczak, James/0000-0001-7598-2836",University of Miami ULINK Phase 1; University of Miami ULINK Phase 2,University of Miami ULINK Phase 1; University of Miami ULINK Phase 2,"This research was supported by University of Miami ULINK Phase 1 and Phase 2 funding to the authors for the project Next generation of coastal structures: Incorporating ecology, engineering, economics, community, and aesthetics for a changing ocean.''

Plant physiology is controlled by many environmental factors, and a number of complex feedbacks are involved, but soil moisture control on root water uptake is primary, particularly in sub-tropical to temperate ecosystems. Land surface models represent plant water stress in different ways, but most implement a water stress factor, beta, which ranges linearly (more recently also curvilinearly) between beta = 1 for unstressed vegetation and beta = 0 at the wilting point, expressed in terms of volumetric water content ( theta ). beta is most commonly used to either limit A or g(s), and hence carbon and water fluxes, and a pertinent research question is whether these treatments are in fact interchangeable. Following Egea et al. (Agricultural and Forest Meteorology, 2011, 151 (10), 1,370-1,384) and Verhoef et al. (Agricultural and Forest Meteorology, 2014, 191, 22-32), we have implemented new beta treatments, reflecting higher levels of biophysical complexity in a state-of-the-art LSM, Joint UK Land Environment Simulator, by allowing root zone soil moisture to limit plant function non-linearly and via individual routes (carbon assimilation, stomatal conductance, or mesophyll conductance) as well as any (non-linear) combinations thereof. The treatment of beta does matter to the prediction of water and carbon fluxes: this study demonstrates that it represents a key structural uncertainty in contemporary LSMs, in terms of predictions of gross primary productivity, energy fluxes and soil moisture evolution, both in terms of climate means and response to a number of European droughts, including the 2003 heat wave. Treatments allowing ss to act on vegetation fluxes via stomatal and mesophyll routes are able to simulate the spatiotemporal variability in water use efficiency with higher fidelity during the growing season; they also support a broader range of ecosystem responses, e.g., those observed in regions that are radiation limited or water limited. We conclude that current practice in weather and climate modelling is inconsistent, as well as too simplistic, failing to credibly simulate vegetation response to soil water stress across the typical range of variability that is encountered for current European weather and climate conditions, including extremes of land surface temperature and soil moisture drought. A generalized approach performs better in current climate conditions and promises to be, based on responses to recently observed extremes, more trustworthy for predicting the impacts of climate change.","[Vidale, P.

The system realistically reproduced the spatiotemporal distributions of the observed meteorology and surface air quality, with a slight overestimate of surface ozone (O-3) by 4% and underestimate of surface PM2.5 by 10%. The system simulation showed that the fire impacts on primary pollutants such as CO were generally confined to the fire source areas but its effects on secondary pollutants like O-3 spread more broadly. The fire contribution to air quality varied greatly during 1997-2016 and occasionally accounted for more than 100 ppbv of monthly mean surface CO and over 20 mu g m(-3) of monthly mean PM2.5 in the Northwest U.S. and Northern California, two regions susceptible to frequent fires. Fire emissions also had implications on air quality compliance. From 1997 to 2016, fire emissions increased surface 8-hour O-3 standard exceedances by 10% and 24-hour PM2.5 exceedances by 33% over CONUS.","[Tao, Zhining] Univ Space Res Assoc, Columbia, MD 21046 USA; [Tao, Zhining] NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; [He, Hao; Sun, Chao; Tong, Daniel; Liang, Xin-Zhong] Univ Maryland, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [He, Hao; Liang, Xin-Zhong] Univ Maryland, Earth Syst Sci Interdisciplinary Ctr, College Pk, MD 20740 USA; [Tong, Daniel] NOAA, Air Resources Lab, College Pk, MD 20740 USA; [Tong, Daniel] George Mason Univ, Ctr Spatial Informat Sci & Syst, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA",Universities Space Research Association (USRA); National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; George Mason University,"Tao, ZN (corresponding author), Univ Space Res Assoc, Columbia, MD 21046 USA.;Tao, ZN (corresponding author), NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA.;Liang, XZ (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.;Liang, XZ (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Earth Syst Sci Interdisciplinary Ctr, College Pk, MD 20740 USA.",zhining.tao@nasa.gov; haohe@umd.edu; sunchao@umd.edu; qtong@gmu.edu; xliang@umd.edu,"Liang, Xin-Zhong/B-3561-2014; sun, chao/AAL-4784-2021; Tong, Daniel/A-8255-2008","Liang, Xin-Zhong/0000-0002-5047-3135; sun, chao/0000-0003-3862-9798; He, Hao/0000-0002-6823-9603; Tong, Daniel/0000-0002-4255-4568","U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Science to Achieve Results [RD83587601]; U.S. National Science Foundation Innovations at the Nexus of Food, Energy and Water Systems [EAR-1639327]; National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Modeling, Analysis, and Prediction Program","U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Science to Achieve Results(United States Environmental Protection Agency); U.S. National Science Foundation Innovations at the Nexus of Food, Energy and Water Systems; National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Modeling, Analysis, and Prediction Program(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA))","This research was partially funded by U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Science to Achieve Results (RD83587601), U.S. National Science Foundation Innovations at the Nexus of Food, Energy and Water Systems (EAR-1639327), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Modeling, Analysis, and Prediction Program.",,72,5,5,2,12,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2072-4292,,REMOTE SENS-BASEL,Remote Sens.,MAR,2020,6,,,,,,913,10.3390/rs12060913,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs12060913,,,17,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,LE6FX,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000526820600015,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the various aerosol-cloud-precipitation interaction mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we analyze multisatellite observations to examine dust-induced modification in ice clouds and precipitation susceptibility. We show contrasting dust-induced changes in ice cloud regimes wherein despite a 25% reduction in ice particle radius in thin ice clouds, we find similar to 40% increase in ice particle radius and ice water path in thick ice clouds resulting in the cloud deepening and subsequently strengthened precipitation susceptibility, under strong updraft regimes. The observed dust-ice cloud-precipitation interactions are supported by a strong correlation between the interannual monsoon rainfall variability and dust frequency. This microphysical-dynamical coupling appears to provide negative feedback to aerosol-cloud interactions, which acts to buffer enhanced aerosol wet scavenging. Our results underscore the importance of incorporating meteorological regime-dependent dust-ice cloud-precipitation interactions in climate simulations. Plain Language Summary The Indian summer monsoon is the central source of freshwater availability to the densely populated regions of southern Asia. The monsoon circulation and rainfall variability are widely known to be governed by large-scale atmosphere-land-ocean dynamics, meteorological processes, and air-sea interactions. In the past two decades, the role of atmospheric aerosols has emerged as a source of modulating monsoon rainfall, as suggested by a host of climate modeling studies. In this paper, we have investigated a new aspect of aerosols in possibly influencing monsoon clouds and rainfall by specifically examining interaction between mineral dust aerosols and ice clouds, as part of the monsoon system. Using state-of-the-art information derived for aerosols and clouds from multisensor and disparate satellite observations spanning 11 years, we find characteristic signature of dust aerosol-induced modification of thick ice clouds (so-called cloud invigoration effect) toward strengthened susceptibility of monsoon precipitation. Overall, our results shed new light on the potential role of dust and ice cloud interactions in modulating the Indian summer monsoon.","[Patel, Piyushkumar N.; Gadhavi, Harish] Phys Res Lab, Space & Atmospher Sci Div, Ahmadabad, Gujarat, India; [Gautam, Ritesh] Environm Def Fund, Washington, DC USA; [Michibata, Takuro] Kyushu Univ, Res Inst Appl Mech, Fukuoka, Fukuoka, Japan","Department of Space (DoS), Government of India; Physical Research Laboratory - India; Environmental Defense Fund; Kyushu University","Patel, PN (corresponding author), Phys Res Lab, Space & Atmospher Sci Div, Ahmadabad, Gujarat, India.",piyushether@gmail.com,"Keyes, Dennis/AAZ-9285-2021; Patel, Piyushkumar N/E-1231-2016","Patel, Piyushkumar N/0000-0003-2179-8739; Michibata, Takuro/0000-0002-1491-0297; Gadhavi, Harish/0000-0001-8935-1517","Physical Research Laboratory, Ahmedabad","Physical Research Laboratory, Ahmedabad","This work is supported by Physical Research Laboratory, Ahmedabad.

The non-accessibility and uncertainty of these data can greatly affect the implementation, management, and performance of photovoltaic or thermal systems. Developing solar irradiation estimation and forecasting approaches is an effective way to overcome these issues. Practically, prediction approaches can help anticipate events by ensuring good operation of the power network and maintaining a precise balance between the demand and supply of the power at every moment. In the literature, various estimation and forecasting methods have been developed. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models are the most commonly used methods in solar irradiation prediction. This paper aims to firstly review, analyze, and provide an overview of different aspects required to develop an ANN model for solar irradiation prediction, such as data types, data horizon, data preprocessing, forecasting horizon, feature selection, and model type. Secondly, a highly detailed state of the art of ANN-based approaches including deep learning and hybrid ANN models for solar irradiation estimation and forecasting is presented. Finally, the factors influencing prediction model performances are discussed in order to propose recommendations, trends, and outlooks for future research in this field.","[El-Amarty, Naima; Bennani, Saad Dosse] Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah Univ, Fac Sci & Technol Fez, SIGER, POB 2202, Fes, Morocco; [Marzouq, Manal; El Fadili, Hakim] Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah Univ, Fac Sci & Technol Fez, LIPI, POB 5206, Fes, Morocco; [Ruano, Antonio] Univ Algarve, Fac Sci & Technol, DEEI, P-8005294 Faro, Portugal; [Ruano, Antonio] Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Tecn, IDMEC, P-1950044 Lisbon, Portugal",Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah University of Fez; Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah University of Fez; Universidade do Algarve; Universidade de Lisboa; Instituto Superior Tecnico,"El-Amarty, N (corresponding author), Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah Univ, Fac Sci & Technol Fez, SIGER, POB 2202, Fes, Morocco.",naima.elamarty@usmba.ac.ma,,,,,,,138,0,0,2,2,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0944-1344,1614-7499,,ENVIRON SCI POLLUT R,Environ.

A contextual map is developed for capturing the main technical, environmental and economic factors affecting the selection of sensors for water monitoring and stewardship during agricultural production.

The results revealed low percentages of correct predictions for original scales of thermal indices despite having high correlation coefficient with thermal sensation votes-TSV, while modified scales of Universal Thermal Climate Index-UTCI and Physiologically Equivalent Temperature-PET correlated better with TSV and had higher correct predictions percentages than the original scales, especially in the 'neutral' class.

Second, by identifying the existing gaps in the literature, we highlight the specific needs for research and practice in this field that can help society figure out the role of urban shared mobility.","[Roukouni, Anastasia; Homem de Almeida Correia, Goncalo] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Civil Engn & Geosci, Transport & Planning Dept, Stevinweg 1, NL-2628 CN Delft, Netherlands",Delft University of Technology,"Roukouni, A (corresponding author), Delft Univ Technol, Fac Civil Engn & Geosci, Transport & Planning Dept, Stevinweg 1, NL-2628 CN Delft, Netherlands.",a.roukouni@tudelft.nl; g.correia@tudelft.nl,"de Almeida Correia, Gonçalo Homem/AAN-9832-2020","de Almeida Correia, Gonçalo Homem/0000-0002-9785-3135",EIT Climate-KIC,EIT Climate-KIC,"The research is part of the SuSMo (Sustainable Urban Shared Mobility) Project, funded by the EIT Climate-KIC.",,129,7,7,6,27,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,DEC,2020,24,,,,,,10504,10.3390/su122410504,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su122410504,,,22,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,PL5WS,,"Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000603192500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The primary goal of this research is to clarify the state-of-the-art performance of DSFs, so that designers can assess the value of these building concepts in meeting design goals for energy efficiency, ventilation, productivity, and sustainability. This investigation adopts an analytical approach using dynamic simulation software (Energy Plus/Designbuilder), to understand the performance of a double skin facade based on research rather than intuition. In this paper, a comparative analysis of cooling and heating loads on a single skin base case is compared against three possible changes to the physical properties of the external and internal layer of the double skin facade. Simulation results indicate that a reflective double skin facade can achieve better energy savings than a single skin with reflective glazing.","[Azarbayjani, Mona; Mehta, Jigisha] UNC, Sch Architecture, Ctr Integrated Bldg Design Res, Energy Performance Lab, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Charlotte,"Azarbayjani, M (corresponding author), UNC, Sch Architecture, Ctr Integrated Bldg Design Res, Energy Performance Lab, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA.",mazarbay@uncc.edu,,,,,,,17,0,0,1,1,SOC MODELING SIMULATION INT-SCS,SAN DIEGO,"PO BOX 17900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92177 USA",0735-9276,,978-1-61839-790-4,SIMUL SERIES,,,2012,8,,,,106,113,,,,,,8,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BH2EW,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000398879200016,View Full Record in Web of Science

Using longitudinal data from the Wabash National Study of Liberal Arts Education, this study examined the relationship between students' perceptions of faculty practices and student-faculty interactions and two measures of students' attitudes toward diversity, and whether these relationships were moderated by race/ethnicity. Findings revealed that several perceptions of faculty practices and student-faculty interactions were positively associated with students' fourth-year diversity attitudes, including: (a) quality of faculty contact; (b) faculty interest in teaching and student development; (c) how often students had discussions with faculty whose political, social, or religious opinions were different from their own; (d) how often faculty engaged students in cooperative learning activities; (e) whether courses helped students see connections between intended careers and how they affect society; and (f) whether courses helped students understand the historical, political, and social connections of past events. Overall, findings suggest that the type and quality of each faculty practice or measure of interaction with students may be significant in terms of fostering positive diversity attitudes among students.

The spatial pattern of the mean and the phase of the annual cycle generally compare well. except that the amplitude of the annual cycle of model precipitation is much smaller than observed. On 10-30-day timescales. it is shown that averaging stations within a 5 degrees radius is approximately equivalent to total wavenumber 20 (T20) spatial scale. although it is more important to have a high density of stations than an exact match of spatial scales. Ideally, there should be one station per 20 000 km(2). On 10-30-day scales, observed rainfall is best correlated with OLR. Correlations between OLR and 150-mb divergence are larger than between observed rainfall and divergence or between rainfall and model precipitation. For example, if 10-30-day filtered OLR and divergence are truncated at T20 and rainfall is averaged to include stations within a 5 degrees radius. OLR is correlated with rainfall at about -0.6, OLR is correlated with divergence at about -0.35, and rainfall is correlated with divergence at about 0.2. At least part of the lack of correlation is due to inadequate spatial sampling of rainfall. Correlations improve with larger spatial scale. The major seasonal transitions from dry to rainy regimes are captured well by OLR but not by the model quantities. The mean diurnal cycle is represented reasonably by 150-mb divergence.","Univ Colorado, Climate Diagnost Ctr, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; Natl Inst Space Studies, Ctr Weather Predict & Climate Studies, Cachoeira Paulista, Brazil; NOAA, Natl Weather Serv, NCEP, Climate Predict Ctr, Washington, DC 20233 USA; Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Phys Oceanog, Sao Paulo, Brazil; Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Atmospher Sci, Sao Paulo, Brazil",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais (INPE); National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Universidade de Sao Paulo; Universidade de Sao Paulo,"Liebmann, B (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, CIRES, Campus Box 449, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",,"Marengo, Jose A/J-9382-2012; WAINER, ILANA/B-4540-2011","Marengo, Jose A/0000-0002-8154-2762; WAINER, ILANA/0000-0003-3784-623X",,,,,24,45,46,0,3,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0894-8755,,,J CLIMATE,J.

However, ISCCP estimates rely on two spectral channels only, while the most advanced satellite sensors offer over 20 spectral bands, and thus a higher probability of correct cloud detection. We validated the accuracy of ISCCP mean monthly cloud amount statistics using the state-of-the-art, 36-spectral channel Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument aboard the Terra and Aqua satellites. Based on the MODIS Level 2 Cloud Mask we developed a dedicated Level 3 product for Central Europe (2004-2009). For the first time, MODIS swath data were projected onto an ISCCP equal-area grid, which guaranteed an exact geometrical agreement between both climatologies. Results showed that there was a close correlation between ISCCP and MODIS data (rho = 0.872, alpha = 0.99), especially at warmer part of the year (rho >= 0.940, alpha > 0.99). However, ISCCP estimations were found to be unreliable in wintertime when surface was covered with snow. The presence of snow resulted in a significant underestimate of cloud amount by 0.45 for individual ISCCP grid boxes. Our results suggest that MODIS cloud climatology is more reliable when estimates of mean monthly cloud amount are required. (C) 2014 Elsevier BM.

Part I of this paper presents a new methodology for assessing all aspects related to the sustainability of a district. The new Apulia ITACA - District Protocol is the extension to the district level of the existing and widely used Italian Apulia ITACA -Building Protocol. The proposed Protocol permits the assessment of any type of district, with no extension limitations. Part II shows an application of the Protocol for the evaluation of the current state of a small district of Lecce, a city in the south-east of Italy with a Mediterranean climate. The district falls in a peripheral social housing area and is composed of two residential buildings and a school. Several strategies have been proposed to improve the overall score of the district, showing both an ideal and realistic renovation. The high flexibility of the protocol in the direct identification of the weaknesses and strengths of the district was demonstrated.","[Congedo, Paolo Maria; Baglivo, Cristina; Toscano, Angelica Maria] Univ Salento, Dipartimento Ingn Innovaz, I-73100 Lecce, Italy",University of Salento,"Baglivo, C (corresponding author), Univ Salento, Dipartimento Ingn Innovaz, I-73100 Lecce, Italy.",cristina.baglivo@unisalento.it,"Congedo, Paolo Maria/N-8307-2015","Congedo, Paolo Maria/0000-0002-7271-8586; Baglivo, Cristina/0000-0001-9553-6382","Project Sistemi energetici smart e Distretti ad energia zero: sistema di programma e protocolli operativi - (Art. 10 del Regolamento per il conferimento di assegni per la collaborazione ad attivita di ricerca - Titoli e progetto) - Convenzione A.Di.S.U.

Where do they go and what do they do? These basic questions are key not only to understanding a species' ecology and evolution, but also for addressing many of the environmental challenges we currently face, including problems posed by invasive species, the spread of zoonotic diseases and declines in wildlife populations due to anthropogenic climate and land-use changes. Monitoring the movements and activities of wild animals can be difficult, especially when the species in question are small, cryptic or move over large areas. In this paper, we describe an Automated Radio-Telemetry System (ARTS) that we designed and built on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama to overcome these challenges. We describe the hardware and software we used to implement the ARTS, and discuss the scientific successes we have had using the system, as well as the logistical challenges we faced in maintaining the system in real-world, rainforest conditions. The ARTS uses automated radio-telemetry receivers mounted on 40-m towers topped with arrays of directional antennas to track the activity and location of radio-collared study animals, 24 h a day, 7 days a week. These receiving units are connected by a wireless network to a server housed in the laboratory on BCI, making these data available in real time to researchers via a web-accessible database. As long as study animals are within the range of the towers, the ARTS system collects data more frequently than typical animal-borne global positioning system collars (similar to 12 locations/h) with lower accuracy (approximately 50 m) but at much reduced cost per tag (similar to 10X less expensive). The geographic range of ARTS, like all VHF telemetry, is affected by the size of the radio-tag as well as its position in the forest (e. g. tags in the canopy transmit farther than those on the forest floor). We present a model of signal propagation based on landscape conditions, which quantifies these effects and identifies sources of interference, including weather events and human activity. ARTS has been used to track 374 individual animals from 38 species, including 17 mammal species, 12 birds, 7 reptiles or amphibians, as well as two species of plant seeds. These data elucidate the spatio-temporal dynamics of animal activity and movement at the site and have produced numerous peer-reviewed publications, student theses, magazine articles, educational programs and film documentaries. These data are also relevant to long-term population monitoring and conservation plans. Both the successes and the failures of the ARTS system are applicable to broader sensor network applications and are valuable for advancing sensor network research.","[Kays, Roland; Hirsch, Ben] New York State Museum & Sci Serv, Albany, NY USA; [Kays, Roland; Crofoot, Margaret; Obando, Daniel; Ortega, Alejandro; Hirsch, Ben; Wikelski, Martin] Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Balboa, Panama; [Tilak, Sameer; Fountain, Tony] Univ Calif San Diego, Calif Inst Telecommun & Informat Technol Calit2, San Diego, CA 92103 USA; [Crofoot, Margaret; Wikelski, Martin] Max Plank Inst Ornithol, Radolfzell am Bodensee, Germany; [Kuemmeth, Franz] E Obs, Gruenwald, Germany; [Mandel, Jamie] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Swenson, George] Univ Illinois, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Lambert, Thomas] Frostburg State Univ, Frostburg, MD 21532 USA",Smithsonian Institution; Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute; University of California System; University of California San Diego; Max Planck Society; Princeton University; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; University System of Maryland; Frostburg State University,"Kays, R (corresponding author), New York State Museum & Sci Serv, Albany, NY USA.",rkays@mail.nysed.gov,,,"US National Science Foundation [0756920, 0201307]; Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute; Frank Levinson Family Foundation; National Geographic Society",US National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute(Smithsonian InstitutionSmithsonian Tropical Research Institute); Frank Levinson Family Foundation; National Geographic Society(National Geographic Society),"This work was partially supported by the US National Science Foundation (Award Number: 0756920, 0201307), Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, Frank Levinson Family Foundation and National Geographic Society.",,53,101,103,1,134,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0010-4620,1460-2067,,COMPUT J,Comput.

However, climatological mean dry bias over the Indian sub-continent is further increased as compared to the previous version. Here we have attempted to link this dry bias with climatological mean bias in the Eurasian winter/spring snow, which is one of the important predictors of the Indian summer monsoon rainfall (ISMR). Simulation of interannual variability of the Eurasian snow and its teleconnection with the ISMR are quite reasonable in the model. Using composite analysis it is shown that a positive snow anomaly, which is comparable to the systematic bias in the model, results into significant decrease in the summer monsoon rainfall over the central India and part of the Equatorial Indian Ocean. Decrease in the summer monsoon rainfall is also found to be linked with weaker northward propagation of intraseasonal oscillation (ISO). A barotropic stationary wave triggered by positive snow anomaly over west Eurasia weakens the upper level monsoon circulation, which in turn reduces the zonal wind shear and hence, weakens the northward propagation of summer monsoon ISOs. A sensitivity experiment by reducing snow fall over Eurasian region causes decrease in winter and spring snow depth, which in turn leads to decrease in Indian summer monsoon rainfall. Results from the sensitivity experiment corroborate with those of composite analysis based on long free run. This study suggests that further improvements in the snow parametrization schemes as well as Arctic sea ice are needed to reduce the Eurasian snow bias during winter/spring, which may reduce the dry bias over Indian sub-continent and hence predictability aspect of the model.","[Saha, Subodh K.; Pokhrel, Samir; Chaudhari, Hemantkumar S.] Indian Inst Trop Meteorol, Pune 411008, Maharashtra, India",Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) - India; Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM),"Saha, SK (corresponding author), Indian Inst Trop Meteorol, Pune 411008, Maharashtra, India.",subodh@tropmet.res.in,"Saha, Subodh Kumar/S-6776-2019; Chaudhari, Hemantkumar/ABI-2294-2020","POKHREL, SAMIR/0000-0003-3011-2428; Chaudhari, Hemantkumar/0000-0002-6925-1890","Ministry of Earth Sciences, Government of India, New Delhi","Ministry of Earth Sciences, Government of India, New Delhi","We thank NCEP for making CFS available freely to scientific community.

A challenge of this century will be to secure enough fresh water for the world's increasing population. U.S. Army installations provide critical support to Army's mission. Army facilities face many risks which must be overcome to ensure that vital missions continue. Installation Energy and Water Plans (IEWPs) comprise one pivotal effort to ensure that facilities maintain access to the resources they need and can meet resilient solutions to maintain water supplies to sustain the people and environment. An essential component of the IEWP is the development of potential solutions, or courses of action (COAs) to address deficiencies that can improve an installation's baseline condition, ensuring energy and water (E&W) security and resiliency. The undertaking seeks to improve security and resiliency by considering the varied threats of disruption within installations and providing measures for adaptable recovery. These disruptions include environmental events, droughts and climatic events, spills, and water security threats. Increasing energy and water resiliency aims to maintain that Army's mission is successfully carried even if sources of water are cut off or compromised. The objective of this paper is to document water resiliency improvements in military installations by applying priority facilities demand estimation planning tools and reviewing courses of action and also providing lessons learned and tools that could be utilized for planned communities or city-based water management efforts. The IEWP process empowers stakeholders to improve military readiness through state-of-the-art solutions for enhanced security, resiliency, and mission assurance. These methods and use of standardized data sets could be pursued to be applied towards a broader scope of stakeholders to improve water resiliency for cities, communities, and industries outside of the military.","[Smith, Clint B.] US Army Engineer Res & Dev Ctr, Geospatial Res Lab, 7701 Telegraph Rd, Alexandria, VA 22315 USA; [Acevedo-Acevedo, Damarys; Martinez-Guerra, Edith; Medina, Victor F.] US Army Engineer Res & Dev Ctr, Environm Lab, 3909 Halls Ferry Rd, Vicksburg, MS 39180 USA; [Duczynski, Michael P.; Feliciano, Luisa, I] US Army Engineer Res & Dev Ctr, Construct Engn Res Lab, 2902 Newmark Dr, Champaign, IL 61822 USA; [Wolters, Susan R.; Melendez, Lauren] US Army Engineer Res & Dev Ctr, Environm Lab, 804 S Main St, Ft Worth, TX 76104 USA; [Garfinkle, Noah W.] US Army Engineer Res & Dev Ctr, Construct Engn Res Lab, POB 9005, Champaign, IL 61826 USA",United States Department of Defense; United States Army; U.S. Army Corps of Engineers; U.S. Army Engineer Research & Development Center (ERDC); Geospatial Research Laboratory (GRL); United States Department of Defense; United States Army; U.S. Army Corps of Engineers; U.S. Army Engineer Research & Development Center (ERDC); United States Department of Defense; United States Army; U.S. Army Corps of Engineers; U.S. Army Engineer Research & Development Center (ERDC); Construction Engineering Research Laboratory (CERL); United States Department of Defense; United States Army; U.S. Army Corps of Engineers; U.S. Army Engineer Research & Development Center (ERDC); United States Department of Defense; United States Army; U.S. Army Corps of Engineers; U.S. Army Engineer Research & Development Center (ERDC); Construction Engineering Research Laboratory (CERL),"Smith, CB (corresponding author), US Army Engineer Res & Dev Ctr, Geospatial Res Lab, 7701 Telegraph Rd, Alexandria, VA 22315 USA.",Clint.B.Smith@usace.army.mil; Damarys.Acevedo-Acevedo@usace.army.mil; Edith.L.Martinez-Guerra@usace.army.mi; Victor.F.Medina@usace.army.mil; Michael.P.Duczynski@usace.army.mil; Susan.R.Wolters@usace.army.mil; Noah.W.Garfinkle@usace.army.mil; Lauren.L.Melendez@usace.army.mil; Luisa.I.Feliciano@usace.army.mil,,,Installation Energy and Water Program (IEWP) through the U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC); Installation Energy and Water Program (IEWP) through the Applied Research Planning Support Center (ARPSC),Installation Energy and Water Program (IEWP) through the U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC); Installation Energy and Water Program (IEWP) through the Applied Research Planning Support Center (ARPSC),This research was supported by the Installation Energy and Water Program (IEWP) through the U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC) and the Applied Research Planning Support Center (ARPSC).,,27,0,0,0,0,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-0963,,,CLIM RISK MANAG,CLIM.

Of particular interest appears a pronounced regional dipole pattern of interannual climate variability over the South American continent particularly evident in ERA-Interim data. The trend dipole affects two distinct areas: the Andean Amazon basin and the Northeast Brazil. The target regions are characterized by rising and decreasing water content associated with water vapor convergence (divergence) and upward (downward) mass fluxes, respectively. As expected, local water vapor feedback due to local surface temperature change does to not fully explain this TCW trend dipole; other mechanisms may play a role in establishing the observed feature such as moisture transports and monsoon variability in the last decade. The observed trends of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) during the period 1982-2005 show an increasing greenness that coincides with the moistening of the atmospheric column in the Amazon basin.

It has been attributed to natural variability(2-5), over-grazing(6) and the impact of industrial emissions of sulphur dioxide(7,8). Each mechanism can influence the Atlantic sea surface temperature gradient, which is strongly coupled to Sahelian precipitation(2,3). We suggest that sporadic volcanic eruptions in the Northern Hemisphere also strongly influence this gradient and cause Sahelian drought. Using de-trended observations from 1900 to 2010, we show that three of the four driest Sahelian summers were preceded by substantial Northern Hemisphere volcanic eruptions. We use a state-of-the-art coupled global atmosphere-ocean model to simulate both episodic volcanic eruptions and geoengineering by continuous deliberate injection into the stratosphere. In either case, large asymmetric stratospheric aerosol loadings concentrated in the Northern Hemisphere are a harbinger of Sahelian drought whereas those concentrated in the Southern Hemisphere induce a greening of the Sahel. Further studies of the detailed regional impacts on the Sahel and other vulnerable areas are required to inform policymakers in developing careful consensual global governance before any practical solar radiation management geoengineering scheme is implemented.","[Haywood, Jim M.; Jones, Andy; Bellouin, Nicolas] Met Off Hadley Ctr, Exeter EX1 3PB, Devon, England; [Haywood, Jim M.; Stephenson, David] Univ Exeter, CEMPS, Exeter EX4 4QF, Devon, England",Met Office - UK; Hadley Centre; University of Exeter,"Haywood, JM (corresponding author), Met Off Hadley Ctr, FitzRoy Rd, Exeter EX1 3PB, Devon, England.",j.m.haywood@exeter.ac.uk,"Haywood, Jim/GQA-6691-2022","Bellouin, Nicolas/0000-0003-2109-9559; Haywood, Jim/0000-0002-2143-6634","SPICE programme; IAGP programme; Joint DECC/Defra Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme; EPSRC [EP/I01473X/1, EP/I014721/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/I01473X/1, EP/I014721/1] Funding Source: researchfish; Natural Environment Research Council [1221323] Funding Source: researchfish",SPICE programme; IAGP programme; Joint DECC/Defra Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme; EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"N.

The large spread of simulated precipitation change signals underlines the need of an evaluation of the individual general circulation models in order to give higher weights to better and lower weights to worse performing models. The models' spread comprises part of the internal climate variability, but is also due to the differing skills of the circulation models. The uncertainty resulting from the latter is the aim of our weighting approach. Each weight is based on the skill to simulate key predictor variables in context of large and medium scale atmospheric circulation patterns within a statistical downscaling framework for the Mediterranean precipitation. Therefore, geopotential heights, sea level pressure, atmospheric layer thickness, horizontal wind components and humidity data at several atmospheric levels are considered. The novelty of this metric consists in avoiding the use of the precipitation data by itself for the weighting process, as state-of-the-art models still have major deficits in simulating precipitation. The application of the weights on the downscaled precipitation changes leads to more reliable and precise change signals in some Mediterranean sub-regions and seasons. The model weights differ between sub-regions and seasons, however, a clear sequence from better to worse models for the representation of precipitation in the Mediterranean area becomes apparent.","[Kaspar-Ott, Irena; Hertig, Elke; Kaspar, Severin; Jacobeit, Jucundus] Univ Augsburg, Inst Geog, Alter Postweg 118, D-86159 Augsburg, Germany; [Pollinger, Felix; Ring, Christoph; Paeth, Heiko] Univ Wurzburg, Inst Geog & Geol, Wurzburg, Germany",University of Augsburg; University of Wurzburg,"Kaspar-Ott, I (corresponding author), Univ Augsburg, Inst Geog, Alter Postweg 118, D-86159 Augsburg, Germany.",irena.kaspar-ott@geo.uni-augsburg.de,,"Pollinger, Felix/0000-0002-9519-2433; Kaspar-Ott, Irena/0000-0002-5151-201X; Hertig, Elke/0000-0002-6934-9468",German Research Foundation,German Research Foundation(German Research Foundation (DFG)),German Research Foundation,,34,5,5,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0899-8418,1097-0088,,INT J CLIMATOL,Int.

Of particular controversy is the question, whether temperature sensitivity differs between young or labile and old or more stable carbon pools. Ambiguities in experimental methodology have so far limited corroboration of any particular hypothesis. Here, we show in a clear-cut approach that differences in temperature sensitivity between young and old carbon are negligible. Using the change in stable composition in transitional systems from C3 to C4 vegetation, we were able to directly distinguish the temperature sensitivity of carbon differing several decades in age. This method had several advantages over previously followed approaches. It allowed to identify release of much older carbon, avoided un-natural conditions of long-term incubations and did not require arguable curve-fitting. Our results demonstrate that feedbacks of the carbon cycle on climate change are driven equally by young and old soil organic carbon.","Univ Basel, Inst Environm Geosci, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland; ART Res Stn, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland",University of Basel,"Conen, F (corresponding author), Univ Basel, Inst Environm Geosci, Bernoullistr 30, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland.",franz.conen@unibas.ch,"Leifeld, Jens/GYR-0349-2022; Leifeld, Jens/A-3298-2014; Alewell, Christine/K-5104-2016","Leifeld, Jens/0000-0002-7245-9852; Leifeld, Jens/0000-0002-7245-9852; Conen, Franz/0000-0003-4821-5775; Alewell, Christine/0000-0001-9295-9806",,,,,28,101,110,7,68,EUROPEAN  GEOSCIENCES UNION,KATLENBURG-LINDAU,"MAX-PLANCK-STR 13, 37191 KATLENBURG-LINDAU, GERMANY",1726-4170,,,BIOGEOSCIENCES,Biogeosciences,,2006,4,,,,515,519,,10.5194/bg-3-515-2006,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/bg-3-515-2006,,,5,"Ecology; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology,130FO,,"Green Submitted, Green Accepted, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000243785300009,View Full Record in Web of Science

These so-called cable bacteria perform an electrogenic form of sulfur oxidation, whereby long-distance electron transport links sulfide oxidation in deeper sediment horizons to oxygen reduction in the upper millimetres of the sediment. Electrogenic sulfur oxidation exerts a strong impact on the local sediment biogeochemistry, but it is currently unknown how prevalent the process is within the seafloor. Here we provide a state-of-the-art assessment of its global distribution by combining new field observations with previous reports from the literature. This synthesis demonstrates that electrogenic sulfur oxidation, and hence microbial long-distance electron transport, is a widespread phenomenon in the present-day seafloor. The process is found in coastal sediments within different climate zones (off the Netherlands, Greenland, the USA, Australia) and thrives on a range of different coastal habitats (estuaries, salt marshes, mangroves, coastal hypoxic basins, intertidal flats). The combination of a widespread occurrence and a strong local geochemical imprint suggests that electrogenic sulfur oxidation could be an important, and hitherto overlooked, component of the marine cycle of carbon, sulfur and other elements.","[Burdorf, Laurine D.

However, the limited availability of observations of karstic groundwater dynamics has been prohibiting the assessment of karst water resources at regional to global scales. This paper presents the first global effort to integrate experimental approaches and large-scale modeling. Using a global soil-moisture monitoring program and a global database of karst spring discharges, the simulations of a preliminary global karstic-groundwater-recharge model are evaluated. It is shown that soil moisture is a crucial variable that better distinguishes recharge dynamics in different climates and for different land cover types. The newly developed dataset of karst spring discharges provides first insights into the wide variability of discharge volumes and recharge areas of different karst springs around the globe. Comparing the model simulations with the newly collected soil-moisture and spring-discharge observations, indicates that (1) improvements of the recharge model are still necessary to obtain a better representation of different land cover types and snow processes, and (2) there is a need to incorporate groundwater dynamics. Applying and strictly evaluating these improvements in the model will finally provide a tool to identify hot spots of current or future water scarcity in the karst regions around the globe, thus supporting national and international water governance.","[Hartmann, Andreas; Liu, Yan; Olarinoye, Tunde; Berthelin, Romane; Marx, Vera] Univ Freiburg, Friedrichstr 39, D-79098 Freiburg, Germany; [Hartmann, Andreas] Univ Bristol, Dept Civil Engn, Bristol, Avon, England",University of Freiburg; University of Bristol,"Hartmann, A (corresponding author), Univ Freiburg, Friedrichstr 39, D-79098 Freiburg, Germany.;Hartmann, A (corresponding author), Univ Bristol, Dept Civil Engn, Bristol, Avon, England.",andreas.hartmann@hydmod.uni-freiburg.de,"Hartmann, Andreas/J-8515-2014","Hartmann, Andreas/0000-0003-0407-742X; Olarinoye, Tunde/0000-0002-1763-8903; Liu, Yan/0000-0002-9871-8920","Projekt DEAL; Emmy Noether Programme of the German Research Foundation (DFG) [HA 8113/1-1]; Innovation Fund of Freiburg University; RiSC of the Ministry for Science, Research and Art of Baden-Wuerttemberg","Projekt DEAL; Emmy Noether Programme of the German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Innovation Fund of Freiburg University; RiSC of the Ministry for Science, Research and Art of Baden-Wuerttemberg","Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.

Nevertheless, major discrepancies still exist between observed and simulated seasonal carbon, water and energy fluxes at the vegetated land-surface. For tropical forest, these discrepancies have been reduced, especially during the dry season, by taking account of tap roots and hydraulic redistribution. The expanding FLUXNET open-access archive allows the current study to extend the investigation of seasonal drought-stress to ten different vegetation types. A state-of-the-art land-surface model is enhanced to take account of tap roots and hydraulic redistribution in order to compare with traditional simulations. Carbon fluxes and fractional soil water content are simulated and compared against observations. We find that a traditional approach, by neglecting tap roots, simulates a seasonal drought for trees and shrubs which is generally too severe compared to observed net carbon flux. The introduction of a tap root benefits tropical broadleaf forest and other ecosystems with high annual potential evapotranspiration in reducing observation-model discrepancies. Our simulations suggest a minor role for hydraulic redistribution, modifying weekly soil moisture rather than substantially changing seasonal water flux totals. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Caicara live primarily by artisanal small-scale fishing, cultivation of modest crops, and recently, catering to tourists. Their ways of life have remained substantially unchanged hundreds of years, until recently. The pattern of their lives highlights changing ecological conditions, manifesting vulnerability of the ecosystem and traditional fishing practices. Linked intimately to the environment, their ways serve to magnify many of the world's most pressing concerns about climate change, the need for conservation, the effects of governmental regulation and the devaluing of traditional knowledge. The representation - or misrepresentation - of a people to the wider world crucially shapes their fortunes and promotes or inhibits their ability to effect positive conditions in their environment.

Objectives to attaining such an understanding include improving upon the current state-of-the-art sensor calibration and developing systematic validation methods for remotely sensed microphysical properties. While advances in active and passive remote sensors will lead to needed improvements in retrieval accuracies and capabilities, ongoing validation is essential so that the changing sensor characteristics do not mask atmospheric trends. Surface-based radiometer, chemical, and lidar networks have critical roles within an integrated observing system, yet they currently undersample key geographic regions, have limitations in certain measurement capabilities, and lack stable funding. In situ aircraft observations of size-resolved aerosol chemical composition are necessary to provide important linkages between active and passive remote sensing. A planned, systematic approach toward a global aerosol observing network, involving multiple sponsoring agencies and surface-based, suborbital, and spaceborne sensors, is required to prioritize trade-offs regarding capabilities and costs. This strategy is a key ingredient of the Progressive Aerosol Retrieval and Assimilation Global Observing Network (PARAGON) framework.

These trends are not yet evident in Latvia, but they are relevant in the context of the forthcoming climate crisis. At the same time, the demand for healthy locally grown food and zero waste products has increased noticeably. Residents of cities and towns are eager to buy products of known origin, quality and processing factories. However, the only way how to be fully convinced of the quality and transparency of the food products is to grow and prepare food stuffs on our own. There are the following questions to be answered: Do we have enough knowledge how to grow, for example, tomatoes? Haven't people forgotten natural processes while using the advantages of the development of technologies? What would happen if we created PLACES where people could both explore and learn, share and experience? As regards such towns in Latvia as Sigulda, where there is a rapid growth of the population and the number of declared residents, it is necessary to promote the creation of the sense of community and education processes due to the lack of the communication opportunities which would promote the interaction of different social groups and enhance the formation of a sustainable society.

Benefit Transfer is a practical way to consider non-market values using functions and estimates acquired through primary valuation methods from other sites. Among the primary methods, Choice Experiments appear to particularly accommodate Benefit Transfer. Nevertheless, validity and reliability of international value transfers obtained from Choice Experiments have not been adequately examined. To this end, two identical Choice Experiments were conducted in Greece and Italy in the context of river services adaptation, testing validity and reliability of Benefit Transfer. The application of validity and reliability tests for different types of transfers is supportive for the use of Benefit Transfer, at least for the value transfer types. In particular the reliability of value transfer was higher when income adjustments were taken into account. Overall, Benefit Transfer can be attentively considered to evaluate cost-effective adaptation policies across countries experiencing similar climate change trends. The latter gains more importance given that an international Benefit Transfer setting as regards the non-market benefits of adaptation to climate change for river services is absent in the relevant literature.

Relatively less effort has been directed toward spatially-explicit studies of vegetation-hydrology interactions at larger scales of a landscape. Only few continuous, process-oriented ecohydrological models had been proposed with structures of varying complexity. This study contributes to their further evolution and presents a novel ecohydrological model, Tethys-Chloris. The model synthesizes the state-of-the-art knowledge on individual processes and coupling mechanisms drawn from the disciplines of hydrology, plant physiology, and ecology. Specifically, the model reproduces all essential components of the hydrological cycle: it resolves the mass and energy budgets in the atmospheric surface layer at the hourly scale, while representing up to two layers of vegetation; it includes a module of snowpack evolution; it describes the saturated and unsaturated soil water dynamics, processes of runoff generation and flow routing. The component of vegetation dynamics parameterizes life cycle processes of different plant functional types, including photosynthesis, phenology, carbon allocation, and tissue turnover. This study presents a confirmation of the long-term, plot-scale model performance by simulating two types of ecosystems corresponding to different climate conditions. A consistent and highly satisfactory model skill in reproducing the energy and water budgets as well as physiological cycles of plants with minimum calibration overhead is demonstrated. Furthermore, these applications demonstrate that the model permits the identification of data types and observation frequencies crucial for appropriate evaluation of modeled dynamics. More importantly, through a synthesis of a wide array of process representations, the model ensures that climate, soil, vegetation, and topography collectively identify essential modes controlling ecohydrological systems, i.e., that satisfactory performance is a result of appropriate mimicking of internal processes.","[Fatichi, S.] ETH, Inst Environm Engn, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Fatichi, S.; Caporali, E.] Univ Florence, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Florence, Italy; [Fatichi, S.; Ivanov, V.

Models are valuable tools to assess their effectiveness. Watershed managers need to choose appropriate and effective modelling methods for a given set of conditions. This paper considered state-of-the-art modelling strategies for the assessment of agricultural BMPs. Typical watershed models and specific models were analyzed in detail. Further improvements, including simplified tools, model integration, and incorporation of climate change and uncertainty analysis were also explored. This paper indicated that modelling methods are strictly scale dependent, both spatially and temporally. Despite current achievements, there is still room for future research, such as broadening the range of the pollutants considered, introducing more local BMPs, improving the representation of the functionality of BMPs, and gathering monitoring date for validation of modelled results. There is also a trend towards agricultural decision support systems (DSSs) for assessing agricultural BMPs, in which models of different scales are seamlessly integrated to bridge the scale and data gaps. This review will assist readers in model selection and development, especially those readers concerned about NPS pollution and water quality control.","[Xie, Hui; Chen, Lei; Shen, Zhenyao] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Environm, State Key Lab Water Environm, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China",Beijing Normal University,"Chen, L (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Environm, State Key Lab Water Environm, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",bnuxiehui@hotmail.com; chenlei1982bnu@bnu.edu.cn; zyshen@bnu.edu.cn,"Chen, Lei/AAD-3766-2019","Chen, Lei/0000-0001-8415-3896; Xie, Hui/0000-0002-8648-0177",National Science Foundation for Innovative Research Group [51121003]; National Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars [51025933]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [51409003],National Science Foundation for Innovative Research Group; National Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This study was supported by the National Science Foundation for Innovative Research Group (No. 51121003), the National Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars (No. 51025933), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51409003).",,93,41,47,3,132,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,MAR,2015,3,,,,1088,1108,,10.3390/w7031088,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w7031088,,,21,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,CF1DP,,"Green Submitted, gold, Green Published",,,12/21/22,WOS:000352284200014,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Cairns, DM",,,,"Cairns, DM",,,Simulating carbon balance at treeline for krummholz and dwarf tree growth forms,ECOLOGICAL MODELLING,,,English,Article,,,,,,canopy representation; treeline; forest process modeling; krummholz,TERRESTRIAL BIOSPHERE MODEL; NET PRIMARY PRODUCTION; OF-THE-ART; FOREST GROWTH; NATIONAL-PARK; DYNAMICS; CLIMATE; WIND; RECONSTRUCTION; PRODUCTIVITY,"Modeling vegetation systems has become one of the most powerful methods available for predicting the response of modem vegetation assemblages to future changes in climate. The alpine treeline is a landscape feature that is coupled to climate and is expected to change location with changes in climate. In the Rocky Mountains, treeline environments are dominated by two distinct growth forms. Dwarf trees are stunted trees that retain an arboreal growth form and krummholz are trees that have assumed a mat-like growth form. Models of treeline dynamics have not taken into account these differences. In this study, I investigate the effects of canopy type on carbon balances predicted using ATE-BGC. ATE-BGC is a forest process model that has been developed specifically for treeline environments. The canopies of dwarf trees and krummholz differ with regard to the vertical distribution of leaf area index (LAI) and light within the canopies. The thermal regimes of the two canopy types also differ vertically. These differences within and between canopy types have significant effects on simulated carbon balance. Dwarf tree canopies are simulated to have higher carbon balances for all leaf area index values above 4 and carbon balances for both canopy types decrease with increases in LAI. The incorporation of vertical changes in the thermal regime does not have a significant impact on carbon balance for either canopy type. The results show that canopy type is an important factor to consider when modeling the alpine treeline. The results also suggest avenues for future modification to the ATE-BGC model. The inclusion of a mechanism to allow for a physiognomic switch (dwarf tree to krummholz or krummholz to dwarf tree) would benefit future simulations of treeline response to climate change.

However, their environmental impacts remain largely unknown, particularly considering state-of-the-art CIGS manufacturing techniques. This study estimates the life cycle environmental impacts of CIGS PV installations in the UK and Spain, including balance-of-system components, using real manufacturing data. It also analyses newly-developed CIGS, replacing the cadmium sulphide (CdS) buffer layer with zinc oxysulphide (Zn(O,S)) via atomic layer deposition (AID). The results show that UK installations have 72% higher impacts than those in Spain, including climate change (25.1 vs 14.6 g CO2 eq./kWh). The inverter and electrical components are the main contributors (46% on average), followed by the PV modules (41%). In comparison to CdTe, mono-Si and multi-Si PV, CIGS has 6%-90% lower impacts in 16 out of 18 categories, including climate change (16%-50% lower). However, metal depletion is five times higher, and land use 12%-31% greater. The replacement of CdS has a small but positive effect, demonstrating that cadmium can be eliminated from the CIGS life cycle without environmental penalties. These results will be of interest to PV manufacturers and policy makers, indicating improvement opportunities and areas for policy intervention. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

This requires a large-scale transformation of the global energy system based on the uptake of several technological options to reduce drastically emissions, including expansion of renewable energy, energy efficiency improvements, and fuel switch towards low-carbon energy carriers. The current study explores the role of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) as a mitigation option, which provides a dispatchable source for carbon-free production of electricity and can also be used to decarbonise industrial processes. In the last decade, limited technology progress and slow deployment of CCS technologies worldwide have increased the concerns about the feasibility and potential for massive scale-up of CCS required for deep decarbonisation. The current study uses the state-of-the-art PROMETHEUS global energy demand and supply system model to examine the role and impacts of CCS deployment in a global decarbonisation context. By developing contrasted decarbonisation scenarios, the analysis illustrates that CCS deployment might bring about various economic and climate benefits for developing economies, in the form of reduced emissions, lower mitigation costs, ensuring the cost efficient integration of renewables, limiting stranded fossil fuel assets, and alleviating the negative distributional impacts of cost-optimal policies for developing economies.","[Fragkos, Panagiotis] E3Modelling SA, Panormou 70-72,PO 11523, Athens, Greece",,"Fragkos, P (corresponding author), E3Modelling SA, Panormou 70-72,PO 11523, Athens, Greece.",fragkos@e3modelling.com,,"Fragkos, Panagiotis/0000-0003-3596-0661","European Union Horizon 2020 research and innovation program [821124, 101003866]",European Union Horizon 2020 research and innovation program,The research leading to this study has received funding from the European Union Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under grant agreement No 821124 (NAVIGATE) and No 101003866 (NDC ASPECTS).,,48,5,5,1,9,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1996-1073,,ENERGIES,Energies,APR,2021,7,,,,,,1879,10.3390/en14071879,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en14071879,,,20,Energy & Fuels,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Energy & Fuels,RK6QS,,"Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000638418900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The majority of tropical nations need high-resolution, satellite-based maps of their forests as the international community now works to craft an incentive-based mechanism to compensate tropical nations for maintaining their forests intact. The effectiveness of such a mechanism will depend in large part on the capacity of current and near-future Earth observation satellites to provide information that meets the requirements of international monitoring protocols now being discussed. Here we assess the ability of a state-of-the-art satellite radar sensor, the ALOS/PALSAR, to support large-area land cover classification as well as high-resolution baseline mapping of tropical forest cover. Through a comprehensive comparative analysis involving twenty separate PALSAR-and Landsat-based classifications, we confirm the potential of PALSAR as an accurate (>90%) source for spatially explicit estimates of forest cover based on data and analyses from a large and diverse region encompassing the Xingu River headwaters in southeastern Amazonia. Pair-wise spatial comparisons among maps derived from PALSAR, Landsat, and PRODES, the Brazilian Amazon deforestation monitoring program, revealed a high degree of spatial similarity. Given that a long-term data record consisting of current and future spaceborne radar sensors is now expected, our results point to the important role that spaceborne imaging radar can play in complementing optical remote sensing to enable the design of robust forest monitoring systems.","[Walker, Wayne S.; Stickler, Claudia M.; Kellndorfer, Josef M.; Kirsch, Katie M.; Nepstad, Daniel C.] Woods Hole Res Ctr, Falmouth, MA 02540 USA; [Stickler, Claudia M.; Nepstad, Daniel C.] Inst Pesquisa Ambiental Amazonia, BR-71503505 Brasilia, DF, Brazil",Woods Hole Research Center,"Walker, WS (corresponding author), Woods Hole Res Ctr, Falmouth, MA 02540 USA.",wwalker@whrc.org,,,Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation; Google.org; David and Lucile Packard Foundation; NASA,Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation(Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation); Google.org(Google Incorporated); David and Lucile Packard Foundation(The David & Lucile Packard Foundation); NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)),"The authors thank the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, Google.org, and the David and Lucile Packard Foundation for supporting this work.

Unfortunately, resource preferences are often unknown to policy-makers and have to be inferred from data. In this paper we consider the problem of inferring agents' preferences from observed movement trajectories, and formulate it as an Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) problem. With the goal of informing policy-making, we take a probabilistic approach and consider generative models that can be used to simulate behavior under new circumstances such as changes in resource availability, access policies, or climate. We study the Dynamic Discrete Choice (DDC) models from econometrics and prove that they generalize the Max-Entropy IRL model, a widely used probabilistic approach from the machine learning literature. Furthermore, we develop SPL-GD, a new learning algorithm for DDC models that is considerably faster than the state of the art and scales to very large datasets. We consider an application in the context of pastoralism in the arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, where migratory pastoralists face regular risks due to resource availability, droughts, and resource degradation from climate change and development. We show how our approach based on satellite and survey data can accurately model migratory pastoralism in East Africa and that it considerably outperforms other approaches on a large-scale real-world dataset of pastoralists' movements in Ethiopia collected over 3 years.","[Ermon, Stefano] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Xue, Yexiang; Bernstein, Richard; DeGloria, Steve; Barrett, Christopher; Gomes, Carla P.] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Toth, Russell] Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Dilkina, Bistra] Georgia Tech, Atlanta, GA USA; [Damoulas, Theodoros] NYU CUSP, New York, NY USA; [Clark, Patrick] USDA, Res Serv, Washington, DC USA; [Mude, Andrew] Int Livestock Res Inst, Nairobi, Kenya",Stanford University; Cornell University; University of Sydney; University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); CGIAR; International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI),"Ermon, S (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",ermon@cs.stanford.edu; yexiang@cs.cornell.edu; russell.toth@sydney.edu.au; bdilkina@cc.gatech.edu; rab38@cornell.edu; td47@nyu.edu; pat.clark@ars.usda.gov; sdd4@cornell.edu; a.mude@cgiar.org; cbb2@cornell.edu; gomes@cs.cornell.edu,"Barrett, Christopher B./A-9750-2009","Barrett, Christopher B./0000-0001-9139-2721","NSF Expeditions in Computing grant on Computational Sustainability [0832782]; Computing research infrastructure for constraint optimization, machine learning, and dynamical models for Computational Sustainability grant [1059284]; Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade of Australia [2012 ADRAS 66138]; David R.

In view of the anticipated oxygen loss in aquatic systems due to eutrophication and climate change, HYPOX was set up to improve capacities to monitor hypoxia as well as to understand its causes and consequences. Temporal dynamics and spatial patterns of hypoxia were analyzed in field studies in various aquatic environments, including the Baltic Sea, the Black Sea, Scottish and Scandinavian fjords, Ionian Sea lagoons and embayments, and Swiss lakes. Examples of episodic and rapid (hours) occurrences of hypoxia, as well as seasonal changes in bottom-water oxygenation in stratified systems, are discussed. Geologically driven hypoxia caused by gas seepage is demonstrated. Using novel technologies, temporal and spatial patterns of water-column oxygenation, from basin-scale seasonal patterns to meter-scale sub-micromolar oxygen distributions, were resolved. Existing multidecadal monitoring data were used to demonstrate the imprint of climate change and eutrophication on long-term oxygen distributions. Organic and inorganic proxies were used to extend investigations on past oxygen conditions to centennial and even longer timescales that cannot be resolved by monitoring. The effects of hypoxia on faunal communities and biogeochemical processes were also addressed in the project. An investigation of benthic fauna is presented as an example of hypoxia-devastated benthic communities that slowly recover upon a reduction in eutrophication in a system where naturally occurring hypoxia overlaps with anthropogenic hypoxia. Biogeochemical investigations reveal that oxygen intrusions have a strong effect on the microbially mediated redox cycling of elements. Observations and modeling studies of the sediments demonstrate the effect of seasonally changing oxygen conditions on benthic mineralization pathways and fluxes. Data quality and access are crucial in hypoxia research. Technical issues are therefore also addressed, including the availability of suitable sensor technology to resolve the gradual changes in bottom-water oxygen in marine systems that can be expected as a result of climate change. Using cabled observatories as examples, we show how the benefit of continuous oxygen monitoring can be maximized by adopting proper quality control. Finally, we discuss strategies for state-of-the-art data archiving and dissemination in compliance with global standards, and how ocean observations can contribute to global earth observation attempts.","[Friedrich, J.; He, Y.; Stanev, E.

However, their broad implications beyond climate change remain unclear as previous studies ma i n l y focused on analyzing their carbon footprint. To fi l l this gap, here, we evaluated the environmental and economic impact of Fischer- Tropsch electro-diesel (FT e-diesel) synthesized from electrolytic H-2 and captured CO2. We consider various power (wind, solar, nuclear, or the current mix) and carbon sources (capture from the air (DAC) or a coal power plant) while covering a range of impacts on human health, ecosystems, and resources. Applying process simulation and life cycle assessment (LCA), we found that producing e-diesel from wind and nuclear H-2 combined with DAC CO2 could reduce the carbon footprint relative to fossil diesel, leading to burden-shifting in human health and ecosystems. Also, it would incur prohibitive costs, even when considering externalities (i.e., indirect costs of environmental impacts). Overall, this work highlights the need to embrace environmental impacts beyond climate change in the analysis of alternative fuels and raises concerns about the environmental appeal of electro-fuels.","[Medrano-Garcia, Juan D.; Charalambous, Margarita A.; Guillen-Gosalbez, Gonzalo] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Chem & Bioengn, Dept Chem & Appl Biosci, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Guillen-Gosalbez, G (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Chem & Bioengn, Dept Chem & Appl Biosci, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland.",gonzalo.guillen.gosalbez@chem.ethz.ch,,"Charalambous, Margarita Athanasia/0000-0001-6097-0592; Medrano-Garcia, Juan D./0000-0001-5422-1683",National Centre of Competence in Research - Swiss National Science Foundation [180544],National Centre of Competence in Research - Swiss National Science Foundation,"This publication was created as part of NCCR Catalysis (Grant 180544) , a National Centre of Competence in Research funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation.",,45,0,0,7,7,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",2168-0485,,,ACS SUSTAIN CHEM ENG,ACS Sustain.

Within chemistry-climate and transport models this chemistry is simplified for computational expediency. We compare the state of the art Master Chemical Mechanism (MCM) with six tropospheric chemistry schemes (CRI-reduced, GEOS-CHEM and a GEOS-CHEM adduct, MOZART-2, TOMCAT and CBM-IV) that could be used within composition transport models. We test the schemes within a box model framework under conditions derived from a composition transport model and from field observations from a regional scale pollution event. We find that CRI-reduced provides much skill in simulating the full chemistry, yet with greatly reduced complexity. We find significant variations between the other chemical schemes, and reach the following conclusions. 1) The inclusion of a gas phase N2O5+H2O reaction in one scheme and not others is a large source of uncertainty in the inorganic chemistry. 2) There are significant variations in the calculated concentration of PAN between the schemes, which will affect the long range transport of reactive nitrogen in global models. 3) The representation of isoprene chemistry differs hugely between the schemes, leading to significant uncertainties on the impact of isoprene on composition. 4) Differences are found in NO3 concentrations in the night-time chemistry. Resolving these four issues through further investigative laboratory studies will reduce the uncertainties within the chemical schemes of global tropospheric models.","[Emmerson, K. M.; Evans, M.

Environmental authorities worldwide have responded to these climate challenges through the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. In this context, it is key to ascertain empirically whether emission levels are converging among the countries forming the industrialized world. In doing so, we focus on 23 industrialized countries using a novel dataset with ten series of annual estimates of anthropogenic emissions that include aerosols, aerosol precursor and reactive compounds, and carbon dioxide over the 1820-2018 period. We apply four state-of-the-art panel unit root tests that allow for several forms of time-dependent and state-dependent nonlinearity. Our evidence supports stochastic convergence following a linear process for carbon dioxide, whereas the adjustment is nonlinear for black carbon, carbon monoxide, methane, non-methane volatile organic compounds, nitrous oxide, nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide. In contrast, ammonia and organic carbon emissions appear to diverge. As for deterministic convergence, carbon dioxide converges linearly, while black carbon, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, non-methane volatile organic compounds and sulfur dioxide adjust nonlinearly. Our results carry important policy implications concerning the achievement of SDG13 of the global 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which appears to be feasible for the converging compounds.","[Romero-Avila, Diego] Univ Pablo Olavide, Dept Econ, Km 1, Seville, Spain; [Omay, Tolga] Atilim Univ, TR-06830 Ankara, Turkey",Universidad Pablo de Olavide; Atilim University,"Romero-Avila, D (corresponding author), Univ Pablo Olavide, Dept Econ, Km 1, Seville, Spain.",dromtor@upo.es; tolga.omay@atilim.edu.tr,,,"Universidad Pablo de Olavide; CRUE-CSIC; Springer Nature; Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities [AEI/FEDER, UE] [ECO2017-86780-R]; Junta de Andalucia [P20_00808, PAIDI SEJ-513]","Universidad Pablo de Olavide; CRUE-CSIC; Springer Nature; Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities [AEI/FEDER, UE](Spanish Government); Junta de Andalucia(Junta de Andalucia)","Open Access funding provided thanks to the Universidad Pablo de Olavide and CRUE-CSIC agreement with Springer Nature.

The same considerations are effective for the well-known environmental problems related to direct and indirect emissions of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and the incentives to support energy efficiency. In this work an air to water heat pump working with R290 and HFO1234yf has been modeled and simulated using the software package IMST-ART in order to evaluate the seasonal performance. Two different types of applications were considered: fan coils and radiant heat floor panels. Different types of building are considered. The seasonal performance in heating mode, SCOP, is calculated by coupling the performance of the heat pump in different operative conditions to a heating demand curve, in two different climate zones (average and colder). The results of the simulations show better performance of the heat pump with propane in both climates and applications, which is probably due to the state of current technology of the different components. In particular, the global performance of the compressor working with R1234yf is not yet optimized. At the same time a new design of the evaporator is desirable to reduce the pressure drops with R1234yf. (C) 2015 The Authors.

This study introduces a supplemental and improved set of land surface hydrological fields (MERRA-Land) generated by rerunning a revised version of the land component of the MERRA system. Specifically, the MERRA-Land estimates benefit from corrections to the precipitation forcing with the Global Precipitation Climatology Project pentad product (version 2.1) and from revised parameter values in the rainfall interception model, changes that effectively correct for known limitations in the MERRA surface meteorological forcings. The skill (defined as the correlation coefficient of the anomaly time series) in land surface hydrological fields from MERRA and MERRA-Land is assessed here against observations and compared to the skill of the state-of-the-art ECMWF Re-Analysis-Interim (ERA-I). MERRA-Land and ERA-I root zone soil moisture skills (against in situ observations at 85 U.S. stations) are comparable and significantly greater than that of MERRA. Throughout the Northern Hemisphere, MERRA and MERRA-Land agree reasonably well with in situ snow depth measurements (from 583 stations) and with snow water equivalent from an independent analysis. Runoff skill (against naturalized stream flow observations from 18 U.S. basins) of MERRA and MERRA-Land is typically higher than that of ERA-I. With a few exceptions, the MERRA-Land data appear more accurate than the original MERRA estimates and are thus recommended for those interested in using MERRA output for land surface hydrological studies.","[Reichle, Rolf H.; Koster, Randal D.; De Lannoy, Gabrielle J.

Considering the complexity of biodiesel production processes, process design, quantitative evaluation and optimization of the biodiesel from whole systems perspectives is essential for unlocking the complexity and enhancing the system performances. Process systems engineering offers an efficient approach to design and optimize biodiesel manufacturing systems by using a variety of tools. This review reflects state-of-the-art biodiesel research in the field of process systems engineering with a particular focus on biodiesel production including process design and simulation, sustainability evaluation, optimization and supply chain management. This review also highlights the challenges and opportunities for the development of potentially sustainable and eco-friendly enzymatic biodiesel technology.","[Pasha, Mustafa Kamal; Dai, Lingmei; Liu, Dehua; Du, Wei] Tsinghua Univ, Minist Educ, Dept Chem Engn, Key Lab Ind Biocatalysis, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Guo, Miao] Kings Coll London, Fac Nat & Math Sci, Dept Engn, London, England; [Liu, Dehua; Du, Wei] Tsinghua Innovat Ctr Dongguan, Dongguan 523808, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Tsinghua University; University of London; King's College London,"Du, W (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Minist Educ, Dept Chem Engn, Key Lab Ind Biocatalysis, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.;Guo, M (corresponding author), Kings Coll London, Fac Nat & Math Sci, Dept Engn, London, England.",miao.guo@kcl.ac.uk; duwei@tsinghua.edu.cn,"Guo, Miao/AAM-6196-2020","Guo, Miao/0000-0001-7733-5077; Pasha, Mustafa Kamal/0000-0002-7898-0251",China-Latin America Joint Laboratory for Clean Energy and Climate Change [KY201501004]; Dongguan Science & Technology Bureau (Innovative R&D Team Leadership of Dongguan City) [201536000100033],China-Latin America Joint Laboratory for Clean Energy and Climate Change; Dongguan Science & Technology Bureau (Innovative R&D Team Leadership of Dongguan City),"The authors express their gratitude to the support from China-Latin America Joint Laboratory for Clean Energy and Climate Change (KY201501004), and Dongguan Science & Technology Bureau (Innovative R&D Team Leadership of Dongguan City, 201536000100033).",,102,21,21,17,39,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,1754-6834,,BIOTECHNOL BIOFUELS,Biotechnol.

Tools for integrated mobility management will help reduce CO2 emissions and improve the quality of life of European citizens, contributing towards the Paris Agreement targets. Sustainable mobility solutions are deemed as increasingly relevant for tourism destinations, especially in natural protected areas like the Danube Delta Biosphere Reserve, where environmental pressures from touristic activities need to be mitigated in order to preserve biodiversity and landscape quality. Practices that aim at reducing the socio-ecological impact of visitor movement within the territory include providing visitors with the necessary support for responsible tourism, including comprehensive and up-to-date information on ecotourism alternatives and sustainable mobility options for their trips. The premises for creating a mobility information centre for Danube Delta, as a measure for increasing the quality of services provided in the nodes of an international destinations network along the Danube, have been studied in the context of the activities carried out in the Inter-reg Danube project Transdanube.Pearls. Based on a collection of best practices from comparative case studies across the European Union and an analysis of the state-of-the-art of regional mobility and tourism systems in the Danube Delta area, we conclude that establishing a regional mobility centre in Tulcea municipality, in a close partnership with relevant stakeholders, would positively impact the mobility behaviour of both tourists and inhabitants and increase mobility management capacities of local and regional authorities.","[Sbarcea, M.; Bratfanof, E.; Tudor, M.] Danube Delta Natl Inst Res & Dev, 165 Babadag St, Tulcea 820112, Romania; [Sbarcea, M.] Ion Mincu Univ Architecture & Urban Planning, 18-20 Acad St, Bucharest 010014, Romania; [Cononov, C.] South East Reg Dev Agcy, 24 Anghel Saligny St, Braila 810118, Romania",Ion Mincu University of Architecture & Urbanism,"Sbarcea, M (corresponding author), Danube Delta Natl Inst Res & Dev, 165 Babadag St, Tulcea 820112, Romania.;Sbarcea, M (corresponding author), Ion Mincu Univ Architecture & Urban Planning, 18-20 Acad St, Bucharest 010014, Romania.",madalina.sbarcea@ddni.ro,,"Sbarcea, Madalina/0000-0002-4097-4809",Interreg Danube Transnational Programme,Interreg Danube Transnational Programme,"The present paper is grounded on the study developed for the Danube Delta Mobility Centre Business Plan, commissioned by the South-East Regional Development Agency as a deliverable of the Transdanube Pearls project, funded through the Interreg Danube Transnational Programme.",,17,0,0,0,3,SCIBULCOM LTD,SOFIA,"PO BOX 249, 1113 SOFIA, BULGARIA",1311-5065,,,J ENVIRON PROT ECOL,J.

In recent years, there has been a significant shift towards digital representation of soil maps and environmental variables and the associated activity of predictive soil mapping, where statistical analysis is used to create predictive models of soil properties. Predictive soil mapping requires less human intervention than traditional soil mapping techniques, and relies more oil computers to create models that can predict variation of soil properties. This paper reports on a multi-disciplinary collaborative project applying advanced data-mining techniques to predictive soil modelling for Honduras. Gaussian process models are applied to map continuous soil variables of texture and pH in Honduras at a spatial resolution of I km, using 2472 sites with soil sample data and 32 terrain, climate, vegetation and geology related variables. Using split sample validation, 45% of variability in soil pH was explained, 17% in clay content and 24% in sand content. The principle variables that the models selected were climate related. Gaussian process models are shown to be powerful approaches to digital soil mapping, especially when multiple explanatory variables are available. The reported work leverages the knowledge of the soil science and computer science communities, and creates a model that contributes to the state of the art for predictive soil mapping.","[Gonzalez, Juan Pablo] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Inst Robot, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA",Carnegie Mellon University,"Gonzalez, JP (corresponding author), Carnegie Mellon Univ, Inst Robot, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.",jpgonzal@cmu.edu; ajarvis@cgiar.org; s.cook@cgiar.org; t.oberthur@cgiar.org; rnaurorin@univalle.edu.co; bagnell2@andrew.cmu.edu; bdias@andrew.cmu.edu,"Jarvis, Andy/K-5516-2013; Cook, Simon/R-7762-2017","Jarvis, Andy/0000-0001-6543-0798; Cook, Simon/0000-0003-0902-1476",,,,,22,2,2,0,3,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",,,978-1-4020-8591-8,,,,2008,,,,,367,+,,10.1007/978-1-4020-8592-5_33,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4020-8592-5_33,,,6,"Geography, Physical; Remote Sensing; Soil Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Physical Geography; Remote Sensing; Agriculture,BIJ47,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000260070000033,View Full Record in Web of Science

Several elements in the model affect SW fluxes. This necessitates individual testing of each of the physical processes in the NWP model. Here we present a focused study of the SW radiation schemes in the HIRLAM (HIgh Resolution Limited Area Model) Aladin Regional Mesoscale Operational NWP In Europe (HARMONIE) model, which is the primary NWP model used and developed by several National Weather Services in Europe. Detailed calculations have been made with the DISORT model run in the libRadtran framework, which is a collection of state-of-the-art radiative transfer software and data sets. These are used to test the NWP radiation calculations. Both models are given the same atmospheric properties as input. We also perform a separate test of cloud liquid optical property parameterisations with Mie calculations. This leads us to introduce a new parameterisation for calculating these properties. In addition, we show that the results of a simpler radiation scheme, introduced into HARMONIE, compare well with those of the comprehensive default parameterisations. The methodology applied here may be used for testing radiation schemes in other NWP or climate models.","[Nielsen, K.

Translation problems and the contentious nature of some of Freud's ideas have made for their difficult reception in China. The inattention to Jung's ideas in universities in the west in the past, and a reliance on science based subjects by Chinese students studying abroad, have meant little opportunity to study Jung, and, by implication, to translate him. The turbulent political climate in China over the course of the past century has also hindered developments in psychology generally. In addition, certain traditional practices of understanding mind-body relationships and reporting 'illnesses' have precluded the possibility of any psychotherapeutic psychology emerging. However, the present climate looks more favourable for the dissemination of Jungian knowledge, but the question of an appropriate context and a receptive readership remains. Certain Jungian notions can be seen to fit comfortably within traditional systems of Chinese thought but the present day psychology department in China is no more a congenial environment for Jungian psychology than its counterpart in the west. It may be that the success of importing Jungian ideas into China rests with those with a predilection towards arts and cultural sciences, and with the innovations of the organizers of conferences.","Univ Hong Kong, Dept Psychol, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",University of Hong Kong,"Blowers, G (corresponding author), Univ Hong Kong, Dept Psychol, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",,"Blowers, Geoffrey Hathaway/B-3640-2009",,,,,,24,3,3,0,2,BLACKWELL PUBL LTD,OXFORD,"108 COWLEY RD, OXFORD OX4 1JF, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-8774,,,J ANAL PSYCHOL,J.

About 40% of extant amphibians are under threat of extinction and about 200 species have disappeared completely. Reproductive technologies and biobanking of cryopreserved materials offer technologies that could increase the efficiency and effectiveness of conservation programs involving management of captive breeding and wild populations through reduced costs, better genetic management and reduced risk of species extinctions. However, there are relatively few examples of applications of these technologies in practice in on-the-ground conservation programs, and no example that we know of where genetic diversity has been restored to a threatened amphibian species in captive breeding or in wild populations using cryopreserved genetic material. This gap in the application of technology to conservation programs needs to be addressed if assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) and biobanking are to realise their potential in amphibian conservation. We review successful technologies including non-invasive gamete collection, IVF and sperm cryopreservation that work well enough to be applied to many current conservation programs. We consider new advances in technology (vitrification and laser warming) of cryopreservation of aquatic embryos of fish and some marine invertebrates that may help us to overcome factors limiting amphibian oocyte and embryo cryopreservation. Finally, we address two case studies that illustrate the urgent need and the opportunity to implement immediately ARTs, cryopreservation and biobanking to amphibian conservation. These are (1) managing the biosecurity (disease risk) of the frogs of New Guinea which are currently free of chytridiomycosis, but are at high risk (2) the Sehuencas water frog of Bolivia, which until recently had only one known surviving male.","[Clulow, J.; Upton, R.] Univ Newcastle, Sch Environm & Life Sci, Newcastle, NSW, Australia; [Trudeau, V.

A multilayer complex snow scheme, incorporated into the state-of-the-art coupled Climate Forecast System version 2 (CFSv2) showed significant improvements in the simulation of mean ISMR, snow, and Northern Hemisphere surface and tropospheric temperature. Here we show that a realistic simulation of high-latitude snow decreases the north-south temperature gradient, which in turn decreases the meridional transport of energy from the Equator to the Pole, consequently affecting the tropical sea surface temperature (SST) and air-sea interactions. The global teleconnections of the ISMR with SST and 2m temperature over land are also improved considerably in association with improved simulation of the oceanic natural modes of variability. Our findings provide new insights for the relationship between the winter Eurasian snow and the following ISMR, namely that the same relationship may be understood through a framework of meridional atmospheric energy transport and its effects on the tropical air-sea interactions. The improvements in the global teleconnection in the modified version of CFSv2 may have implications in the ISMR predictability and prediction skill.","[Sujith, K.; Saha, Subodh Kumar; Rai, Archana; Pokhrel, Samir; Chaudhari, Hemantkumar S.; Hazra, Anupam] Indian Inst Trop Meteorol, Pune, Maharashtra, India; [Sujith, K.] Savitribai Phule Pune Univ, Dept Atmospher & Space Sci, Pune, Maharashtra, India; [Murtugudde, Raghu] Univ Maryland, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Goswami, B.

The technique has the advantage that it can readily be modified to include projected changes to cyclone behaviour due to the enhanced greenhouse effect. Sea-level heights in the current climate for return periods of 50, 100, 500 and 1000 years have been determined to be 2.0 m, 2.3 m, 3.0 m and 3.4 m respectively. In an enhanced greenhouse climate (around 2050), projected increases in cyclone intensity and mean sea-level see these heights increase to 2.4 m, 2.8 m, 3.8 m and 4.2 m respectively. The average area inundated by events with a return period greater than 100 years is found to more than double under enhanced greenhouse conditions.","CSIRO, Div Atmospher Res, Aspendale, Vic 3195, Australia",Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Mcinnes, KL (corresponding author), CSIRO, Div Atmospher Res, PMB 1, Aspendale, Vic 3195, Australia.",,"BEER, Tom/A-9142-2008; McInnes, Kathleen L/A-7787-2012; Whetton, Penny H/A-6885-2012","McInnes, Kathleen L/0000-0002-1810-7215; Walsh, Kevin/0000-0002-1860-510X",,,,,21,145,155,1,43,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-030X,,,NAT HAZARDS,Nat.

Therefore, the scientific knowledge on urban design and microclimate are fundamental for obtaining a tolerable thermal environment at the neighborhood scale. Such problematic interested the huge part of the world population that lives in urban area, which is currently about 50% and it is expected will increase to 66 % by 2050. The specificity of the urban climate is frequently associated with the urban heat islands phenomenon, which refers to the elevated temperatures within the city areas compared to the rural surroundings. In this context a typical urban geometry is represented by the so called urban canyon that denotes an ideal infinite urban street confined by buildings on both sides In this study an urban geometry, constituted by three urban street canyons with a canyon aspect ratio H/W of 1.0, has been examined. CFD simulations were performed to evaluate the fields of temperature and velocity of the air within the urban canyons and their surroundings. Several scenarios were examined considering alternatively the leeward or the windward walls hitted by the sunrays, while the opposite facade was shaded, as well as varying the reflective properties of the surfaces and the wind velocity. The results of simulations evidence that the adoption of materials of the building envelope with high albedo coefficient guarantees a decrease of the temperatures at least of 1.5 degrees C. Therefore, an increase of the knowledge of urban climate may provide valuable contribution to promote energy efficiency in the built environment. (C) 2017 The Authors.
