These two concurring adverse environmental conditions will surely have a detrimental effect on crop performance and productivity that will be particularly severe on woody crops such as citrus, olive and grapevine that define the backbone of traditional Mediterranean agriculture. These woody species have been traditionally selected for traits such as improved fruit yield and quality or alteration in harvesting periods, leaving out traits related to plant field performance. This is currently a crucial aspect due to the progressive and imminent effects of global climate change. Although complete genome sequence exists for sweet orange (Citrus sinensis) and clementine (Citrus clementine), olive tree (Olea europaea) and grapevine (Vitis vinifera), the development of biotechnological tools to improve stress tolerance still relies on the study of the available genetic resources including interspecific hybrids, naturally occurring (or induced) polyploids and wild relatives under field conditions. To this respect, post-genomic era studies including transcriptomics, metabolomics and proteomics provide a wide and unbiased view of plant physiology and biochemistry under adverse environmental conditions that, along with high-throughput phenotyping, could contribute to the characterization of plant genotypes exhibiting physiological and/or genetic traits that are correlated to abiotic stress tolerance. The ultimate goal of precision agriculture is to improve crop productivity, in terms of yield and quality, making a sustainable use of land and water resources under adverse environmental conditions using all available biotechnological tools and high-throughput phenotyping. This review focuses on the current state-of-the-art of biotechnological tools such as high throughput -omics and phenotyping on grapevine, citrus and olive and their contribution to plant breeding programs.","[De Ollas, Carlos; Gomez-Cadenas, Aurelio; Arbona, Vicent] Univ Jaume 1, Dept Ciencies Agr & Medi Nat, Castellon De La Plana, Spain; [Morillon, Raphael] Ctr Cooperat Int Rech Agron Dev CIRAD, Petit Bourg, Guadeloupe, France; [Fotopoulos, Vasileios] Cyprus Univ Technol, Dept Agr Sci Biotechnol & Food Sci, Limassol, Cyprus; [Puertolas, Jaime] Univ Lancaster, Lancaster Environm Ctr, Lancaster, England; [Ollitrault, Patrick] Ctr Cooperat Int Rech Agron Dev CIRAD, San Giuliano, France",Universitat Jaume I; CIRAD; Cyprus University of Technology; Lancaster University; CIRAD,"Arbona, V (corresponding author), Univ Jaume 1, Dept Ciencies Agr & Medi Nat, Castellon De La Plana, Spain.",vicente.arbona@camn.uji.es,"Puértolas, Jaime/AAA-4611-2021; Gomez-Cadenas, Aurelio/K-6084-2012; Fotopoulos, Vasileios/D-4848-2011; de ollas, carlos J/B-7461-2019","Puértolas, Jaime/0000-0002-6132-0679; Gomez-Cadenas, Aurelio/0000-0002-4598-2664; Fotopoulos, Vasileios/0000-0003-1205-2070; de ollas, carlos J/0000-0001-8488-623X; Morillon, Raphael/0000-0001-6762-1715; Ollitrault, Patrick/0000-0002-9456-5517",Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad (MINECO) [AGL2016-76574-R]; Cyprus University of Technology [EX032]; Leventis Foundation; Universitat Jaume I [UJI-B2016-24]; Cavalbio FEDER project,Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad (MINECO); Cyprus University of Technology; Leventis Foundation; Universitat Jaume I; Cavalbio FEDER project,"CDO, AG-C, and VA gratefully acknowledge funding provided through grants AGL2016-76574-R and UJI-B2016-24 from Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad (MINECO) and Universitat Jaume I, respectively.

However, the high computational complexity of state-of-the-art climate models remains a central bottleneck in this endeavour. Here we introduce a machine learning approach, which utilises a unique dataset of existing climate model simulations to learn relationships between short-term and long-term temperature responses to different climate forcing scenarios. This approach not only has the potential to accelerate climate change projections by reducing the costs of scenario computations, but also helps uncover early indicators of modelled long-term climate responses, which is of relevance to climate change detection, predictability, and attribution. Our results highlight challenges and opportunities for data-driven climate modelling, especially concerning the incorporation of even larger model datasets in the future. We therefore encourage extensive data sharing among research institutes to build ever more powerful climate response emulators, and thus to enable faster climate change projections.","[Mansfield, L.

An examination of Elliot Eisner's claim that art is research concludes that, though the arts may be used for display, data, or heuristic in educational research, they are not being recognised for their distinctive characteristics. John White's critique of the theory of multiple intelligences is revisited to mitigate common claims for the arts based upon Gardner. Given the dominance of scientism in today's research climate, it is argued that the arts should take their rightful place to balance research in its quest for certainty; that they be the antagonist mode of thought called for by John Stuart Mill.","[Forrest, Michelle] Mt St Vincent Univ, Halifax, NS, Canada",Mount Saint Vincent University,"Forrest, M (corresponding author), Mt St Vincent Univ, Halifax, NS, Canada.",michelle.forrest@msvu.ca,,,,,,,27,4,4,0,0,CANADIAN PHILOSOPHY EDUCATION SOC-C P E S,VANCOUVER,"C/O CLAUDIA RUITENBERG, DEPT EDUC STUD, UNIV BRITISH COLUMBIA, VANCOUVER, BC V6T 1Z4, CANADA",,1916-0348,,PAIDEUSIS,Paideusis,,2007,2,,,,3,13,,,,,,11,Education & Educational Research,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Education & Educational Research,V7U4P,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000421301400002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Current knowledge indicates that a descent of solar activity into an extended minimum state is a possible scenario. With aid of experiments from a state-of-the-art Earth system model, we investigate the impact of a future solar minimum on Northern Hemisphere climate change projections. This scenario is constructed from recent 11 year solar-cycle minima of the solar spectral irradiance, and is therefore more conservative than the 'grand' minima employed in some previous modeling studies. Despite the small reduction in total solar irradiance (0.36 W m(-2)), relatively large responses emerge in the winter Northern Hemisphere, with a reduction in regional-scale projected warming by up to 40%. To identify the origin of the enhanced regional signals, we assess the role of the different mechanisms by performing additional experiments forced only by irradiance changes at different wavelengths of the solar spectrum. We find that a reduction in visible irradiance drives changes in the stationary wave pattern of the North Pacific and sea-ice cover. A decrease in UV irradiance leads to smaller surface signals, although its regional effects are not negligible. These results point to a distinct but additive role of UV and visible irradiance in the Earth's climate, and stress the need to account for solar forcing as a source of uncertainty in regional scale projections.","[Chiodo, G.; Garcia-Herrera, R.; Calvo, N.; Barriopedro, D.] Univ Complutense, Fac Ciencias Fis, Dept Astrofis & CC Atmosfera, E-28040 Madrid, Spain; [Garcia-Herrera, R.; Barriopedro, D.] Inst Geociencias IGEO, Madrid, Spain; [Vaquero, J.

The linearity of the two indirect effects on the model response is also investigated by including each effect separately in the model. The response of the sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and sea ice is found to provide an important feedback on the cooling at high latitudes and the change in meridional SST gradient results in a southward shift of the inter-tropical convergence zone (ITCZ). The sensitivity of the model to the forcing from the indirect effects of sulfate aerosol is found to be similar to, but slightly weaker than that obtained from a doubling of CO2.","Hadley Ctr Climate Predict & Res, Met Off, Bracknell RG12 2SY, Berks, England",Met Office - UK; Hadley Centre,"Williams, KD (corresponding author), Hadley Ctr Climate Predict & Res, Met Off, London Rd, Bracknell RG12 2SY, Berks, England.",,"Senior, Catherine/AAA-3126-2022","Senior, Catherine/0000-0002-4124-0612",,,,,40,94,97,0,15,SPRINGER-VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0930-7575,,,CLIM DYNAM,Clim.

This study evaluates the skill of an ensemble of state-of-the-art regional climate simulations from the European Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment initiative in reproducing the precipitation (P) properties in Sardinia, a Mediterranean island of 24,000km(2). The ensemble includes simulations at 0.44 degrees and 0.11 degrees grid spacing of the Historical experiment from 1950 to 2005. Precipitation records from a high-density network of gauges are used as reference data set. The interannual and seasonal climatology of P, presence of trend, and orographic effect are assessed at the original RCM grid spacings and different spatial scales of aggregation. Most models capture the observed positive relation between annual P and elevation, with better performance at 0.11 degrees spacing. The simulated spatial patterns of the climatological annual and seasonal means are well correlated with the observation at both spacings, but their spatial variability is overestimated. Positive and negative bias of up to 60% are found in the simulation of annual mean and interannual variability. While the majority of the models reproduce the phase of the seasonal cycle, they underestimate (overestimate) winter (summer) P. The RCMs exhibit different deficiencies in capturing the negative annual and seasonal observed trends. In general, models' skill degrades when analyses are conducted at smaller aggregation scales. Results of this study reveal insight on RCM performances in small-scale regions, which are often targeted by impact studies and have so far received less attention.","[Mascaro, Giuseppe] Arizona State Univ, Sch Sustainable Engn & Built Environm, Tempe, AZ 85281 USA; [Viola, Francesco; Deidda, Roberto] Univ Cagliari, Dipartimento Ingn Civile Ambientale & Architettur, Cagliari, Italy",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; University of Cagliari,"Mascaro, G (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Sch Sustainable Engn & Built Environm, Tempe, AZ 85281 USA.",gmascaro@asu.edu,"Viola, Francesco/E-9722-2013; Mascaro, Giuseppe/K-5504-2013; DEIDDA, ROBERTO/J-2054-2017","Viola, Francesco/0000-0003-1716-192X; Mascaro, Giuseppe/0000-0003-4516-1206; DEIDDA, ROBERTO/0000-0001-5469-0199",Sardinia Region with Law [CRP 78576],Sardinia Region with Law,"We thank two anonymous reviewers, whose suggestions and comments helped to improve the quality of the manuscript.

The river system response to climate change is complex and the effects of non-linear interactions between alterations in water, sediment and vegetation remain incompletely understood. Which of these components becomes dominant in shaping the river channel when climate becomes drier or wetter? To answer this question, we investigate the cross-sectional response of sand-bed rivers to climate change focusing on channel width and depth, which respond directly to changes in boundary stresses. Thanks to the exceptional availability of long time-series of daily discharge and cross-sectional profiles, the Pilcomayo River is an ideal living lab for this investigation. We constructed a two-dimensional model of the river using the open -source state-of-the-art, structured Delft3D code. The highly dynamic behaviour and quick morphological adaptation of the Pilcomayo allowed reducing the period of time covered by the simulations because the river cross-section adapts its morphology to a new value of the water discharge within hours or days, which is crucial for modelling investigations. Calibration and validation were successfully performed by comparison with his-torical data. We considered several scenarios representing current, dryer and wetter climates. The results show that a dryer climate reduces the river channel depth and enlarges the width. A wetter climate increases the channel depth but produces negligible widening.

The horizontal and temporal character of these changes has been closely replicated by the state-of-the-art Parallel Climate Model (PCM) forced by observed and estimated anthropogenic gases. Application of optimal detection methodology shows that the model-produced signals are indistinguishable from the observations at the 0.05 confidence Level. Further, the chances of either the anthropogenic or observed signals being produced by the PCM as a result of natural, internal forcing alone are Less than 5%. This suggests that the observed ocean heat-content changes are consistent with those expected from anthropogenic forcing, which broadens the basis for claims that an anthropogenic signal has been detected in the global climate system. Additionally, the requirement that modeled ocean heat uptakes match observations puts a strong, new constraint on anthropogenically forced climate models. It is unknown if the current generation of climate models, other than the PCM, meet this constraint.","Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, Div Climate Res, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego; Scripps Institution of Oceanography,"Barnett, TP (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, Div Climate Res, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",tbarnett@ucsd.edu,,,,,,,25,278,286,4,64,AMER ASSOC ADVANCEMENT SCIENCE,WASHINGTON,"1200 NEW YORK AVE, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20005 USA",0036-8075,1095-9203,,SCIENCE,Science,13-Apr,2001,5515,,,,270,274,,10.1126/science.1058304,http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1058304,,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,421QA,11303099,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000168074000042,View Full Record in Web of Science

The project is centered round a series of sailing voyages into the Arctic, through routes that were previously icebound but are now passable. The expeditions take teams of world-renowned artists, educators, writers, musicians and thinkers into the Arctic, onboard a hundred-year old schooner, with the invitation to engage with scientists (from the National Oceanography Centre, as well as Southampton), to make art, and to draw people's attention to the effects of ocean currents on us and our climate. Since its first expedition in 2003, the project has grown to include educational programs, an award-winning website, a BBC documentary, and an exhibit, The Ship, The Art of Climate Change,'' developed with the Natural History Museum and which has embarked on a worldwide tour. In August 2007, Cape Farewell began a three-year residency at Southbank Centre, operating as a cultural eco-hub for the Centre's creative climate change initiatives, and has started a collaboration with the Eden Project in Cornwall, UK.

Their efforts to construct a stable representation of England's climate took shape against the polluted atmosphere of industrial, imperial London, and in tandem with the modern state's disciplinary visuality.

It is about the diverse responses of selected artists and humanists to the problems created by the anthropocentrically structured powers geared for exploitation of biological environments and material ecologies. These artistic reactions cannot be simplified to a single thread of environmental storytelling: they are seen and interpreted as personal and moral responses to the perceptions about the old culture-nature dichotomy as well as to commodification and depletion of the biosphere. This article looks at individual reactions of artists who respond to the exploitable character of the global-wide management of environmental and technological resources; the responses to a paradigm often referred to as the Anthropocene or Sixth Extinction.

To a large extent, the underestimation of those feedbacks can be explained by the cold equatorial SST bias, which shifts the rising branch of the Pacific Walker Circulation (PWC) too far to the west by up to 30 degrees, resulting in an erroneous convective response during ENSO events. Based on simulations from the Kiel Climate Model (KCM) and the 5th phase of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5), we investigate how well ENSO dynamics are simulated in case of underestimated ENSO atmospheric feedbacks (EAF), with a special focus on ocean-atmosphere coupling over the equatorial Pacific. While models featuring realistic atmospheric feedbacks simulate ENSO dynamics close to observations, models with underestimated EAF exhibit fundamental biases in ENSO dynamics. In models with too weak feedbacks, ENSO is not predominantly wind-driven as observed; instead ENSO is driven significantly by a positive shortwave radiation feedback. Thus, although these models simulate ENSO, which in terms of simple indices is consistent with observations, it originates from very different dynamics. A too weak oceanic forcing on the SST via the positive thermocline, the Ekman and the zonal advection feedback is compensated by weaker atmospheric heat flux damping. The latter is mainly caused by a biased shortwave-SST feedback that erroneously is positive in most climate models. In the most biased models, the shortwave-SST feedback contributes to the SST anomaly growth to a similar degree as the ocean circulation. Our results suggest that a broad continuum of ENSO dynamics can exist in climate models and explain why climate models with less than a half of the observed EAF strength can still depict realistic ENSO amplitude.","[Bayr, Tobias; Wengel, Christian; Latif, Mojib; Luebbecke, Joke; Park, Wonsun] GEOMAR Helmholtz Ctr Ocean Res Kiel, Dusternbrooker Weg 20, D-24105 Kiel, Germany; [Latif, Mojib] Univ Kiel, Cluster Excellence Future Ocean, D-24105 Kiel, Germany; [Dommenget, Dietmar] Monash Univ, Sch Math Sci, Clayton, Vic, Australia",Helmholtz Association; GEOMAR Helmholtz Center for Ocean Research Kiel; University of Kiel; Monash University,"Bayr, T (corresponding author), GEOMAR Helmholtz Ctr Ocean Res Kiel, Dusternbrooker Weg 20, D-24105 Kiel, Germany.",tbayr@geomar.de,"Lübbecke, Joke F/G-6315-2016; Luebbecke, Joke/AFR-7882-2022; Park, Wonsun/J-8097-2012","Lübbecke, Joke F/0000-0002-7839-3284; Luebbecke, Joke/0000-0002-7839-3284; Park, Wonsun/0000-0002-6345-8428",European Union; ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science [CE110001028]; ARC project Beyond the linear dynamics of the El Nino Southern Oscillation'' [DP120101442];  [SFB 754],European Union(European Commission); ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science(Australian Research Council); ARC project Beyond the linear dynamics of the El Nino Southern Oscillation''(Australian Research Council); ,"The authors would like to thank the anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments.

Here we use a combination of observational data and state-of-the-art forced and control climate model simulations to demonstrate the absence of consistent evidence for decadal or longer-term internal oscillatory signals that are distinguishable from climatic noise. Only variability in the interannual range associated with the El Nino/Southern Oscillation is found to be distinguishable from the noise background. A distinct (40-50 year timescale) spectral peak that appears in global surface temperature observations appears to reflect the response of the climate system to both anthropogenic and natural forcing rather than any intrinsic internal oscillation. These findings have implications both for the validity of previous studies attributing certain long-term climate trends to internal low-frequency climate cycles and for the prospect of decadal climate predictability.","[Mann, Michael E.; Miller, Sonya K.] Penn State Univ, Dept Meteorol & Atmospher Sci, 514 Walker Bldg, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Steinman, Byron A.] Univ Minnesota Duluth, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, 2205 E 5th St, Duluth, MN 55812 USA; [Steinman, Byron A.] Univ Minnesota Duluth, Large Lakes Observ, 2205 E 5th St, Duluth, MN 55812 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Duluth; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Minnesota Hospital; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Duluth; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Minnesota Hospital,"Mann, ME (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Dept Meteorol & Atmospher Sci, 514 Walker Bldg, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",mann@psu.edu,"Mann, Michael E/B-8472-2017","Mann, Michael E/0000-0003-3067-296X",NSF Paleoclimate Program [1748097],NSF Paleoclimate Program(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)),"We acknowledge the World Climate Research Programme's Working Group on Coupled Modelling, which is responsible for CMIP, and we thank the climate modelling groups for producing and making available their model output.

Advancing prediction of the MJO using state of the art observational data and modeling systems is thus a necessary goal for improving global intraseasonal climate prediction. MJO prediction is assessed in the NOAA Climate Forecast System version 2 (CFSv2) based on its hindcasts initialized daily for 1999-2010. The analysis focuses on MJO indices taken as the principal components of the two leading EOFs of combined 15 degrees S-15 degrees N average of 200-hPa zonal wind, 850-hPa zonal wind and outgoing longwave radiation at the top of the atmosphere. The CFSv2 has useful MJO prediction skill out to 20 days at which the bivariate anomaly correlation coefficient (ACC) drops to 0.5 and root-mean-square error (RMSE) increases to the level of the prediction with climatology. The prediction skill also shows a seasonal variation with the lowest ACC during the boreal summer and highest ACC during boreal winter. The prediction skills are evaluated according to the target as well as initial phases. Within the lead time of 10 days the ACC is generally greater than 0.8 and RMSE is less than 1 for all initial and target phases. At longer lead time, the model shows lower skills for predicting enhanced convection over the Maritime Continent and from the eastern Pacific to western Indian Ocean. The prediction skills are relatively higher for target phases when enhanced convection is in the central Indian Ocean and the central Pacific. While the MJO prediction skills are improved in CFSv2 compared to its previous version, systematic errors still exist in the CFSv2 in the maintenance and propagation of the MJO including (1) the MJO amplitude in the CFSv2 drops dramatically at the beginning of the prediction and remains weaker than the observed during the target period and (2) the propagation in the CFSv2 is too slow. Reducing these errors will be necessary for further improvement of the MJO prediction.","[Wang, Wanqiu; Hung, Meng-Pai; Weaver, Scott J.; Kumar, Arun] NOAA, NWS, NCEP, CPC,Ctr Weather & Climate Predict, College Pk, MD 20740 USA; [Fu, Xiouhua] Univ Hawaii Manoa, IPRC, SOEST, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA",National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa,"Wang, WQ (corresponding author), NOAA, NWS, NCEP, CPC,Ctr Weather & Climate Predict, 5830 Univ Res Court,Room 3004, College Pk, MD 20740 USA.",wanqiu.wang@noaa.gov,"Hung, Meng-Pai/O-2305-2019; , AK/B-6517-2008","Hung, Meng-Pai/0000-0003-4748-1932; ",,,,,48,101,104,0,29,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0930-7575,1432-0894,,CLIM DYNAM,Clim.

In policy debates about climate change adaptation, framing the adaptation issue is a challenge with potentially far-reaching implications for the shape and success of adaptation projects. From the available literature on how the meaning of climate change adaptation is constructed and debated, three key dimensions of frame differences were identified: (1) the tension between adaptation and mitigation as two contrasting but interrelated perspectives on climate change; (2) the contrast between framing climate change adaptation as a tame technical problem, and framing climate change as a wicked problem of governance; and (3) the framing of climate change adaptation as a security issue, contrasting state security frames with human security frames. It is argued that the study of how climate change adaptation gets framed could be enriched by connecting these dimensions more closely with the following themes in framing research: (1) how decision-making biases that to framing issues as structured technical problems; (2) the process of scale framing by which issues are situated at a particular scale level; and (3) the challenge of dealing with the variety of frames in adaptation processes.

This paper presents a new approach to analyzing prehistoric art: quantitative deep time study. It analyzes a database of 211 art traditions from across Europe and from 40,000 B.C. to 0A.D. to identify changes in the amount, nature, and use of prehistoric art. The results reveal clear long-term trends. The amount of art made increased sharply with the origins of sedentary farming and continued to rise throughout prehistory. New forms of art arise in conjunction with new ways of life; period genres are closely tied into patterns of social change. There are also long-term shifts in aesthetics and the uses of art (such as a gradual shift from arts of ritual and concealment to arts of surface and display). These results, though preliminary, show that a deep-time approach familiar from topics such as climate change is applicable to art; the resulting social history can illuminate both art and its social context.","Univ Cambridge, Dept Archaeol, Cambridge CB2 3DZ, England",University of Cambridge,"Robb, J (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Archaeol, Downing St, Cambridge CB2 3DZ, England.",jer39@cam.ac.uk,,,Leverhulme Trust,Leverhulme Trust(Leverhulme Trust),"I am grateful to many colleagues across Europe for information on individual bodies of art, to Sheila Kohring for help in searching for information, and to Dacia Viejo Rose for translating the abstract into Spanish.

This study aims at comparing current and future maize and sorghum climate suitability and yield using five state-of-art climate models in the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP8.5) in Couple Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). The study considered 1970-2000 as the baseline and 2040-2060 (the 2050s) and 2061-2080 (2070s) as the projection periods. The mechanist FAO Eco-crop model and statistical crop model were used. The results show that rainfall and temperature are projected to increase by 2050s and 2070s with certain (uncertainty) in temperature (rainfall) projection. The central and western highlands are the optimum suitable zones for maize. Gradual reduction of maize suitable zone is anticipated leading to a yield loss of 10.8% (23.7%) by 2050s (2070s). The sorghum climate suitable areas are expected to increase in the future leading to a yield gain of 114% (80.7%) by 2050s (2070s) from the baseline yield. Currently, temperature creates more uncertainties in crop yield than rainfall. The findings of this research enlighten the policymakers and farmers on the probable susceptibilities of the agricultural system in future climate and the viable strategic measures to curb food insecurity over the country.","[Mumo, Lucia; Yu, Jinhua; Ojara, Moses] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Minist Educ, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteoro, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China; [Mumo, Lucia; Yu, Jinhua; Ojara, Moses] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Coll Atmospher Sci, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Mumo, Lucia; Kerandi, Noah] South Eastern Univ Kenya, POB 170-90200, Nairobi, Kenya; [Ojara, Moses] Uganda Natl Meteorol Author, Plot 21,28 Port Bell Rd, Kampala, Uganda; [Lukorito, Cromwel] Univ Nairobi, POB 30197-00100, Nairobi, Kenya",Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; University of Nairobi,"Mumo, L (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Minist Educ, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteoro, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China.;Mumo, L (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Coll Atmospher Sci, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.;Mumo, L (corresponding author), South Eastern Univ Kenya, POB 170-90200, Nairobi, Kenya.",mumolucia@gmail.com,,"MUMO, LUCIA/0000-0001-7210-3090; Ojara, Moses.

Meanwhile, CDV also rectifies atmospheric variations of longer time scales via interactions with other physical and dynamic processes. These make CDV a valuable aspect for diagnosing climate model performance. Here, we evaluate the accuracy of simulated CDV in state-of-the-art global climate models (GCMs) by comparing CDV in the historical simulation of 32 GCMs from 20 institutes participating the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) with observations from the International Satellite and Cloud Climatology Project-H product. While good agreement is found over the oceans, significant biases exist over land (notably deserts and plateaus), where the models simulate excessive nighttime clouds and insufficient daytime clouds and miss the observed peak of cloud fraction in the early afternoon. These biases persist throughout the year. It is illustrated that correcting the CDV biases tends to reduce the known model biases of smaller shortwave cloud radiative effect over the midlatitude Africa-Europe-Asia continent, South America, and vast ocean areas. Inter-model comparisons show that the CDV biases vary significantly among models from different institutes and present similar characteristics among models from the same institutes, and suggests that the biases are more likely to be attributed to deficiencies in cloud-related physical parameterizations rather than the model treatment of resolution, ocean, and chemistry. The improvement of CMIP6 models against their CMIP5 counterparts in simulating CDV is also discussed.","[Chen, Guoxing] Fudan Univ, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Chen, Guoxing] Fudan Univ, Inst Atmospher Sci, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Chen, Guoxing; Bao, Qing; Li, Jiandong] Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Numer Modeling Atmospher Sci & Geop, Inst Atmospher Phys, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Wei-Chyung] SUNY Albany, Atmospher Sci Res Ctr, Albany, NY 12222 USA","Fudan University; Fudan University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Albany","Chen, GX (corresponding author), Fudan Univ, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Shanghai, Peoples R China.;Chen, GX (corresponding author), Fudan Univ, Inst Atmospher Sci, Shanghai, Peoples R China.;Chen, GX (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Numer Modeling Atmospher Sci & Geop, Inst Atmospher Phys, Beijing, Peoples R China.",chenguoxing@fudan.edu.cn,"Bao, Qing/A-7765-2012","Bao, Qing/0000-0003-1719-6540",STCSM International Science and Technology Collaboration Program [21230780200]; U.S. National Science Foundation [1545917]; SUNY Research Foundation Fixed-Price Balance Account [31972],STCSM International Science and Technology Collaboration Program; U.S. National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); SUNY Research Foundation Fixed-Price Balance Account,This study is supported by STCSM International Science and Technology Collaboration Program (21230780200).

Shared Socioeconomic Pathways and Representative Concentration Pathways are extended at temporal and spatial scales relevant for the most contributing sectors. Extended socioeconomic and climate scenarios are then used as inputs for spatially and temporally detailed models for population and land use change, and their subsequent impact on nutrient loading is computed. According to the model simulations, several factors of varying influence may either increase or decrease total nutrient loads. In general, societal drivers outweigh the impacts of changing climate. Food demand is the most impactful driver, strongly affecting land use and nutrient loads from agricultural lands in the long run. In order to reach the good environmental status of the Baltic Sea, additional nutrient abatement efforts should focus on phosphorus rather than nitrogen. Agriculture is the most important sector to be addressed under the conditions of gradually increasing precipitation in the region and increasing global demand for food. (C) 2020 The Authors.

Notwithstanding the ephemeral appearance of the super-light nanomaterial silica aerogel used by Ioannis Michaloudis (Michalous) in his sculptures, the longevity of some of his art seems guaranteed: two works, Bottled Nymph and Noli Me Tangere have been selected to be rocketed to the moon as part of the MoonArk sculpture. The sculptures will be aboard a Space X Falcon 9 rocket launched in 2018 from Cape Kennedy in an Astrobotic Robotic Lunar Mission, and will remain on the moon, potentially, for billions of years. Spirited Skies is a project where we experience by touching other forms of longevity of the ephemeral silica aerogel. Filling double jacketed borosilicate glass vials with aerogel skies and clouds in a unique way, Michaloudis transforms every day's life trivial objects into art. And whilst Michaloudis is seeding the heavens and landing his artwork onto the moon, a Masters student under his supervision, Matthew van Roden is waxing and waning back here on earth.

A younger generation leading the movement has given renewed vigour to the movement's discourse by emphasising the need to act immediately by expressing the idea of emergency. This article suggests that this notion, one that is central to the current youth climate movement, includes an acceleration of time and a discourse based on hope. These ideas have worked as an activator of action complementing or nuancing narratives about future and climate change. The analysis of the discourse of Fridays For Future Barcelona on social media (Twitter and Instagram) with a mixed methods approach shows first the centrality of the notion of emergency in the public discourse of the movement and its role in making the future seem not so distant. Secondly, it shows how the use of emergency speech is linked to a positive view of the future and to a generational discourse. And, finally, it has been detected that using emergency speech together with references to a hopeful future increases the impact of the movement's social media posts.","[Soler-I-Marti, Roger] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Inst Govt & Publ Policy IGOP, Edifici MRA Campus UAB, Barcelona 08193, Spain; [Fernandez-Planells, Ariadna] Univ Politecn Valencia, Dept Audiovisual Commun Documentat & Hist Art, Valencia, Spain; [Perez-Altable, Laura] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Dept Commun, Barcelona, Spain",Autonomous University of Barcelona; Universitat Politecnica de Valencia; Pompeu Fabra University,"Soler-I-Marti, R (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Inst Govt & Publ Policy IGOP, Edifici MRA Campus UAB, Barcelona 08193, Spain.",roger.soler.marti@uab.cat,"Soler-i-Martí, Roger/AAA-4663-2019","Soler-i-Martí, Roger/0000-0002-3486-6836",AJOVE2019-AGAUR from the Government of Catalonia; PlanetaryWellbeing2019 Pompeu Fabra University programme,AJOVE2019-AGAUR from the Government of Catalonia; PlanetaryWellbeing2019 Pompeu Fabra University programme,"This article is based on data from two research projects on youth climate activism: YouGECA (Youth Global Engagement for Climate Action) funded by the PlanetaryWellbeing2019 Pompeu Fabra University programme, and #4F (Hashtags For Future) funded by the AJOVE2019-AGAUR from the Government of Catalonia.",,53,0,0,6,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1474-2837,1474-2829,,SOC MOVEMENT STUD,Soc.

Findings indicate commercial news outlets at times produced more diverse accounts of the negotiations than nonprofit or public-funded outlets. However, these more diverse accounts often stem from journalistic practices somewhat shielded from market pressures. A niche focus on particular aspects of the negotiations dampens content diversity at individual news outlets but increases content diversity as measured across outlets within a country, which this study finds to be higher in the U.K. These findings indicate that forms of funding resistant to market pressures and approaches to reporting diverging from legacy journalistic practices can support diverse news accounts of climate change.","[Neff, Timothy] Harvard Univ, Berkman Klein Ctr Internet & Soc, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University,"Neff, T (corresponding author), 23 Everett St,2nd Floor, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",tneff@cyber.harvard.edu,,,,,,,69,1,1,2,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1752-4032,1752-4040,,ENVIRON COMMUN,Environ.

A hydro-dynamical shallow water model (HYPSE, Hydrostatic Padua Sea Elevation model) is driven by 6-hourly meteorological fields produced by the state-of-the-art global and regional climate models that have been used in the CIRCE fp6 project (Climate Change and Impact Research: the Mediterranean Environment). Model validation is based on the comparison of a model hindcast (1958-2001) and climate simulations with observed sea level (SL) values at 21 tide gauges. The accuracy of the models in reproducing large positive and negative storm surges appears to depend primarily on the quality of the atmospheric forcing (which is mainly related to their space resolution). Also the resolution of the hydro-dynamical model is somehow relevant along some stretches of the coastline. Climate signal is computed as the difference between the surge statistics in the 2021-2050 and 1971-2000 periods. The choice of the global climate simulation, which is used for the boundary conditions of the regional climate models, is shown to be the largest source of uncertainty for the assessment of the climate change signal. Other, less relevant, sources of uncertainty are the choice of the regional climate model and that of the hydro-dynamical model resolution. In spite of these uncertainties, the model ensemble mean shows a modest (about -5%), but clear and widespread decrease of the amplitude of both positive and negative large storm surges along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea. However, increase of mean SL and land subsidence (which are not considered in this study) might increase significantly the hazard posed by coastal floods in spite of the likely attenuation of storminess that is caused by climate change in the Mediterranean Sea.

Inter-annual climatic variability, a bimodal precipitation regime and climate change uncertainties present challenges to water resource management in the region. Hydrological assessments are conducted for three meteorological products during a historical period and a future climate change scenario. Historical (1990-2000) and future (2031-2040) projections were derived from a mesoscale model forced with boundary conditions from a general circulation model under a high emissions scenario. The results reveal significantly higher precipitation, reservoir inflows, elevations and releases in the future relative to historical simulations. Furthermore, hydrological seasonality might be altered with a shift toward earlier water supply during the North American monsoon. The proposed infrastructure would have a limited ability to ameliorate future conditions, with more benefits in a tributary with lower flood hazard. These projections of the impacts of climate change and its interaction with infrastructure should be of interest to water resources managers in arid and semi-arid regions. [GRAPHICS] Editor D.

Its long water residence time contributes to oxygen depletion in the bottom water of its southern sub-basins. In this study, recently performed scenario simulations for the Baltic Sea including marine biogeochemistry were analysed and compared with earlier published projections. Specifically, dynamical downscaling using a regionally coupled atmosphere-ocean climate model was used to regionalise four global Earth system models. However, as the regional climate model does not include components representing terrestrial and marine biogeochemistry, an additional catchment and a coupled physical-biogeochemical model for the Baltic Sea were included. The scenario simulations take the impact of various global sea level rise scenarios into account. According to the projections, compared to the present climate, higher water temperatures, a shallower mixed layer with a sharper thermocline during summer, less sea-ice cover and greater mixing in the northern Baltic Sea during winter can be expected. Both the frequency and the duration of marine heat waves will increase significantly, in particular in the coastal zone of the southern Baltic Sea (except in regions with frequent upwellings). Nonetheless, due to the uncertainties in the projections regarding regional winds, the water cycle and the global sea level rise, robust and statistically significant salinity changes could not be identified. The impact of a changing climate on biogeochemical cycling is predicted to be considerable but still smaller than that of plausible nutrient input changes. Implementing the proposed Baltic Sea Action Plan, a nutrient input abatement plan for the entire catchment area, would result in a significantly improved ecological status of the Baltic Sea, including reductions in the size of the hypoxic area also in a future climate, which in turn would increase the resilience of the Baltic Sea against anticipated climate change. While our findings regarding changes in heat-cycle variables mainly confirm earlier scenario simulations, they differ substantially from earlier projections of salinity and biogeochemical cycles, due to differences in experimental setups and in input scenarios for bioavailable nutrients.","[Meier, H.

As a case study, the methodology is applied to study severe storms in Cambodia based on two future climate scenarios and data on historical damages from storm events, which are used as a proxy in performing a sensitivity analysis on all input parameters. For the assumptions and parameter ranges used here, the study shows a high sensitivity to the income distribution (reflected by discount rates) and risk aversion and smaller effects from equality measures and extreme wind climate scenario. We emphasize that the assumptions on risk aversion reflecting consumption smoothing possibilities of low-income households clearly depicts that climate risks can be particularly high as a consequence of poverty and therefore recommend that context-specific vulnerabilities and equity concerns in climate risk studies should be included when making assessments for least developed countries.","[Halsnaes, Kirsten; Larsen, Morten Andreas Dahl; Kaspersen, Per Skougaard] DTU Management Engn, Prod Torvet, Bldg 426, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark",Technical University of Denmark,"Larsen, MAD (corresponding author), DTU Management Engn, Prod Torvet, Bldg 426, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark.",madla@dtu.dk,"Larsen, Morten Andreas Dahl/F-5185-2015; Larsen, Morten Andreas Dahl/AAR-2445-2021; Kaspersen, Per Skougaard/T-1677-2017; Halsnaes, Kirsten/E-8722-2017","Larsen, Morten Andreas Dahl/0000-0002-7478-5416; Larsen, Morten Andreas Dahl/0000-0002-7478-5416; Kaspersen, Per Skougaard/0000-0002-1709-0183; Halsnaes, Kirsten/0000-0001-9106-9190",,,,,56,6,6,2,18,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0921-030X,1573-0840,,NAT HAZARDS,Nat.

Tropical forests and savannahs account for 60%. GPP over 40% of the vegetated land is associated with precipitation. State-of-the-art process-oriented biosphere models used for climate predictions exhibit a large between-model variation of GPP's latitudinal patterns and show higher spatial correlations between GPP and precipitation, suggesting the existence of missing processes or feedback mechanisms which attenuate the vegetation response to climate.

Whereas the short-term response of BVOC emissions to meteorological drivers is fairly well simulated by current emission models, it is yet unclear whether models can faithfully predict their response to climate change, given the scarcity of long observation records of BVOC fluxes. Here we take advantage of the high yield of formaldehyde (HCHO) in the oxidation of VOCs and use a long-term spaceborne record of HCHO observations in combination with model simulations to show that (i) HCHO interannual variability is primarily driven by climate through its impacts on photochemistry, vegetation fire occurrence, and above all, biogenic emissions and (ii) the HCHO record validates the interannual variability of biogenic emissions calculated by the state-of-the-art Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature (MEGAN) emission model in vegetated regions. Plain Language Summary This study is motivated by the incomplete knowledge of a major feedback between climate and atmospheric chemistry lying in the meteorological dependence of the emissions of biogenic volatile organic compounds into the atmosphere. Although the short-term response of biogenic fluxes to meteorological drivers is relatively well established, their long-term response is not yet assessed due to the lack of long-term observation records of biogenic fluxes. Here we address two fundamental questions: (i) Can we assess the long-term response of biogenic fluxes to meteorological fields? (ii) Does a widely used biogenic emission model (MEGAN) provide reliable predictions of how those fluxes might respond to climate change? In this study, and for the first time, the long-term variability of hydrocarbon emission fluxes is assessed by using a long-term spaceborne formaldehyde data set (2005-2015). Analysis of this unique observational record and of multiyear model simulations reveals clear evidence that (i) the observed interannual variability is primarily driven by climate through its impacts on biogenic emissions and photochemistry, (ii) the formaldehyde data record validates the long-term response of biogenic emissions to climate variability predicted by the MEGAN state-of-science biogenic emission model, and (iii) the predicted biogenic emission trends appear consistent with the formaldehyde data record.","[Stavrakou, T.; Mueller, J. -F.; Bauwens, M.; De Smedt, I.; Van Roozendael, M.] Royal Belgian Inst Space Aeron, Brussels, Belgium; [Guenther, A.] Univ Calif Irvine, Irvine, CA USA",University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Stavrakou, T (corresponding author), Royal Belgian Inst Space Aeron, Brussels, Belgium.",jenny@aeronomie.be,"Guenther, Alex B/B-1617-2008","Guenther, Alex B/0000-0001-6283-8288; de smedt, isabelle/0000-0002-3541-7725; Jean-Francois, Muller/0000-0001-5335-2622",project PRODEX TROVA of the European Space Agency - Belgian Science Policy Office; project OCTAVE of the Belgian Research Action through Interdisciplinary Networks (BRAIN-be) research programme (2017-2021); ESA Sentinel-5 Precursor Level-2 Development project; Belgian PRODEX (TRACE-S5P project); EU FP7 QA4ECV project [607405],project PRODEX TROVA of the European Space Agency - Belgian Science Policy Office; project OCTAVE of the Belgian Research Action through Interdisciplinary Networks (BRAIN-be) research programme (2017-2021); ESA Sentinel-5 Precursor Level-2 Development project; Belgian PRODEX (TRACE-S5P project); EU FP7 QA4ECV project,"This research has been supported by the projects PRODEX TROVA of the European Space Agency funded by the Belgian Science Policy Office (2016-2018) and OCTAVE of the Belgian Research Action through Interdisciplinary Networks (BRAIN-be) research programme (2017-2021).

To reduce them, risk transfer is a key strategy for climate risk management. However, this approach does not consider the socioeconomic vulnerability of each population group, limiting its effectiveness. The objective of this paper is to improve and increase the usefulness of risk transfer through the Differential Risk Transfer (DRT) approach. Design/methodology/approach A comprehensive and systematic review of the state of the art on Differential Approach (DA) is presented, and its connection with existing models of vulnerability to disasters is analysed. Through epistemic deliberations, an operational definition of Differential Risk Transfer (DRT), as well as its advantages are discussed. Finally, general guidelines are presented for the implementation of the DRT in a specific context. Findings The results confirm that DA presents a clear relation with the models for the study of disaster vulnerability. The small group discussions agree with the usefulness of DRT for improving climate-related risk management. Practical implications This paper argues for the inclusion of the DRT approach in the climate risk management strategies aiming to fill the disaggregated data gaps that limit the potentiality and accuracy of risk transfer schemes worldwide. Originality/value This innovative approach improves the accuracy of the risk transfer mechanisms through the recognition of the differences of ethnicity, gender and life cycle that increase socioeconomic vulnerability to climate-related disasters.","[Fernandez Lopera, Cristian Camilo; Mendes, Jose Manuel] Univ Coimbra, Ctr Social Studies, Coimbra, Portugal; [Barata, Eduardo Jorge] Univ Coimbra, Ctr Business & Econ Res, Coimbra, Portugal",Universidade de Coimbra; Universidade de Coimbra,"Lopera, CCF (corresponding author), Univ Coimbra, Ctr Social Studies, Coimbra, Portugal.",camilofernandez@ces.uc.pt,"Barata, Eduardo/K-2165-2017","Barata, Eduardo/0000-0003-2609-4642; Fernandez Lopera, Cristian Camilo/0000-0002-4922-932X; Mendes, Jose Manuel/0000-0003-3602-9756",FCT-Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [2021.07982],FCT-Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology(Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology),"This work was financed by national funds through FCT-Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (Grant number: 2021.07982.BD).

Even though the question of what exactly constitutes a successful adaptation to climate change is still unanswered and calls for further research, there is some evidence that many rural and indigenous communities are actively putting into place initiatives to adapt to climate change. But even in today's Internet age it seems difficult to identify these communities properly as information from Africa is fragmented, outdated or simply not to be found. Yet knowing what kind of adaptation is taking place on the local level is a prerequisite for successful approaches to state-of-the-art adaptation which link bottom-up action with top-down strategies. Addressing this knowledge need, this chapter presents the outcome of a 2010 mapping study on local community-based adaptation to climate change in Africa, illustrating how communities are integrated into local adaptation actions that tackle both development and climate change objectives. To reflect the complex nature of adaptation, the identified initiatives were grouped into two categories social and economic resilience and a range of emerging adaptation themes were identified. Comprising 39 local-and regional initiatives, the analysis provides some recent examples of concrete local adaptation that may possess a certain potential for replication, upscaling and mainstreaming. In this way, and combined with the continued demand for enhancing the scientific data base to reduce the uncertainty of current climate predictions for the African continent in particular, further research is needed to allow the design of tailored measures to respond to often unique regional adaptation needs.","[Mannke, Franziska] Hamburg Univ Appl Sci, Applicat Life Sci Res & Transfer Ctr, D-21033 Hamburg, Germany",Hochschule Angewandte Wissenschaft Hamburg,,franziska.mannke@haw-hamburg.de,,,,,,,16,12,12,0,7,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",1610-2010,,978-3-642-22314-3,CLIM CHANG MANAG,,,2011,,,,,17,32,,10.1007/978-3-642-22315-0_2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-22315-0_2,,,16,Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BGF55,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000322747100002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Due to this reason, an attempt has been made to apply a new geostatistical approach with the help of transform software to downscale EdGCM for identifying the trend of surface air temperature at the Sylhet district. Both Doubled_CO2 and Global_Warming_01 are simulated from EdGCM and maps are generated to depict global temperature variations. Downscaling is applied to the outputs from Doubled_CO2 scenario. Percent of bias (PBIAS), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) and the ratio of root mean square error to the standard deviation of measured data (RSR) values are satisfactory and acceptable. The trend analysis was performed using the Mann-Kendall Trend test and Sen's slope estimator. Temperature changes are significant for both downscaled and observed results of p-value which is less than alpha = 0.05. Mann-Kendall Z tests for annual downscaled and IPCC during (2006-2020) show a positive trend.

Subsistence-oriented smallholder farmers of developing regions, such as those in sub-Saharan Africa, are highly vulnerable to these changes given their lower adaptive capacity. In this context, building a climate-resilient agricultural society is an essential requirement to protect livelihoods. Hence, there is a need for spreading the climate-resilient sustainable agricultural (CRSA) practices by replicating the proven ones to larger areas (scaling-up). Fostering widespread adoption of such practices needs consideration of their social, ecological, economic, and institutional appropriateness in target areas. This article reports the application of a tool ScalA that generates information on a multitude of aspects and assesses the local suitability of CRSA practices among sub-Saharan smallholders. It also briefly presents other state-of-the-art tools that can be used for similar purposes. In the first case study, the tool is used to assess appropriateness of agroforestry, biochar application, and rainwater harvesting in Fulwe village of Morogoro, Tanzania, for enhancing resilience capacity. In another case study, the potential of fertilizer management is assessed for two different villages, i.e., Fulwe and Mlali. Analytically, appropriateness of interventions is assessed by the deviation of the actual factor constellation of the scaling-up process with an optimal constellation that will foster the wider adoption of the given practice.","[Sieber, Stefan; Jha, Srijna; Tharayil Shereef, Amjath-Babu; Uckert, Goetz; Graef, Frieder; Mueller, Klaus] Leibniz Ctr Agr Landscape Res ZALF, Inst Socioecon, D-15374 Muncheberg, Germany; [Crewett, Wibke] Humboldt Univ, Div Resource Econ, D-10099 Berlin, Germany; [Bringe, Franziska] 4C Assoc, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Polreich, Severin] Int Potato Ctr, Lima, Peru; [Ndah, Tim Hycenth] Univ Hohenheim, Inst Agr Social Sci, Stuttgart, Germany",Leibniz Zentrum fur Agrarlandschaftsforschung (ZALF); Humboldt University of Berlin; CGIAR; International Potato Center (CIP); University Hohenheim,"Jha, S (corresponding author), Leibniz Ctr Agr Landscape Res ZALF, Inst Socioecon, Eberswalder Str 84, D-15374 Muncheberg, Germany.",stefan.sieber@zalf.de; srijna@gmail.com; amjath.babu@zalf.de; franziska.bringe@4c-coffeeassociation.org; ibke_crewett@web.de; Goetz.Uckert@zalf.de; s.polreich@cgiar.org; HycenthTim.Ndah@uni-hohenheim.de; fgraef@zalf.de; kmueller@zalf.de,,"Mueller, Klaus/0000-0002-4249-047X; Sieber, Stefan/0000-0002-4849-7277; Amjath-Babu, T.S/0000-0001-9902-7104; Ndah, Dr. rer. agr.

More frequent drought events and heat spells are expected to reduce growth and increase mortality. Extended growing seasons, warming and elevated CO2 (eCO(2)) can also positively affect forest productivity. We studied the growth, productivity and mortality of beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and fir (Abies alba Mill.) in the Black Forest (Germany) under three climate change scenarios (representative concentration pathways (RCP): RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP8.5) using the detailed biogeochemical forest growth model GOTILWA+. Averaged over the entire simulation period, both species showed productivity losses in RCP2.6 (16-20%) and in RCP4.5 (6%), but productivity gains in RCP8.5 (11-17%). However, all three scenarios had a tipping point (between 2035-2060) when initial gains in net primary productivity (NPP) (6-29%) eventually turned into losses (1-26%). With eCO(2) switched off, the losses in NPP were 26-51% in RCP2.6, 36-45% in RCP4.5 and 33-71% in RCP8.5. Improved water-use efficiency dampened drought effects on NPP between 4 and 5%. Tree mortality increased, but without notably affecting forest productivity. Concluding, cultivation of beech and fir may still be possible in the study region, although severe productivity losses can be expected in the coming decades, which will strongly depend on the dampening CO2 fertilization effect.","[Sperlich, Dominik; Hanewinkel, Marc; Yousefpour, Rasoul] Univ Freiburg, Fac Environm & Nat Resources, Forestry Econ & Forest Planning, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany; [Nadal-Sala, Daniel] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res Atmospher Environm Re, D-82467 Garmisch Partenkirchen, Germany; [Nadal-Sala, Daniel; Gracia, Carlos] Univ Barcelona, Fac Biol, Dept Ecol, Diagonal 645, Barcelona 08028, Spain; [Gracia, Carlos] Ecol & Forestry Applicat Res Ctr CREAF, Barcelona 08193, Spain; [Kreuzwieser, Juergen] Univ Freiburg, Dept Ecosyst Physiol, Georges Koehler Allee 53-54, D-79110 Freiburg, Germany",University of Freiburg; Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; University of Barcelona; Centro de Investigacion Ecologica y Aplicaciones Forestales (CREAF); University of Freiburg,"Sperlich, D (corresponding author), Univ Freiburg, Fac Environm & Nat Resources, Forestry Econ & Forest Planning, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany.",dominik.sperlich@ife.uni-freiburg.de; daniel.sala@kit.edu; cgracia@ub.edu; juergen.kreuzwieser@ctp.uni-freiburg.de; marc.hanewinkel@ife.uni-freiburg.de; rasoul.yousefpour@ife.uni-freiburg.de,"hanewinkel, marc/E-5639-2011; Nadal-Sala, Daniel/AAC-2904-2020","hanewinkel, marc/0000-0003-4081-6621; Nadal-Sala, Daniel/0000-0002-0935-6201","Bundesministerium fur Ernahrung und Landwirtschaft (BMEL) [22WC106901]; Bundesministerium fur Umwelt, Naturschutz, the Federal Minister of Agriculture (BML); Federal Institute of Agriculture and Nutrition (BLE) [FKZ/28W-C-1-069-01]; Baden-Wuerttemberg Ministry of Science, Research and Art; University of Freiburg","Bundesministerium fur Ernahrung und Landwirtschaft (BMEL); Bundesministerium fur Umwelt, Naturschutz, the Federal Minister of Agriculture (BML); Federal Institute of Agriculture and Nutrition (BLE); Baden-Wuerttemberg Ministry of Science, Research and Art; University of Freiburg","The present study is part of the project Buchen-Tannen-Mischwalder zur Anpassung von Wirtschaftswaldern an Extremereignisse des Klimawandels (BuTaKli) within the program Waldklimafonds (number 22WC106901) which was financially supported by the Bundesministerium fur Ernahrung und Landwirtschaft (BMEL), the Bundesministerium fur Umwelt, Naturschutz, the Federal Minister of Agriculture (BML) and the Federal Minister of Environment (BMU) via the Federal Institute of Agriculture and Nutrition (BLE) (grant number FKZ/28W-C-1-069-01).

Here, we present an integrated modeling and analysis framework for researching climate change using NPP as an ecosystem indicator. It's brings together remote sensing, GIS and an ecosystem simulation model without requiring users to have any knowledge of any other specific software. Satellite data driven architecture can play a positive role in understanding the climate change and carbon cycles from regional to global scales. The benefit of the framework is that it provides complete spatial coverage and high temporal resolution, versus plot samples from which it may be difficult to provide an overall assessment for large-scale study. Recent advances in service-oriented architectures are allowing us to share of model results by geospatial services and create distributed applications needed for the collaborative research. Multi-layer approaches allow the framework more flexible and easy to extend. New datasets and models can be integrated for use in the development of new applications. A preliminary system based on the framework was carried out for monitoring the dynamic changes of terrestrial ecosystem NPP in China. State-of-the art processing algorithms was developed based on light-use efficiency model (Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) model). Fraction of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by vegetation (FPAR) is a linear function of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Simple Ratio vegetation index (SR). We combined the method of NDVI and SR together to compute the FPAR of China. And then, the NPP time-series of Chinese terrestrial vegetation is built. The System is capable of querying, retrieving, and visualizing datasets with heterogeneous formats and the spatio-temporal analysis revealed the relationship between NPP and climatic change in China. These results supported national trends of NPP in relation to lag effects of climate.","[Liu, Shuai; Li, Qi; Zhou, Hongwei] Peking Univ, Inst Remote Sensing & GIS, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China",Peking University,"Liu, SA (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Inst Remote Sensing & GIS, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",liu_shuai@yahoo.cn,"Liu, Shuai/AAX-1239-2021","Liu, Shuai/0000-0001-9909-0664",,,,,14,0,0,1,5,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-1-4244-7302-1,,,,2010,,,,,,,,,,,,5,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Engineering,BXN38,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000296522300259,View Full Record in Web of Science

Documentary-based drought reconstructions are then addressed in terms of long-term spatio-temporal fluctuations, major drought events, relationships with external forcing and large-scale climate drivers, socioeconomic impacts and human responses. Documentary-based drought series are also considered from the viewpoint of spatio-temporal variability for certain continents, and their employment together with hydroclimate reconstructions from other proxies (in particular tree rings) is discussed.

In many studies it has been suggested that these trends may be related to global warming due to increasing greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations. Coupled climate model scenario experiments may give a hint of such a relationship. Here, a large model intercomparison study is presented, incorporating most state-of-the-art models of the international modeller community with GHG and GHG plus sulphate aerosol (SUL) forcing, in order to quantify the signals common to different climate models and to determine the degree of uncertainty. The extratropical circulation candidates are the Arctic oscillation (AO), the North Atlantic oscillation (NAO), the Aleutian low (AL) and the Antarctic oscillation (AAO). Most climate models agree in predicting positive AO and AAO trends into the 21st century, these being different from the respective results of long-term control experiments. The NAO appears to be less sensitive to radiative forcing, with slightly positive and negative trends occurring in different models. The AL tends to strengthen in several models with GHG + SUL forcing. Projecting the spatial structure of the circulation modes onto the trend patterns of mean sea-level pressure (SLP) indicates that, in particular, the AO and AAO contribute considerably to the simulated long-term trends in SLP. Intermodel variations in Northern Hemisphere SLP trends become predominantly apparent over the mountainous regions and the North Pacific. In the Southern Hemisphere, the Antarctic region is subject to large model uncertainties. The multi-decadal trends of all circulation modes except the NAO are statistically significant in the majority of the climate-change experiments. At the interannual time scale, external radiative forcing does account for a small but statistically significant part of total multi-model variability, but this part is of the same order of magnitude as the systematic differences between the models. At decadal time scales, the external impact clearly stands out from the other sources of variability. Present-day climate models mostly agree in predicting a strengthening of the annular modes AO and AAO. As all models generally project a deepening of SLP over the polar caps, time series indicative of these regions might be a more appropriate measure of the sensitivity of extratropical circulation.

This has somehow resulted in instances where facts become less influential than opinion. This phenomenon has been coined in as 'post-truths in 2016 and it seems as though this trend of politics is here to stay. There are alarming issues ongoing and one such as climate change is an important hurdle that we must collectively work against. This research was conducted to discover the interpretations made from the contents of Before The Flood movie in 2016-A documentary that advocates for environmentalism. This research was developed from the model theory of Stuart Hall reception theory, which adopted the content analysis in reviewing 70 comments collected from the audience. In general, the results have shown that commentators put themselves in certain roles in society namely- consumer and normal citizens. When holding on to this view, it results in paradoxes of opinions.

Both the observations and model results support the picture that the decadal variability in the region of interest is based on a cycle involving unstable ocean-atmosphere interactions over the North Pacific. The period of this cycle is of the order of a few decades. The cycle involves the two major circulation regimes in the North Pacific climate system, the subtropical ocean gyre, and the Aleutian low. When,for instance, the subtropical ocean gyre is anomalously strong, more warm tropical waters are transported poleward by the Kuroshio and its extension, leading to a positive SST anomaly in the North Pacific. The atmospheric response to this SST anomaly involves a weakened Aleutian low, and the associated fluxes at the air-sea interface reinforce the initial SST anomaly, so that ocean and atmosphere act as a positive feedback system. The anomalous heat Aux, reduced ocean mixing in response to a weakened storm track, and anomalous Ekman hear transport contribute to this positive feedback. The atmospheric response, however, consists also of a wind stress curl anomaly that spins down the subtropical ocean gyre, thereby reducing the poleward heat transport and the initial SST anomaly. The ocean adjusts with some time lag to the change in the wind stress curl, and it is this transient ocean response that allows continuous oscillations. The transient response can be expressed in terms of baroclinic planetary waves, and the decadal timescale of the oscillation is therefore determined to first order by wave timescales. Advection by the mean currents, however, is not negligible. The existence of such a cycle provides the basis of long-range climate forecasting over North America at decadal timescales. At a minimum, knowledge of the present phase of the decadal mode should allow a ''now-cast'' of expected climate ''bias'' over North America, which is equivalent to a climate forecast several years ahead.","SCRIPPS INST OCEANOG,DIV CLIMATE RES,LA JOLLA,CA",University of California System; University of California San Diego; Scripps Institution of Oceanography,"Latif, M (corresponding author), MAX PLANCK INST METEOROL,BUNDESSTR 55,D-20146 HAMBURG,GERMANY.",,"Latif, Mojib/C-2428-2016","Latif, Mojib/0000-0003-1079-5604",,,,,41,461,508,1,68,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693",0894-8755,,,J CLIMATE,J.

This paper presents a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art in the application of CFD for modelling the interaction between the internal climate of glasshouses with external weather conditions and environmental control settings. The first published work in this area by Okushima et al. (1989) was concerned with the behaviour of a small glasshouse with simple boundary conditions. Subsequent published work has related to more complex and realistic situations and at the present time the authors are engaged in building a comprehensive fully three dimensional model of a full-scale commercial Venlo-type glasshouse. The paper presents all the main conclusions to be derived from the present body of published material along with the latest results of the authors' own research programme and points to the direction of future developments in the area of glasshouse control and optimised performance.,"Univ Exeter, Sch Engn & Comp Sci, Dept Engn, Exeter EX4 4QF, Devon, England",University of Exeter,"Reichrath, S (corresponding author), Univ Exeter, Sch Engn & Comp Sci, Dept Engn, Harrison Bldg,N Pk Rd, Exeter EX4 4QF, Devon, England.",,,,,,,,32,78,79,2,23,E D P SCIENCES,LES ULIS CEDEXA,"7, AVE DU HOGGAR, PARC D ACTIVITES COURTABOEUF, BP 112, F-91944 LES ULIS CEDEXA, FRANCE",0249-5627,,,AGRONOMIE,Agronomie,JAN-FEB,2002,1,,,,3,19,,10.1051/agro:2001006,http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/agro:2001006,,,17,Agronomy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,530VW,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000174380500001,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Joshi, MM; Turner, AG; Hope, C",,,,"Joshi, Manoj M.; Turner, Andrew G.; Hope, Chris",,,The use of the land-sea warming contrast under climate change to improve impact metrics,CLIMATIC CHANGE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,MODEL; OCEAN,"A favoured method of assimilating information from state-of-the-art climate models into integrated assessment models of climate impacts is to use the transient climate response (TCR) of the climate models as an input, sometimes accompanied by a pattern matching approach to provide spatial information. More recent approaches to the problem use TCR with another independent piece of climate model output: the land-sea surface warming ratio (phi). In this paper we show why the use of phi in addition to TCR has such utility. Multiple linear regressions of surface temperature change onto TCR and phi in 22 climate models from the CMIP3 multi-model database show that the inclusion of phi explains a much greater fraction of the inter-model variance than using TCR alone. The improvement is particularly pronounced in North America and Eurasia in the boreal summer season, and in the Amazon all year round. The use of phi as the second metric is beneficial for three reasons: firstly it is uncorrelated with TCR in state-of-the-art climate models and can therefore be considered as an independent metric; secondly, because of its projected time-invariance, the magnitude of phi is better constrained than TCR in the immediate future; thirdly, the use of two variables is much simpler than approaches such as pattern scaling from climate models. Finally we show how using the latest estimates of phi from climate models with a mean value of 1.6-as opposed to previously reported values of 1.4-can significantly increase the mean time-integrated discounted damage projections in a state-of-the-art integrated assessment model by about 15 %. When compared to damages calculated without the inclusion of the land-sea warming ratio, this figure rises to 65 %, equivalent to almost 200 trillion dollars over 200 years.","[Joshi, Manoj M.] Univ E Anglia, Climat Res Unit, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Joshi, Manoj M.] Univ E Anglia, Tyndall Ctr Climate Change Res, Sch Environm Sci, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Turner, Andrew G.] Univ Reading, NCAS Climate, Reading, Berks, England; [Hope, Chris] Univ Cambridge, Judge Business Sch, Cambridge, England",University of East Anglia; University of East Anglia; UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); NERC National Centre for Atmospheric Science; University of Reading; University of Cambridge,"Joshi, MM (corresponding author), Univ E Anglia, Climat Res Unit, Norwich Res Pk, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",m.joshi@uea.ac.uk,"Turner, Andrew G/D-2286-2009; Joshi, Manoj/C-1795-2008","Turner, Andrew G/0000-0002-0642-6876; Joshi, Manoj/0000-0002-2948-2811","NERC [NE/H015655/1]; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/H015655/1, ncas10009] Funding Source: researchfish",NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"AT is supported by a NERC Postdoctoral Fellowship, grant NE/H015655/1.

Arguments like statistics and policy debates are extrinsic motivators, which do not necessarily align people's own intrinsic motives with those of climate action. Instead, narratives and visual communication can influence viewers implicitly by the way they show and reinforce actions and thoughts that align with climate action. In this design study, we used comics created for human-level climate change influence to promote ideas like future-based thinking, sharing of responsibility, and caring for each other. We also created data visuals that illustrate future consequences of climate change for the purpose of averting negative alternative realities. To see whether our design can affect audience perception of climate change on the human level of goals and desires, we showed the comics to readers unfamiliar with the themes of the stories, presenting them as manga about characters and situations. The survey showed that data stories can affect the way naive readers interpret narratives to align with pro-climate attitudes such as sharing and future-vision, and that readers are focused on the human-level of the data and story as opposed to the physical resource level. Speculative fiction and data visuals provide a potentially effective way to influence individuals' climate change attitudes by showing alternative realities and attributes of collective responsibility and planning-for-the-future as data stories.","[Lc, Ray; Song, Zijing; Yang, Cheng] City Univ Hong Kong, Sch Creat Media, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Sun, Yating] Acad Art Univ, San Francisco, CA USA",City University of Hong Kong,"Lc, R (corresponding author), City Univ Hong Kong, Sch Creat Media, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",lc@raylc.org,,"Song, Zijing/0000-0002-9794-1039; YANG, Cheng/0000-0002-8372-2951; LC, RAY/0000-0001-7310-8790",,,,,45,0,0,6,6,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-1078,,,FRONT PSYCHOL,Front.

Quantifying the monetary value of climate change driven environmental losses is scarce, especially in coastal areas of developing countries that have low adaptive capacity to climate change impacts. To address this knowledge gap, we present a practical framework to Quantify Climate change driven Environmental Losses (QuantiCEL) that coherently assesses the likely physical impacts of climate change on CES, and pursues the valuation of their losses with primary data collection. The framework is applied to coastal areas in three developing countries, and may serve as a useful guide for practitioners. We quantify potential environmental losses due to relative sea level rise-induced coastal inundation in Indonesia and Bangladesh, and losses due to sea level rise and storm-induced coastline recession in Sri Lanka in the next 100 years. This study illustrates the applicability of the framework in different contexts in the data-scarce developing countries. Our findings suggest that the three case studies will experience the absolute loss value of CES by the end of the 21 st century, with food provision and tourism suffering the highest losses. Moreover, art, amenity, and tourism services are highly affected CES with respect to the percentage loss relative to the present-day value of these CES. The QuantiCEL framework and its application presented in this study could help researchers, policy makers, and coastal zone managers to get better insights into likely climate change driven environmental losses in coastal areas, contributing to the development of much needed environmental risk quantification methods, and sustainable management of coastal wetlands.","[Mehvar, Seyedabdolhossein; Ranasinghe, Roshanka] Univ Twente, Dept Water Engn & Management, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands; [Mehvar, Seyedabdolhossein; Dastgheib, Ali; Ranasinghe, Roshanka] IHE Delft Inst Water Educ, Dept Water Sci & Engn, NL-2601 DA Delft, Netherlands; [Filatova, Tatiana] Univ Twente, Dept Governance & Technol Sustainabil, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands; [Filatova, Tatiana] Univ Technol Sydney, Sch Informat Syst & Modeling, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia; [Ranasinghe, Roshanka] Deltares, Harbour Coastal & Offshore Engn, NL-2600 MH Delft, Netherlands",University of Twente; IHE Delft Institute for Water Education; University of Twente; University of Technology Sydney; Deltares,"Mehvar, S (corresponding author), Univ Twente, Dept Water Engn & Management, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands.;Mehvar, S (corresponding author), IHE Delft Inst Water Educ, Dept Water Sci & Engn, NL-2601 DA Delft, Netherlands.",s.mehvar@utwente.nl,"Ranasinghe, Roshanka/C-6711-2009; Dastgheib, Ali/M-8982-2013; Filatova, Tatiana/K-8233-2016","Ranasinghe, Roshanka/0000-0001-6234-2063; Dastgheib, Ali/0000-0002-5914-7213; Filatova, Tatiana/0000-0002-3546-6930",ADBIHE knowledge partnership (CRiSP project); Ministry I& M IHE Delft cooperation program; AXA Research Fund; Deltares Strategic Research Programme Coastal and Offshore Engineering,ADBIHE knowledge partnership (CRiSP project); Ministry I& M IHE Delft cooperation program; AXA Research Fund(AXA Research Fund); Deltares Strategic Research Programme Coastal and Offshore Engineering,"The authors are thankful for the financial supports from the ADBIHE knowledge partnership (via the CRiSP project), the Ministry I& M IHE Delft cooperation program, and the AXA Research Fund.

Wales's climate is projected to become warmer but wetter and it is known that hygrothermal impacts can accelerate deterioration, leading to damp and, subsequently, a loss of thermal performance. A stressor-response methodology was applied, which assumes that the exogenous stressors of solar flux, precipitation, and humidity have a direct effect on building-fabric performance. The resultant stressor-response values equate to the quantitative impact that a specific stressor has on individual specific building elements, presented as an adjusted service life and associated costs. Results show a modest reduction in the service life of building materials due to increases in and changing patterns of precipitation and subsequent moisture ingress. Although modest, with 1.5 million dwellings in Wales, the impact is significant. Advocating regular maintenance and repair will not only reduce the risks associated with changing weather patterns, but also encourage energy efficiency by improving the thermal performance of the building envelope. This will reduce the risk of adverse climate related outcomes, increased vulnerability to climate change, now or in the future.","[Hayles, Carolyn] Cardiff Metropolitan Univ, Cardiff Sch Art & Design, Cardiff CF5 2YB, Wales; [Huddleston, Matt; Helman, Jacob] Resilient Anal Inc, Louisville, CO 80027 USA; [Chinowsky, Paul] Univ Colorado, Environm Design, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",Cardiff Metropolitan University; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Hayles, C (corresponding author), Cardiff Metropolitan Univ, Cardiff Sch Art & Design, Cardiff CF5 2YB, Wales.",cshayles@Cardiffmet.ac.uk; mhuddleston@resilient-analytics.com; Paul.Chinowsky@colorado.edu; jhelman@resilient-analytics.com,,"Hayles, Carolyn/0000-0002-0811-0816",,,,,46,1,1,2,6,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2075-5309,,BUILDINGS-BASEL,BUILDINGS-BASEL,FEB,2022,2,,,,,,184,10.3390/buildings12020184,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/buildings12020184,,,19,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Civil",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Construction & Building Technology; Engineering,ZR3QH,,"Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000767701500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here, we evaluate vegetation carbon turnover processes in GVMs participating in the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISI-MIP, including HYBRID4, JeDi, JULES, LPJml, ORCHIDEE, SDGVM, and VISIT) using estimates of vegetation carbon turnover rate (k) derived from a combination of remote sensing based products of biomass and net primary production (NPP). We find that current model limitations lead to considerable biases in the simulated biomass and in k (severe underestimations by all models except JeDi and VISIT compared to observation-based average k), likely contributing to underestimation of positive feedbacks of the northern forest carbon balance to climate change caused by changes in forest mortality. A need for improved turnover concepts related to frost damage, drought, and insect outbreaks to better reproduce observation-based spatial patterns in k is identified. As direct frost damage effects on mortality are usually not accounted for in these GVMs, simulated relationships between k and winter length in boreal forests are not consistent between different regions and strongly biased compared to the observation-based relationships. Some models show a response of k to drought in temperate forests as a result of impacts of water availability on NPP, growth efficiency or carbon balance dependent mortality as well as soil or litter moisture effects on leaf turnover or fire. However, further direct drought effects such as carbon starvation (only in HYBRID4) or hydraulic failure are usually not taken into account by the investigated GVMs. While they are considered dominant large-scale mortality agents, mortality mechanisms related to insects and pathogens are not explicitly treated in these models.","[Thurner, Martin; Beer, Christian] Stockholm Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Analyt Chem ACES, Stockholm, Sweden; [Thurner, Martin; Beer, Christian] Stockholm Univ, Bolin Ctr Climate Res, Stockholm, Sweden; [Ciais, Philippe] Lab Sci Climat & Environm LSCE, Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Friend, Andrew D.; Rademacher, Tim T.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Geog, Cambridge, England; [Ito, Akihiko] Natl Inst Environm Studies, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Kleidon, Axel; Carvalhais, Nuno] Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, Jena, Germany; [Lomas, Mark R.; Shaun Quegan] Univ Sheffield, Sch Math & Stat, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Schaphoff, Sibyll] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Potsdam, Germany; [Tum, Markus] German Aerosp Ctr DLR, German Remote Sensing Data Ctr DFD, Wessling, Germany; [Wiltshire, Andy] Met Off Hadley Ctr, Exeter, Devon, England; [Carvalhais, Nuno] Univ Nova Lisboa, Fac Cencias & Tecnol, Dept Ciencias & Engn, CENSE, Caparica, Portugal",Stockholm University; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; CEA; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); University of Cambridge; National Institute for Environmental Studies - Japan; Max Planck Society; University of Sheffield; Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; Helmholtz Association; German Aerospace Centre (DLR); Met Office - UK; Hadley Centre; Universidade Nova de Lisboa,"Thurner, M (corresponding author), Stockholm Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Analyt Chem ACES, Stockholm, Sweden.;Thurner, M (corresponding author), Stockholm Univ, Bolin Ctr Climate Res, Stockholm, Sweden.",martin.thurner@aces.su.se,"Beer, Christian/D-2296-2013; Ciais, Philippe/A-6840-2011; Thurner, Martin/K-4854-2017; Wiltshire, Andy/C-2848-2008; Ito, Akihiko/P-2624-2017","Beer, Christian/0000-0002-5377-3344; Ciais, Philippe/0000-0001-8560-4943; Thurner, Martin/0000-0003-2362-5161; Ito, Akihiko/0000-0001-5265-0791; Friend, Andrew/0000-0002-9029-1045; Rademacher, Tim/0000-0002-0627-6564; Carvalhais, Nuno/0000-0003-0465-1436","Vetenskapsradet [621-2014-4266]; NOVA [UID/AMB/04085/2013]; GlobBiomass Project [4000113100/ 14/I-NB]; Joint UK DECC/Defra Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme [GA01101]; NERC [nceo020005] Funding Source: UKRI; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/D000874/1, nceo020005] Funding Source: researchfish",Vetenskapsradet(Swedish Research Council); NOVA; GlobBiomass Project; Joint UK DECC/Defra Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme; NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"Vetenskapsradet, Grant/Award Number: 621-2014-4266; NOVA, Grant/Award Number: UID/AMB/04085/2013; GlobBiomass Project, Grant/Award Number: 4000113100/ 14/I-NB; Joint UK DECC/Defra Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme, Grant/ Award Number: GA01101",,88,46,46,4,76,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

The model is forced with reconstructions of solar irradiance, greenhouse gas (GHG) and volcanic aerosol concentrations. A 1990 control simulation shows that the model is able to represent the Southern Annular Mode (SAM), and to some extent the South Pacific Dipole (SPD) and the Zonal Wave 3 (ZW3). During the past 500 yr we find that SPD and ZW3 variability remain stable, whereas SAM shows a significant shift towards its positive state during the 20th century. Regional temperatures over South America are strongly influenced by changing both GHG concentrations and volcanic eruptions, whereas precipitation shows no significant response to the varying external forcing. For temperature this stands in contrast to proxy records, suggesting that SH climate is dominated by internal variability rather than external forcing. The underlying dynamics of the temperature changes generally point to a combination of several modes, thus, hampering the possibilities of regional reconstructing the modes from proxy records. The linear imprint of the external forcing is as expected, i.e. a warming for increase in the combined solar and GHG forcing and a cooling after volcanic eruptions. Dynamically, only the increase in SAM with increased combined forcing is simulated.","[Wilmes, S. B.; Raible, C. C.; Stocker, T. F.] Univ Bern, Bern, Switzerland; [Wilmes, S. B.; Raible, C.

State-of-the-art climate models, by contrast, typically simulate a moderate decrease in both the Arctic and Antarctic sea ice covers. However, in each hemisphere there is a small subset of model simulations that have sea ice trends similar to the observations. Based on this, a number of recent studies have suggested that the models are consistent with the observations in each hemisphere when simulated internal climate variability is taken into account. Here sea ice changes during 1979-2013 are examined in simulations from the most recent Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) as well as the Community Earth System Model Large Ensemble (CESM-LE), drawing on previous work that found a close relationship in climate models between global-mean surface temperature and sea ice extent. All of the simulations with 1979-2013 Arctic sea ice retreat as fast as observations are found to have considerably more global warming than observations during this time period. Using two separate methods to estimate the sea ice retreat that would occur under the observed level of global warming in each simulation in both ensembles, it is found that simulated Arctic sea ice retreat as fast as observations would occur less than 1% of the time. This implies that the models are not consistent with the observations. In the Antarctic, simulated sea ice expansion as fast as observations is found to typically correspond with too little global warming, although these results are more equivocal. As a result, the simulations do not capture the observed asymmetry between Arctic and Antarctic sea ice trends. This suggests that the models may be getting the right sea ice trends for the wrong reasons in both polar regions.","[Rosenblum, Erica; Eisenman, Ian] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego; Scripps Institution of Oceanography,"Rosenblum, E (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",ejrosenb@ucsd.edu,"Eisenman, Ian/B-9329-2009",,"National Science Foundation (NSF); NSF [ARC-1107795, OCE-1357078]; Division Of Ocean Sciences [1357078] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)National Research Foundation of Korea); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Division Of Ocean Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)),"Without implying their endorsement, we are grateful to Sarah Gille, Art Miller, Paul Kushner, Neil Tandon, Frederic Laliberte, Till Wagner, and John Fyfe for helpful comments and discussions.

The IPCC AR5 report suggests a growing demand for research to provide information for a deeper and more useful understanding of climate adaptation options, and indicates a lack of effective methods to meet this increasing demand of policymakers. In this respect, a participatory integrated assessment (PIA) approach is presented in this paper to provide an effective means to mainstream wetland climate change adaptation in rural sustainable development strategies, and thus to reduce climate vulnerability and to enhance rural community livelihood. The PIA approach includes a series of research activities required to assess climate impacts on wetland ecosystems, and to prioritize adaptation responses. A range of adaptation options that address key aspects of the wetland ecosystem resilience and concerns are evaluated against community based on sustainable development indicators. The PIA approach is able to identify desirable adaptation options which can then be implemented to improve wetland ecosystem health and to enhance regional sustainable development in a changing climate. For illustration purpose, the PIA was applied in a case study in Poyang Lake (PYL) region, a critical wetland and water ecosystem in central China with important international biodiversity linkages, and a locale for key policy experiments with ecosystem rehabilitation. The PIA was used to facilitate the integration of wetland climate change adaptation in rural sustainable development actions with multi-stakeholders participation. In particular, the case shows how the PIA can be designed and implemented to select effective and practical climate change adaptation options to enhance ecosystem services management and to reduce resource use conflicts and rural poverty. Worked in partnership with multi-stakeholders and assisted with a multi-criteria decision making tool, the case identified alternative desirable adaptation measures which could be used to deal with climate risks. Several desirable adaptation options were implemented as pilot projects to showcase the effectiveness of these measures which resulted in benefits to the well-being and productivity of all people living in the region. It should be noted that while the case study evaluated adaptation policies or options to climate change, it was not completed in terms of discussing in detail all the key components of the PIA approach. However, the case study represents the state-of-the-arts research in climate change impact assessment and adaptation option evaluation, particularly in linking with wetland ecosystem sustainability. Findings of the case study have indicated that the potential effects of climate change on wetland sustainability are quite significant. The case has also identified adaptation measures considered by stakeholders to be potentially effective for reducing vulnerability of wetland ecosystems. It is clear that wetland ecosystem sustainability goals will be unachievable without mainstreaming adaptation measures into wetland conservation and health programs under a changing climate.","[Huang Li; Yin Yongyuan; Du De-Bin] East China Normal Univ, Sch Urban & Reg Sci, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China",East China Normal University,"Yin, YY (corresponding author), East China Normal Univ, Sch Urban & Reg Sci, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China.",yongyuan.yin@gmail.com,,,Boell Foundation China Office [116006]; GEF/SGP [RAF06],Boell Foundation China Office; GEF/SGP,Funding for this report was provided through two contracts from the Boell Foundation China Office (Code: 116006) and the GEF/SGP (RAF06).

However, recent studies have demonstrated that land management practices, especially irrigation, have distinct climate impacts. Here we disentangle the seasonal climate impacts of land cover change and irrigation across areas of high agricultural intensity using climate simulations with three different land surface scenarios: (1) natural vegetation cover/no irrigation, (2) year 2000 crop cover/no irrigation, and (3) year 2000 crop cover and irrigation rates. We find that irrigation substantially amplifies land cover-induced climate impacts but has opposing effects across certain regions. Irrigation mostly causes surface cooling, which substantially amplifies land cover change-induced cooling in most regions except over Central, West, and South Asia, where it reverses land cover change-induced warming. Despite increases in net surface radiation in some regions, this cooling is associated with enhancement of latent relative to sensible heat fluxes by irrigation. Similarly, irrigation substantially enhances the wetting influence of land cover change over several regions including West Asia and the Mediterranean. The most notable contrasting impacts of these forcings on precipitation occur over South Asia, where irrigation offsets the wetting influence of land cover during the monsoon season. Differential changes in regional circulations and moist static energy induced by these forcings contribute to their precipitation impacts and are associated with differential changes in surface and tropospheric temperature gradients and moisture availability. These results emphasize the importance of including irrigation forcing to evaluate the combined impacts of land surface changes for attributing historical climatic changes and managing future impacts. Plain Language Summary Several regions have experienced substantial agricultural expansion and intensification to meet the needs of our growing population. While the effects of land cover change associated with agriculture have been extensively studied and included as a standard forcing in simulations of historical and future climate, the influence of a common form of agricultural intensification-irrigation-is not fully understood. Despite mounting evidence of its importance on regional climate, irrigation is still not considered a standard climate forcing. To isolate the influence of irrigation from land cover changes, we conduct a suite of simulations with a state-of-the-art global climate model. Our analysis of nine regions with extensive agriculture and heavy irrigation demonstrates that irrigation has comparable climatic impacts to land cover changes. Across most regions, irrigation amplifies land cover forced changes. However, over parts of Asia, where irrigation rates are highest, irrigation contrasts land cover forced changes and the combined climate response to land cover and irrigation are opposite to what would be expected with land cover changes alone. Our results highlight the importance of including land management decisions in climate simulations for a more accurate understanding of how human activities shape climate, particularly over these regions, and have implications for management of the effects of future climate change.","[Singh, Deepti; Cook, Benjamin I.] Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY 10027 USA; [Singh, Deepti] Washington State Univ, Sch Environm, Vancouver, WA 98686 USA; [McDermid, Sonali P.] NYU, Environm Studies Dept, New York, NY USA; [McDermid, Sonali P.; Cook, Benjamin I.; Puma, Michael J.; Nazarenko, Larissa; Kelley, Maxwell] NASA, Goddard Inst Space Studies, New York, NY 10025 USA; [Puma, Michael J.; Nazarenko, Larissa] Columbia Univ, Ctr Climate Syst Res, Earth Inst, New York, NY USA",Columbia University; Washington State University; New York University; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; Columbia University,"Singh, D (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY 10027 USA.;Singh, D (corresponding author), Washington State Univ, Sch Environm, Vancouver, WA 98686 USA.",deepti.singh@wsu.edu,"Cook, Benjamin I/H-2265-2012","McDermid, Sonali/0000-0002-4244-772X","Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory Fellowship; NASA Modeling, Analysis, and Prediction program; NASA High-End Computing (HEC) Program through the NASA Center for Climate Simulation (NCCS) at Goddard Space Flight Center","Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory Fellowship; NASA Modeling, Analysis, and Prediction program(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); NASA High-End Computing (HEC) Program through the NASA Center for Climate Simulation (NCCS) at Goddard Space Flight Center","D.

Thus, this paper aims at drafting the state of the art on what is climate-related information disclosed by PIEs in the changing EU non-financial regulation assuming the Italian scenario and the industrial industry as significant in achieving the research aims. Design/methodology/approach The authors used the content analysis composing the sample of 34 large listed companies (i.e. PIEs) belonging to the industrial sector in Italy. The authors choose the Italian PIEs' sustainability reports published in 2019 after the adoption of the EU directive and its guidelines. The authors adopted a coding and classification system, investigating the climate-related information through a systematic, objective and reliable method. The authors defined 99 indicators along the structure of the European Commission's guidelines and the indicator of disclosure, climate-related information indicator (CII). The framework mainly derives from the corporate disclosure theory and legitimacy and stakeholders' theories. Findings The results show the lack of several required climate-related information or a not in-depth presentation of information. Thus, findings are interesting in emphasizing that the current climate-related disclosure is at an early stage in complying with the European Commission's guidelines. Additionally, the findings enlarge previous theories on corporate disclosure, proposing new insights in the light of the recent interest in climate-related information. Research limitations/implications Evidence contributes to extending the existing literature, drafting the state of the art of what is the quality and the quantity of the climate-related information in the corporate disclosure in the European scenario. Practical implications This paper is directed to propose the state of the climate-related disclosure following the EU directive guidelines, proposing some evidence to support the path toward the integrations of information by several parts (e.g. companies, regulators and so on). Originality/value The paper is a useful baseline for academics, practitioners, policy-makers and regulators in understanding actions to adopt in the climate-related disclosure and what could be the impact of forthcoming regulations in the field, also having some metrics (e.g. score value of disclosure, the indicator of climate-related information disclosure - CII).","[Lombardi, Rosa] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Law & Econ Prod Act, Rome, Italy; [Schimperna, Federico] Univ Cassino & Southern Lazio, Cassino, Italy; [Paoloni, Paola; Galeotti, Michele] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Rome, Italy",Sapienza University Rome; University of Cassino; Sapienza University Rome,"Lombardi, R (corresponding author), Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Law & Econ Prod Act, Rome, Italy.",rosa.lombardi@uniroma1.it,"Lombardi, Rosa/M-2292-2019","Lombardi, Rosa/0000-0003-0470-231X; Schimperna, Federico/0000-0001-7827-830X","Mixing Accounting Regulation and Corporate Accountability in the Era of Non-Financial Information, Intangibles and Digitalization","Mixing Accounting Regulation and Corporate Accountability in the Era of Non-Financial Information, Intangibles and Digitalization","The investigation conducted in this paper is connected to the wide research path actived by the project financed by Sapienza University of Rome TOrnado or SUnshine?

In this Perspective, we provide a comprehensive overview and categorization of the pathways and methods translating biophysical impacts into economic damages. We highlight the open question of the persistence of impacts as well as key methodological gaps, in particular the effect of including inequality and adaptation in the assessments.

The evolution of science seems to show a new trend with the application of less stringent targets, but after more than one century of research in the museum environment field there is still not a consensus. The test of the published risk assessment and, optimization tools in real cases assumes therefore a fundamental role for the change of the approach. The current work uses data recorded along one year in a Portuguese national museum to test the application of a sequential process to classify the indoor microclimate in terms of HVAC efficiency, risk of damage and thermal comfort, in an attempt to reach a balance between conservation needs, thermal comfort and energy reduction by the climate optimization. A set of three rooms (2 equipped with HVAC system, and the other without control system) was used. The optimization process was carried out to limit the risk of damage by limiting the RH fluctuation with the use of a dynamic method (FCT-UNL) based on the past climate and limiting the T to maximize the thermal comfort of the visitors. New targets were achieved, allowing to replace the original set-point of 20-22 degrees C and 50-60% by new values evidencing the high potential of energy reduction due to less demanding impositions.

The vast majority of these proxies are biologically based, and it is important to determine whether alternative sedimentologically based proxies indicate similar cold biases in models. Therefore, we have performed an evaluation of the very latest generation of climate model predictions for terrestrial sites using climatically sensitive sediments as palaeoclimate indicators. Evidence from the geological record, comprising coal/peat, evaporites, bauxite and laterite deposits, are portrayed on a series of palaeoclimate-data maps. These are then compared with the global distributions of potential deposits generated from model simulations of the Maastrichtian using versions of the Hadley Centre climate model. The Maastrichtian was chosen because of the greater range and sophistication of GCMs adapted for its climate simulation and sediment prediction than for other Cretaceous stages. This thus represents the first attempt at comparing such state-of-the-art models to lithological climate indicators and quantifying their relative performances. For peat/coal, there is generally good correspondence between Maastrichtian model predictions for predicted potential deposits and the observed record. For evaporites, there is also very close agreement between predictions by the models and the geological record, minor differences between the individual model versions resulting from their differing levels of atmospheric CO2 and the different palaeogeographical representations of intracontinental seaways in the Northern Hemisphere. For bauxites and laterites, the models predict less than half of the documented deposits, successfully portraying equatorial accumulations but omitting the majority of mid to high latitude deposits. The main discrepancy is therefore identified as the failure of all models to predict bauxite and laterite deposits corresponding with recorded accumulations within the mid to high latitudes of Europe and Asia. In many cases, the effects of CO2 have minimal impact on the skill of model prediction. However, for evaporite distributions, the low CO2 model is appreciably worse. In general, the best match across the geological data and models is achieved by the simulation with open Northern Hemisphere seaways. Overall, these results confirm those inferred from biological proxies, showing that climate models have a serious cold bias in high latitudes and continental interiors during the Cretaceous and that the latest generation of climate models still produces results which are incompatible with the geological data. Levels of atmospheric CO2 and uncertainties in palaeogeography cannot explain the discrepancy. The cold bias is common to many climate models, and suggests that a process or mechanism is poorly represented or omitted in the current generation of climate models, or that we are failing to recognise a major boundary condition change in the Cretaceous. If the former, this implies that we may be underestimating the extent of extreme future climate change at high latitudes and in continental interiors. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This paper attempts to show the potential importance of visual culture within a field that we may call cultural climatology. Cultural climatology seeks to explore the dialectic between society and atmosphere, weather and climate at a variety of temporal and spatial scales. A new visual approach to cultural climatology is presented as a possible way of stimulating conversations across the divide between the social and physical sciences. Images and visualisation assert their presence in the understanding, modelling and communication of many nature/culture debates, highlighting a need both for visual literacy across geography, and for social and physical scientists to share their visual methodologies. Cultural climatologists, like other scientists, need visual methodologies for both the critical construction and deconstruction of the images they wish to present and with which they are confronted. To illustrate the importance of visual literacy for cultural climatologists this paper introduces a sample of works from three artists: Constable, Monet and Eliasson. It shows how an exploration of their work (via a theory of pictures) could help to provide: firstly a methodology for understanding the cultural symbolism of skies and weather; secondly an assessment of the urban atmosphere in London at the turn of the 20th century and thirdly an example of the effective representation of atmosphere, weather and climate involving public participation and understanding. Lessons learned from deconstructing these works of art will then be used to suggest improvements in the visualisation of weather in the production and consumption of weather forecasts (thus, picturing theory).

This transnational identity, however, raises certain questions, including how Yan Xing's work changed from when he lived in China to when he became a US resident in 2015, and how these changes differ from the globalized art of earlier diasporic Chinese artists. Accordingly, this article first argues that overt references in Yan Xing's earlier work to sex and sexuality shift to an exploration of desire, truth and fiction in his later work that aligns with discourses on queer diasporas and minor theories. Secondly, this article argues that the new generation of Chinese diaspora artists live and work in a different political climate from the earlier generation of Chinese diaspora artists; the new generation works in an art world in which they are not exoticized objects, but actively participates in the making of a global visual language.","[Kyan, Winston] Univ Utah, Dept Art & Art Hist, 375 1530 E RM 161, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA",Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah,"Kyan, W (corresponding author), Univ Utah, Dept Art & Art Hist, 375 1530 E RM 161, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA.",winston.kyan@utah.edu,,,,,,,17,1,1,0,0,INTELLECT LTD,BRISTOL,"THE MILL, PARNALL RD, BRISTOL, BS16 3JG, ENGLAND",2051-7041,2051-705X,,J CONTEMP CHIN ART,J.

Effective governance necessitates the generation of concise information on the costs-effectiveness of policy instruments aimed at reducing atmospheric greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The marginal abatement cost curve (MACC) approach is a framework commonly used to summarise information of potential mitigation effort, and can help in identifying the most cost-effective managerial and technological GHG mitigation options. Agriculture offers key opportunities to mitigate GHG emissions and utilise carbon (C) sink potentials. Therefore, a number of countries have developed national agricultural MACCs in the last decade. Whilst these MACCs have undoubtedly been catalysers for the information exchange between science and policy, they have also accentuated a range of constraints and limitations. In response, each of the scientific teams developed solutions in an attempt to address one or more of these limitations. These solutions represent 'lessons learned' which are invaluable for the development of future MACCs. To consolidate and harness this knowledge that has heretofore been dispersed across countries, this paper reviews the engineering agricultural MACCs developed in European countries. We collate the state-of-the-art, review the lessons learnt, and provide a more coherent framework for countries or research groups embarking on a trajectory to develop an agricultural MACC that assesses mitigations both within the farm gate and to the wider bioeconomy. We highlight the contemporary methodological developments, specifically on 1) the emergence of stratified MACCs; 2) accounting for soil carbon sequestration 3) accounting for upstream and downstream emissions; 4) the development of comprehensive cost-calculations; 5) accounting for environmental co-effects and 6) uncertainty analyses. We subsequently discuss how the mitigation potential summarised by MACCs can be incentivised in practice and how this mitigation can be captured in national inventories. We conclude that the main purpose of engineering MACCs is not necessarily the accurate prediction of the total abatement potential and associated costs, but rather the provision of a coherent forum for the complex discussions surrounding agricultural GHG mitigation, and to visualise opportunities and low. hanging fruit in a single graphic and manuscript.

In this study, the convection-permitting Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model configured with 1.5 km grid spacing is used to simulate precipitation on sub-daily timescales over the Yangtze River Delta Region of China for continuous 10 years (2005-2014). The simulations are compared with rain gauge observations, reanalysis data, and the simulations of a lower resolution WRF with 9 km grid spacing that has a parameterization of convection. The results show that precipitation over the region can be well captured by using the convection-permitting model (CPM). Furthermore, the intensity, duration and coverage of these precipitation events can be more accurately described by the CPM. On the convection timescales of 1-4 h, especially for heavy rainfall events, the CPM is more accurate than the convection-parameterized model in capturing the short-duration events, which may be due to its better account of physical processes related to the convection on the convection-permitting scale. In addition, the extreme events which are more localized and with short-duration can be represented better by the CPM while the convection-parameterized model tends to produce widespread precipitation events covering more grid cells than observations Biases of the simulation by the 9-km mesh convection-parameterized mode appear to be related to the deficiencies in the representation of convections.","[Dong, Guangtao] Shanghai Climate Ctr, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China; [Dong, Guangtao] China Meteorol Adm, Key Lab Cities Mitigat & Adaptat Climate Change S, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Zhiyu] Nanjing Univ, Sch Atmospher Sci, Nanjing 201400, Peoples R China; [Wang, Ya] Shanghai Meteorol Disaster Prevent Technol Ctr, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China; [Tian, Zhan; Liu, Junguo] Southern Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China",China Meteorological Administration; Nanjing University; Southern University of Science & Technology,"Tian, Z (corresponding author), Southern Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China.",tianz@sustech.edu.cn,"Jiang, Zhiyu/B-1150-2018","Jiang, Zhiyu/0000-0002-8778-0999; Tian, Zhan/0000-0002-4520-0036","National Key R&D Program of China [2019YFE0124800]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [51761135024, 41730959]; Social Development Projects of STCSM [19DZ1201402, 19DZ1201500]",National Key R&D Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Social Development Projects of STCSM,"The authors would like to thank the sponsors of this work: the National Key R&D Program of China (Grant no. 2019YFE0124800), National Natural Science Foundation of China (51761135024 and 41730959), and also Social Development Projects of STCSM (19DZ1201402 and19DZ1201500).

The prediction of the climatology and interannual EASM pattern and the impact on the prediction are further investigated. It is noted that the four models have some skill in predicting summer rainfall in the East Asia, however, the skill is low on average and also largely regional dependence. The interannual variation of EASM measured by monsoon circulation index is well reproduced, implying that the broad-scale feature/pattern of EASM has higher predictability than the detailed spatial variation of EASM rainfall. The possible sources of predictability of the interannual variability of EASM are associated with the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the north Indian Ocean (NIO) sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies. The correlation pattern of rainfall with the NIO SST is characterized by a tripole pattern from south to north of East Asia, which is different from the correlation distribution of the southern-northern dipole with ENSO, suggesting that NIO SST may exert influence on the EASM independently. The major biases in climatology of EASM in the models are the northward shift of the western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH) and weak monsoonal southerly over the coast of East Asia, which leads to the prediction bias of the Meiyu/Baiu/Changma (MBC) rainfall belt. The prediction of the interannual EASM pattern presents two deficiencies: too weak rainfall variability and northward shift of the dipole rainfall pattern (opposite variation between MBC and the northwestern Pacific), that may be caused by the biases of WPSH in the models.","[Liu, Yunyun; Ke, Zongjian; Ding, Yihui] China Meteorol Adm, Natl Climate Ctr, 46 Mongguancun South Ave, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Liu, Yunyun] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteoro, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",China Meteorological Administration; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology,"Liu, YY (corresponding author), China Meteorol Adm, Natl Climate Ctr, 46 Mongguancun South Ave, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",liuyuny@cma.gov.cn,"Liu, Yunyun/AAD-8880-2022",,National Key R&D Program of China [2018YFC1505806]; Public Welfare Industry (Meteorological) Research Projects [GYHY201306024],National Key R&D Program of China; Public Welfare Industry (Meteorological) Research Projects,"National Key R&D Program of China, Grant/Award Number: 2018YFC1505806; Public Welfare Industry (Meteorological) Research Projects, Grant/Award Number: GYHY201306024",,55,22,25,5,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0899-8418,1097-0088,,INT J CLIMATOL,Int.

Simulating the most extreme rainfall intensities is still very challenging and highly uncertain under climate change. A convection-permitting regional climate model is used to estimate return levels dependent on the rainfall duration and return period for Germany. A comparison to radar-and station -based datasets reveals high-resolution model abilities to reproduce observed extreme precipitation statistics ranging from hourly to daily timescales. Among others, the model performance reveals a good agreement for extreme rainfall intensities for durations above 12 hours independent of the return period. An overestimation for hourly extreme precipitation intensities is still apparent. A comparison to several lower-resolution models using convection parameterisations shows the advantage of applying a convection-permitting setup for improving the spatial distribution and reducing the mean relative bias of extreme precipitation estimation over Germany. Finally, changes in extreme precipitation statistics are estimated under climate change for the convection-permitting model and placed in contrast to results obtained by state-of-the-art regional climate models. A 30% mean increase in intensity is projected for the end of the 21st century assuming a high -end emission scenario for daily precipitation extremes over Germany. The convection-permitting simulation does not show a further increase in intensity for sub-daily heavy rainfall estimates under global warming, as contrasted with regional climate models using parameterised convection.","[Rybka, Harald; Haller, Michael; Brienen, Susanne; Brauch, Jennifer; Frueh, Barbara; Junghaenel, Thomas; Lengfeld, Katharina; Walter, Andreas; Winterrath, Tanja] Deutsch Wetterdienst, Offenbach, Germany",,"Rybka, H (corresponding author), Deutsch Wetterdienst, Offenbach, Germany.",harald.rybka@dwd.de,,,,,,,109,0,0,4,4,E SCHWEIZERBARTSCHE VERLAGSBUCHHANDLUNG,STUTTGART,"NAEGELE U OBERMILLER, SCIENCE PUBLISHERS, JOHANNESSTRASSE 3A, D 70176 STUTTGART, GERMANY",0941-2948,1610-1227,,METEOROL Z,Meteorol.

The occurrence of vector competent Anopheles species as well as favorable climatic conditions may lead to the re-emergence of autochthonous malaria in Europe and the Mediterranean area. However, high-resolution assessments of possible changes of Anopheles vector distributions and of potential malaria transmission stability in the European-Mediterranean area under changing climatic conditions during the course of the 21st century are not available yet.MethodsBoosted Regression Trees are applied to relate climate variables and land cover classes to vector occurrences. Changes in future vector distributions and potential malaria transmission stability due to climate change are assessed using state-of-the art regional climate model simulations.ResultsDistinct changes in the distributions of the dominant vectors of human malaria are to be expected under climate change. In general, temperature and precipitation changes will lead to a northward spread of the occurrences of Anopheles vectors. Yet, for some Mediterranean areas, occurrence probabilities may decline.ConclusionsPotential malaria transmission stability is increased in areas where the climatic changes favor vector occurrences as well as significantly impact the vectorial capacity. As a result, vector stability shows the highest increases between historical and future periods for the southern and south-eastern European areas. Anopheles atroparvus, the dominant vector in large parts of Europe, might play an important role with respect to changes of the potential transmission stability.","[Hertig, Elke] Univ Augsburg, Inst Geog, Alter Postweg 118, D-86135 Augsburg, Germany",University of Augsburg,"Hertig, E (corresponding author), Univ Augsburg, Inst Geog, Alter Postweg 118, D-86135 Augsburg, Germany.",elke.hertig@geo.uni-augsburg.de,,"Hertig, Elke/0000-0002-6934-9468",,,,,35,31,32,2,24,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1756-3305,,,PARASITE VECTOR,Parasites Vectors,8-Jan,2019,,,,,,,18,10.1186/s13071-018-3278-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-018-3278-6,,,9,Parasitology; Tropical Medicine,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Parasitology; Tropical Medicine,HG9YT,30621785,"gold, Green Published",,,12/21/22,WOS:000455369300002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Optical microscopy of ultra-thin sections, backscattered electron microscopy, x-ray (energy dispersive and wavelength dispersive) analysis of cross sections, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy reveal that fires create some thermal fractures that enhance panel erosion, but most of the fire-induced erosion occurs along weathering rinds that form long before petroglyph manufacturing. In addition, rock varnish on top of petroglyphs experiences spalling, and fire ash with a clear potassium spike strongly adheres to rock varnish on petroglyphs and spalled sandstone. In the past, site managers assumed minimal damage away from massive spalls and other macrodamage on fire affected petroglyphs; an assumption no longer tenable.

This trend with poleward shifting tropospheric westerlies was attributed to downward propagation of stratospheric changes induced by ozone depletion. However, the role of the ocean in setting the SAM response to ozone depletion and its dynamical forcing remains unclear. Here we show, using idealized experiments with a state-of-the-art atmospheric model and analysis of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change climate simulations, that frontal sea surface temperature gradients in the midlatitude SH are critical for translating the ozone-induced stratospheric changes down to the surface. This happens through excitation of wave forcing, which controls the vertical connection of the tropospheric SAM with the stratosphere and shows the importance of internal tropospheric dynamics for stratosphere/troposphere coupling. Thus, improved simulation of oceanic fronts may reduce uncertainties in simulating SH ozone-induced climate changes.","[Ogawa, Fumiaki; Omrani, Nour-Eddine; Keenlyside, Noel] Univ Bergen, Inst Geophys, Bergen, Norway; [Ogawa, Fumiaki; Omrani, Nour-Eddine; Keenlyside, Noel] Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, Bergen, Norway; [Nishii, Kazuaki; Nakamura, Hisashi] Univ Tokyo, Adv Sci & Technol Res Ctr, Tokyo, Japan; [Nakamura, Hisashi] Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan",University of Bergen; Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research; University of Tokyo; Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science & Technology (JAMSTEC),"Ogawa, F (corresponding author), Univ Bergen, Inst Geophys, Bergen, Norway.",fumiaki.ogawa@gfi.uib.no,"Keenlyside, Noel S/E-8303-2013; Omrani, Noue-Eddine/GQQ-7245-2022","Keenlyside, Noel S/0000-0002-8708-6868; ","Max-Plank Institute [ECHAM5]; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; Japanese Ministry of Environment through Environment Research and Technology Development Fund [A-1201, 2-1503]; Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) [2205]; NordForsk GREENICE project [61841]; MEXT; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [22106001, 25287120] Funding Source: KAKEN","Max-Plank Institute; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Japanese Ministry of Environment through Environment Research and Technology Development Fund(Ministry of Environment (ME), Republic of Korea); Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT)(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); NordForsk GREENICE project; MEXT(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","Max-Plank Institute, especially Benjamin Moebis, provided support with ECHAM5.

The contributions provide an overview on models, methods, techniques used in decision support and the proposed frameworks to support decision making. With populations and economies growing worldwide, the demands on forest resources increase, and sustaining the supply of ecosystem services becomes crucial. Through growing public participation in decisions regarding the management of natural resources, new demands have emerged for tools that support our understanding of environmental issues, and for the development and evaluation of alternative management options; there is a desire to project the consequences of different courses of action. Decision Support Systems (DSS) have been proven to solve such ill-structured decision problems by integrating database management systems with analytical and operational research models, thus providing various reporting capabilities. Several case studies focus on decision problems, the development and evaluation of alternative management options, and on projecting the consequences of different courses of action in the provision of ecosystem services.

Whether this connection is intrinsic to the climate system or caused by external forcing remains unclear in view of the substantial existence of anthropogenic greenhouse gases and aerosols in observations. Two state-of-the-art climate models (GFDL-CM3 and HadGEM2-ES), the historical simulations (1850-2005) of which show positive correlations between the AMO and ISM, similar to observation, are used to address this question. A significant positive AMO-ISM correlation exists in the control simulations with fixed preindustrial forcing with HadGEM2-ES, but not with GFDL-CM3. An in-depth analysis illustrates that the positive correlation in the HadGEM2-ES control run is more reasonable, since it simulates a similar teleconnection of the AMO with the North Pacific to that in both observations and previous studies. In comparison, the GFDL-CM3 control run fails to simulate the teleconnection of the AMO with the North Pacific. The positive AMO-ISM correlation in the historical simulation in GFDL-CM3 may be attributable to the role of the external forcing, since it is so strong that the AMO signals are excited additionally in the North Pacific. This study suggests that the AMO-ISM connection is intrinsic to the climate system, and highlights the crucial role played by the North Pacific in bridging such a connection.","[Luo, Feifei; Li, Shuanglin; Gao, Yongqi] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Nansen Zhu Int Res Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Luo, Feifei; Li, Shuanglin; Gao, Yongqi] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Climate Change Res Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Li, Shuanglin] China Univ Geosci, Dept Atmospher Sci, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Gao, Yongqi; Keenlyside, Noel] Nansen Environm & Remote Sensing Ctr, Bergen, Norway; [Gao, Yongqi; Svendsen, Lea; Furevik, Tore; Keenlyside, Noel] Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, Bergen, Norway; [Svendsen, Lea; Furevik, Tore; Keenlyside, Noel] Univ Bergen, Geophys Inst, Bergen, Norway","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; China University of Geosciences; Nansen Environmental & Remote Sensing Center (NERSC); Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research; University of Bergen","Li, SL (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Nansen Zhu Int Res Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Li, SL (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Climate Change Res Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China.",shuanglin.li@mail.iap.ac.cn,"gao, yongqi/N-9347-2014; Keenlyside, Noel S/E-8303-2013","Keenlyside, Noel S/0000-0002-8708-6868; Luo, Feifei/0000-0003-3587-5547; Furevik, Tore/0000-0002-1668-2785; Svendsen, Lea/0000-0002-0181-3332","National Key R&D Program of China [2018YFA0606403]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41790473, 41731177, 41421004]; Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA11010401]",National Key R&D Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences),"We thank the two anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments and suggestions, which helped greatly towards improving the manuscript.

Included is not only high culturethe arts and literaturebut also science, technology, and more practical, everyday activities and beliefs: how to plant a potato or pray for rain, to seek good luck in battle or on exams at school. Cultures are not static; they change in response to wars, plagues, new inventionsas well as to environmental and climate variability. Here we look at some of the rules of culture, in order to explore the extent to which climate change seriously threatens cultural diversity. The most popular examples of climate change impacts on human societies focus on remote communities in the Arctic or on tropical islands, but we need to keep in mind that the fossil fuel dependent lifeways of those of us residing in the industrialized temperate zones are perhaps even more endangered, and certainly less sustainable.

The model is forced with downscaled atmospheric fields from two global climate models using two different greenhouse-gas concentration scenarios giving an ensemble of four realisations of possible future ice conditions. Even though ice extent will be reduced in future climate and ice seasons will become shorter, completely ice-free winters are unlikely during the present century. In future climate, the ice becomes thinner, thus fewer traffic restrictions will be needed, but with a large inter-annual variability.

As the consequences of climate change are becoming evident, climate-based models of disease risk are of growing importance. Here, we review the current state-of-the-art in both mechanistic and correlative disease modelling, the data driving these models, the vectors and diseases covered, and climate models applied to assess future risk. We find that modelling techniques have advanced considerably, especially in terms of using ensembles of climate models and scenarios. Effects of extreme events, precipitation regimes, and seasonality on diseases are still poorly studied. Thorough validation of models is still a challenge and is complicated by a lack of field and laboratory data. On a larger scale, the main challenges today lie in cross-disciplinary and cross-sectoral transfer of data and methods.","[Tjaden, Nils Benjamin; Beierkuhnlein, Carl; Thomas, Stephanie Margarete] Univ Bayreuth, Dept Biogeog, Bayreuth, Germany; [Caminade, Cyril] Univ Liverpool, Inst Infect & Global Hlth, Liverpool, Merseyside, England; [Caminade, Cyril] NIHR, Hlth Protect Res Unit Emerging & Zoonot Infect, Liverpool, Merseyside, England; [Beierkuhnlein, Carl; Thomas, Stephanie Margarete] Bayreuth Ctr Ecol & Environm Res, BayCEER, Bayreuth, Germany; [Beierkuhnlein, Carl] GIB, Bayreuth, Germany",University of Bayreuth; University of Liverpool; University of Bayreuth,"Thomas, SM (corresponding author), Univ Bayreuth, Dept Biogeog, Bayreuth, Germany.;Thomas, SM (corresponding author), Bayreuth Ctr Ecol & Environm Res, BayCEER, Bayreuth, Germany.",stephanie.thomas@uni-bayreuth.de,"Beierkuhnlein, Carl/ABF-8797-2021; Tjaden, Nils/AFT-8631-2022; Beierkuhnlein, Carl/ABF-9693-2021","Tjaden, Nils/0000-0002-7685-1659; Beierkuhnlein, Carl/0000-0002-6456-4628; Thomas, Stephanie Margarete/0000-0003-0507-2006; Caminade, Cyril/0000-0002-3846-7082",German Research Platform for Zoonoses; Federal Ministry of Education and Research [FKZ: 01KI1601]; National Institute for Health Research Health Protection Research Unit (NIHR HPRU) in Emerging and Zoonotic Infections at the University of Liverpool; Public Health England (PHE); Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM); Farr Institute for Health Informatics Research (MRC) [MR/M0501633/1]; German Research Platform for Zoonoses; Federal Ministry of Education and Research [FKZ: 01KI1601]; National Institute for Health Research Health Protection Research Unit (NIHR HPRU) in Emerging and Zoonotic Infections at the University of Liverpool; Public Health England (PHE); Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM); Farr Institute for Health Informatics Research (MRC) [MR/M0501633/1],German Research Platform for Zoonoses; Federal Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); National Institute for Health Research Health Protection Research Unit (NIHR HPRU) in Emerging and Zoonotic Infections at the University of Liverpool; Public Health England (PHE); Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM); Farr Institute for Health Informatics Research (MRC); German Research Platform for Zoonoses; Federal Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); National Institute for Health Research Health Protection Research Unit (NIHR HPRU) in Emerging and Zoonotic Infections at the University of Liverpool; Public Health England (PHE); Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM); Farr Institute for Health Informatics Research (MRC),"Nils Tjaden and Stephanie Thomas were funded by the German Research Platform for Zoonoses and the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Interdisciplinary cross-sectional project 'Spatial, Temporal and Economic Risk Assessment of Vector-borne Zoonoses' FKZ: 01KI1601).

We engage Deleuze's method of dramatisation to theorise how young people are using digital platforms to perform climate activism and construct new political subjectivities through affective investments. We develop these ideas by describing the process of co-developing a climate change education App with young people. This co-design process brought together elements of climate education, environmental science, speculative fiction, gaming, social media, and hacktivism as techniques for dramatising climate change through digital practices of fabulation. We argue that climate change is a complex philosophical problem that needs to be dramatised - and that young people are currently using digital media to elaborate speculative performances of this problem through the cultivation of a minor politics.","[Rousell, David] RMIT Univ, Sch Educ, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Wijesinghe, Thilinika] Southern Cross Univ, Fac Educ, Gold Coast, Australia; [Cutter-Mackenzie-Knowles, Amy; Osborn, Maia] Southern Cross Univ, Fac Educ, Gold Coast Campus, Coolangatta, Australia",Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT); Southern Cross University; Southern Cross University,"Rousell, D (corresponding author), RMIT Univ, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia.",david.rousell@rmit.edu.au,"Cutter-Mackenzie-Knowles, Amy/H-6325-2016","Cutter-Mackenzie-Knowles, Amy/0000-0002-2499-8552; Rousell, David/0000-0002-4509-6128",Australian Association of Environmental Educators,Australian Association of Environmental Educators,This research was supported by funding from the Australian Association of Environmental Educators.,,70,3,3,2,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-1911,1465-3397,,EDUC REV,Educ.

The research project reflects Cockpit Arts' interest in raising aspirations for improved profitability and success in the craft sector and in highlighting the role that incubation can play. The article first outlines the aims and context of the project, the research methodology employed and some of its limitations. This is followed by a summary of the key findings, headlined by the fact that craft businesses at Cockpit Arts are experiencing significant business growth, despite a tough economic climate. The evidence highlights a number of key drivers contributing to this growth including craft discipline, age of business, product innovation, market diversification beyond the UK contemporary craft market, successfully outsourcing manufacture and exploitation of intellectual property through licensing. The article continues by exploring some of the barriers and challenges facing makers today in terms of business growth and sustainability. Incubation is shown to contribute to business growth through the mechanisms of strategic planning supported by one to one coaching and access to finance in particular. The research shows, however, that no set business model or combination of incubator services can guarantee business development or growth. One size does not fit all. To conclude, I argue that while measuring the impact of incubation is challenging, it can play a significant role in craft sector development. In particular, I make the case for an approach that focuses on the development of the owner-manager in order that they can exploit their creativity in the most effective, sustainable and profitable way.","[O'Hara, Ellen] Cockpit Arts, Northington St, London WC1N 2NP, England",,"O'Hara, E (corresponding author), Cockpit Arts, Northington St, London WC1N 2NP, England.",ellen@cockpitarts.com,,,,,,,10,2,2,0,0,INTELLECT LTD,BRISTOL,"THE MILL, PARNALL RD, BRISTOL, BS16 3JG, ENGLAND",2040-4689,2040-4697,,CRAFT RES,Craft Res.,JUN,2011,1,,,,129,141,,10.1386/crre.2.129_7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1386/crre.2.129_7,,,13,Art,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Art,V2R1Q,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000217835700008,View Full Record in Web of Science

Phenological changes in spring (i.e., the start of the growing season, SOS) over the TP are of much debate, while our understanding on the variation of autumn phenology (i.e., the end of the growing season, EOS) is still lacking. Given the significance of tracing the latest variation of EOS induced by the ongoing global change, we used the currently longest time series (1982-2018) of the normalized difference vegetation index of the Long Term Data Record from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR LTDR NDVI) and investigated the responses of EOS to biological and climatic factors. We found that the EOS showed an insignificantly delayed trend at an average rate of 0.14 days center dot decade(-1) on the TP. This variation was found for all vegetation types except for alpine sparse vegetation. We further showed that spring SOS had the largest contribution to the interannual variations in EOS, where 46.5% of the vegetated areas showed significantly positive correlations between SOS and EOS (p < .05). Temperature (26.5%) and precipitation (18.8%) also had significant positive impacts on EOS, while the contribution of radiation was negative (11.3%). These correlations were regulated by local hydrothermal conditions, especially for precipitation gradients. Using the longest satellite data currently available, with the state-of-art data processing, we demonstrated a weakly delaying trend of EOS and the controlling role of spring phenology on the interannual variability of EOS, which is of great significance to improve our comprehension of the interactions between vegetation dynamics and climate change in the future.","[Peng, Jie; Wu, Chaoyang; Wang, Xiaoyue] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Land Surface Pattern & Simulat, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Peng, Jie; Wu, Chaoyang; Wang, Xiaoyue] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Lu, Linlin] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Remote Sensing & Digital Earth, Key Lab Digital Earth Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; The Institute of Remote Sensing & Digital Earth, CAS","Wu, CY (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Land Surface Pattern & Simulat, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",wucy@igsnrr.ac.cn,"Lu, Linlin/P-9200-2018","Lu, Linlin/0000-0003-1647-1950; Peng, Jie/0000-0002-6533-8737","Key Research Program of Frontier Sciences, CAS [QYZDB-SSW-DQC011]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41871255, 41901359]; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA19040103]","Key Research Program of Frontier Sciences, CAS; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences)","Key Research Program of Frontier Sciences, CAS, Grant/Award Number: QYZDB-SSW-DQC011; National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Numbers: 41871255, 41901359; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Grant/Award Number: XDA19040103",,91,15,15,14,90,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0899-8418,1097-0088,,INT J CLIMATOL,Int.

Amongst other things, the indoor climate is of utmost importance to minimize collection degradation. Many museums employ tight climate guidelines, allowing only small fluctuations of indoor temperature and relative humidity, resulting in the following problems: huge energy consumption, the need for high-capacity HVAC systems, additional stress on historical buildings. This simulation study investigates the energy-saving potential of different setpoint strategies. Damage functions were used to assess the degradation risk of the collection and an Adaptive Temperature Guideline was used to assess thermal comfort. A state-of-the-art museum in the Netherlands was modeled and the indoor climate and energy consumption were simulated, including heating, cooling, humidification and dehumidification. Maximum savings, compared to a reference situation, of 82% may be achieved. However, the optimum strategy yields a saving of 77%, significantly improves thermal comfort and decreases chemical degradation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Kramer, R. P.; Maas, M.

Here, we analyze time series of low, mean, and high river flows from 7250 observatories around the world covering the years 1971 to 2010. We identify spatially complex trend patterns, where some regions are drying and others are wetting consistently across low, mean, and high flows. Trends computed from state-of-the-art model simulations are consistent with the observations only if radiative forcing that accounts for anthropogenic climate change is considered. Simulated effects of water and land management do not suffice to reproduce the observed trend pattern. Thus, the analysis provides clear evidence for the role of externally forced climate change as a causal driver of recent trends in mean and extreme river flow at the global scale.","[Gudmundsson, Lukas;

The third version of the CNRM (Centre National de Recherches Meteorologiques) global atmosphere-ocean-sea ice coupled model (CNRM-CM3) was used to conduct climate change experiments for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report (IPCC AR4). The analysis of the A1B scenario experiment shows that global warming leads to a slowdown of North Atlantic deep ocean convection and thermohaline circulation south of Iceland. This slowdown is triggered by a freshening of the Arctic Ocean and an increase in freshwater outflow through Fram Strait. Sea ice melting in the Barents Sea induces a local amplification of the surface warming, which enhances the cyclonic atmospheric circulation around Spitzberg. This anti-clockwise circulation forces an increase in Fram Strait outflow and a simultaneous increase in ocean transport of warm waters toward the Barents Sea, favouring further sea ice melting and surface warming in the Barents Sea. Additionally, the retreat of sea ice allows more deep water formation north of Iceland and the thermohaline circulation strengthens there. The transport of warm and saline waters toward the Barents Sea is further enhanced, which constitutes a second positive feedback.","[Guemas, Virginie; Salas-Melia, David] CNRS, GMGEC, CNRM, Grp Etude Atmosphere Meteorolog, F-31057 Toulouse, France; [Guemas, Virginie] UVSQ, CNRS, CEA, Lab Sci Climat & Environm,UMR 1572, Gif Sur Yvette, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; CEA; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Guemas, V (corresponding author), CNRS, GMGEC, CNRM, Grp Etude Atmosphere Meteorolog, F-31057 Toulouse, France.",virginie.guemas@meteo.fr,"Guemas, Virginie/B-9090-2016","Guemas, Virginie/0000-0002-6340-3558",,,,,56,9,10,2,17,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0930-7575,1432-0894,,CLIM DYNAM,Clim.

The modelling system enables joint probabilities for overtopping discharge to be assessed for different future climate scenarios with different rates of sea level rise. For the test case of a sea wall at Walcott, UK, where extensive flooding occurred on 9th November 2007, it is shown how the frequency of flooding of a given magnitude would increase with time, dependent on future climate projections and sea level rise, and, correspondingly, how the magnitude of flooding with a given return period would increase. For example, for an event with a return period of 100 years (similar to the 2007 Walcott event), the return period, estimated by the proposed extreme event analyses, reduces to 5 years with 0.35 m sea level rise in 2100, thought to be the most likely level, and just over 1 year with 1 m sea level rise. The methodology applied here, based on state-of-the-art modelling of wave overtopping, shows that the future projected rates are more influenced by changes in water level than by changes in significant wave height.

According to climate projections, the region is at risk due to its pronounced susceptibility to changes in the hydrological budget and extremes. Such changes are expected to have strong impacts on the management of water resources and on key strategic sectors of regional economies. Related developments have an increased capacity to exacerbate tensions, and even intra- and inter-state conflict among social, political, ecological and economic actors. Thus, effective adaptation and prevention policy measures call for multi-disciplinary analysis and action. This review paper presents the current state-of-the-art on research related to climate change impacts upon water resources and security from an ecological, economic and social angle.

Although it is believed to be caused by 18.6-year period tidal cycle, no study has directly shown how the tidal cycle regulates such variability. Using a state-of-the-art climate model, we show that the 18.6-year cycle in strong tidal mixing localized around the Kuril Islands induces 18.6-year periodicity in E1 Nino-Southern Oscillation-like Pacific climate variability. Influence of the tidal mixing propagates along the Pacific western rim as coastally trapped waves. Temperature anomaly is generated in the subsurface western equatorial Pacific, which propagates along the equatorial thermocline and eventually excites 18.6-year periodicity in the equatorial sea surface temperature.","[Hasumi, Hiroyasu; Tatebe, Hiroaki; Kimoto, Masahide] Univ Tokyo, Ctr Climate Syst Res, Kashiwa, Chiba 2778568, Japan; [Yasuda, Ichiro] Univ Tokyo, Ocean Res Inst, Tokyo 1648639, Japan",University of Tokyo; University of Tokyo,"Hasumi, H (corresponding author), Univ Tokyo, Ctr Climate Syst Res, Kashiwa, Chiba 2778568, Japan.",hasumi@ccsr.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"kimoto, masahide/P-9077-2014","tatebe, hiroaki/0000-0002-2265-5847",,,,,32,30,30,0,4,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",0094-8276,1944-8007,,GEOPHYS RES LETT,Geophys.

M.",,,Is interactive air sea coupling relevant for simulating the future climate of Europe?,CLIMATE DYNAMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,BALTIC SEA; NORTH-SEA; EXTREME PRECIPITATION; SURFACE-TEMPERATURE; MODEL SIMULATIONS; CHANGE SCENARIOS; DEGREES-C; CORDEX; PROJECTIONS; ENSEMBLE,"The majority of regional climate change assessments for the Euro-CORDEX region is based on high resolution atmosphere models. These models use prescribed lower boundary conditions, such as sea surface temperatures (SST) from global ocean General Circulation Models (GCMs), that do not respond to changes simulated by the regional atmosphere model, thus lacking an important feedback to the atmosphere. However, research during the past decade indicated that the use of coupled atmosphere-ocean models can lead to significantly altered model solutions compared to standalone atmosphere models for the present day climate imposing some uncertainty on the widely used uncoupled future scenarios. We here present the first multi-model and multi scenario (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP8.5) ensemble of future climate change scenarios downscaled with a coupled atmosphere-ocean model in which sea surface temperature and sea ice fields are explicitly simulated by a coupled state-of-the-art high resolution ocean model and communicated to the atmosphere at 3-hourly time steps. Our ensemble generally confirms results of previous uncoupled ensembles over land areas implying that the coupling effect is restricted mainly to the coupled area and the adjacent coastal zone. By contrast, over the North Sea and Baltic Sea small scale processes point to important coupling effects that mediate the response to climate change and that can not be simulated by uncoupled models. Our results therefore impose general uncertainty on the usage of regional climate change data from uncoupled ensembles over marine areas such as for purposes of offshore wind or mussel farming, the planing of marine protected areas, and marine recreation along the coastal zone. It further sets in question the usage of uncoupled scenario data (such as Euro-CORDEX) to force high resolution ocean models. Comparing coupled and uncoupled hindcast simulations reveals that the coupling effect over land is most pronounced during the warm season when prescribed and modelled sea surface temperatures (SST) differ strongest. In addition, a generally weaker wind regime in summer damps the heat dispersion in the atmosphere so that air temperature anomalies can extent further over land compared to winter. Future projections are discussed under consideration of land-sea warming characteristics for selected climate indices as well as mean seasonal climate change. At the end of the century a clear land-sea pattern is seen in all scenarios with stronger warming over land than over open sea areas. On average land areas warm at a rate 1.5 times faster than areas over the open ocean. Over the coupled area, i.e. the North Sea and Baltic Sea tropical nights are impacted strongest and the Baltic Sea turns out to be a hot spot in future climate. This has been unrecognized in previous studies using high resolution atmosphere models with prescribed SSTs from global models which do not represent small scale ocean processes in the Baltic Sea adequately.","[Groeger, M.; Meier, H.

The sound recordings of interviews and encounters conducted in this process were edited into a score that then formed the basis for a creative exchange with environmentalist and documentary film-maker Sara Penrhyn Jones. The resulting 15-minute film installation sits between the genres of dance and documentary. What we offer here is a reflexive account of the process of creating this work. We consider how walking, talking and being in landscape with greater attention to the senses can combine to foster a more deeply felt sense of embodiment in walker/researcher, respondents and film-maker alike. In pointing to the parallels between this and the application of somatic practices in dance training and performance, we ask if embodiment can be tangibly communicated from performer to audience to bring about greater ecological and social awareness. We also observe that, while coming from our seemingly disparate fields, the practices of somatics and of observational documentary are ultimately both about opening 'space'. It is this we sought to amplify in the film: space for the subjects to speak in their own voices and, in limiting distracting visual images (unusually, the speakers themselves are not seen at all), greater space for the viewer to contemplate their message. We suggest that, in combining our fields of experience in this way, a practice is emerging which may represent an 'activism by stealth', stimulating debate and encouraging a more embodied and everyday engagement with the issues of climate change. We conclude with a discussion of the capacity of participative-collaborative arts projects to facilitate a move away from more traditional consumptive attitudes to the arts, counteracting passivity to re-frame our lives in the context of a changing climate.","[Allen, Jess] Coventry Univ, Sch Art & Design, Coventry, W Midlands, England; [Allen, Jess] City Bristol Coll, Bristol, Avon, England; [Jones, Sara Penrhyn] Aberystwyth Univ, Dept Theatre Film & Televis Studies, Aberystwyth, Dyfed, Wales",Coventry University; Aberystwyth University,"Allen, J (corresponding author), Coventry Univ, Sch Art & Design, Coventry, W Midlands, England.",hedgesprite@googlemail.com,,,,,,,33,12,12,0,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1356-9783,,,RIDE-J APPL THEATRE,RIDE-J.

Therefore, the simulations performed are not able to provide information about possible future scenarios due to climate change. In this work, future trends of building energy demands due to the climate change across Europe were studied by comparing three time steps (present, 2050, and -2080) in three different European cities, characterized by different Koppen-Geiger climatic classes. A residential building with modern architectural features was taken into consideration for the simulations. Future climate conditions were reached by applying the effects of climate changes to current hourly meteorological data though the climate change tool world weather file generator (CCWorldWeatherGen) tool, according to the guidelines established by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. In order to examine the resilience of the building, the simulations carried out were compared with respect to: peak power, median values of the power, and energy consumed by heating and cooling system. The observed trend shows a general reduction in the energy needs for heating (-46% for Aberdeen, -80% for Palermo, -36% for Prague in 2080 compared to the present) and increase (occurrence for Aberdeen) in cooling requirements. These results imply a revaluation of system size.","[Ciancio, Virgilio; Golasi, Iacopo; Coppi, Massimo; de Santoli, Livio; Salata, Ferdinando] Univ Rome Sapienza, Dept Astronaut Elect & Energy Engn, Appl Phys Area, Via Eudossiana 18, I-00184 Rome, Italy; [Falasca, Serena] Univ Urbino Carlo Bo, Dept Pure & Appl Sci, I-61029 Urbino, Italy; [Falasca, Serena] Univ Aquila, Ctr Excellence Telesensing Environm & Model Predi, I-67100 Coppito, Italy; [de Wilde, Pieter] Univ Plymouth, Sch Art Design & Architecture, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England",Sapienza University Rome; University of Urbino; University of L'Aquila; University of Plymouth,"Salata, F (corresponding author), Univ Rome Sapienza, Dept Astronaut Elect & Energy Engn, Appl Phys Area, Via Eudossiana 18, I-00184 Rome, Italy.",virgilio.ciancio@uniroma1.it; serena.falasca@uniurb.it; iacopo.golasi@uniroma1.it; pieter.dewilde@plymouth.ac.uk; massimo.coppi@uniroma1.it; livio.desantoli@uniroma1.it; ferdinando.salata@uniroma1.it,"Salata, Ferdinando/I-4627-2015; de Wilde, Pieter/T-5829-2017","Salata, Ferdinando/0000-0001-9740-034X; de Wilde, Pieter/0000-0003-3376-9775; Falasca, Serena/0000-0002-7365-369X; ciancio, virgilio/0000-0002-4535-078X; Golasi, Iacopo/0000-0002-9942-0560",Sapienza University of Rome,Sapienza University of Rome,Ferdinando Salata received for this research a grant on the Progetti di Ricerca-Progetti Medi 2018 from Sapienza University of Rome.,,43,11,11,1,10,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1996-1073,,ENERGIES,Energies,DEC,2019,23,,,,,,4506,10.3390/en12234506,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en12234506,,,15,Energy & Fuels,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Energy & Fuels,KM4IF,,"Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000514090100104,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, longstanding uncertainties in their ability to simulate regional and local precipitation extremes and related processes inhibit decision making. Existing state-of-the art approaches for uncertainty quantification use Bayesian methods to weight ESMs based on a balance of historical skills and future consensus. Here we propose an empirical Bayesian model that extends an existing skill and consensus based weighting framework and examine the hypothesis that nontrivial, physics-guided measures of ESM skill can help produce reliable probabilistic characterization of climate extremes. Specifically, the model leverages knowledge of physical relationships between temperature, atmospheric moisture capacity, and extreme precipitation intensity to iteratively weight and combine ESMs and estimate probability distributions of return levels. Out-of-sample validation suggests that the proposed Bayesian method, which incorporates physics-guidance, has the potential to derive reliable precipitation projections, although caveats remain and the gain is not uniform across all cases.","[Kodra, Evan; Chen, Stone; Ganguly, Auroop Ratan] RisQ Inc, 55 Magazine St 6B, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Bhatia, Udit] Indian Inst Technol, Civil Engn, Gandhinagar 382355, India; [Chatterjee, Snigdhansu] Univ Minnesota, Sch Stat, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Ganguly, Auroop Ratan] Northeastern Univ, Civil & Environm Engn, Boston, MA 02115 USA",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Gandhinagar; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; Northeastern University,"Bhatia, U (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol, Civil Engn, Gandhinagar 382355, India.",bhatia.u@iitgn.ac.in,,"Chatterjee, Snigdhansu/0000-0002-7986-0470","NSF Expeditions award [1029711]; NSF SBIR award [1621576]; NSF Big Data award [1447587]; NSF Cyber SEES award [1442728]; NASA AMES; NSF Division Of Mathematical Sciences [1622483, 1737918]",NSF Expeditions award; NSF SBIR award(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Engineering (ENG)); NSF Big Data award; NSF Cyber SEES award; NASA AMES(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); NSF Division Of Mathematical Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"Funding was provided by NSF Expeditions award number 1029711 (Kodra, Chatterjee, Ganguly), NSF SBIR award number 1621576 (Kodra), NSF Big Data award number 1447587 (Ganguly), NSF Cyber SEES award 1442728 (Ganguly), a grant from NASA AMES (Ganguly), and NSF Division Of Mathematical Sciences awards numbers 1622483 (Chatterjee) and 1737918 (Chatterjee).

This multifaceted relationship has been assessed in several regional studies, but spatially resolved, large-scale analyses are largely missing so far. Here we estimate recent changes in growth of 5800 beech trees (Fagus sylvatica L.) from 324 sites, representing the full geographic and climatic range of species. Future growth trends were predicted considering state-of-the-art climate scenarios. The validated models indicate growth declines across large region of the distribution in recent decades, and project severe future growth declines ranging from -20% to more than -50% by 2090, depending on the region and climate change scenario (i.e. CMIP6 SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5). Forecasted forest productivity losses are most striking towards the southern distribution limit of Fagus sylvatica, in regions where persisting atmospheric high-pressure systems are expected to increase drought severity. The projected 21(st) century growth changes across Europe indicate serious ecological and economic consequences that require immediate forest adaptation. Tree ring data from a network of beech tree stands across Europe show evidence for a recent growth decline from 1986-2016 and project up to 50% growth reductions in some areas of Europe with future climate change.","[del Castillo, Edurne Martinez;

In our work as a Shakespeare scholar-turned-public-humanist and a climate scientist, we have created a methodology that allows researchers and communities to co-produce knowledge by co-producing narratives. We combine principles from emerging climate storylines research with collaborative storytelling inspired by William Shakespeare's plays and theatrical practices. Shakespeare's plays spark collaborations and interpretations, in part, because of how Shakespeare leaves gaps in the narrative. These gaps allow others to enter as collaborators, creating a cognitive ecology that fosters knowledge and action among all engaged. Integrating these methods into climate storyline-making offers a radical paradigm: it upends the scientist's role as the focal storyteller and expert, and fosters, instead, partnership, equity, and a co-exploration of multiple uncertainties. It is time for researchers to cede control to a cognitive ecology of collaborative action.

In doing so, we elaborate on the effects of the arts on people's emotional connections to the landscape; the memories, beliefs, meaning and knowledge they associate with the landscape; and the expression of people's attachments through actions. We draw on 28 walking interviews and three group discussions which were conducted in Pingjum, a village along the Dutch Wadden Sea coast. A key feature in Pingjum's landscape is the Gouden Halsband, a late medieval dike surrounding the village. Recently, the area around Pingjum (including this dike) was designated as a potential location for the construction of a new windfarm. In our study, we found that the arts in Pingjum fuelled people's emotional connection to their (coastal) landscape and the Gouden Halsband, enhanced their knowledge of both and triggered them to reflect on the meanings they assign to them. In addition, the arts enhanced people's awareness and stimulated their assessment of the windfarm plans. The arts framed people's interpretation of the windfarm plans, mainly bringing potential negative impacts on the landscape to their attention. In this way, the arts encouraged action, stimulating both efforts to preserve the Gouden Halsband and protests against the proposed windfarm plans.","[van der Vaart, Gwenda; van Hoven, Bettina; Huigen, Paulus P.

Here, we establish the basis for using Abies guatemalensis Rehder (Pinaceae) for climate reconstruction in Central America. Annual crossdating in this montane species is demonstrated at high-elevation sites in the Sierra de los Cuchumatanes in western Guatemala. We find that ring width is most strongly influenced by early growing season moisture conditions, controlled by late dry season rainfall, and negatively correlated with growing season temperature. Our chronology is also significantly negatively correlated with eastern tropical Pacific sea surface temperature anomalies. Our confirmation of annual chronology and the identification of a climatic signal in this species now allow its use in local and regional paleoclimate reconstructions, as well as ecological studies.","[Anchukaitis, Kevin J.; Martin-Fernandez, Javier; Dell, Malcolm; Chopp, Christopher; Castellanos, Edwin J.] Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Anchukaitis, Kevin J.] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Geol & Geophys, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [Taylor, Matthew J.] Univ Denver, Denver, CO 80208 USA; [Pons, Diego; Castellanos, Edwin J.] Univ Valle Guatemala, Guatemala City, Guatemala; [Dell, Malcolm] Cooper Union Adv Sci & Art, New York, NY USA",Columbia University; Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution; University of Denver; Universidad del Valle de Guatemala,"Anchukaitis, KJ (corresponding author), Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Geol & Geophys, 266 Woods Hole Rd,MS 22, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.",kja@ldeo.columbia.edu,,"Castellanos, Edwin/0000-0001-9775-0518",United States National Science Foundation (NSF) Geography and Spatial Science Program [BCS 0852652]; United States Department of State; Columbia University's Earth Institute; Columbia University,United States National Science Foundation (NSF) Geography and Spatial Science Program(National Science Foundation (NSF)); United States Department of State; Columbia University's Earth Institute; Columbia University,This research is funded by a grant from the United States National Science Foundation (NSF) Geography and Spatial Science Program (BCS 0852652).

We investigated how this redistribution of water affects the global climate, focusing on its effects on near-surface temperatures. Using the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM) coupled to the Community Land Model (CLM), we compared global simulations with and without irrigation. To approximate actual irrigation amounts and locations as closely as possible, we used national-level census data of agricultural water withdrawals, disaggregated with maps of croplands, areas equipped for irrigation, and climatic water deficits. We further investigated the sensitivity of our results to the timing and spatial extent of irrigation. We found that irrigation alters climate significantly in some regions, but has a negligible effect on global-average near-surface temperatures. Irrigation cooled the northern mid-latitudes; the central and southeast United States, portions of southeast China and portions of southern and southeast Asia cooled by similar to 0.5 K averaged over the year. Much of northern Canada, on the other hand, warmed by similar to 1 K. The cooling effect of irrigation seemed to be dominated by indirect effects like an increase in cloud cover, rather than by direct evaporative cooling. The regional effects of irrigation were as large as those seen in previous studies of land cover change, showing that changes in land management can be as important as changes in land cover in terms of their climatic effects. Our results were sensitive to the area of irrigation, but were insensitive to the details of irrigation timing and delivery.","[Sacks, William J.] Univ Wisconsin, Ctr Sustainabil & Global Environm, Madison, WI 53726 USA; [Cook, Benjamin I.] Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Geol Observ, Palisades, NY 10964 USA; [Cook, Benjamin I.] NASA, Goddard Inst Space Studies, New York, NY 10025 USA; [Buenning, Nikolaus] Univ Colorado, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Buenning, Nikolaus] Univ Colorado, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Levis, Samuel] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Climate & Global Dynam Div, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [Helkowski, Joseph H.] Earth Tech, Miami, FL 33178 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; Columbia University; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA,"Sacks, WJ (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Ctr Sustainabil & Global Environm, 1710 Univ Ave, Madison, WI 53726 USA.",wsacks@wisc.edu,"Cook, Benjamin I/H-2265-2012; Sacks, Bill/ABG-2438-2020",,National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Global Change Postdoctoral Program; Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Studies student fellowship; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Climate and Global Change Program; National Science Foundation,National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship(National Science Foundation (NSF)); National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Global Change Postdoctoral Program(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Studies student fellowship; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Climate and Global Change Program(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"We thank NCAR's Advanced Study Program for sponsoring the Art of Climate Modeling summer colloquium, where we began this work.

Understanding environmental effects on spring bloom dynamics is important for predicting future climate responses and for managing aquatic systems. We analyzed long-term phytoplankton data from one coastal and one offshore station in the Baltic Sea to uncover trends in timing, composition and size of the spring bloom and its correlations to environmental variables. There was a general trend of earlier phytoplankton blooms by 1-2 weeks over the last 20 years, associated with more sunshine and less windy conditions. High water temperatures were associated with earlier blooms of diatoms and dinoflagellates that dominate the spring bloom, and decreased diatom bloom magnitude. Overall bloom timing, however, was buffered by a temperature and ice related shift in composition from early blooming diatoms to later blooming dinoflagellates and the autotrophic ciliate Mesodinium rubrum. Such counteracting responses to climate change highlight the importance of both general and taxon-specific investigations. We hypothesize that the predicted earlier blooms of diatoms and dinoflagellates as a response to the expected temperature increase in the Baltic Sea might also be counteracted by more clouds and stronger winds. A shift from early blooming and fast sedimenting diatoms to later blooming groups of dinoflagellates and M. rubrum at higher temperatures during the spring period is expected to increase energy transfers to pelagic secondary production and decrease spring bloom inputs to the benthic system, resulting in lower benthic production and reduced oxygen consumption.","[Hjerne, Olle; Hajdu, Susanna; Larsson, Ulf; Downing, Andrea S.; Winder, Monika] Stockholm Univ, Dept Ecol Environm & Plant Sci, Stockholm, Sweden; [Downing, Andrea S.] Stockholm Univ, Stockholm Resilience Ctr, Stockholm, Sweden",Stockholm University; Stockholm University,"Winder, M (corresponding author), Stockholm Univ, Dept Ecol Environm & Plant Sci, Stockholm, Sweden.",monika.winder@su.se,"downing, andrea s./H-4465-2012","downing, andrea s./0000-0002-5206-9355",Stockholm University's Strategic Marine Environmental Research Program on Baltic Ecosystem Adaptive Management (BEAM); BONUS BIO-C3 project; BONUS (Art 185) - EU; BONUS (Art 185) - Swedish Research Council FORMAS,Stockholm University's Strategic Marine Environmental Research Program on Baltic Ecosystem Adaptive Management (BEAM); BONUS BIO-C3 project; BONUS (Art 185) - EU; BONUS (Art 185) - Swedish Research Council FORMAS(Swedish Research Council Formas),"This study was financially supported by Stockholm University's Strategic Marine Environmental Research Program on Baltic Ecosystem Adaptive Management (BEAM) and received funding from the BONUS BIO-C3 project, and also supported by BONUS (Art 185), funded jointly by the EU and the Swedish Research Council FORMAS.",,79,35,35,8,38,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-7745,,FRONT MAR SCI,Front.

Drawing upon literature of emotional geography, social dimensions of climate change, and public participation, this study illustrates the role of emotion in a public participation exercise in Londonderry, Vermont - a small town struggling to recover from Tropical Storm Irene. As a member of an interdisciplinary design team that facilitated a workshop on flood resilience and adaptive design in Londonderry, I witnessed an innovative exercise that employed storytelling, emotion, and body movement. This activity, which I term 'emotive-physical storytelling', created a foundation of trust and interpersonal connection that facilitators and residents built upon to plan for flood resiliency. Contrary to recent accounts of the ways that negative emotional responses can cause inaction in the face of climate change, this paper argues that creative public participation methods can generate positive emotions such as hope, responsibility, care, and solidarity. Such emotions have the potential to inspire adaptive action and produce transformative change. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

However, with changing climate and air pollution levels, solar resources may no longer be stable over time and undergo substantial decadal changes. Observational records covering the past decades confirm long-term changes in this quantity. Here we examine how the latest generation of climate models used for the 5th IPCC report projects potential changes in surface solar radiation over the coming decades, and how this may affect, in combination with the expected greenhouse warming, solar power output from photovoltaic (PV) systems. For this purpose, projections up to the mid 21st century from 39 state of the art climate models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) are analysed globally and for selected key regions with major solar power production capacity. The large model ensemble allows to assess the degree of consistency of their projections. Models are largely consistent in the sign of the projected changes in solar radiation under cloud-free conditions as well as surface temperatures over most of the globe, while still reasonably consistent over a considerable part of the globe in the sign of changes in cloudiness and associated changes in solar radiation. A first order estimate of the impact of solar radiation and temperature changes on energy yields of PV systems under the RPC8.5 scenario indicates statistically significant decreases in PV outputs in large parts of the world, but notable exceptions with positive trends in large parts of Europe, South-East of North America and the South-East of China. Projected changes between 2006 and 2049 under the RCP8.5 scenario overall are on the order of 1%/decade for horizontal planes, but may be larger for tilted or tracked planes as well as on shorter (decadal) timescales.

Previous work has shown that land cover change can significantly impact key climate variables, including turbulent fluxes, precipitation, and surface temperature. However, fewer studies have investigated how intensive crop management can impact background climate conditions, such as the strength of land-atmosphere coupling and evaporative regime. We conduct sensitivity experiments using a state-of-the-art climate model with modified vegetation characteristics to represent modern crop cover and management, using observed crop-specific leaf area indexes and calendars. We quantify changes in land-atmosphere interactions and climate over intensively cultivated regions situated at transitions between moisture- and energy-limited conditions. Results show that modern intensive agriculture has significant and geographically varying impacts on regional evaporative regimes and background climate conditions. Over the northern Great Plains, modern crop intensity increases the model simulated precipitation and soil moisture, weakening hydrologic coupling by increasing surface water availability and reducing moisture limits on evapotranspiration. In the U.S. Midwest, higher growing season evapotranspiration, coupled with winter and spring rainfall declines, reduces regional soil moisture, while crop albedo changes also reduce net surface radiation. This results overall in reduced dependency of regional surface temperature on latent heat fluxes. In central Asia, a combination of reduced net surface energy and enhanced pre-growing season precipitation amplify the energy-limited evaporative regime. These results highlight the need for improved representations of agriculture in global climate models to better account for regional climate impacts and interactions with other anthropogenic forcings.","[McDermid, Sonali Shukla] NYU, Dept Environm Studies, New York, NY 10003 USA; [McDermid, Sonali Shukla; Montes, Carlo; Cook, Benjamin I.; Puma, Michael J.; Kiang, Nancy Y.; Aleinov, Igor] NASA, Goddard Inst Space Studies, New York, NY 10025 USA; [Cook, Benjamin I.; Puma, Michael J.; Aleinov, Igor] Columbia Univ, Ctr Climate Syst Res, New York, NY USA; [Puma, Michael J.] Columbia Univ, Ctr Climate & Life, New York, NY USA",New York University; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; Columbia University; Columbia University,"McDermid, SS (corresponding author), NYU, Dept Environm Studies, New York, NY 10003 USA.;McDermid, SS (corresponding author), NASA, Goddard Inst Space Studies, New York, NY 10025 USA.",sps246@nyu.edu,"Cook, Benjamin I/H-2265-2012","Montes, Carlo/0000-0003-4828-5589; Aleinov, Igor/0000-0002-7827-228X; McDermid, Sonali/0000-0002-4244-772X","NASA Modeling, Analysis, and Prediction program; NASA [NASA 80NSSC17K0265]; NASA","NASA Modeling, Analysis, and Prediction program(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA))","All data used in this study are publically accessible.

Historically, local architecture was based on people's experience and knowledge. It was sympathetic to the climate and environment. After a period of building design that ignored the local climate, more passive buildings, low energy buildings, and zero buildings have come into focus because of the environmental pollution caused by an excessive use of fossil fuels. The historic architectural style in Dezful includes underground shelters, 5-12 m deep, to improve the indoor climate conditions in this hot and semi humid city. This type of underground shelter, known as a Shavadoon, is regarded as one of the passive energy strategies to seek temperature comfort using the earth annual temperature stability and natural ventilation. The present study was conducted in a house owned by Mohammad Reza Ghamsari. The house was used to test the accuracy of numerical simulation of the temperature and air flow within the Shavadoon spaces. Temperature contours, streamlines, and other related findings are reported. The results show that space conditioning costs could be cut and adequate comfort could be derived using such passive heating and cooling systems. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

We do not yet know, however, how faculty draw on disciplines and disciplinary boundaries in their academic identity work or how they construct their academic identities and convey those identities to others. We explore these questions through 100 in-depth interviews with faculty from 34 arts and sciences disciplines at a private, Research 1 university. We show how boundary battles over symbolic resources associated with disciplines contribute to faculty identity work. We identify four types of identity work arts and sciences faculty use: foregrounding disciplinarity, resisting disciplinary identities associated with administratively assigned departmental homes, emphasizing scientist identities, and pursuing question-oriented identities. Finally, we show how beliefs that disciplinary differences reflect underlying distinctions between kinds of people shore up the importance of disciplinary divisions, even in a university setting that provides material support for interdisciplinarity. We use these results to argue that even in institutional settings that provide support for interdisciplinarity, disciplinary boundaries may remain central by providing important symbolic resources.","[Simula, Brandy L.] Ctr Posit Sexual, Burbank, CA USA; [Scott, Tracy L.] Emory Univ, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA",Emory University,"Simula, BL (corresponding author), Georgia Inst Technol, 237 Uncle Heinie Way, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.",brandylsimulaphd@gmail.com,,,,,,,88,0,0,6,10,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",2329-4965,2329-4973,,SOC CURR,Soc.

Studies that examine historical species responses over large geographic and climatic distances may provide insights into the temporal and spatial complexities underlying forest vulnerabilities to climate change. We analyzed annual tree-ring data collected from 56 white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss) populations across the species' distribution in Yukon, Canada. Regional growth patterns were identified and correlation and response functions were computed to determine primary climatic influences on growth within each region. The temporal stability of climate-growth relationships was also tested in regions with sufficient climate records. Key results showed that white spruce radial growth shows strong geographic patterns across Yukon, likely reflecting large-scale climatic influences on growth. Drought appears to be a primary limitation to white spruce growth across much of southern Yukon, whereas snowfall and summer temperatures may be more important limitations in other regions. Spruce populations growing at high-elevations in central Yukon may be changing their climatic sensitivity over time and are converging with low-elevation populations in terms of climate-growth relationships. The considerable spatial and temporal complexity of climate-growth responses suggest that climate change will have varying implications for white spruce growth across Yukon. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Driven by river flows, conventional hydropower is exposed to the vagaries of weather and climate, motivating drought and climate change hydropower impact studies at large spatial scales. Here we review methods of climate-driven hydropower simulation at large spatial scales, specifically multi-basin regions to global. We identify four types of approach based on complexity of tools and richness of data applied to the problem. Since the earliest attempts to model climate-driven hydropower at continental scale almost two decades ago, the field has transitioned from one of scientific curiosity to practical application, with studies increasingly motivated by the need to inform power grid expansion planning and operation. As the hydrological and water management models used in large-scale hydropower studies become more sophisticated, new opportunities will emerge to study the impacts of changing hydropower on power system reliability and performance at large power grid scale. To grasp these opportunities, the water resources community must continue to enhance data and models for representing river flows and anthropogenic water use and management at subcontinental to global scales.","[Turner, Sean W.

However, little is known on the effects of combined change in temperature, CO2 concentration, and extreme events on barley grain quality and how capable are the current process-based crop models capture the signal of climate change on quality traits. Here in this review, we initially explored the response of quality traits of barley to heat, drought, and CO2 concentration from experiential studies. Next, we reviewed the state of the art of some of the current modeling approaches to capture grain quality. Lastly, we suggested possible opportunities to improve current models for tracking the detailed quality traits of barley. Heat and drought stress increase the protein concentration which has a negative effect on malting quality. The rise of CO2 concentration significantly reduces the grain protein, again resulting in a decline of the malting and brewing quality since the nitrogen concentration of grains needs to be kept at a specific level. The current crop models that simulate barley grain quality are limited to simulation of grain nitrogen concentration, size, and number in response to climate extremes and CO2. Nevertheless, crop models fail to account for the complex interactions between the conflicting effects of rising temperatures and droughts as well as increasing CO2 concentrations on grain protein. They have mainly adapted wheat models that cannot capture barley's protein composition and whole grain malting quality. Implementation of experiments from gene to canopy scales which are explicitly designed to detect the interactions among environmental variables on detailed quality traits and couple the remote sensing plus data-driven approaches to crop models are possible opportunities to improve modeling of barley grain quality. The development of modeling routines can capture the detailed grain quality provide valuable tools for forming climate adaptive strategies. Equally important, they can guide breeding programs to develop climate-resilient but high-quality barley genotypes.","[Rezaei, Ehsan Eyshi; Zhu, Wanxue] Leibniz Ctr Agr Landscape Res, Muncheberg, Germany; [Rojas, Luis Vargas; Cammarano, Davide] Purdue Univ, Dept Agron, W Lafayette, IN 47906 USA; [Zhu, Wanxue] Univ Gottingen, Dept Crop Sci, D-37075 Gottingen, Germany; [Cammarano, Davide] Aarhus Univ, Ctr Circular Bioecon CBIO, Dept Agroecol, iClimate, DK-8830 Tjele, Denmark",Leibniz Zentrum fur Agrarlandschaftsforschung (ZALF); Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; University of Gottingen; Aarhus University,"Cammarano, D (corresponding author), Aarhus Univ, Ctr Circular Bioecon CBIO, Dept Agroecol, iClimate, DK-8830 Tjele, Denmark.",davide.cammarano@agro.au.dk,"朱, 婉雪/F-9506-2017","朱, 婉雪/0000-0002-2635-0688; Vargas Rojas, Luis/0000-0001-8610-9901; Eyshi Rezaei, Ehsan/0000-0003-2603-8034",,,,,127,0,0,24,24,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0378-4290,1872-6852,,FIELD CROP RES,Field Crop.

We define climate radicalization as a process of growing willingness to pursue and/or support radical changes in society that are in conflict with or could pose a threat to the status quo or democratic legal order to reach climate goals. We describe how perceptions of unfairness can play a pivotal role in processes of climate change related radicalization. Without taking any position or judgment regarding climate concerns and associated actions, we suggest that although these behaviors drive many people to participate in peaceful climate protest, they may also lead others to radicalize into breaking the law to achieve their climate goals, possibly in violent ways. This process of climate radicalization, we argue, can be driven by people perceiving certain situations to be blatantly unfair. Specifically, we discuss how radical attitudes and behaviors can be products of perceived unfairness stemming from the past, the future, the immediate social environments of perceivers, as well as those that are spatially distant from them. We further argue that because radicalization processes are shaped by an interaction between individuals and movements, on the one hand, and societal actors and developments, on the other, they tend to develop in non-linear and dynamic ways. We therefore propose that climate radicalization is a (1) dynamic, contingent, and non-linear process, often of an escalating (and sometimes de-escalating) kind, (2) that develops over time, (3) through various interactions between individuals and their contexts, and (4) in which people and groups move back and forth from peaceful protest, through disobedient and unlawful methods, to violent actions. Implications, strengths, and limitations of our model are discussed.","[Jansma, Amarins; van den Bos, Kees] Univ Utrecht, Dept Psychol, Utrecht, Netherlands; [van den Bos, Kees] Univ Utrecht, Sch Law, Utrecht, Netherlands; [de Graaf, Beatrice A.] Univ Utrecht, Dept Hist & Art Hist, Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University; Utrecht University; Utrecht University,"Jansma, A (corresponding author), Univ Utrecht, Dept Psychol, Utrecht, Netherlands.",a.jansma@uu.nl,,,Netherlands Research Council (NWO) [STEVIN.2018.1],Netherlands Research Council (NWO)(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)),Funding The research leading to these results was partly funded by the Netherlands Research Council (NWO) under project number STEVIN.2018.1.,,158,0,0,5,5,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-1078,,,FRONT PSYCHOL,Front.

At present, the necessary interdisciplinary collaboration is greatly limited by the difficulties in discovering, sharing, and integrating climatic data due to the tremendously increasing data size. This paper discusses the methods and techniques for solving the inter-related problems encountered when transmitting, processing, and serving metadata for heterogeneous Earth System Observation and Modeling (ESOM) data. A cyberinfrastructure-based solution is proposed to enable effective cataloging and two-step search on big climatic datasets by leveraging state-of-the-art web service technologies and crawling the existing data centers. To validate its feasibility, the big dataset served by UCAR THREDDS Data Server (TDS), which provides Petabyte-level ESOM data and updates hundreds of terabytes of data every day, is used as the case study dataset. A complete workflow is designed to analyze the metadata structure in TDS and create an index for data parameters. A simplified registration model which defines constant information, delimits secondary information, and exploits spatial and temporal coherence in metadata is constructed. The model derives a sampling strategy for a high-performance concurrent web crawler bot which is used to mirror the essential metadata of the big data archive without overwhelming network and computing resources. The metadata model, crawler, and standard-compliant catalog service form an incremental search cyberinfrastructure, allowing scientists to search the big climatic datasets in near real-time. The proposed approach has been tested on UCAR TDS and the results prove that it achieves its design goal by at least boosting the crawling speed by 10 times and reducing the redundant metadata from 1.85 gigabytes to 2.2 megabytes, which is a significant breakthrough for making the current most non-searchable climate data servers searchable.","[Gaigalas, Juozas; Di, Liping; Sun, Ziheng] George Mason Univ, Ctr Spatial Informat Sci & Syst, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA",George Mason University,"Di, LP (corresponding author), George Mason Univ, Ctr Spatial Informat Sci & Syst, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.",juozasgaigalas@gmail.com; ldi@gmu.edu; zsun@gmu.edu,,,"National Science Foundation [AGS-1740693, CNS-1739705]",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This research was funded by the National Science Foundation, grant number AGS-1740693 & CNS-1739705; PI: Liping Di.",,79,5,5,2,11,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2220-9964,,ISPRS INT GEO-INF,ISPRS Int.

However, it poses major difficulties such as poor driving range, high price, and troublesome recharging which demotivate their consumers. These problems have arisen due to the stringent constraints on the EV battery packs. Moreover, the battery capacity degrades overtime and this degradation defines the battery lifetime and shortens the driving range further. The driving range and battery lifetime are mainly influenced by the route behavior, electric motor, and Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) power consumption. In this paper, we present a novel jointly optimized eco-friendly automotive climate control and navigation system methodology. The integration between these two systems helps us to optimize the HVAC utilization and route for better battery lifetime and driving range. We have compared the performance of our methodology with the state-of-the-arts for different weather and route behavior. We have seen upto 24% improvement in battery lifetime and 17% reduction in energy consumption.","[Vatanparvar, Korosh; Al Faruque, Mohammad Abdullah] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Irvine, CA 92697 USA",University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Vatanparvar, K (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",kvatanpa@uci.edu; alfaruqu@uci.edu,,,,,,,37,0,0,0,1,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2375-8317,,978-1-5090-1772-0,ACM IEEE INT CONF CY,,,2016,,,,,,,,,,,,10,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Software Engineering; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Engineering,BG0MO,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000386348200014,View Full Record in Web of Science

The paper also includes information about the likely synergy effects (co-benefits) current and new climate change polices and mitigation options might have on mercury emissions reductions in the future. The review concludes that reductions of mercury emission from anthropogenic sources worldwide would need to be introduced as soon as possible in order to assure lowering the adverse impact of climate change on human health. Scientific information currently available, however, is not in the position to clearly answer whether climate change will increase or decrease the risk of exposure to mercury in the Arctic.

This study reviews the effective decarbonization strategies in the context of Europe's climate neutral vision. Initially, the study analyzes the reasons for ever-increasing emissions and investigates the perception of decarbonization in line with various influencing factors such as population size, economic growth, energy intensity, emission intensity, innovation, affordability and time. Subsequently, an in-depth qualitative analysis is performed to force out the challenges that Europe faces in decarbonizing the heating sector from the aspects, such as using clean energy resources, effective heat energy conversion and management approaches. Sustainable approaches and practices are proposed to mitigate carbonization and to promote carbon sink in line with the major problems associated with various sectors such as building, energy, industry and transportation sector. Furthermore, the roles of digitalization in decarbonization are explored and the inherent challenges are also discussed. This study also reviews various decarbonization policies that can direct the governments' action to effectively make a transition towards a climate-neutral society. The key findings highlight that solar energy utilization in small-scale is relatively not preferable for heat energy conversion in Europe due to climatic conditions, while district heating network with bio-and geothermal energy resource highly favors clean heat transformation scenario. In addition, 3D printing has a prodigious role to reduce building lifecycle emissions and hybrid policies as well as reward-based policies yields better outcomes. Promoting hydrogen utilization and carbon capture storage and utilization technologies can pivot climate neutrality in the sectors that are difficult to decarbonize. On the other hand, it can be observed that more focus is provided to reduce emissions and significantly less attention is focused on carbon sink.","[Elavarasan, Rajvikram Madurai] Thiagarajar Coll Engn, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Madurai 625015, Tamil Nadu, India; [Elavarasan, Rajvikram Madurai; Khan, Irfan Ahmad] Texas A&M Univ, Clean & Resilient Energy Syst CARES Lab, Galveston, TX 77553 USA; [Pugazhendhi, Rishi] Nestlives Private Ltd, Res & Dev Div Power & Energy, Chennai 600091, Tamil Nadu, India; [Irfan, Muhammad] Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Management & Econ, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Irfan, Muhammad] Beijing Inst Technol, Ctr Energy & Environm Policy Res, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Irfan, Muhammad] ILMA Univ, Dept Business Adm, Karachi, Pakistan; [Mihet-Popa, Lucian] Ostfold Univ Coll, Fac Elect Engn, NO-1757 Halden, Norway; [Campana, Pietro Elia] Malardalen Univ, Dept Sustainable Energy Syst, SE-72123 Vasteras, Sweden",Thiagarajar College of Engineering; Texas A&M University System; Beijing Institute of Technology; Beijing Institute of Technology; Ostfold University College; Malardalen University,"Elavarasan, RM (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Clean & Resilient Energy Syst Lab, Galveston, TX 77553 USA.",rajvikram787@gmail.com; rishi2000.p@gmail.com; irfan@ncepu.edu.cn; lucian.mihet@hiof.no; irfankhan@tamu.edu; pietro.campana@mdh.se,"Pugazhendhi, Rishi/GON-4476-2022; Mihet, Lucian/H-7502-2012; Irfan, Muhammad/AAL-9371-2020; Khan, Irfan/J-1241-2019","Pugazhendhi, Rishi/0000-0001-6831-6288; Mihet, Lucian/0000-0002-4556-2774; Irfan, Muhammad/0000-0003-1446-583X; Khan, Irfan/0000-0003-2484-6169",,,,,181,23,23,66,71,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",1364-0321,1879-0690,,RENEW SUST ENERG REV,Renew.

The local climatic conditions, with clear skies for most of the year, require the integration of different shading and re-directing systems with the existing envelope and rooms' layout. Results show that the dynamic modelling is a powerful and 'creative' tool in the designer's hands, which helps to inform about the choice of the most appropriate technological solutions and on their architectural integration. Comparison with mostly used static daylight metrics, such as the average Daylight Factor (aDF) and the Uniformity Ratio (UR), reveals a contrast with what would be suggested if considering these metrics alone, as prescribed by the Italian legislation. These outcomes rebate the need of performing more accurate and dynamic daylight simulations using recorded (i.e., varying) rather than fixed sky conditions to correctly inform the design process.","[Costanzo, Vincenzo] Univ Reading, Sch Built Environm, Reading RG6 6AW, Berks, England; [Evola, Gianpiero; Marletta, Luigi; Nascone, Fabiana Pistone] Univ Catania, Dept Elect Elect & Comp Engn, Viale A Doria 6, I-95125 Catania, Italy",University of Reading; University of Catania,"Costanzo, V (corresponding author), Univ Reading, Sch Built Environm, Reading RG6 6AW, Berks, England.",v.costanzo@reading.ac.uk; gevola@unict.it; luigi.marletta@dii.unict.it; fabiana.pistonenascone@gmail.com,"; Costanzo, Vincenzo/D-3873-2016","Evola, Gianpiero/0000-0003-1892-5960; Costanzo, Vincenzo/0000-0002-8426-1835",,,,,33,15,15,1,5,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,AUG,2018,8,,,,,,2653,10.3390/su10082653,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su10082653,,,19,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GW3CI,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000446767700069,View Full Record in Web of Science

To combat this phenomenon in colder climates, architects have turned to using double skin facades. These facades comprise of: a completely transparent external facade: an internal skin: and an air layer between the two. Research on the performance of double skin facades mostly considers cold and moderate climates. In addition, data collection is normally based on simulations, rather than actual field measurements. In this paper a building with double skin facade was monitored for 2 weeks in summer and 2 weeks in winter in the hot arid climate of Iran, in order to observe the behaviour of the facade both in hot and cold conditions. Additionally, simulations were performed on the case study building with and without double skin facade, to assess the effectiveness of the facade. The results revealed that the temperature difference between the outer skin, the inner skin and the cavity can significantly save heating energy in winter. To reduce the cooling loads in summer it is essential to introduce additional techniques such as night ventilation and installation of shading devices for the cavity. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, the authors pursue a novel approach by using discriminant analysis to enhance the distinction between past and future climates from state-of-the-art climate model simulations. The method is based on multivariate fingerprints that are defined in the space of several prominent climate indices representing the thermal, dynamical, and hygric aspects of climate change. Attribution is carried out by means of a Bayesian classification approach. The leading discriminant function accounts for more than 99% of total discriminability, with temperature variables, extratropical precipitation, and extratropical circulation modes mainly contributing to the discriminant power. The misclassification probability between probability density functions of past and future climates is substantially reduced by the discriminant analysis: from >50% to <15%. Since the mid-1980s, the observed anomalies of the considered climate indices are more or less consistently attributed to a climate under strong radiative forcing, projected for the first half of the twenty-first century. The authors also assess the sensitivity of their results to different emissions scenarios from the CMIP3 and CMIP5 multimodel ensembles, seasons, prior probabilities for the early twenty-first-century climate, estimates of the observational error, low-pass filters, variable compositions, group numbers, and reference data.","[Paeth, Heiko; Pollinger, Felix; Ring, Christoph] Univ Wurzburg, Inst Geog & Geol, Wurzburg, Germany",University of Wurzburg,"Paeth, H (corresponding author), Univ Wurzburg, Inst Geog & Geol, Wurzburg, Germany.",heiko.paeth@uni-wuerzburg.de,,"Pollinger, Felix/0000-0002-9519-2433",,,,,53,3,3,0,11,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693, UNITED STATES",0894-8755,1520-0442,,J CLIMATE,J.

These images appear on or take the form of coins, jewels, vase paintings, and sculptures. Building on the major scholarly work on the subject since the late 19th century, I suggest that the iconography of Heracles shows the influence of new religious and philosophical conceptions of his myth, in particular relating to Pythagoreanism, Orphism, and mystery cults, as well as the intellectual climate of 5th century Athens. Rather than appearing as an example of infinite toil and excess in the manner of earlier literary and iconographic representations, Heracles is presented in the Classical period as a model of virtue and self-restraint and a symbol of the triumph of merit over adversity and divine persecution.","[Dourado Lopes, Antonio Orlando] Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais,"Lopes, AOD (corresponding author), Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil.",douradolopes@letras.ufmg.br,,,,,,,67,0,0,0,2,"UNIV NAC LA PLATA, FAC HUMANIDADES & CIENCIAS EDUC",LA PLATA,"CALLE 48 E-6 & 7,PISO 5, OF 517, LA PLATA, BUENOS AIRES 1900, ARGENTINA",0328-1205,,,SYNTHESIS-LA PLATA,Synth.-La Plata,DEC,2018,2,,,,,,e042,10.24215/1851779Xe042,http://dx.doi.org/10.24215/1851779Xe042,,,19,Classics,Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;HCI),Classics,HU7MF,,"Green Published, gold, Green Submitted",,,12/21/22,WOS:000465464800005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Climate change can significantly affect hydropower plants. One of the negative effects of climate change is the reduction of hydropower generation. Therefore, to better management of power supply and demand, the climate change effect on hydropower plants should be examined. The main purpose of this study is the prediction of future hydropower generation (2021-2050) in terms of climate change. One of the factors sensitive to climate change in hydropower plants is the amount of input flow to the reservoir. In this study, a method has been used that can increase the accuracy of flow estimation. This innovation is the use of the ANN model under the new version of the Developed Crow Search Algorithm (DCSA). This algorithm increases the accuracy of prediction by solving optimization disadvantages such as getting stuck in the optimal location, the imbalance between exploitation and exploration at different levels The results showed that the DCSA algorithm with minimum error (MSE = 1.06) and maximum correlation (R-2 = 0.88) compared to other algorithms has the best performance. The results of the prediction of climate change under RCPs scenarios showed that the average annual power generation will decrease under RCP2.6 and RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 about 10.74% and% 16.38 and 22.25% respectively. Also, the average annual power generation under scenarios RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5 by 2050 are 740.33 MW, 603.12 MW, and 585.77 MW, respectively. (C) 2021 The Author(s).

In particular, existing studies provide projections for a stationary climate representative of the end of the century, although information is demanded for the near future. Such time-slice experiments fail to account for the transient nature of climatic changes over the century. Moreover, uncertainty linked to natural climate variability is not explicitly considered in previous studies. In this study we substantially improve upon the state-of-the-art by using a sophisticated transient weather generator in combination with an integrated surface-subsurface hydrological model (Geer basin, Belgium) developed with the finite element modeling software HydroGeoSphere. This version of the weather generator enables the stochastic generation of large numbers of equiprobable climatic time series, representing transient climate change, and used to assess impacts in a probabilistic way. For the Geer basin, 30 equiprobable climate change scenarios from 2010 to 2085 have been generated for each of six different regional climate models (RCMs). Results show that although the 95% confidence intervals calculated around projected groundwater levels remain large, the climate change signal becomes stronger than that of natural climate variability by 2085. Additionally, the weather generator's ability to simulate transient climate change enabled the assessment of the likely time scale and associated uncertainty of a specific impact, providing managers with additional information when planning further investment. This methodology constitutes a real improvement in the field of groundwater projections under climate change conditions.","[Goderniaux, Pascal; Brouyere, Serge; Orban, Philippe; Dassargues, Alain] Univ Liege, Grp Hydrogeol & Environm Geol Aquapole, BE-4000 Liege, Belgium; [Blenkinsop, Stephen; Burton, Aidan; Fowler, Hayley J.] Newcastle Univ, Water Resource Syst Res Lab, Sch Civil Engn & Geosci, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England; [Goderniaux, Pascal] Natl Funds Sci Res Belgium, Brussels, Belgium",University of Liege; Newcastle University - UK,"Goderniaux, P (corresponding author), Univ Rennes 1, UMR 6118, CNRS, Rennes, France.",pascal.goderniaux@ulg.ac.be,"Fowler, Hayley J/A-9591-2013","Fowler, Hayley J/0000-0001-8848-3606; Goderniaux, Pascal/0000-0001-9625-6884; Brouyere, Serge/0000-0003-1687-1102; Blenkinsop, Stephen/0000-0003-0790-6545; Dassargues, Alain/0000-0003-2247-8390","European Union [GOCE 505,428, EVk2-CT2001-00132]; Interuniversity Attraction Pole TIMOTHY (IAP); Belgian Federal Science Policy Office (BELSPO) [P6/13]; NERC [NE/D009588/1]; EPSRC [EP/G013403/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/G013403/1] Funding Source: researchfish; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/D009588/1] Funding Source: researchfish",European Union(European Commission); Interuniversity Attraction Pole TIMOTHY (IAP); Belgian Federal Science Policy Office (BELSPO)(Belgian Federal Science Policy Office); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"This work was supported by the European Union FP6 Integrated Project AquaTerra (project GOCE 505,428) under the thematic priority sustainable development, global change, and ecosystems, the Interuniversity Attraction Pole TIMOTHY (IAP Research Project P6/13 funded by the Belgian Federal Science Policy Office (BELSPO)) and a NERC postdoctoral Fellowship award to Hayley Fowler (2006-2010) NE/D009588/1.

In recent times there has been a diverse range of art and communication media representing bees, and such work is often linked to growing concerns about potential bee declines due to a variety of factors including natural habitat fragmentation, climate change, and pesticide use in agriculture. We take a broad view of human art representations of bees to ask if the current interest in artistic representations of bees is evidenced throughout history, and in different regions of the world prior to globalisation. We observe from the earliest records of human representations in cave art over 8,000 years old through to ancient Egyptian carvings of bees and hieroglyphics, that humans have had a long-term relationship with bees especially due to the benefits of honey, wax, and crop pollination. The relationship between humans and bees frequently links to religious and spiritual representations in different parts of the world from Australia to Europe, South America and Asia. Art mediums have frequently included the visual and musical, thus showing evi-dence of being deeply rooted in how different people around the world perceive and relate to bees in nature through creative practice. In modern times, artistic representations extend to installation arts, mixed-media, and the moving image. Through the examination of the diverse inclusion of bees in human culture and art, we show that there are links between the functional benefits of associating with bees, including sourcing sweet-tasting nutritious food that could have acted, we suggest, to condition positive responses in the brain, leading to the development of an aesthetic appreciation of work representing bees.","[Prendergast, Kit S.] Curtin Univ, Sch Mol & Life Sci, Bentley, WA, Australia; [Garcia, Jair E.; McFarlane, Stuart J.; Dyer, Adrian G.] RMIT Univ, Sch Media & Commun, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia; [Howard, Scarlett R.] Deakin Univ, Ctr Integrat Ecol, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Burwood, Vic, Australia; [Ren, Zong-Xin] Chinese Acad Sci, Kunming Inst Bot, CAS Key Lab Plant Divers & Biogeog East Asia, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Dyer, Adrian G.] Monash Univ, Dept Physiol, Clayton, Vic, Australia","Curtin University; Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT); Deakin University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Kunming Institute of Botany, CAS; Monash University","Dyer, AG (corresponding author), RMIT Univ, Sch Media & Commun, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia.;Dyer, AG (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Dept Physiol, Clayton, Vic, Australia.",adrian.dyer@rmit.edu.au,"Howard, Scarlett/AAB-9278-2022","McFarlane, Stuart/0000-0001-8218-2626",Deakin University; Australian Research Council [DP160100161]; Talent Young Scientist Program of Yunnan Province [YNWR-QNBJ-2019-055],Deakin University; Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Talent Young Scientist Program of Yunnan Province,"The authors would like to thank Wolfgang Buttress, Louis Masai and Jim Vision for providing media and artwork supporting this manuscript, and Rhys Howard for discussions on the cultural significance of Australian native bees to First Nations people.

The AOGCMs, despite their relatively coarse resolution, have shown some reasonable skill in simulating the mean monsoon and precipitation variability over the South Asian monsoon region. However, considerable biases do exist with reference to the observed precipitation and also inter-model differences. The monsoon rainfall and surface flux bias with respect to the observations from the historical run for the period nominally from 1850 to 2005 are discussed in detail. Our results show that the coupled model simulations over South Asia exhibit large uncertainties from one model to the other. The analysis clearly brings out the presence of large systematic biases in coupled simulation of boreal summer precipitation, evaporation, and sea surface temperature (SST) in the Indian Ocean, often exceeding 50 % of the climatological values. Many of the biases are common to many models. Overall, the coupled models need further improvement in realistically portraying boreal summer monsoon over the South Asian monsoon region.","[Prasanna, Venkatraman] APEC Climate Ctr APCC, Climate Res Dept, 12 Centum 7 Ro, Busan 612020, South Korea",,"Prasanna, V (corresponding author), APEC Climate Ctr APCC, Climate Res Dept, 12 Centum 7 Ro, Busan 612020, South Korea.",prasa_arnala@yahoo.com,"PRASANNA, Venkatraman/AAE-6612-2022","PRASANNA, Venkatraman/0000-0001-5967-3793",,,,,49,4,4,0,12,SPRINGER BASEL AG,BASEL,"PICASSOPLATZ 4, BASEL, 4052, SWITZERLAND",0033-4553,1420-9136,,PURE APPL GEOPHYS,Pure Appl.

This climate-hydrology-assessment chain has been developed with a primary focus on applicability to a medium-sized rural basin, which has been and still is the main type of domain investigated in this context. However, impact assessment is to an increasing degree being performed at scales smaller or larger than the medium-sized rural basin. Small-scale assessment includes e.g., impacts on solute transport and urban hydrology and large-scale assessment includes e.g., climate teleconnections and continental modelling. In both cases, additional complexity is introduced in the process and additional demands are placed on all components involved, i.e., climate and hydrology models, tailoring methods, assessment principles, and tools. In this paper we provide an overview of recent progress with respect to small-and large-scale hydrological climate change impact assessment. In addition, we wish to highlight some key issues that emerged as a consequence of the scale and that need further attention from now on. While we mainly use examples from work performed in Europe for illustration, the progress generally reflects the overall state of the art and the issues considered are of a generic character.","[Olsson, Jonas; Arheimer, Berit; Donnelly, Chantal; Foster, Kean; Viklander, Maria; Yang, Wei] Swedish Meteorol & Hydrol Inst, Res & Dev Hydrol, S-60176 Norrkoping, Sweden; [Borris, Matthias; Perttu, Anna-Maria; Viklander, Maria] Lulea Univ Technol, Dept Civil Environm & Nat Resources Engn, S-97187 Lulea, Sweden; [Nikulin, Grigory] Swedish Meteorol & Hydrol Inst, Rossby Ctr, S-60176 Norrkoping, Sweden; [Persson, Magnus; Uvo, Cintia B.] Lund Univ, Dept Water Resources Engn, Box 118, S-22100 Lund, Sweden",Swedish Meteorological & Hydrological Institute; Lulea University of Technology; Swedish Meteorological & Hydrological Institute; Lund University,"Olsson, J (corresponding author), Swedish Meteorol & Hydrol Inst, Res & Dev Hydrol, S-60176 Norrkoping, Sweden.",Jonas.olsson@smhi.se; berit.arheimer@smhi.se; matthias.borris@ltu.se; chantal.donnelly@smhi.se; kean.foster@smhi.se; grigory.nikulin@smhi.se; magnus.persson@tvrl.lth.se; anna-maria.perttu@ltu.se; cintia.uvo@tvrl.lth.se; maria.viklander@ltu.se; wei.yang@smhi.se,"Persson, Magnus/A-4062-2009","Persson, Magnus/0000-0003-0013-2321; Bertacchi Uvo, Cintia/0000-0002-8497-0295; Donnelly, Chantal/0000-0002-0086-4453; Arheimer, Berit/0000-0001-8314-0735",,,,,122,39,39,0,26,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2225-1154,,CLIMATE,Climate,SEP,2016,3,,,,,,39,10.3390/cli4030039,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/cli4030039,,,24,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,DV0QY,,"gold, Green Submitted, Green Published",,,12/21/22,WOS:000382625300006,View Full Record in Web of Science

During the period from 1960 to 2005, the models well capture the WNP summer climate anomalies during most of years in different ENSO phases except the La Nia decaying summers. In the El Nio developing, El Nio decaying and La Nia developing summers, the prediction skills are high for the WNP summer monsoon index (WNPMI), with the prediction correlation larger than 0.7. The high prediction skills of the lower-tropospheric circulation during these phases are found mainly over the tropical western Pacific Ocean, South China Sea and subtropical WNP. These good predictions correspond well to their close teleconnection with ENSO and the high prediction skills of tropical SSTs. By contrast, for the La Nia decaying summers, the prediction skills are considerably low with the prediction correlation for the WNPMI near to zero and low prediction skills around the Philippines and subtropical WNP. These poor predictions relate to the weak summer anomalies of the WNPMI during the La Nia decaying years and no significant connections between the WNP lower-tropospheric circulation anomalies and the SSTs over the tropical central and eastern Pacific Ocean in observations. However, the models tend to predict an apparent anomalous cyclone over the WNP during the La Nia decaying years, indicating a linearity of the circulation response over WNP in the models prediction in comparison with that during the El Nio decaying years which differs from observations. In addition, the models show considerable capability in describing the WNP summer anomalies during the ENSO neutral summers. These anomalies are related to the positive feedback between the WNP lower-tropospheric circulation and the local SSTs. The models can capture this positive feedback but with some uncertainties from different ensemble members during the ENSO neutral summers.","[Li, Chaofan] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Ctr Monsoon Syst Res, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Lu, Riyu] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, State Key Lab Numer Modelling Atmospher Sci & Geo, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Dong, Buwen] Univ Reading, Dept Meteorol, Natl Ctr Atmospher Sci Climate, Reading, Berks, England","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); NERC National Centre for Atmospheric Science; University of Reading","Li, CF (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Ctr Monsoon Syst Res, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.",lichaofan@mail.iap.ac.cn,"Li, Chaofan/D-2735-2017","Li, Chaofan/0000-0001-5157-5427; Dong, Buwen/0000-0003-0809-7911",National Basic Research Program of China [2010CB950403]; U.K. National Centre for Atmospheric Science-Climate (NCAS-Climate) at the University of Reading; Natural Environment Research Council [ncas10009] Funding Source: researchfish,National Basic Research Program of China(National Basic Research Program of China); U.K. National Centre for Atmospheric Science-Climate (NCAS-Climate) at the University of Reading; Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),We thank two anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments.

These reanalysis products estimate the path of climate evolution that actually happened, and their use in a probabilistic context-for example, to document trends in extreme events in response to climate change-is, therefore, limited. Free runs of NWP models without data assimilation can in principle be used for the latter purpose, but such simulations are computationally expensive and are prone to systematic biases. Here we produce a high-resolution, 100-member ensemble simulation of surface atmospheric temperature over North America for the 1979-2015 period using a comprehensive spatially extended non-stationary statistical model derived from the data based on the North American Regional Reanalysis. The surrogate climate realizations generated by this model are independent from, yet nearly statistically congruent with reality.

Our study examined the barriers leading to poor gender mainstreaming and potential solutions in policies applying to gender, agriculture, climate change, food security and nutrition, in both Guatemala and Honduras. We used a case study approach to analyze the barriers to gender integration in these governments' policies. Based on semi-structured interviews and policy document analysis, we conducted a methodology based on policy mix, policy integration and policy translation. Results show that, despite having made multiple international commitments on gender issues and having gender-labeled policy and governmental gender bodies, gender mainstreaming in the policy cycle is lagging. There are multiple barriers of a different nature and at different levels that explain the lack of gender integration in the policy cycle, related and linked to: (1) policy translation from the international level; (2) structural policy barriers at national level; (3) behaviors and corruption; and (4) lack of knowledge and capacity. Solutions to address these barriers have been identified. Our results confirmed the literature findings and also introduce new elements such as the importance of considering the nature of the relationship (purely technical and/or political) between governments and international cooperation actors to evaluate the level of gender integration in policy. Furthermore, we stress that for key informants, there are no (easy) solutions to redress the poor gender integration strategies implemented. Finally, we noted that no solutions were provided relating to structural racism and machismo, religious extremism, power groups, and censorship of civil society.","[Howland, Fanny; Acosta, Mariola; Muriel, Juliana] Int Ctr Trop Agr, Cali, Colombia; [Le Coq, Jean-Francois] UMR5281 Acteurs Ressources & Terr Dans Dev ART De, Montpellier, France",Alliance; International Center for Tropical Agriculture - CIAT; Universite de Montpellier,"Howland, F (corresponding author), Int Ctr Trop Agr, Cali, Colombia.",f.c.howland@cgiar.org,,"Howland, Fanny/0000-0002-0778-2741; Acosta, Mariola/0000-0003-4456-1283","CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS)","CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS)(CGIAR)","This work was funded by the CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS), which was carried out with support from CGIAR Fund Donors and through bilateral funding agreements.

Beginning with the project Manaaki Taha Moana: Enhancing Coastal Ecosystems for Iwi and Hapu (2010-2015), hapu have collaborated with specialists to cocreate new frameworks for addressing short-term issues and long-term impacts of sea-level rise, leading to the Adaptation Strategies for Climate Change for Coastal Maori Communities project (2015-2017). Building on Maori methods such as wananga, hui, and hikoi, these approaches have strengthened localized cultural knowledge of place as the lens through which climate change and fluvial geomorphology sciences can be viewed. Developed design scenarios have encouraged beneficial relationships between culture, settlement form, ecologies, economies, and farming practices in order to better prepare Maori communities for the ecological and socioeconomic impacts of climate change.

Today this brings into being the performative shake of openings, announcements and debuts without any consequence (the novelty as novelty itself; or the simulated novelty). It creates a variety but without any differences, that is in fact - dullness. The author briefly analyses what kind of limitations and thoughtlessness we have been sentenced to by our open, critical and creative variety in the recent period. Analysis is made using the example of four main superstitions that have shaped the art worlds' intellectual climate: variety, currentness, commitment and controversy. It proves that in fact the concepts were not arguments or explanations but. problems. Problems that have not been undertaken at all. Slawomir Marzec raises the question: what is the reason to practice deconstruction, when the public (and frequently the authors too) are not able to distinguish deconstruction from frolic? Similarly: to practice the strategy of appropriation as insolent feeding (instead of subtle trance / subjectiveness). Or the desublimating abject which often appears only as the canonization of vulgarity. As a consequence it brings the danger of identification of the new cultural (and artistic) competence together with a principal hypocrisy and primitive smartness. The author formulates the newest challenges to art (and to the art world) - perceiving the reality as complex dynamical multi dimensionality, authentic pluralism, individual subjectiveness (and so on). The concept of plurality results here in the right to have art (both as an artist and a viewer) on ones own measure.

The video by the popular German YouTuber Rezo attacked the conservative Government party CDU (Christlich Demokratische Union Deutschlands) mainly for climate inaction. As a reaction to the subsequent attacks on Rezo and his video from the political establishment an alliance of popular German YouTubers formed to release a second video. In this video, the YouTubers asked their followers not to vote for the Government or the far-right parties, because they would ignore the expertise of scientists and the scientific consensus on anthropogenic climate change and therefore be unable to provide sustainable solutions for the future. This debate started as a YouTube phenomenon but quickly evolved into a national public discussion that took place across various social media channels, blogs, newspapers, and TV news, but also e.g., in discussions in schools, churches, as well as arts and cultural events. The focus of this contribution is on the formation of the heterogeneous coalition that emerged to defend and support the YouTubers. It prominently involved scientists and scientific expertise, but other forms of expertise and 'worlds of relevance' were also part of this coalition. The conceptual tools of 'networked expertise' and 'ethno-epistemic assemblages' are employed to explore expertise and credibility as well as the associations and networks of actors involved which illuminate how a single YouTuber was able to contribute to the unleashing of a national debate on climate change policy.","[Allgaier, Joachim] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Human Technol Ctr, Chair Soc & Technol, D-52062 Aachen, Germany",RWTH Aachen University,"Allgaier, J (corresponding author), Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Human Technol Ctr, Chair Soc & Technol, D-52062 Aachen, Germany.",joachim.allgaier@humtec.rwth-aachen.de,,"Allgaier, Joachim/0000-0001-7085-7315",,,,,60,10,10,6,9,COGITATIO PRESS,LISBON,"RUA FIALHO ALMEIDA 14, 2 ESQ, LISBON, 1070-129, PORTUGAL",2183-2439,,,MEDIA COMMUN-LISBON,Media Commun.,,2020,2,,,,376,386,,10.17645/mac.v8i2.2862,http://dx.doi.org/10.17645/mac.v8i2.2862,,,11,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,ML6KJ,,"Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000549572200006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Theory predicts that the benefit an organism can gain from acclimating depends on the rate at which temperatures change relative to the time it takes to induce beneficial acclimation. Here, we present a conceptual model showing how slower seasonal changes under climate change can alter species' relative performance when they differ in acclimation rate and magnitude. To test predictions from theory, we performed a microcosm experiment where we reared a mid- and a high-latitude damselfly species alone or together under the rapid seasonality currently experienced at 62 degrees N and the slower seasonality predicted for this latitude under climate change and measured larval growth and survival. To separate acclimation effects from fixed thermal responses, we simulated growth trajectories based on species' growth rates at constant temperatures and quantified how much and how fast species needed to acclimate to match the observed growth trajectories. Consistent with our predictions, the results showed that the midlatitude species had a greater capacity for acclimation than the high-latitude species. Furthermore, since acclimation occurred at a slower rate than seasonal temperature changes, the midlatitude species had a small growth advantage over the high-latitude species under the current seasonality but a greater growth advantage under the slower seasonality predicted for this latitude under climate change. In addition, the two species did not differ in survival under the current seasonality, but the midlatitude species had higher survival under the predicted climate change scenario, possibly because rates of cannibalism were lower when smaller heterospecifics were present. These findings highlight the need to incorporate acclimation rates in ecological models.","[Nilsson-Ortman, Viktor] Lund Univ, Dept Biol, Evolutionary Ecol Unit, Solvegatan 12, S-22362 Lund, Sweden; [Nilsson-Ortman, Viktor] Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 25 Willcocks St, Toronto, ON M5S 3B2, Canada; [Johansson, Frank] Uppsala Univ, Dept Ecol & Genet, Evolutionary Biol Ctr, Norbyvagen 18D, S-75236 Uppsala, Sweden",Lund University; University of Toronto; Uppsala University,"Nilsson-Ortman, V (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Dept Biol, Evolutionary Ecol Unit, Solvegatan 12, S-22362 Lund, Sweden.;Nilsson-Ortman, V (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 25 Willcocks St, Toronto, ON M5S 3B2, Canada.",viktor.j.nilsson@gmail.com,,,"Swedish Research Council Formas; Swedish Research Council, a Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council grant; Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Postdoctoral Program at the University of Toronto","Swedish Research Council Formas(Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council Formas); Swedish Research Council, a Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council grant; Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Postdoctoral Program at the University of Toronto","We thank Anssi Lauria, Locke Rowe, Lucia Kwan, Art Woods, and two anonymous reviewers for valuable comments on an earlier version of this work.

Once a synchronous state is in place, an increase in the coupling strength may lead to a bifurcation, which destroys the network. Here we show that this mechanism is present in the climate system and is responsible for major climate shifts. First, we construct a network of observed climate modes in the period 1950-2005 and investigate their collective behavior. The results indicate that this network synchronized at around 1975. The synchronous state was followed by a steady increase in the coupling strength until the system bifurcated and the network was destroyed, upon which a new climate state emerged. This significant event is known as the great climate shift of the 1970s. We have also discovered the evidence for such type of behavior in a 100-yr climate simulation using a state-of-the-art model. During this period, the network has synchronized three times. In one of the cases, the synchronous state was followed by a decrease in coupling strength and no climate shift was observed, consistent with the theory. In the other two cases, the synchronous state was followed by an increase in coupling strength and in both these cases a major shift occurred. Thus, the combination of theory, observations and model simulations consistently suggest this is a new mechanism for climate shifts.","[Tsonis, Anastasios A.; Swanson, Kyle] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Math Sci, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Milwaukee,"Tsonis, AA (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Math Sci, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA.",,,,,,,,23,0,0,0,0,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"PO BOX 128 FARRER RD, SINGAPORE 9128, SINGAPORE",,,978-981-4415-00-2,SCI CULT-NUCL STRAT,,,2012,,,,,289,297,,,,,,9,Nuclear Science & Technology,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Nuclear Science & Technology,BG8QR,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000392644500024,View Full Record in Web of Science

Specifically, it aims at assessing quantitative gains and losses in the performance of climate models caused by an enhancement in temporal and spatial resolution by evaluating the capability of different climate simulations in reproducing daily and sub-daily present precipitation dynamics over a complex orographic context such as the Alpine region. In this perspective, the results of three experiments (EURO-CORDEX ensemble mean, CCLM 8 and CCLM 2.2) at different spatial (similar to 12, 8 and 2.2 km) and temporal (daily, 6 h and 3 h) scales are compared to gridded and point-scale observational datasets. Precipitation data are analyzed by mean of the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices indicators, as well as with statistical models able to evaluate the precipitation distribution and the extreme values for different durations of precipitation events. To objectively assess gains and losses in adopting high-resolution RCMs, data are elaborated assuming the distribution added value as metric, particularly focusing on the role of orography. The work returns, at daily scale, a gain in climate model performances moving from lower to higher horizontal resolution. At the same time, investigating the effect of the orography the simulation with the finest grid proves to better capture local precipitation dynamics at higher altitudes in terms of both sub-daily precipitation and extreme events.","[Reder, Alfredo; Raffa, Mario; Montesarchio, Myriam; Mercogliano, Paola] Ctr Euromediterraneo Cambiamenti Climatici, Reg Models & Geohydrol Impacts, Via Maiorise, I-81043 Capua, Italy; [Montesarchio, Myriam; Mercogliano, Paola] CIRA Italian Aerosp Res Ctr, Meteorol Lab, Via Maiorise, I-81043 Capua, Italy",Centro Euro-Mediterraneo sui Cambiamenti Climatici (CMCC); CIRA - Italian Aerospace Research Centre,"Reder, A (corresponding author), Ctr Euromediterraneo Cambiamenti Climatici, Reg Models & Geohydrol Impacts, Via Maiorise, I-81043 Capua, Italy.",alfredo.reder@cmcc.it,,"REDER, Alfredo/0000-0002-5782-8170; Mercogliano, Paola/0000-0001-7236-010X; Raffa, Mario/0000-0002-0124-4600",Italian Project of Strategic Interest NEXTDATA; European Union-EU-DEM layers,Italian Project of Strategic Interest NEXTDATA; European Union-EU-DEM layers,"We acknowledge financial support from the Italian Project of Strategic Interest NEXTDATA (http://www.nextdataproject.it) A national system for recovery, storage, accessibility and dissemination of environmental and climatic data from mountain and marine areas.

Thus, the degradation of permafrost under warming climate conditions may affect the alpine grassland ecosystem on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Previous space-for-time studies using plot and basin scales have reached contradictory conclusions. In this study, we applied a process-based ecosystem model (DOS-TEM) with a state-of-the-art permafrost hydrology scheme to examine this issue. Our results showed that 1) the DOS-TEM model could properly simulate the responses of soil thermal and hydrological dynamics and of ecosystem dynamics to climate warming and spatial differences in precipitation; 2) the simulated results were consistent with plot-scale studies showing that warming caused an increase in maximum unfrozen thickness, a reduction in vegetation and soil carbon pools as a whole, and decreases in soil water content, net primary production, and heterotrophic respiration; and 3) the simulated results were also consistent with basin-scale studies showing that the ecosystem responses to warming were different in regions with different combinations of water and energy constraints. Permafrost prevents water from draining into water reservoirs. However, the degradation of permafrost in response to warming is a long-term process that also enhances evapotranspiration. Thus, the degradation of the alpine grassland ecosystem on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (releasing carbon) cannot be mainly attributed to the disappearing waterproofing function of permafrost.","[Yi, Shuhua; Wang, Xiaoyun; Qin, Yu; Ding, Yongjian] Chinese Acad Sci, Cold & Arid Reg Environm & Engn Res Inst, State Key Lab Cryospher Sci, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xiaoyun] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Xiang, Bo] Chongqing Meteorol Adm, Chongqing 404100, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Cold & Arid Regions Environmental & Engineering Research Institute, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Yi, SH (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Cold & Arid Reg Environm & Engn Res Inst, State Key Lab Cryospher Sci, 320 Donggang West Rd, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China.",yis@lzb.ac.cn,,,Major State Basic Research Development Program of China (973 Programme) [2010CB951402]; Strategic Priority Research Program [XDB030303]; State Key Laboratory of Cryospheric Sciences [SKLCS-ZZ-2013-2-2]; Chinese National Natural Science Foundation Commission [41271089],Major State Basic Research Development Program of China (973 Programme)(National Basic Research Program of China); Strategic Priority Research Program(Chinese Academy of Sciences); State Key Laboratory of Cryospheric Sciences; Chinese National Natural Science Foundation Commission(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"We would like to thank Dave McGuire for his helpful suggestions and comments; Huijun Jin for clarifying the classification of permafrost type on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau; the Data Assimilation and Modeling Center for Tibetan Multi-spheres, Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences for help with radiation data; and the Environmental and Ecological Science Data Center for West China, National Natural Science Foundation of China (http://westdc.westgis.ac.cn) for providing the permafrost, vegetation, and NDVI data.

Fueled with liquid hydrogen (LH2), their emissions consist of water vapor (H2O), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and unburned hydrogen. If LH2 is produced in a climate- and carbon-neutral manner, carbon dioxide does not have to be included when calculating the climate footprint. H2O that is emitted near the surface has a very short residence time (hours) and thereby no considerable climate impact. Super- and hypersonic aviation emit at very high altitudes (15 to 35 km), and H2O residence times increase with altitude from months to several years, with large latitudinal variations. Therefore, emitted H2O has a substantial impact on climate via high altitude H2O changes. Since the (photo-)chemical lifetime of H2O largely decreases at altitudes above 30 km via the reaction with O(D-1) and via photolysis, the question is whether the H2O climate impact from hypersonics flying above 30 km becomes smaller with higher cruise altitude. Here, we use two state-of-the-art chemistry-climate models and a climate response model to investigate atmospheric changes and respective climate impacts as a result of two potential hypersonic fleets flying at 26 and 35 km, respectively. We show, for the first time, that the (photo-)chemical H2O depletion of H2O emissions at these altitudes is overcompensated by a recombination of hydroxyl radicals to H2O and an enhanced methane and nitric acid depletion. These processes lead to an increase in H2O concentrations compared to a case with no emissions from hypersonic aircraft. This results in a steady increase with altitude of the H2O perturbation lifetime of up to 4.4 +/- 0.2 years at 35 km. We find a 18.2 +/- 2.8 and 36.9 +/- 3.4 mW m(-2) increase in stratosphere-adjusted radiative forcing due to the two hypersonic fleets flying at 26 and 35 km, respectively. On average, ozone changes contribute 8 %-22 %, and water vapor changes contribute 78 %-92 % to the warming. Our calculations show that the climate impact, i.e., mean surface temperature change derived from the stratosphere-adjusted radiative forcing, of hypersonic transport is estimated to be roughly 8-20 times larger than a subsonic reference aircraft with the same transport volume (revenue passenger kilometers) and that the main contribution stems from H2O.","[Pletzer, Johannes; Joeckel, Patrick; Grewe, Volker] Deutsch Zentrum Luft & Raumfahrt, Inst Phys Atmosphere, Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany; [Pletzer, Johannes; Grewe, Volker] Delft Univ Technol, Aircraft Noise & Climate Effect, Aerosp Engn, Kluyverweg 1, NL-2629 HS Delft, Netherlands; [Hauglustaine, Didier; Cohen, Yann] Univ Paris Saclay, Lab Sci Climat & Environm, LSCE IPSL CEA CNRS UVSQ, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France",Helmholtz Association; German Aerospace Centre (DLR); Delft University of Technology; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; CEA; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Pletzer, J (corresponding author), Deutsch Zentrum Luft & Raumfahrt, Inst Phys Atmosphere, Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany.;Pletzer, J (corresponding author), Delft Univ Technol, Aircraft Noise & Climate Effect, Aerosp Engn, Kluyverweg 1, NL-2629 HS Delft, Netherlands.",johannes.pletzer@dlr.de,,"Grewe, Volker/0000-0002-8012-6783; Pletzer, Johannes Friedrich/0000-0003-3210-3496","European Commission [769246, 101006856]",European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre),"This research has been supported by the European Commission, Horizon 2020 Framework Programme (STRATOFLY (grant no. 769246) and MOREandLESS (grant no. 101006856)).",,84,0,0,3,3,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1680-7316,1680-7324,,ATMOS CHEM PHYS,Atmos.

A statistical downscaling technique, in which local values are inferred from observed atmospheric predictor variables, is compared against two dynamical downscaling techniques, based on the use of the screen temperature or precipitation simulated at the nearest grid point in integrations of two climate models. In one integration a global general circulation model (GCM) is constrained to reproduce the observed atmospheric circulation over the period of interest, while the second involves a high-resolution regional climate model (RCM) nested inside the GCM. The dynamical and statistical methods are compared in terms of the correlation between the estimated and observed time series of monthly anomalies. For estimates of temperature a high degree of skill is found, especially over western, central and northern Europe; for precipitation skill is lower (average correlations ranging from 0.4 in summer to 0.7 in winter). Overall, the dynamical and statistical methods show similar levels of skill, although the statistical method is better for summertime estimates of temperature while the dynamical methods give slightly better estimates of wintertime precipitation. In general, therefore, the skill with which present-day surface climate anomalies can be derived from atmospheric observations is not improved by using the sophisticated calculations of subgrid-scale processes made in climate models rather than simple empirical relationships. It does not necessarily follow that statistical and dynamical downscaling estimates of changes in surface climate will also possess equal skill. By the above measure the two dynamical techniques possess approximately equal skill; however, they art: also compared by assessing errors in the mean and variance of monthly values and errors in the simulated distributions of daily values. Such errors arise from systematic biases in the models plus the effect of unresolved local forcings. For precipitation the results show that the RCM offers clear benefits relative to the GCM: the simulated variability of both daily and monthly values, although lower than observed, is much more realistic than in the CCM because the finer grid reduces the amount of spatial smoothing implicit in the use of grid-box variables. The climatological means are also simulated better in the winter half of the year because the RCM captures some of the mesoscale detail present in observed distributions. The temperature fields contain a mesoscale orographic signal that is skillfully reproduced by the RCM; however, this is not a source of increased skill relative to the GCM since elevation biases can be largely removed using simple empirical corrections based on spatially averaged lapse rates. Nevertheless, the average skill of downscaled climatological mean temperature values is higher in the RCM in nearly all months. The additional skill arises from better resolution of local physiographical features, especially coastlines, and also from the dynamical effects of higher resolution, which generally act to reduce the large-scale systematic biases in the simulated values. Both models tend to overestimate the variability of both daily and monthly mean temperature. On average the RCM is more skillful in winter but less skillful in summer, due to excessive drying of the soil over central and southern Europe. The downscaling scores for monthly means are compared against scores obtained by using a predictor variable consisting of observations from the nearest station to the predictand station. In general the downscaling scores are significantly worse than those obtained from adjacent stations, indicating that there remains considerable scope for refining the techniques in future. In the case of dynamical downscaling progress can be made by reducing systematic errors through improvements in the representation of physical processes and increased resolution; the prospects for improving statistical downscaling will depend on the availability of the observational data needed to provide longer calibration time series and/or a wider range of predictor variables.","UK Meteorol Off, Hadley Ctr Climate Predict & Res, Bracknell RG12 2SY, Berks, England",Met Office - UK; Hadley Centre,"Murphy, J (corresponding author), UK Meteorol Off, Hadley Ctr Climate Predict & Res, London Rd, Bracknell RG12 2SY, Berks, England.",,,,,,,,51,372,387,0,86,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0894-8755,,,J CLIMATE,J.

In the last 10-15 years, climate impact assessment has been performed for many river basins worldwide using different climate scenarios and models. However, their results are hardly comparable, and do not allow one to create a full picture of impacts and uncertainties. Therefore, a systematic intercomparison of impacts is suggested, which should be done for representative regions using state-of-the-art models. Only a few such studies have been available until now with the global-scale hydrological models, and our study is intended as a step in this direction by applying the regional-scale models. The impact assessment presented here was performed for three river basins on three continents: the Rhine in Europe, the Upper Niger in Africa and the Upper Yellow in Asia. For that, climate scenarios from five general circulation models (GCMs) and three hydrological models, HBV, SWIM and VIC, were used. Four representative concentration pathways (RCPs) covering a range of emissions and land-use change projections were included. The objectives were to analyze and compare climate impacts on future river discharge and to evaluate uncertainties from different sources. The results allow one to draw some robust conclusions, but uncertainties are large and shared differently between sources in the studied basins. Robust results in terms of trend direction and slope and changes in seasonal dynamics could be found for the Rhine basin regardless of which hydrological model or forcing GCM is used. For the Niger River, scenarios from climate models are the largest uncertainty source, providing large discrepancies in precipitation, and therefore clear projections are difficult to do. For the Upper Yellow basin, both the hydrological models and climate models contribute to uncertainty in the impacts, though an increase in high flows in the future is a robust outcome ensured by all three hydrological models.","[Vetter, T.; Huang, S.; Aich, V.; Krysanova, V.; Hattermann, F.] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Potsdam, Germany; [Yang, T.; Wang, X.] Hohai Univ, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; Hohai University,"Vetter, T (corresponding author), Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Potsdam, Germany.",vetter@pik-potsdam.de,"Krysanova, Valentina/AAR-2324-2020","Vetter, Tobias/0000-0001-7627-9464; Aich, Valentin/0000-0002-3699-3775; Huang, Shaochun/0000-0001-7426-5181","project PROGRESS (Potsdam Research Cluster for Georisk Analysis, Environmental Change and Sustainability)","project PROGRESS (Potsdam Research Cluster for Georisk Analysis, Environmental Change and Sustainability)","This work was financed by the project PROGRESS (Potsdam Research Cluster for Georisk Analysis, Environmental Change and Sustainability).

A topic open to debate is whether that change takes place because rainfall becomes more intense, or because it rains more often, or a combination of both. The answer to this question is of interest for water resources planning, hydrometeorological design, and agricultural management. Change in the number of rainy days can cause major disruptions in hydrological and ecological systems, with important economic and social effects. Furthermore, the characteristics of daily rainfall aggregation in ongoing climate variability provide a reference to evaluate the capability of GCM to simulate changes in the hydrologic cycle. In this research, we analyze changes in the aggregation of daily rainfall producing a climate positive trend in annual rainfall in central Argentina, in the southern middle-latitudes. This state-of-the-art agricultural region has a semiarid climate with dry and wet seasons. Weather effects in the region influence world-market prices of several crops. Results indicate that the strong positive trend in seasonal and annual rainfall amount is produced by an increase in number of rainy days. This increase takes place in the 3-month periods January-March (summer) and April-June (autumn). These are also the 3-month periods showing a positive trend in the mean of annual rainfall. The mean of the distribution of annual number of rainy day (ANRD) increased in 50% in a 36-year span (starting at 44 days/year). No statistically significant indications on time changes in the probability distribution of daily rainfall amount were found. Non-periodic fluctuations in the time series of annual rainfall were analyzed using an integral wavelet transform. Fluctuations with a time scale of about 10 and 20 years construct the trend in annual rainfall amount. These types of non-periodic fluctuations have been observed in other regions of the world. This suggests that results of this research could have further geographical validity. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

We use one simulation and a four-member ensemble performed with the MPI-ESM-P and CESM-LME models, respectively, forced only by low-scaling variations in Total Solar Irradiance (TSI). We apply linear methods (correlation and regression) and composite analysis to estimate the NA surface and tropospheric climatic responses to decadal solar variability. Linear methods in the CESM ensemble indicate a weak summer response in sea-level pressure (SLP) and 500-hPa geopotential height to TSI, with decreased values over Greenland and increased values over the NA subtropics. Composite analysis indicates that, during high-TSI periods, SLP decreases over eastern Canada and the geopotential height at 500-hPa increases over the subtropical NA. The possible summer response of SSTs is overlapped by model internal variability. Therefore, for low-scaling TSI changes, state-of-the-art ESMs disagree on the NA surface climatic effect of solar forcing indicated by proxy-based studies during the preindustrial millennium. The analysis of control simulations indicates that, in all climatic variables studied, spurious patterns of apparent solar response may arise from the analysis of single model simulations.","[Pyrina, Maria; Wagner, Sebastian; Zorita, Eduardo] Helmholtz Zentrum Hereon, Inst Coastal Syst, D-21502 Geesthacht, Germany; [Pyrina, Maria] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Moreno-Chamarro, Eduardo] Barcelona Supercomp Ctr, Barcelona 08034, Spain",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya; Barcelona Supercomputer Center (BSC-CNS),"Pyrina, M (corresponding author), Helmholtz Zentrum Hereon, Inst Coastal Syst, D-21502 Geesthacht, Germany.;Pyrina, M (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",maria.pyrina@hereon.de; eduardo.moreno@bsc.es; sebastian.wagner@hereon.de; eduardo.zorita@hereon.de,"Moreno-Chamarro, Eduardo/ABF-9676-2021","Moreno-Chamarro, Eduardo/0000-0002-7931-5149; Wagner, Sebastian/0000-0001-5603-3897; Pyrina, Maria/0000-0002-4890-0732",European Initial Marie Curie Training network ARAMACC (Annually resolved Archives of Marine Climate Change); European Union [604802],European Initial Marie Curie Training network ARAMACC (Annually resolved Archives of Marine Climate Change); European Union(European Commission),"This research partly received external funding from the framework of the European Initial Marie Curie Training network ARAMACC (Annually resolved Archives of Marine Climate Change).

This paper investigates the performances of existing state-of-the-art rule induction and tree algorithms, namely, single conjunctive rule learner, decision table, M5P model tree, decision stump, and REPTree. Downscaling models are developed to obtain projections of mean monthly maximum and minimum temperatures (Tmax and Tmin) as well as pan evaporation to lake-basin scale in an arid region in India using these algorithms. The predictor variables, such as air temperature, zonal wind, meridional wind, and geo-potential height, are extracted from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis data set for the period 1948-2000 and from the simulations using third-generation Canadian coupled global climate models for emission scenarios for the period 2001-2100. A simple multiplicative shift was used for correcting predictand values. The performances of various models have been evaluated on several statistical performance parameters such as correlation coefficient, mean absolute error, and root mean square error. The M5P model tree algorithm was found to yield better performance among all other learning techniques explored in the present study. An increasing trend is observed for Tmax and Tmin for emission scenarios, whereas no trend has been observed for pan evaporation in the future.","[Goyal, Manish Kumar; Ojha, C. S.

Increases in predicted N-load from climate change vary from 20 to 60% depending on climate model. SSPs moderate these N-load changes with small changes for SSP1 to large increases for SSP5, with greater increases for Norsminde than Kocinka due to land use differences.

Compared to reanalysis, the convective-scale simulation is better able to represent humid heatwaves than the parameterized simulation. Model performance for dry heatwaves is much more similar. Both model configurations simulate large increases in the intensity, duration, and frequency of heatwaves by 2100 under RCP8.5. Present-day conditions that occur on 3-6 heatwave days per year will be normal by 2100, occurring on 150-180 days per year. The future change in dry heatwaves is similar in both climate model configurations, whereas the future change in humid heatwaves is 56% higher in intensity and 20% higher in frequency in the convective-scale model. Dry heatwaves are associated with low rainfall, reduced cloud, increased surface shortwave heating, and increased sensible heat flux. In contrast, humid heatwaves are predominately controlled by increased humidity, rainfall, cloud, longwave heating, and evaporation, with dry-bulb temperature gaining more significance in the most humid regions. Approximately one-third (32%) of humid heatwaves commence on wet days. Moist processes are known to be better represented in convective-scale models. Climate models with parameterized convection, such as those in CMIP, may underestimate the future change in humid heatwaves, which heightens the need for mitigation and adaptation strategies and indicates there may be less time available to implement them to avoid future catastrophic heat stress conditions than previously thought. Significance StatementTemperatures are higher in dry heatwaves, but humid heatwaves can be more dangerous, as the ability to cool by sweating is limited. We found that dry heatwaves are caused by decreased cloud, allowing the sun to heat the surface, whereas humid heatwaves are caused by increased cloud, rainfall, and evaporation from the surface. We found that a state-of-the-art very high-resolution climate model predicts a larger future change in humid heatwaves compared to a more traditional global climate model. Previous estimates of the prevalence of humid heatwaves in the future may therefore be underestimated. If we do not cut emissions of greenhouse gases, present-day African heatwave conditions could be experienced on up to half of all days of the year by 2100.","[Birch, C. E.; Jackson, L. S.; Finney, D.

Climate models continue to struggle to adequately represent the ITCZ and differ substantially in its simulated response to climate change. Here we employ complex network approaches, which extract spatiotemporal variability patterns from climate data, to better understand differences in the dynamics of the ITCZ in state-of-the-art global circulation models (GCMs). For this purpose, we study simulations with 14 GCMs in an idealized slab-ocean aquaplanet setup from TRACMIP - the Tropical Rain belts with an Annual cycle and a Continent Model Intercomparison Project. We construct network representations based on the spatial correlation patterns of monthly surface temperature anomalies and study the zonal-mean patterns of different topological and spatial network characteristics. Specifically, we cluster the GCMs by means of the distributions of their zonal network measures utilizing hierarchical clustering. We find that in the control simulation, the distributions of the zonal network measures are able to pick up model differences in the tropical sea surface temperature (SST) contrast, the ITCZ position, and the strength of the Southern Hemisphere Hadley cell. Although we do not find evidence for consistent modifications in the network structure tracing the response of the ITCZ to global warming in the considered model ensemble, our analysis demonstrates that coherent variations of the global SST field are linked to ITCZ dynamics. This suggests that climate networks can provide a new perspective on ITCZ dynamics and model differences therein.","[Wolf, Frederik; Donner, Reik, V] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res PIK, Res Domain IV Complex Sci, Potsdam, Germany; [Wolf, Frederik; Donner, Reik, V] Leibniz Assoc, Potsdam, Germany; [Wolf, Frederik] Humboldt Univ, Dept Phys, Berlin, Germany; [Voigt, Aiko] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Dept Troposphere Res, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Karlsruhe, Germany; [Voigt, Aiko] Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, New York, NY USA; [Donner, Reik, V] Magdeburg Stendal Univ Appl Sci, Dept Water Environm Construct & Safety, Magdeburg, Germany",Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; Humboldt University of Berlin; Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; Columbia University,"Wolf, F (corresponding author), Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res PIK, Res Domain IV Complex Sci, Potsdam, Germany.;Wolf, F (corresponding author), Leibniz Assoc, Potsdam, Germany.;Wolf, F (corresponding author), Humboldt Univ, Dept Phys, Berlin, Germany.",frederik.wolf@pik-potsdam.de,"Voigt, Aiko/H-4691-2012; Donner, Reik/F-4400-2017","Voigt, Aiko/0000-0002-7394-8252; Donner, Reik/0000-0001-7023-6375","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [IRTG 1740/TRP 2011/50151-0]; Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung [01LN1306A, 01LK1509A, 01LP16MA, 01LP2002B]",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"This research has been supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (grant no.

Twelve Steps for Art History Writing in the Anthropocene,KONSTHISTORISK TIDSKRIFT,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Looking at both critique and postcritique in relation to art history, in general, and art historiography, in particular, this article suggests that art history's critical heritage runs longer and deeper than a hermeneutics of suspicion signals, and that this state of affairs is therefore a deeper and wider problem than how to overcome and replace critique. The latter term, for art history, is of a piece with the modernity/modernism/avant-gardism of this discipline, which - despite declarations to the contrary - is not over, and which therefore makes today's critical (in the sense of dangerous and urgent) situation of imminent climate disaster even harder to come to terms with. What our discipline is arguably in need of in the epoch of the Anthropocene - save for contributing to saving the world - is a new way of composing histories of art. In search of such a more unbiassed model I will discuss temporal conceptions, including the Anthropocene itself as well as Francois Hartog's ideas on presentism, and draw on Piotr Piotrowski's attempt to construct a spatially extended horizontal art history, as opposed to the hierarchical West-centered one, in order, finally, to propose the outlines of an alternative, inspired by Bruno Latour - a twelve-step sketch that is horizontal in a more neutral and material sense, and which responds to the keywords anachronic, amodern and acritical.","[Karlholm, Dan] Sodertorn Univ, Dept Culture & Educ Art Hist, Huddinge, Sweden",Sodertorn University,"Karlholm, D (corresponding author), Sodertorn Univ, Dept Culture & Educ Art Hist, Huddinge, Sweden.",dan.karlholm@sh.se,,,,,,,73,0,0,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0023-3609,1651-2294,,KONSTHIST TIDSKR,Konsthistorisk Tidsskr.,2-Apr,2020,2,,SI,,150,164,,10.1080/00233609.2019.1704863,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00233609.2019.1704863,,,15,Art,Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;HCI),Art,MU3QP,,"hybrid, Green Published",,,12/21/22,WOS:000555587200006,View Full Record in Web of Science

So far, discussions on adaptation tracking have focused on the technocratic reasons for limited progress on adaptation tracking, for example, financial, methodological, and technical capacity gaps. Substantial variation exists in the institutional context within which adaptation takes place and is being tracked. Yet, recent discussions overlook the importance of the extent to which new systems of adaptation tracking fit within the prevailing rules and practices of knowledge production and use. Although such a fit-for-context approach has been considered important in other fields, no adequate frameworks exist to operationalize it within adaptation tracking. We develop a six-dimensional framework for analyzing institutional structures as the first step towards alignment in the design and use of adaptation tracking: 1) stakeholder participation, 2) transparency, 3) bureaucratic accountability, 4) engagement with experts, 5) politico-administrative relations, and 6) coordination within the administration. For each dimension, we synthesize academic literature, provide variables for operationalization, and provide examples drawn from various regions. The resulting framework allows the description of the institutional structures of knowledge production and use and supports the context-specific design of new programs, tools, and practices for tracking adaptation progress.","[Njuguna, Lucy; Biesbroek, Robbert; Dewulf, Art] Wageningen Univ & Res, Publ Adm & Policy Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Njuguna, Lucy; Crane, Todd A.] Int Livestock Res Inst ILRI, Nairobi, Kenya; [Tamas, Peter] Wageningen Univ & Res, Biometr Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research; CGIAR; International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI); Wageningen University & Research,"Njuguna, L (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ & Res, Publ Adm & Policy Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands.;Njuguna, L (corresponding author), Int Livestock Res Inst ILRI, Nairobi, Kenya.",Lucy.Njuguna@wur.nl,"Biesbroek, Robbert/GZZ-4476-2022","Biesbroek, Robbert/0000-0002-2906-1419; Tamas, Peter/0000-0002-5409-1273",German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ); Deut-sche Gesellschaft fur Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) through the Fund International Agricultural Research (FIA) [81231239],German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ); Deut-sche Gesellschaft fur Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) through the Fund International Agricultural Research (FIA),"The work by Lucy Njuguna and Todd Crane is funded through the Program for Climate Smart Livestock (PCSL) which has received financial support from the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) commissioned by the Deut-sche Gesellschaft fuer Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) through the Fund International Agricultural Research (FIA) , grant number: 81231239.",,117,1,1,1,1,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-0963,,,CLIM RISK MANAG,CLIM.

Non-materialistic resources are difficult for diagnosis owing to their attributes and a difficulty appears among researchers of the presented phenomena in interpreting the applied methods and the analysis of obtained research results. However, all the time attempts are made to describe economic components of this type because theorists as well as experienced experts of economic life prove, in their numerous publications on the problem, that the significance of these resources for the development is unquestionable. There was made an attempt to study the organizational climate of higher education institutions as determinants influencing creative attitudes among young people, so desirable in today's economy. The main objective of the research was: Using scientific procedures and using the appropriate methodology examined and recognized in current state of organizational climate of universities and its impact on the development of students creativity. Considerations were the basis for the formulation of the research hypothesis: The higher and more advanced level of organizational climate focused on creativity, the higher the level of creativity among students, who as part of the intellectual capital is a key factor in the development of micro-and macro-region.

This article examines 'One-Way Ticket' and compares Migration with exhibitions of Otto Dix's 1924 Der Krieg series to demonstrate the racial bias undergirding even an honest attempt to pay homage to an artist outside of a white modernist mainstream. With the acknowledgement of profound differences in impact and scale, this article contends that there is a parallel between MoMA's 'One-Way Ticket' and the consistent assumption of African-American otherness to a white norm undergirding today's climate of racial unrest.","[Berkowitz, Elizabeth] CUNY, Grad Ctr, Art Hist, New York, NY 10016 USA",City University of New York (CUNY) System,"Berkowitz, E (corresponding author), CUNY, Grad Ctr, Art Hist, New York, NY 10016 USA.",,,,,,,,21,1,1,0,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1473-5784,1473-5776,,CULT THEORY CRIT,Cult.

Intermodel comparison of Phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project CO2 quadrupling experiments shows that even in models where hemispheric ocean heat uptake differences are small, Arctic warming still exceeds Antarctic warming. The polar climate impact of this evolving ocean response to CO2 forcing is then isolated using slab ocean experiments in a state-of-the-art climate model. Overall, feedbacks over the Southern Hemisphere more effectively dissipate top-of-atmosphere anomalies than those over the Northern Hemisphere. Furthermore, a poleward shift in ocean heat convergence in both hemispheres amplifies destabilizing ice albedo and lapse rate feedbacks over the Arctic much more so than over the Antarctic. These results suggest that the Arctic is intrinsically more sensitive to both CO2 and oceanic forcings than the Antarctic and that ocean-driven climate sensitivity asymmetry arises from feedback destabilization over the Arctic rather than feedback stabilization over the Antarctic. Plain Language Summary Anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions impact climate globally, but nowhere more so than over the Arctic, a phenomenon known as polar amplification. Surprisingly, the climate response over the Antarctic is much more muted than the climate response over the Arctic, which has been attributed to the large uptake of heat over the Southern Ocean which cools the Southern Hemisphere. Here we show that a weaker climate response over the Antarctic is due, in part, to weaker intrinsic sensitivity to both greenhouse gas forcing and the state of the ocean. Even climate models with similar amounts of heat uptake into the deep ocean in both hemispheres warm more over the Arctic than the Antarctic. Furthermore, similar increases in winter season heat transport into the polar oceans in both hemispheres trigger more destabilizing climate feedbacks over the Arctic than the Antarctic. Therefore, greater climate change over the Arctic than the Antarctic can be expected even if ocean heat uptake or ocean heat transport changes are similar in both hemispheres.","[Singh, H.

In particular, works partially or totally realized with wood, such as polychrome sculptures, painted panels or Crucifixes, are highly sensitive and delicate and thus need a particular attention. The wooden support is, in fact, an essential element for the stability of pictorial layers: the color lies on a preparation, which in turn, is anchored to the wood. Wrong conservation methods, i.e. in an environmental climate that is not controlled, or intrinsic mechanical stresses, can warp such structures, and the effects can be irreversible and destructive to the painted layer. The use of fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors for the quasi-distributed, in situ measurement and continuous monitoring of deformations in painted wood panel is proposed. In order to demonstrate the applicability of FBG sensors to painted wood panels, a wooden support, made using the same 15th-16th century techniques, was prepared in the Opificio laboratories. A number of Bragg grating sensors were affixed in several critical points, on the back and front sides and on the strengthening cross-beams, in order to detect deformations in the panel dependent on the variations in the environmental relative humidity (RH). Measurements during the removal of the cross-beams are also reported. The results of measurements have shown the applicability of FBG sensors for the continuous in situ monitoring of valuable wooden objects and works of art. 2003 Editions scientifiques et medicales Elsevier SAS.

Comparisons were made between the CCM results and European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Interim Reanalysis (ERA-Interim). The results of most of the CCMs, and those based on ERA-Interim, showed the trends of lower-to mid-stratospheric WV during the period 1980-2005 to be positive, with the extent of the trend increasing with altitude. The trend of lower-to mid-stratospheric WV in the ensemble mean of the CCMs was 0.03 ppmv per decade, which was about twice as large as that based on ERA-Interim. The authors also used a state-of-the-art general circulation model to evaluate the impacts of greenhouse gas (GHG) concentration increases and ozone depletion on stratospheric WV. The simulation results showed that the increases of lower-to mid-stratospheric WV affected by the combined effects of GHG and ozone changes happened mainly via warming of the tropopause and enhancement of the Brewer-Dobson circulation (BDC), with the former being the greater contributor. GHG increase led to a higher and warmer tropopause with stronger BDC, which in turn led to more WV entering the stratosphere; while ozone depletion led to a higher and cooler tropopause, which caused the decreases of lower-to mid-stratospheric WV, despite also causing stronger BDC.","[Hu Ding-Zhu; Han Yuan-Yuan; Sang Wen-Jun] Lanzhou Univ, Coll Atmospher Sci, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu, Peoples R China; [Xie Fei] Beijing Normal Univ, Coll Global Change & Earth Syst Sci, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China",Lanzhou University; Beijing Normal University,"Xie, F (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, Coll Global Change & Earth Syst Sci, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",xiefei@lasg.iap.ac.cn,"Xie, Fei/I-9766-2016","Xie, Fei/0000-0003-2891-3883","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41225018, 41305036]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 41225018 and 41305036).

As an instrumental-technical intervention, planning is mainly used to improve the physical environment (through concepts such as regulating waterproof facades of architecture, setting buffering zones, and designing green-blue corridors). However, the implementation of the proposed physical interventions is often challenging and necessitates assistance from practices such as climate assessment, policy disciplines, civil societies, and economic resources. These extensive perspectives have spawned many new research domains in the realm of spatial planning. This paper provides a review of the recent developments in flood resilience, risk management, and climate adaptation; based on this, it positions planning research and practice within these works of literature. Four clusters of thought are identified, mainly in the European and American scholarship of the last two decades. They are environmental concerns, disaster management concerns, socio-economic concerns, and institutional concerns. Current planning research concentrates on disaster management in the underlying belief that planning is functionally efficient. The attention to environmental concerns, socio-economic concerns, and institutional concerns of planning research remains insufficient but has been growing. This, in turn, enlarges the scope of planning research and indicates future directions for study. These new concerns relate to spatial planning's ability to operate effectively in a multi-sectoral setting, despite limited resources and in the face of uncertain risk.","[Meng, Meng; Dabrowski, Marcin; Stead, Dominic] Delft Univ Technol TU Delft, Fac Architecture & Built Environm, Dept Urbanism, Julianalaan 134, NL-2628 BL Delft, Netherlands",,"Meng, M (corresponding author), Delft Univ Technol TU Delft, Fac Architecture & Built Environm, Dept Urbanism, Julianalaan 134, NL-2628 BL Delft, Netherlands.",m.meng@tudelft.nl; m.m.dabrowski@tudelft.nl; D.Stead@tudelft.nl,"Stead, Dominic/O-8029-2014","Stead, Dominic/0000-0002-8198-785X; meng, meng/0000-0002-7306-0544",,,,,123,8,8,11,27,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,OCT,2020,19,,,,,,7864,10.3390/su12197864,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12197864,,,23,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,ON5ZC,,"Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000586777700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Results showed that on the annual scale, the model's response to the heterogeneities is quite sensitive, and that the effect of the temperature heterogeneity (TH) is more pronounced than the moisture heterogeneity (MH). On the intraannual scale, TH may lead to more (less) precipitation in warm (cold) seasons, and hence lead to larger intraannual variability in precipitation; the major MH effects may be lagged by about 1 month during the warm, rainy seasons, inducing similar to 6% more precipitation for some sub-regions. Additionally, the modeled climate for the northern sub-regions shows larger sensitivities to the land surface heterogeneities than those for the southern sub-regions. Since state-of-art land surface models seldom account for surface intra-patch variabilities, this study emphasizes the importance of including this kind of variability in the land surface models.","[Zeng Xinmin; Liu Jinbo; Xi Chaoli] PLA Univ Sci & Technol, Inst Meteorol, Nanjing 211101, Peoples R China; [Zeng Xinmin; Ma Zhuguo; Song Shuai; Wang Hanjie] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Reg Climate Environm Res Temperate E Asia, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Zeng Xinmin] Nanjing Univ, Key Lab Mesoscale Severe Weather, Minist Educ, Nanjing 210093, Peoples R China",Army Engineering University of PLA; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Nanjing University,"Zeng, XM (corresponding author), PLA Univ Sci & Technol, Inst Meteorol, Nanjing 211101, Peoples R China.",xmzen@sohu.com,"Zeng, Xin-Min/E-7060-2014","Zeng, Xin-Min/0000-0002-7146-0819",,,,,25,5,8,0,11,SCIENCE PRESS,BEIJING,"16 DONGHUANGCHENGGEN NORTH ST, BEIJING 100717, PEOPLES R CHINA",0256-1530,1861-9533,,ADV ATMOS SCI,Adv.

Globally, natural catastrophic phenomena and hazards, such as drought, soil erosion, quantitative and qualitative degradation of groundwater, frost, flooding, sea level rise, etc., are intensified by anthropogenic factors. Thus, they present rapid increase in intensity, frequency of occurrence, spatial density, and significant spread of the areas of occurrence. The impact of these phenomena is devastating to human life and to global economies, private holdings, infrastructure, etc., while in a wider context it has a very negative effect on the social, environmental, and economic status of the affected region. Geospatial technologies including Geographic Information Systems, Remote Sensing-Earth Observation as well as related spatial data analysis tools, models, databases, contribute nowadays significantly in predicting, preventing, researching, addressing, rehabilitating, and managing these phenomena and their effects. This review attempts to mark the most devastating geo-hazards from the view of environmental monitoring, covering the state of the art in the use of geospatial technologies in that respect. It also defines the main challenge of this new era which is nothing more than the fictitious exploitation of the information produced by the environmental monitoring so that the necessary policies are taken in the direction of a sustainable future. The review highlights the potential and increasing added value of geographic information as a means to support environmental monitoring in the face of climate change. The growth in geographic information seems to be rapidly accelerated due to the technological and scientific developments that will continue with exponential progress in the years to come. Nonetheless, as it is also highlighted in this review continuous monitoring of the environment is subject to an interdisciplinary approach and contains an amount of actions that cover both the development of natural phenomena and their catastrophic effects mostly due to climate change.","[Tsatsaris, Andreas; Krassanakis, Vassilios] Univ West Attica, Dept Surveying & Geoinformat Engn, Ag Spyridonos Str, Athens 12243, Greece; [Kalogeropoulos, Kleomenis; Tsanakas, Konstantinos; Petropoulos, George P.; Chalkias, Christos] Harokopio Univ Athens, Dept Geog, El Venizelou St 70, Athens 17671, Greece; [Stathopoulos, Nikolaos] BEYOND Ctr EO Res & Satellite Remote Sensing, Inst Space Applicat & Remote Sensing, Natl Observ Athens, Athens 15236, Greece; [Louka, Panagiota] Agr Univ Athens, Dept Nat Resources Dev & Agr Engn, Lab Mineral Geol, 75 Iera Odos, Athens 11855, Greece; [Tsesmelis, Demetrios E.] Agr Univ Athens, Dept Nat Resources Dev & Agr Engn, Div Water Resources, Lab Agr Hydraul, 75 Iera Odos, Athens 11855, Greece; [Tsesmelis, Demetrios E.] Hellen Open Univ, Sch Sci & Technol, Lab Technol & Policy Energy & Environm, Parodos Aristotelous 18, Patras 26335, Greece; [Pappas, Vasilis] Univ Patras, Dept Architecture, Univ Campus, Rion 26500, Patra, Greece",University of West Attica; Harokopio University Athens; National Observatory of Athens; Agricultural University of Athens; Agricultural University of Athens; Hellenic Open University; University of Patras,"Tsatsaris, A (corresponding author), Univ West Attica, Dept Surveying & Geoinformat Engn, Ag Spyridonos Str, Athens 12243, Greece.",atsats@uniwa.gr; kalogeropoulos@hua.gr; n.stathopoulos@noa.gr; p.louka@aua.gr; ktsanakas@hua.gr; tsesmelis@aua.gr; krasvas@uniwa.gr; gpetropoulos@hua.gr; vpappas@upatras.gr; xalkias@hua.gr,"Tsesmelis, Demetrios/ABC-6371-2021; TSATSARIS, ANDREAS/R-6973-2018; Tsanakas, Konstantinos/ABD-9792-2021; Tsesmelis, Demetrios/AAS-7296-2021; Petropoulos, George P./N-5810-2019; Krassanakis, Vassilios/AAP-5076-2021","TSATSARIS, ANDREAS/0000-0003-3509-6551; Tsesmelis, Demetrios/0000-0001-5417-9585; Petropoulos, George P./0000-0003-1442-1423; Krassanakis, Vassilios/0000-0002-3030-4203; STATHOPOULOS, NIKOLAOS/0000-0002-1921-9729; Kalogeropoulos, Kleomenis/0000-0002-7952-0353; Tsanakas, Konstantinos/0000-0002-6516-9929",NERC's Newton Fund RCUK project Toward a Fire EarlyWarning System for Indonesia (ToFEWSI),NERC's Newton Fund RCUK project Toward a Fire EarlyWarning System for Indonesia (ToFEWSI),GPP's contribution to this work has been supported by NERC's Newton Fund RCUK project Toward a Fire EarlyWarning System for Indonesia (ToFEWSI).,,302,7,7,8,31,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2220-9964,,ISPRS INT J GEO-INF,ISPRS Int.

Historical indoor climate data can indicate climate variations that may have caused damage to objects. Avoiding these variations in the present and future may prevent new or further degradation. However, historical indoor climate data conditions are often not available and cannot be derived from recent indoor climate data as many historic buildings nowadays have climate control systems. In this study, multi-zone hygrothermal building simulation is applied to reconstruct the historical indoor climate in a 17th-century Dutch castle based on meteorological data, building properties, and user behaviour. Furthermore, a finite element model is created to analyse heat and moisture induced strain of a historic wooden cabinet. This cabinet has been located in the castle since the 18th century and shows damage caused by movement of the wood in response to climate variations. Mechanical degradation of the cabinet could have occurred when the strain exceeded the yield strain for safe, reversible deformation. The results show that combining a hygrothermal building simulation model and a finite element model can generate an adequate prediction of the microclimate around an object; though obtaining accurate data on hygroscopic and mechanical material properties can be difficult. Although the cabinet has experienced considerable tension after a conservation heating system was installed in the castle during a recent major renovation, the predicted strain was within the limits for safe, reversible deformation. This corresponds to the observation that no further damage occurred after the renovation. Damage may not be caused by the regular present or historical indoor climate in the castle, but could be indicated if the long-term average moisture content of the wood significantly deviates from the room conditions or if the vapour concentration in the room increases because of a flooding event.

Most extreme climate change effects in West Africa are predicted to occur in desert and grassland areas. It is important for smallholder farmers in this region to understand the implications of these projections to their livelihood and to identify appropriate adaptation strategies. A grazing game was used to explore gender-specific adaptive responses to climate variability in the semiarid region of Ghana. The game was designed to understand the decision-making processes that result in the overgrazing of animals, leading to desertification based on the players' interactions with the environment. A total of 44 grazing games comprising 22 games for male-headed households (HH) and 22 games for female-HH were played from August to December 2014 from 14 communities within the Bolgatanga Municipality and the Bongo district. The study revealed that males migrate to the southern part of the country to work on other people's farms during the dry season as an adaptation strategy, while females engage in off-farm activities such as shea-butter production and basketry. Results of the game showed that males produced the highest number of cattle but created the largest desert patches. Females, on the other hand, were more conscious about the environment (long-term condition of the rangeland) than the short-term income benefits from the sale of cattle; hence, they created fewer desert patches. Strategies such as reducing the number of cattle to allow for the re-growth of vegetation in periods of feed scarcity, ploughing for one another using bulls, and family support using income from the sale of livestock were employed by both gender groups. The involvement of female farmers in decision-making is crucial to improve natural resource management.","[Mensah, Michael] Univ Profess Studies Accra UPSA, Dept Business Adm, POB 149, Madina, Ghana; [Mensah, Michael; Villamor, Grace B.; Vlek, Paul L.

SmartSim is a library dedicated to enabling online analysis and Machine Learning (ML) for high performance, numerical simulations. In this paper, we detail the SmartSim architecture and provide benchmarks including online inference with a shared ML model, EKEResNet, on heterogeneous HPC systems. We demonstrate the capability of SmartSim by using it to run a 12-member ensemble of global-scale, high-resolution ocean simulations, each spanning 19 compute nodes, all communicating with the same ML architecture at each simulation timestep. In total, 970 billion inferences are collectively served by running the ensemble for a total of 120 simulated years. The inferences are used to predict the oceanic eddy kinetic energy (EKE), which is a variable that is used to tune different turbulence closures in the model and thus directly affects the simulation. The root-mean-square of the error in EKE (as compared to an eddy-resolving simulation) is 20% lower when using the ML-prediction than the previous state of the art. This demonstration is an example of how machine learning methods can be integrated into traditional numerical simulations, replace prognostic equations, and preserve overall simulation stability without significantly affecting the time to solution.","[Partee, Sam; Ellis, Matthew; Robbins, Benjamin] Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Seattle, WA 98007 USA; [Rigazzi, Alessandro] Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Wallisellen, Switzerland; [Shao, Andrew E.] Canadian Ctr Climate Modelling & Anal, Victoria, BC, Canada; [Bachman, Scott; Marques, Gustavo] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Boulder, CO USA",Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling & Analysis (CCCma); National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA,"Partee, S (corresponding author), Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Seattle, WA 98007 USA.",sam@partee.io,,"Marques, Gustavo/0000-0001-7238-0290; Partee, Sam/0000-0001-6005-5116",RedisLabs; Mitacs [IT15738],RedisLabs; Mitacs,"The authors would like to acknowledge Elliot Ronaghan for his help with application performance, and RedisLabs for their continued sup-port.

Results obtained, by contrasting meteorological data with sewage data, show that wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) influent flow rates are significantly increased during temporary snow melting periods above a critical daily air mean temperature of approx. -1.5 degrees C degree (T(Crit)) identified in the area. In order to assess melting patterns, the number of days above and below TCrit was assessed, and the annual number of melting periods was additionally evaluated using meteorological data obtained in the last decade. A striking thing about the daily air temperature pattern is that, despite the progressively warmer winter temperatures in the last decade, an increasing number of days with temperatures below -1.5 degrees C could be observed. The frequency of melting periods is shown to increase in wintertime, and it is identified as an additional climate change related factor in the Oslo region. We demonstrate that these impacts can deteriorate the WWTP operation through progressively increasing the relative frequencies of very high influent flow rate and of the very low influent sewage temperature. Such climate change related effects on sewage treatment processes can be characterised as shock-conditions, i.e. significant changes in a system's boundary conditions, occurring in a relatively short period of time. In the six year period examined, biological nitrogen removal and secondary clarification processes are shown to be significantly affected by the climate factors. A striking thing about using the state-of-the-art mathematical models of wastewater treatment processes in decision support systems is their inability of describing, and thus predicting the effects of such shock-loading events, as they have not been studied so far. Adaptation and optimisation of process models, also for use in design, optimisation as well as in real-time automation and process control schemes, are thus critical to meet the challenges of climatic changes in the future.","[Plosz, Benedek Gy.; Liltved, Helge; Ratnaweera, Harsha] Norwegian Inst Water Res NIVA, NO-0349 Oslo, Norway",Norwegian Institute for Water Research (NIVA),"Plosz, BG (corresponding author), Norwegian Inst Water Res NIVA, Gaustadalleen 21, NO-0349 Oslo, Norway.",benedek.plosz@niva.no; helge.liltved@niva.no; harsha.ratnaweera@niva.no,"Ratnaweera, Harsha Chandima/O-7962-2017","Ratnaweera, Harsha Chandima/0000-0003-1456-2541; Plosz, Benedek/0000-0002-7081-7038",NIVA [O-28094CLIWA-2M],NIVA,"Funding for the study was provided by NIVA (O-28094CLIWA-2M).

The first aerosol indirect radiative forcing (FAIRF) constitutes the largest uncertainty among the radiative forcings quantified by the latest IPCC report (IPCC2007) and is a major source of uncertainty in predicting climate change. Here, we investigate the anthropogenic contribution to CCN and associated FAIRF using a state-of-the-art global chemical transport and aerosol model (GEOS-Chem/APM) that contains a number of advanced features (including sectional particle microphysics, online comprehensive chemistry, consideration of all major aerosol species, online aerosol-cloud-radiation calculation, and usage of more accurate assimilated meteorology). The model captures the absolute values and spatial distributions of CCN concentrations measured in situ around the globe. We show that anthropogenic emissions increase the global mean CCN in the lower troposphere by similar to 60-80% and cloud droplet number concentration by similar to 40%. The global mean FAIRF based on GEOS-Chem/APM is -0.75 W m(-2), close to the median values of both IPCC2007 and post-IPCC2007 studies.

Based on a governmental policy that dates from the 1950s, China is divided into a heated North, where urban houses enjoy the amenities of a district heating infrastructure, and a non-heated South, which lacks this infrastructure. Most high-rise buildings in this zone are constructed without insulation, and a rapidly growing middle class heats under uninsulated conditions. Residents mitigate the winter cold through active means of climate control, primarily with electric devices that serve to warm certain parts of their bodies, or warm limited spaces in their apartments. This paper is based on a methodology that combines ethnographic building analysis, discourse analysis, architectural theory, and building science.

CAM SEM includes a unique dynamical core coupled at this time to the physics component of the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM) as well as the Community Land Model. This model allows the inclusion of local mesh refinement to seamlessly study imbedded higher-resolution regional climate concurrently with the global climate. Additionally. the numerical structure of the model based on spectral elements allows for application of state-of-the-art computing hardware most effectively and economically to produce the best prediction/simulation results with minimal expenditure of computing resources. The model has been tested under various conditions beginning with the shallow water equations and ending with an Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP)-style run that uses initial conditions and physics comparable to the CAM2 (version 2 of the NCAR CAM climate model) experiments. For uniform resolution, the output of the model compares favorably with the published output from the CAM2 experiments. Further integrations with local mesh refinement included indicate that while greater detail in the prediction of mesh-refined regions-that is, regional climate-is observed, the remaining coarse-grid results are similar to results obtained from a uniform-grid integration of the model with identical conditions. It should be noted that in addition to spectral elements, other efficient schemes have lately been considered, in particular the finite-volume scheme. This scheme has not yet been incorporated into CAM_SEM. The two schemes-finite volume and spectral element-are quasi-independent and generally compatible. dealing with different aspects of the integration process. Their impact can be assessed separately and the omission of the finite-volume process herein will not detract from the evaluation of the results using the spectral-element method alone.","Univ Maryland, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; Univ Maryland, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Baer, F (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",baer@atmos.umd.edu,"Wang, Houjun/AAR-3517-2021; Fournier, Aimé/J-6366-2015","Wang, Houjun/0000-0002-1462-5234; Fournier, Aimé/0000-0002-5872-8307",,,,,30,17,17,0,6,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0027-0644,,,MON WEATHER REV,Mon.

How the rain-bearing South American monsoon will evolve across the twenty-first century is thus a question of major interest. Extensive savanization, with its loss of forest carbon stock and uptake capacity, is an extreme although very uncertain scenario(1-6). We show that the contrasting rainfall projections simulated for Amazonia by 36 global climate models (GCMs) can be reproduced with empirical precipitation models, calibrated with historical GCM data as functions of the large-scale circulation. A set of these simple models was therefore calibrated with observations and used to constrain the GCM simulations. In agreement with the current hydrologic trends(7,8), the resulting projection towards the end of the twenty-first century is for a strengthening of the monsoon seasonal cycle, and a dry-season lengthening in southern Amazonia. With this approach, the increase in the area subjected to lengthy-savannah-prone-dry seasons is substantially larger than the GCM-simulated one. Our results confirm the dominant picture shown by the state-of-the-art GCMs, but suggest that the model democracy view of these impacts can be significantly underestimated.","[Boisier, Juan P.; Ducharne, Agnes; Guimberteau, Matthieu] UPMC, Univ Paris 04, CNRS, UMR METIS 7619,IPSL,EPHE, F-75252 Paris, France; [Ciais, Philippe; Guimberteau, Matthieu] CEA, CNRS, UVSQ, Lab Sci Climat & Environm,IPSL, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); UDICE-French Research Universities; PSL Research University Paris; Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes (EPHE); Sorbonne Universite; Universite Paris Cite; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Cite; Universite Paris Saclay; CEA; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Boisier, JP (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Dept Geophys, Santiago 8370449, Chile.",jboisier@dgf.uchile.cl,"Ciais, Philippe/A-6840-2011","Ciais, Philippe/0000-0001-8560-4943; Guimberteau, Matthieu/0000-0001-8582-6087; Boisier, Juan Pablo/0000-0003-3872-2538","European Union Seventh Framework Programme, under the project AMAZALERT [282664]; CONICYT (Chile) grant FONDAP (Center for Climate and Resilience Research) [15110009]; CONICYT (Chile) grant FONDECYT [3150492]","European Union Seventh Framework Programme, under the project AMAZALERT; CONICYT (Chile) grant FONDAP (Center for Climate and Resilience Research)(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDAP); CONICYT (Chile) grant FONDECYT(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT)","This research received financial support from the European Union Seventh Framework Programme, under the project AMAZALERT (Grant Agreement No. 282664).

CNRM-RCSM4 includes the regional representation of the atmosphere (ALADIN-Climate model), land surface (ISBA model), rivers (TRIP model) and the ocean (NEMOMED8 model), with a daily coupling by the OASIS coupler. This model aims to reproduce the regional climate system with as few constraints as possible: there is no surface salinity, temperature relaxation, or flux correction; the Black Sea budget is parameterised and river runoffs (except for the Nile) are fully coupled. The atmospheric component of CNRM-RCSM4 is evaluated in a companion paper; here, we focus on the air-sea fluxes, river discharges, surface ocean characteristics, deep water formation phenomena and the Mediterranean thermohaline circulation. Long-term stability, mean seasonal cycle, interannual variability and decadal trends are evaluated using basin-scale climatologies and in-situ measurements when available. We demonstrate that the simulation shows overall good behaviour in agreement with state-of-the-art Mediterranean RCSMs. An overestimation of the shortwave radiation and latent heat loss as well as a cold Sea Surface Temperature (SST) bias and a slight trend in the bottom layers are the primary current deficiencies. Further, CNRM-RCSM4 shows high skill in reproducing the interannual to decadal variability for air-sea fluxes, river runoffs, sea surface temperature and salinity as well as open-sea deep convection, including a realistic simulation of the Eastern Mediterranean Transient. We conclude that CNRM-RCSM4 is a mature modelling tool allowing the climate variability of the Mediterranean regional climate system to be studied and understood.

This is an ambitious goal that will require substantial decreases in emission rates of long-lived greenhouse gasses (GHG). This work provides a mathematical framework, based on current state of the art climate models, to calculate the GHG emissions consistent with prescribed GMST pathways that meet the Paris agreement goal. The unique capability of this framework, to start from a GMST timeseries and efficiently calculate the emissions required to meet that temperature pathway, makes it a powerful resource for policymakers. Our results indicate that aerosol emissions play a large role in determining the near-term allowable greenhouse gas emissions that will limit future warming to 2 degrees C, however in the long term, drastic GHG emissions reductions are required under any reasonable aerosol scenario. With large future aerosol emissions, similar to present day amounts, GHG emissions need to be reduced 8% by 2040 and 74% by 2100 to limit warming to 2 degrees C. Under a more likely low aerosol scenario, GHG emissions need to be reduced 36% and 80% by 2040 and 2100, respectively.

Each decadal prediction consists of simulations over a 10 year period each of which are initialized every five years from climate states of 1960/1961 to 2005/2006. Most of the models overestimate trends, whereby the models predict less warming or even cooling in the earlier decades compared to observations and too much warming in recent decades. All models show high prediction skill for surface temperature over the Indian, North Atlantic and western Pacific Oceans where the externally forced component and low-frequency climate variability is dominant. However, low prediction skill is found over the equatorial and North Pacific Ocean. The Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) index is predicted in most of the models with significant skill, while the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) index shows relatively low predictive skill.

The model helps us grasp the effects of climate change perception and hypothetical shifts in destination attractiveness, as well as threat and coping appraisals in light of tourists' adaptation intentions in coastal destinations. We collected a total of 333 on-site valid questionnaires from domestic tourists at Kenting National Park in Taiwan and analysed the structural relationships in the aforementioned study constructs using structural equation modelling. Our findings show that when tourists have a higher level of perception regarding global climate change, they believe that destination attractiveness will decrease. When presented with scenarios of hypothetical shifts in destination attractiveness, tourists with higher levels of adaptation intention will perceive greater levels of threat to tourism behaviours, as well as higher effectiveness in adaptive measures. We confirmed that the proposed theoretical framework for tourists' adaptation intention toward climate change is useful; the framework also sheds light on tourists' acknowledgement of hypothetical alterations in destination attractiveness caused by climate change, in addition to their psychological adaptations. We discuss theoretical and practical implications.","[Wang, Wei-Ching] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Nanfang Coll, Business Sch, 882 Wenquan Rd, Guangzhou 510970, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Lin, Chung-Hsien] Feng Chia Univ, Dept Land Management, 100 Wenhwa Rd, Taichung 40724, Taiwan; [Lu, Wen-Bor] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Nanfang Coll, Dept Art Design & Creat Ind, 882 Wenquan Rd, Guangzhou 510970, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Lee, Su-Hsin] Natinal Taiwan Normal Univ, Dept Geog, 162 He Ping East Rd,Sect 1, Taipei 10610, Taiwan","Nanfang College, Guangzhou; Sun Yat Sen University; Feng Chia University; Nanfang College, Guangzhou; Sun Yat Sen University","Wang, WC (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Nanfang Coll, Business Sch, 882 Wenquan Rd, Guangzhou 510970, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",weiching39@hotmail.com,,"Lin, Chung-Hsien/0000-0003-0291-6373; Wang, Wei-Ching/0000-0001-9215-600X",,,,,74,15,15,4,38,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1368-3500,1747-7603,,CURR ISSUES TOUR,Curr.

Concurrently, there is growing concern about the effect that rising temperatures may have on species with TSD, potentially producing extremely biased sex ratios or offspring of only one sex. The current state-of the-art in TSD research on sea turtles is reviewed here and, against current paradigm, it is proposed that TSD provides an advantage under warming climates. By means of coadaptation between early survival and sex ratios, sea turtles are able to maintain populations. When offspring survival declines at high temperatures, the sex that increases future fecundity (females) is produced, increasing resilience to climate warming. TSD could have helped reptiles to survive mass extinctions in the past via this model. Flaws in research on sex determination in sea turtles are also identified and it is suggested that the development of new techniques will revolutionize the field.","[Santidrian Tomillo, Pilar] Goldring Gund Marine Biol Stn, Playa Grande, Guancaste, Costa Rica; [Spotila, James R.] Drexel Univ, Dept Biodivers Earth & Environm Sci, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",Drexel University,"Tomillo, PS (corresponding author), Goldring Gund Marine Biol Stn, Playa Grande, Guancaste, Costa Rica.",bibi@leatherback.org,"Santidrián Tomillo, Pilar/N-5406-2014","Santidrián Tomillo, Pilar/0000-0002-6895-7218",Earthwatch Institute; Leatherback Trust,Earthwatch Institute; Leatherback Trust,The authors would like to thank all researchers that have conducted studies on temperature-dependent sex determination on sea turtles over decades as their work has been critical for the development of the ideas discussed here.

My art work is an ongoing series of drawings and paintings of dead birds entitled Adrift in History. In reflecting on the meaning of this artistic practice through environmental narrative and art as a complex site of productive experimentation, I place the experience of grief-regarding both human and animal mortality in our rapidly diminishing environment in the Anthropocene-on display and for interpretation within multiple modalities. This project brings together art, literature, poetry, psychology, philosophy, phenomenology, environmentalism, cultural ecology, anthropology, ornithology, and naturalism to frame the cycle of life, death and transformation. My goal is to juxtapose an ecocritical theoretical lens with the art work to create a discursive intermedial effect-one that asks, reflexively, what the value might be of contemplating, while creating, an interspecies, archetypal image of the soul and its potential emotional resonance in the traumatic contemporary moment of the Anthropocene condition. In Who Is This One?-a recent suite in the series Adrift in History-I dwell on the image of the North American robin-Turdus migratorius-a common backyard species, and one of the many birds now facing great risk. So, I depict the robin at rest, contingently, in a state of limbo between life, death and the after-life. Influenced by Jon Young's environmental narrative, What the Robin Knows: How Birds Reveal the Secrets of the Natural World, and the ecocritical concept of strategic empathy, I represent what the robin might feel. I am interested in how such images-and their capacity to evoke sympathy in the system of affinities between the embodied human mind and the more-than-human world enfolding animals, nature, and the environment as interdependent forces-might contribute to efforts to move us through and beyond grief, toward active investment as answerable, and ethical agents of social change.","[Ramsay, Christine] Univ Regina, Regina, SK, Canada",University of Regina,"Ramsay, C (corresponding author), Univ Regina, Regina, SK, Canada.",christine.ramsay@uregina.ca,,,,,,,68,0,0,0,3,"BABES-BOLYAI UNIV, FAC THEATRE & TELEVISION",CLUJ-NAPOCA,"STR  MIHAIL KOGALNICEANU, NR 1, CLUJ-NAPOCA, 400084, ROMANIA",2067-631X,2559-2068,,EKPRASIS,Ekprasis,,2020,2,,,,167,192,,10.24193/ekphrasis.24.9,http://dx.doi.org/10.24193/ekphrasis.24.9,,,26,"Film, Radio, Television",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),"Film, Radio & Television",PG7RI,,Bronze,,,12/21/22,WOS:000599927900009,View Full Record in Web of Science

First, over the course of a year, sample dwellings and short-term on-site indoor physical environment measurements were selected from the local climate. Then, three building materials, namely, brick, wood, and rammed earth, and different structural forms were selected to simulate the indoor thermal environment, ventilation conditions, and energy consumption of traditional dwellings. The study also summarised the advantages and disadvantages of the physical environment of traditional dwellings in response to climate characteristics. The results showed that the fluctuation in indoor temperature and humidity of typical dwellings in the North Dong region is approximately 5 degrees C, which is 14% lower than that outdoors. Traditional Dong dwellings have good indoor conditioning abilities. Traditional wood structure dwellings can save 26% and 39% of energy per year compared with those of raw earth and brick wood, respectively. Traditional dwellings in the Dong region are well adapted to the local climate in terms of form, materials, and structure and contribute to climate-responsive buildings in the harsh climatic conditions of the region. The solutions used in these dwellings can also be used to design new climate-responsive buildings; however, the indoor thermal comfort is not entirely satisfactory. We proposed an effective adaptation strategy for Dong traditional dwellings.","[Zhang, Fupeng; Shi, Lei; Liu, Simian; Shi, Jiaqi; Ma, Qian; Zhang, Jinyue] Cent South Univ, Sch Architecture & Art, Changsha 410075, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Fupeng; Shi, Lei; Liu, Simian; Shi, Jiaqi; Ma, Qian; Zhang, Jinyue] Cent South Univ, Hlth Bldg Res Ctr, Changsha 410075, Peoples R China",Central South University; Central South University,"Liu, SM (corresponding author), Cent South Univ, Sch Architecture & Art, Changsha 410075, Peoples R China.;Liu, SM (corresponding author), Cent South Univ, Hlth Bldg Res Ctr, Changsha 410075, Peoples R China.",201301004@csu.edu.cn; shilei@csu.edu.cn; 217034@csu.edu.cn; 181301013@csu.edu.cn; 201311004@csu.edu.cn; 151301005@csu.edu.cn,,,,,,,40,3,3,34,53,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JAN,2022,2,,,,,,850,10.3390/su14020850,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14020850,,,19,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,ZB5XB,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000756913700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

We used the state-of-the-art complex, dynamic, mechanistic model GOTM-FABM-PCLake to quantify the impacts of extreme summer warming on a summer-stratified temperate Danish lake. Simulated values of all calibrated parameters (water temperature, DO, NO3, NH4, TN, PO4, TP and Chl.-a) agreed well with observed values over the whole calibration and validation period and generally exhibited the same seasonal dynamics and inter-annual variations as the monitoring data. A series of climate scenarios with different summer heat wave frequencies and duration were set up to quantify the effects on the ecosystem state of the lake. Our simulations showed that summer surface mean TN will decrease with rising summer heat wave frequencies, while summer surface mean TP and Chl.-a and the biomass and proportion of cyanobacteria will increase. Following a summer heat wave, the lake approached baseline conditions in the autumn, but with increasing frequency of heatwaves the recovery period increased. Our results suggest that compliance with existing legislation, such as EU's Water Framework Directive, will become increasingly challenging in a future scenario with increased temperatures and more frequent heatwaves.","[Chou, Qingchuan; Cao, Te; Ni, Leyi] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Hydrobiol, State Key Lab Freshwater Ecol & Biotechnol, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China; [Chou, Qingchuan] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Chou, Qingchuan; Nielsen, Anders; Andersen, Tobias K.; Hu, Fenjuan; Chen, Weiyu; Sondergaard, Martin] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, DK-8600 Silkeborg, Denmark; [Andersen, Tobias K.; Jeppesen, Erik; Trolle, Dennis] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sino Danish Ctr Educ & Res, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Chen, Weiyu] Hohai Univ, Coll Water Conservancy & Hydropower Engn, Nanjing 210098, Peoples R China; [Jeppesen, Erik] Middle East Tech Univ, Dept Biol Sci, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Hydrobiology, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Aarhus University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Hohai University; Middle East Technical University","Chou, QC (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Hydrobiol, State Key Lab Freshwater Ecol & Biotechnol, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China.",chouqc@ihb.ac.cn,"Jeppesen, Erik/O-2667-2019; Søndergaard, Martin/P-2417-2019","Søndergaard, Martin/0000-0002-1514-0482; Trolle, Dennis/0000-0001-7568-2411; Nielsen, Anders/0000-0002-5885-4100; Andersen, Tobias Kuhlmann/0000-0003-1257-2201","China Scholarship Council [201704910729]; Sino-Danish Centre for Education and Research; CASHFISH project - Danish Council for Independent Research; WATExR project through the EU JPI Climate initiative; PROGNOS project through the EU JPI Water initiative; project oMechanistic Models for Water Action Planning - Danish EPA; TUBITAK project [BIDEB2232, 118C250]",China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council); Sino-Danish Centre for Education and Research; CASHFISH project - Danish Council for Independent Research; WATExR project through the EU JPI Climate initiative; PROGNOS project through the EU JPI Water initiative; project oMechanistic Models for Water Action Planning - Danish EPA; TUBITAK project(Turkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Arastirma Kurumu (TUBITAK)),"We are grateful to A.M.

Modeled and observed daily values of mean, minimum and maximum temperature and total precipitation are used to construct transfer functions for the period 1961-1990, which are then applied to the decade 1991-2000, where the results are evaluated. By using a large ensembles of model runs and a long construction period, we take into account both intermodel variability and longer (e.g., decadal) natural climate variability. Results show that the technique performs successfully for all variables over large part of the European continent, for all seasons. In particular, the probability distribution functions (PDFs) of both temperature and precipitation are greatly improved, especially in the tails, i.e., increasing the capability of reproducing extreme events. When the statistics of bias-corrected results are ensemble averaged, the result is very close to the observed ones. The bias correction technique is also able to improve statistics that depend strongly on the temporal sequence of the original field, such as the number of consecutive dry days and the total amount of precipitation in consecutive heavy precipitation episodes, which are quantities that may have a large influence on, e.g., hydrological or crop impact models. Bias-corrected projections of RCMs are hence found to be potentially useful for the assessment of impacts of climate change over Europe.","[Dosio, A.] European Commiss, Inst Environm & Sustainabil, Joint Res Ctr, I-21027 Ispra, VA, Italy; [Paruolo, P.] Univ Insubria, Dept Econ, I-21100 Varese, Italy; [Paruolo, P.] European Commiss, Inst Protect & Secur Citizen, Joint Res Ctr, I-21027 Ispra, VA, Italy",European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site; University of Insubria; European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site,"Dosio, A (corresponding author), European Commiss, Inst Environm & Sustainabil, Joint Res Ctr, Via E Fermi 2749,TP 290, I-21027 Ispra, VA, Italy.",alessandro.dosio@jrc.ec.europa.eu,"Dosio, Alessandro/U-9093-2017","Dosio, Alessandro/0000-0002-6365-9473; Paruolo, Paolo/0000-0002-3982-4889","European Union [036946, 505539]",European Union(European Commission),"The bias correction code used here was developed under the European Union FP6 integrated Project WATCH (contract 036946).

The 2-year leadership residencies were intensive, combining at least 370 hours of professional development with on-the-job training, in which aspiring school principals held either assistant-level administrative or teacher leadership roles.Research Design:Using a difference-in-differences framework with school fixed effects, we estimate the relationship between schools' cumulative exposure to program residents and measures of school climate and student performance. We measure school climate using school-by-semester teacher survey composites. Student performance is captured using school-by-year data on language arts and math scale scores, chronic absence rates, suspension rates, and graduation rates.Findings:In models that allow average time trends to vary between the state and the treatment city, an additional resident-by-year in an administrative role in high schools is linked to an additional 15% of a school-level standard deviation in math scale scores and an additional 3.6 percentage points in graduation rates, but also to an additional 10 percentage points in suspension rates.

Most IPCC AR4 climate models predict excessive snow mass in spring and suffer from a delayed spring snow melt while the onset of the snow accumulation is generally well captured. This positive SWE bias is mainly caused by too heavy snowfall during the winter and spring season. Seasonal cycles of snow cover area (SCA) at continental scales are captured reasonably well by most participating models. Two models clearly overestimate SCA over both Eurasia and North America. Year-to-year variations are reasonably well captured over both Eurasia and North America in winter and spring. The most pronounced underestimation in the interannual SCA variability is generally simulated during snow melt. The pronounced negative SCA trend that has been observed from 1979 to 2000 is only partly reproduced in the AR4 model simulations. Furthermore, the computed trends show a large spread among the models. Results from time slice simulations with the ECHAM5 climate model suggest that accurate sea surface temperatures are vital for correctly predicting SCA trends. Simulated global mean annual surface albedos are slightly above the remote-sensed surface albedo estimates. The participating AR4 models generally reproduce the seasonal cycle of the surface albedo with sufficient accuracy while systematic albedo biases are predicted over both snow-free and snow-covered areas, with the latter being distinctly more pronounced. The study shows that the surface albedo over snow-covered forests is probably too high in various state-of-the-art global climate models. The analysis demonstrates that positive biases in SCA are not necessarily related to positive albedo biases. Furthermore, an overestimation of area-averaged SWEs is not necessarily related to positive SCA anomalies since the relationship between SWE and SCF is highly nonlinear.","Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Roesch, A (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, Univ Str 16, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",andreas.roesch@env.ethz.ch,,,,,,,50,96,102,0,16,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",2169-897X,2169-8996,,J GEOPHYS RES-ATMOS,J.

In Europe this was manifested in the Enlightenment as Galileo, Copernicus and others laid the foundations for the evidence-based natural philosophy which signaled the birth of The Enlightenment. The importance of intellectual and personal freedom for humanitarian advance is clearly manifested in the exponential success of the sciences in conquering many humanitarian problems from starvation and disease to the more obvious technologies that make modern life relatively pleasant for many especially in the developed world. On the down side however has been the reckless thirst of a plethora of governments to exploit the vast powers of the sciences to construct ever more powerful destructive weapons. Since then, the great thinkers from Kant to Russell, scientists from Einstein to Feynman and writers from Whitman to Shaw have repeatedly pointed to the importance of the doubt-based philosophy that is the crucial antidote to the stultifying effect of dogmas of all kinds. Indeed it is only doubt that leaves the road open for all advances in human endeavour. In the 21st Century we have reached a watershed in that the human race now confronts a set of crises significantly more serious than any previously. These threats can only be overcome by an open minded liberal education of the next generation of young people. Before the name Science was coined it had another name, Natural Philosophy' which more adequately describes its primary place in the spectrum of human culture. More important than any other aspect is the fact that Natural Philosophy is the only philosophical construct we have devised to determine Truth with any degree of reliability. As such it should be a primary ethical focus for the education of every child, student and citizen so at the very least they can decide whether what they are being told is actually true. This is also a strong intellectual basis for fostering creativity. For a truly humanitarian global society to evolve, equality of opportunity and personal freedom will be a necessary for all young people whatever their race, colour, nationality and most importantly sex. All technologies have the capacity to benefit society or to be detrimental and so as powerful new technical advances arise there is an onus on everyone to understand some important SET factors. As our modern world is so completely - and precariously - balanced on SET, an understanding of these disciplines by all in positions of responsibility is vital. Although wise decision-making may not be guaranteed by knowledge, common sense suggests that wisdom is an unlikely consequence of ignorance. Education is certainly a key factor and the Internet must be harnessed to improve matters.

Yet, there is a lack of literature that discusses online multifaith spaces.

We begin by outlining the main aims of the multifaith movement and how it responds to global risks. We then review religion and geography literature on space, politics and poetics, and on material religion and embodiment. Next, we discuss third spaces and digital activism, and then present a thematic and aesthetic analysis on the ARRCC website drawing on these theories. We conclude with a summary of our main findings, arguing that mastery of the online realm through digital third spaces and activism, combined with a willingness to partake in real-world, embodied activism, can assist multifaith networks and social networks more generally to develop Netpeace and counter the risks of climate change collaboratively.","[Smith, Geraldine] Univ Tasmania, Sch Social Sci, Sociol & Criminol, Hobart, Tas 7005, Australia; [Halafoff, Anna] Deakin Univ, Sch Humanities & Social Sci, Sociol, Melbourne, Vic 3125, Australia",University of Tasmania; Deakin University,"Smith, G (corresponding author), Univ Tasmania, Sch Social Sci, Sociol & Criminol, Hobart, Tas 7005, Australia.",geraldine.smith@utas.edu.au; anna.halafoff@deakin.edu.au,,"Halafoff, Anna/0000-0003-4274-5951","Australian Research Council, ARC [DP180101664]","Australian Research Council, ARC(Australian Research Council)","This research was supported by the Australian Research Council, ARC Discovery Project: DP180101664.",,61,3,3,0,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2077-1444,,RELIGIONS,Religions,MAR,2020,3,,,,,,105,10.3390/rel11030105,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rel11030105,,,16,Religion,Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;HCI),Religion,LB1UO,,"Green Accepted, Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000524420800020,View Full Record in Web of Science

An outline is presented of the challenges posed by, and the approaches adopted to, tracing the possible evolution of the climate system on these various time-scales. First an overview is provided of the nature of the climate system's natural internal variations and the uncertainty arising from the complexity and non-linearity of the system. Thereafter consideration is given sequentially to the range of extant approaches adopted to study and derive multi-decadal climate projections, seasonal predictions, and significant sub-seasonal weather phenomena. For each of these three time-scales novel results are presented that indicate the nature (and limitations) of the models used to forecast the evolution, and illustrate the techniques adopted to reduce or cope with the forecast uncertainty. In particular, the contributions (i) appear to exemplify that in simple climate models uncertainties in radiative forcing outweigh uncertainties associated with ocean models, (ii) examine forecast skills for a state-of-the-art seasonal prediction system, and (iii) suggest that long-lived weather phenomena can help shape intra-seasonal climate variability.

Simulated SAM index exhibits significant long-term linear trends of different sign depending on the season that are closely related to multi-millennial changes in insolation which was the main driver of long-term climate change in the study period. Interactions between changes in insolation and the SAM are linked to temperature and pressure changes developed through the entire Southern Hemisphere. In fact, model results suggest that insolation changes produced significant changes in extratropical temperature gradients that, in turn, induced changes in pressure gradients synthesized by significant long-term linear trends in the SAM index from Mid- to Late-Holocene. Considering that changes in the SAM index synthetize changes in hemispheric patterns of temperature, pressure and winds, results exposed in this study should be considered as reference for reconstructions of SAM evolution in the last 6000 years from climate proxy archives.","[Silvestri, Gabriel; Berman, Ana Laura] Univ Buenos Aires UBA, CNRS, Inst Franco Argentino Estudio Clima & Impactos, IRL 3351 IFAECI,IRD,UBA,CONICET, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Braconnot, Pascale; Marti, Olivier] Univ Paris Saclay, CNRS, Lab Sci Climat & Environm LSCE, IPSL,UVSQ,CEA, Gif Sur Yvette, France",Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); University of Buenos Aires; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Cite; Universite Paris Saclay; CEA; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Silvestri, G (corresponding author), Univ Buenos Aires UBA, CNRS, Inst Franco Argentino Estudio Clima & Impactos, IRL 3351 IFAECI,IRD,UBA,CONICET, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",gabriels@cima.fcen.uba.ar; alberman@cima.fcen.uba.ar; pascale.braconnot@lsce.ipsl.fr; olivier.marti@lsce.ipsl.fr,,,IPSL Modeling Center; IPSL Climate Graduate School (Investissements d'avenir programme) [ANR-11-IDEX-0004-17-EURE-0006],IPSL Modeling Center; IPSL Climate Graduate School (Investissements d'avenir programme)(French National Research Agency (ANR)),Model developments and infrastructure is supported by the IPSL Modeling Center and benefits from the L-IPSL LABEX and IPSL Climate Graduate School (Investissements d'avenir programme ANR-11-IDEX-0004-17-EURE-0006).,,58,0,0,5,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0930-7575,1432-0894,,CLIM DYNAM,Clim.

Over the last years, the role of forests in climate change has received increased attention. This is due to the observation that not only the atmosphere has a principal impact on vegetation growth but also that vegetation is contributing to local variations of weather resulting in diverse microclimates. The interconnection of plant ecosystems and weather is described and studied as ecoclimates. In this work we take steps towards simulating ecoclimates by modeling the feedback loops between vegetation, soil, and atmosphere. In contrast to existing methods that only describe the climate at a global scale, our model aims at simulating local variations of climate. Specifically, we model tree growth interactively in response to gradients of water, temperature and light. As a result, we are able to capture a range of ecoclimate phenomena that have not been modeled before, including geomorphic controls, forest edge effects, the Foehn effect and spatial vegetation patterning. To validate the plausibility of our method we conduct a comparative analysis to studies from ecology and climatology. Consequently, our method advances the state-of-the-art of generating highly realistic outdoor landscapes of vegetation.","[Palubicki, Wojtek; Makowski, Milosz; Gajda, Weronika] UAM, Umultowska 87, PL-61614 Poznan, Poland; [Hadrich, Torsten; Michels, Dominik L.] KAUST, Visual Comp Ctr, Thuwal 23955, Saudi Arabia; [Pirk, Soren] Adobe Res, 345 Pk Ave, San Jose, CA 95110 USA; [Pirk, Soren] Google Res, Mountain View, CA USA",King Abdullah University of Science & Technology; Adobe Systems Inc.; Google Incorporated,"Palubicki, W (corresponding author), UAM, Umultowska 87, PL-61614 Poznan, Poland.",wojciech.palubicki@amu.edu.pl; milosz.makowski@amu.edu.pl; wersko3@st.amu.edu.pl; torsten.hadrich@kaust.edu.sa; dominik.michels@kaust.edu.sa; soeren.pirk@gmail.com,,,,,,,77,0,0,5,5,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY USA",0730-0301,1557-7368,,ACM T GRAPHIC,ACM Trans.

State-of-the-art climate models, especially coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation models and Regional Climate Models (RCMs) cannot, however, be used to simulate such a large number of scenarios. This paper presents a methodology for obtaining future climate scenarios through a simple scaling methodology. The projections of several key meteorological variables obtained from a few regional climate model runs are scaled, based on different global-mean warming projections drawn in a probability distribution of future global-mean warming. The resulting climate change scenarios are used to drive a hydrological and a water management model to analyse the potential climate change impacts on a water resources system. This methodology enables a joint quantification of the climate change impact uncertainty induced by the global-mean warming scenarios and the regional climate response. It is applied to a case study in Switzerland, a water resources system formed by three interconnected lakes located in the Jura Mountains. The system behaviour is simulated for a control period (1961-1990) and a future period (2070-2099). The potential climate change impacts are assessed through a set of impact indices related to different fields of interest (hydrology, agriculture and ecology). The results obtained show that future climate conditions will have a significant influence on the performance of the system and that the uncertainty induced by the inter-RCM variability will contribute to much of the uncertainty of the prediction of the total impact.

The suggested basis for this risk is the existence of two stable regimes of the AMOC ('on' and 'off'), and such bistable behaviour has been identified in a range of simplified climate models. However, up to now, no state-of-the-art atmosphere-ocean coupled global climate model (AOGCM) has exhibited such behaviour, leading to the interpretation that the AMOC is more stable than simpler models indicate. Here we demonstrate AMOC bistability in the response to freshwater perturbations in the FAMOUS AOGCM - the most complex AOGCM to exhibit such behaviour to date. The results also support recent suggestions that the direction of the net freshwater transport at the southern boundary of the Atlantic by the AMOC may be a useful physical indicator of the existence of bistability. We also present new estimates for this net freshwater transport by the AMOC from a range of ocean reanalyses which suggest that the Atlantic AMOC is currently in a bistable regime, although with large uncertainties. More accurate observational constraints, and an improved physical understanding of this quantity, could help narrow uncertainty in the future evolution of the AMOC and to assess the risk of a rapid AMOC collapse.

In this method, the optimal perturbation in initial conditions is the 1st leading singular vector, calculated from an empirical linear operator based on a historical model integration. To verify this concept, this method is applied to a hybrid coupled model. It is demonstrated that the 1st leading singular vector from the empirical linear operator, to a large extent, represents the fast-growing mode in the nonlinear integration. Therefore, the forecast skill with the optimal perturbations is improved over most lead times and regions. In particular, the improvement of the forecast skill is significant where the signal-to-noise ratio is small, indicating that the optimal perturbation method is effective when the initial uncertainty is large. Therefore, the new optimal perturbation method has the potential to improve current seasonal prediction with state-of-the-art coupled GCMs.","[Kug, Jong-Seong] Korea Ocean Res & Dev Inst, Ansan, South Korea; [Ham, Yoo-Geun; Kang, In-Sik] Seoul Natl Univ, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Seoul, South Korea; [Kimoto, Masahide] Univ Tokyo, Ctr Climate Syst Res, Tokyo, Japan; [Jin, Fei-Fei] Univ Hawaii, SOEST, Dept Meteorol, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA",Korea Institute of Ocean Science & Technology (KIOST); Seoul National University (SNU); University of Tokyo; University of Hawaii System,"Kug, JS (corresponding author), Korea Ocean Res & Dev Inst, Ansan, South Korea.",jskug@kordi.re.kr,"kimoto, masahide/P-9077-2014; KUG, JONG-SEONG/A-8053-2013","KUG, JONG-SEONG/0000-0003-2251-2579","KORDI [PE98425, PP00720, PM55290]; NSF [ATM-0652145, ATM-0650552]; NOAA [GC01-229]; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan","KORDI; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT))","This work was mostly done when J.-S.

Data used are obtained from a multimodel ensemble of AMV +/- experiments conducted in the framework of the Decadal Climate Prediction Project component C. These experiments are performed by nudging the surface of the Atlantic Ocean to states defined by the superimposition of observed AMV +/- anomalies onto the model climatology. A robust extratropical response is found in the form of a wave train extending from the Pacific to the Nordic seas. In the warm phase of the AMV compared to the cold phase, the Atlantic storm track is typically contracted and less extended poleward and the low-level jet is shifted toward the equator in the eastern Atlantic. Despite some robust features, the picture of an uncertain and model-dependent response of the Atlantic jet emerges and we demonstrate a link between model bias and the character of the jet response.","[Ruggieri, Paolo] Univ Bologna, Dept Phys & Astron, Bologna, Italy; [Ruggieri, Paolo; Bellucci, Alessio; Nicoli, Dario; Athanasiadis, Panos J.; Gualdi, Silvio] Ctr Euromediterraneo Cambiamenti Climat, Bologna, Italy; [Gualdi, Silvio] Ist Nazl Geofis & Vulcanol, Rome, Italy; [Cassou, Christophe; Qasmi, Said; Sanchez-Gomez, Emilia] Univ Toulouse, CERFACS, CNRS, CECI, Toulouse, France; [Castruccio, Fred; Danabasoglu, Gokhan] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [Davini, Paolo] CNR, Ist Sci Atmosfera & Clima, Turin, Italy; [Dunstone, Nick; Eade, Rosemary; Hermanson, Leon; Smith, Doug] Met Off, Exeter, Devon, England; [Gastineau, Guillaume] Sorbonne Univ, IPSL, UMR LOCEAN, CNRS,IRD,MNHN, Paris, France; [Harvey, Ben] Univ Reading, Natl Ctr Atmospher Sci, Dept Meteorol, Reading, Berks, England; [Qasmi, Said] Univ Toulouse, CNRS, Meteo France, CNRM, Toulouse, France; [Ruprich-Robert, Yohan; Wild, Simon] Barcelona Supercomp Ctr, Barcelona, Spain; [Zampieri, Matteo] European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Ispra, Italy",University of Bologna; Istituto Nazionale Geofisica e Vulcanologia (INGV); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CERFACS; Universite de Toulouse; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Scienze dell'Atmosfera e del Clima (ISAC-CNR); Met Office - UK; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle (MNHN); UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Universite Paris Cite; UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); NERC National Centre for Atmospheric Science; University of Reading; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Meteo France; Universite de Toulouse; Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya; Barcelona Supercomputer Center (BSC-CNS); European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site,"Ruggieri, P (corresponding author), Univ Bologna, Dept Phys & Astron, Bologna, Italy.;Ruggieri, P (corresponding author), Ctr Euromediterraneo Cambiamenti Climat, Bologna, Italy.",paolo.ruggieri2@unibo.it,"Smith, Doug/ABD-5204-2021; Wild, Simon/I-3673-2012; Gualdi, Silvio/F-3061-2015; Ruggieri, Paolo/X-6334-2018; Qasmi, Saïd/AAE-2339-2019; Davini, Paolo/A-8996-2018; Ruprich-Robert, Yohan/AAU-3208-2020","Wild, Simon/0000-0002-1089-5579; Gualdi, Silvio/0000-0001-7777-8935; Ruggieri, Paolo/0000-0003-1996-7206; Qasmi, Saïd/0000-0002-1825-3896; Davini, Paolo/0000-0003-3389-7849; Ruprich-Robert, Yohan/0000-0002-4008-2026; Athanasiadis, Panos/0000-0003-1249-6624; Danabasoglu, Gokhan/0000-0003-4676-2732; Nicoli, Dario/0000-0001-5890-9346; BELLUCCI, Alessio/0000-0003-3766-1921",H2020 EUCP project [GA 776613]; Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme - BEIS; Defra; NERC North Atlantic Climate System: Integrated Study (ACSIS) project; European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme [800154]; U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) [1852977]; U.S. NSF [OCE-1243015]; U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Climate ProgramOffice under the ClimateVariability and Predictability Program [NA13OAR4310138]; European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Grant [H2020-MSCA-COFUND-2016-754433],"H2020 EUCP project; Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme - BEIS; Defra(Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA)); NERC North Atlantic Climate System: Integrated Study (ACSIS) project; European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme; U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)); U.S. NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Climate ProgramOffice under the ClimateVariability and Predictability Program; European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Grant","The authors are thankful to three anonymous reviewers for valuable comments on an early version of the manuscript.

Similarly, the UNFCCC recognizes the diversity of potential environmental and social risks and benefits that could result from REDD+ implementation. As a result, the UNFCCC adopted a set of social, environmental and governance safeguards, commonly known as Cancun Safeguards. Cancun Safeguards should be addressed and respected throughout REDD+ implementation regardless of the source and type of funding and play a key role in accessing results-based finance. The UNFCCC provides guidance regarding an information system as well as up-to-date reports as information and reporting tools on how all Cancun Safeguards have been addressed and respected. However, the UNFCCC does not offer any guidance on how to consider, assess and/or verify reported information. Given the key role that the Green Climate Fund (GCF) plays in channeling REDD+ results-based finance, this research paper examines early lessons from the GCF's pilot programme for REDD-plus results-based payments (RBPs). It assesses the extent to which REDD+ activities have been implemented in consistency with the Cancun Safeguards. This paper examines the assessment and verification procedures of the GCF's pilot programme. Key informant interviews have been a key source of information. We conclude that assessing the extent to which REDD+ results-based activities have in fact been consistent with Cancun Safeguards is a complex endeavor. Such complexity requires a qualitative approach as well as a dedicated verification procedure. This in turn has not been fully captured in the GCF's pilot programme. Additionally, we conclude that by requiring countries to demonstrate conformance with its interim safeguards in the context of REDD+ results-based finance, the GCF's pilot programme poses a significant burden to countries' abilities to access results-based financing.","[Christen, Daniela Rey; Espinosa, Maria Garcia] Climate Law & Policy, 54 Warwick St, Oxford OX4 1SX, England; [Reumann, Andreas] Songdo Int Business Dist, Green Climate Fund, Independent Evaluat Unit, 175 Art Ctr Daero, Incheon 406840, South Korea; [Puri, Jyotsna] Int Fund Agr Dev, Via Paolo di Dono 4, I-00142 Rome, Italy",,"Christen, DR; Espinosa, MG (corresponding author), Climate Law & Policy, 54 Warwick St, Oxford OX4 1SX, England.",drey@climatelawandpolicy.com; m.garcia@climatelawandpolicy.com; areumann@gcfund.org; jpuri@ifad.org,,,,,,,16,4,4,3,14,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1999-4907,,FORESTS,Forests,DEC,2020,12,,,,,,1350,10.3390/f11121350,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f11121350,,,11,Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Forestry,PJ7EL,,"gold, Green Published",,,12/21/22,WOS:000601925900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here, the relative effects of these factors are evaluated for the Washington, DC metropolitan area water supply for the near (2010-2039), intermediate (2040-2069), and distant (2070-2099) future by repeated water resources model simulations. This system poses water management challenges because of long water-delivery travel times that increase uncertainty, multiple water jurisdictions that constrain potential decisions, and future scenarios that simultaneously increase demand and decrease water supply during the critical summer period. Adaptation strategies were developed for the system using a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm. Optimized reservoir management policies were compared using six distinct objectives ranging from reservoir storage to environmental and recreational benefits. Simulations of future conditions show water stress increasing with time. Reservoir sedimentation is projected to more than double (114% increase) the severity of reservoir storage failures by 2040. Increases in water demand and climate change are projected to further stress the system, causing longer periods of low flow and a loss of recreational reservoir storage. The adoption of optimized rules mitigates some of these effects, most notably returning simulations of 2070-2099 climate to near historical levels. Modifying the balance between upstream and downstream reservoirs improved storage penalties by 20.7% and flowby penalties by 50%. Changing triggers for shifting load to off-line reservoirs improved flowby (8.3%) and environmental (4.1%) penalties slightly, whereas changing demand restriction triggers provided only moderate improvements, but with few adverse effects.

To bridge the gap between the coarse spatial resolution of climate model output and the need for weather and climate information at a higher resolution, downscaling methods have been developed. This research compares several different downscaling methods in their ability to simulate rainfall extremes over the Northeastern United States. The methods compared are a bias-correction and spatial disaggregation technique, the statistical downscaling model (SDSM) and a regional climate model, HadRM3. Validation was done using generalized extreme value (GEV) distributions of annual maxima and return-period estimates. All the different techniques simulated reasonable estimates of extreme rainfall across the northeast. However, the agreement of simulations with observations depended upon the downscaling technique used and the location. The SDSM simulations matched observed extreme climatology the best. HadRM3 tended to overestimate mean precipitation and gave a GEV distribution that did not replicate the observed distribution well and, thus, overestimated the extremes. We then developed high-resolution projections of future changes to rainfall across the Northeast United States, using IPCC SRES emission scenario A2 combined with these downscaling methods. Future projections based on SDSM indicate increases in the magnitude of extreme rainfall events by similar to 7% through the 2041-2060 period with considerable regional variation particularly at the higher 50- and 100-year return periods. However, these projected increases rarely fall outside the 95% confidence intervals based on the observation period from 1961 to 1980. Copyright.

For the southern climate however, there are still some doubts in terms of efficiency. There are more and more CO2-installations in operation, equipped with efficiency increasing technology such as parallel compression or ejectors. The increasing number of CO2-installations and growing experience allows proving the predictions in terms of efficiency that optimised CO2-installations can outclass state of the art refrigerating systems, even in southern climate. In summer 2017, two transcritical CO2 racks with multi-ejector and parallel compression have been commissioned near to Valencia, Spain. The two racks are installed in a fish processing plant and replace a previous installation with R507A.

This approach, along with following the provisions of current international comfort standards, has resulted in higher electricity demand and excessive emissions of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. This paper presents an adaptive thermal comfort field study in library buildings in the tropical Aw climate of Kumasi, Ghana considering naturally-ventilated (NV) and air-conditioned (AC) buildings. The proposed models in this study are compared with existing studies and current international standards. Using the Griffiths coefficient of 0.5, the mean neutral temperature of 27.4 degrees C and 30.3 degrees C were predicted for AC and NV mode, respectively. Although Fanger's predicted mean vote (PMV) method overestimates the extent of changes in thermal sensation votes (TSV) by indoor operative temperature in AC mode, the neutral temperature predicted from PMV (27.8 degrees C) is analogous to the one estimated using TSV. The adaptive equations for Kumasi's hot and humid climate predict higher slopes of 0.17 K-1 and 0.41 K-1 in AC and NV modes, respectively, than the standards; this indicates that the Ghanaian respondents were more sensitive to the outdoor temperature changes. The average difference of 2.1 degrees C in AC mode and 1.8-3.3 degrees C in NV mode were estimated when comparing the proposed model with those in the international standards (C) 2022 The Author(s).

Teleconnection patterns have been determined by two different methods, correlation analysis and empirical orthogonal function analysis. Flow regimes have been determined by analysing the structure of a spherical probability density function in a low-dimensional state space spanned by the three leading empirical orthogonal functions. To assess the ability of state-of-the-art coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs), multi-model simulations for present day conditions, performed for the 4th assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change have been analysed. The comparison with observations reveals, that state-of-the-art AOGCMs are able to describe the low-frequency variability in terms of teleconnections and flow regimes realistically. The analyses of simulations for future climate scenarios reveal changes in the strengths of the centers of action. Concerning climate regimes, two new regimes appear and additionally, slight changes were found in the structure of some regimes.","[Handorf, D.; Dethloff, K.] Res Dept Potsdam, Alfred Wegener Inst Polar & Marine Res, Potsdam, Germany","Helmholtz Association; Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar & Marine Research","Handorf, D (corresponding author), Res Dept Potsdam, Alfred Wegener Inst Polar & Marine Res, Telegrafenberg A43, Potsdam, Germany.",doerthe.handorf@awi.de,"Dethloff, Klaus/B-4879-2014; Handorf, Dorthe/T-1789-2017","Handorf, Dorthe/0000-0002-3305-6882",,,,,67,12,12,0,13,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1951-6355,1951-6401,,EUR PHYS J-SPEC TOP,Eur.

Furthermore, European agriculture, based on highly developed farming techniques, is mainly oriented to high quality food production that is more susceptible to meteorological hazards. These hazards can modify environment-genotype interactions, which can affect the quality of production. The COST 734 Action (Impacts of Climate Change and Variability on European Agriculture), launched in 2006, is composed of 28 signature countries and is funded by the European Commission. The main objective of the Action is the evaluation of possible impacts arising from climate change and variability on agriculture and the assessment of critical thresholds for various European areas. The Action will concentrate on four different tasks: agroclimatic indices and simulation models, including review and assessment of tools used to relate climate and agricultural processes; evaluation of the current trends of agroclimatic indices and model outputs, including remote sensing; developing and assessing future regional and local scenarios of agroclimatic conditions; and risk assessment and foreseen impacts on agriculture. The work will be carried out by respective Working Groups. This paper presents the results of the analysis of the first phase of inventory activity. Specific questionnaires were disseminated among COST 734 countries to collect information on climate change analysis, studies, and impact at the European level. The results were discussed with respect to their spatial distribution in Europe and to identify possible common long- and short-term strategies for adaptation.","[Orlandini, Simone] Univ Florence, Dept Agron & Land Management, I-50144 Florence, Italy; [Nejedlik, Pavol] Slovak Hydrometeorol Inst, Bratislava, Slovakia; [Eitzinger, Josef] Univ Nat Resources & Appl Life Sci BOKU, Inst Meteorol BOKU Met, Working Grp Agrometeorol, Vienna, Austria; [Alexandrov, Vesselin] Natl Inst Meteorol & Hydrol, Sofia, Bulgaria; [Toullios, Leonidas] Natl Agr Res Fdn NAGREF, Larisa, Greece; [Calanca, Pierluigi] Res Stn ART, Agroscope Reckenhol Taenikon, Zurich, Switzerland; [Trnka, Miroslav] Mendel Univ Brno, Inst Agr Syst & Bioclimatol, Brno, Czech Republic; [Olesen, Jorgen E.] Univ Aarhus, Dept Agroecol & Environm, Tjele, Denmark","University of Florence; University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna; Bulgarian Academy of Sciences; Swiss Federal Research Station Agroscope; Mendel University in Brno; Aarhus University","Orlandini, S (corresponding author), Univ Florence, Dept Agron & Land Management, Piazzale Cascine 18, I-50144 Florence, Italy.",simone.orlandini@unifi.it,"Eitzinger, Josef/E-2150-2015; Nejedlik, Pavol/ABD-1146-2021; Alexandrov, Vesselin/GSD-3966-2022; Orlandini, Simone/L-7880-2015; Olesen, Jørgen E/C-2905-2016; Olesen, Jørgen/Y-2857-2019; Trnka, Miroslav/F-9428-2014; Alexandrov, Vesselin/I-2618-2012","Orlandini, Simone/0000-0001-6290-9752; Olesen, Jørgen E/0000-0002-6639-1273; Olesen, Jørgen/0000-0002-6639-1273; Trnka, Miroslav/0000-0003-4727-8379; ",,,,,39,28,28,1,31,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER STREET, HOBOKEN, NJ, UNITED STATES",0077-8923,,978-1-57331-732-0,ANN NY ACAD SCI,Ann.NY Acad.Sci.,,2008,,,,,338,353,,10.1196/annals.1446.013,http://dx.doi.org/10.1196/annals.1446.013,,,16,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences; Multidisciplinary Sciences,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences; Science & Technology - Other Topics,BIS03,19076423,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000262400700016,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this study, the role of each region's anthropogenic BC emissions on domestic air quality and climate is investigated. A ten-year six-member parallel simulation (i.e., with anthropogenic emissions in each region reduced by 0%, 50% or 100%, or increased by 200%, 500% or 1000%) is conducted based on the state-of-the-art Community Earth System Model (CESM). Linearity of the emission-response relationship is examined for a variety of air quality and climate indicators. Generally, a change in BC emissions tend to linearly influence BC concentrations over both source and nearby downwind regions even taking into account the effect of BC-induced climate perturbations. Aerosol optical depth (AOD) and the net radiative flux perturbation at top of atmosphere (TOA) tend to preserve a similar linear relationship to local BC emission changes, with a robust signal confined only to the source areas. However, the response of temperature in most places is inconsistent to BC emission changes. Though the presence of BC in the atmosphere absorbs solar and terrestrial radiation which has a tendency to warm the atmosphere, the perturbed atmospheric circulation induces substantial meridional exchanges of warm and cold air masses, which overpasses the warming tendency of BC exerted on the atmosphere. This indicates that reducing/increasing regional BC emissions immediately ameliorate/deteriorate local air quality proportionally, but the associated effects on climate perturbation may lack a clear trend within the initial 10-year time span.

In addition to being a transportation fuel, biodiesel is also used in some jurisdictions for electricity generation in engines and turbines. The world's biodiesel supply grew from 3.9 billion liters in 2005 to 18.1 billion liters in 2010 and is expected to exceed 33 billion liters in 2016 and reach 41.4 billion liters in 2025, a 25% increase over 2016 levels. Biodiesel prices have been facing downward pressure due to low global petro-diesel prices, however, blending mandates have largely sheltered the biodiesel market by lending consistency to demand. International prices of biodiesel are expected to increase in nominal terms over the next 10 years driven by the recovery of crude oil markets and prices of biofuel feedstock. It should be mentioned that the majority of countries producing biodiesel feedstock also have a vibrant domestic market and most or all of their supply is used to meet domestic mandate-driven demand. This dual role, as both producer and consumer, partially explains the limited international trade in biodiesel feedstocks. Most of the limited biodiesel trade over the next 10 years is expected to be composed of Argentina's exports to the US. While there is a debate on the sustainability of biodiesel, many studies using lifecycle assessment (LCA) have demonstrated that biodiesel results in 20-80% less greenhouse emissions when compared to petro-diesel. As crude oil becomes more energy intensive to extract and refine, expected efficiency gains in biodiesel feedstock production and refining, the commercialization of second-generation biodiesel using nonfood feedstocks, combined with the growing market share of biodiesel will result in further reduction of harmful climate-impacting emissions by replacing petro-diesel with biodiesel.","[Rouhany, Mahbod] Strateg Carbon Management Inc, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1Z1, Canada; [Montgomery, Hugh] UCL, Ctr Human Hlth & Performance, Div Med, London, England",University of London; University College London,"Rouhany, M (corresponding author), Strateg Carbon Management Inc, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1Z1, Canada.",mrouhany@gmail.com,,,,,,,20,24,24,0,4,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2363-7609,2363-761,978-3-030-00985-4; 978-3-030-00984-7,BIOFUEL BIOREFIN TEC,,,2019,,,,,1,14,,10.1007/978-3-030-00985-4_1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-00985-4_1,10.1007/978-3-030-00985-4,,14,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Energy & Fuels,Book Citation Index – Science (BKCI-S),Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Energy & Fuels,BQ1GB,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000575665800002,View Full Record in Web of Science

The relationship between PMV and PET thermal indices and real thermal sensation of subjects was established. The evaluation of acceptable PMV range using the actual thermal sensation vote revealed that the common comfortable PMV range overestimated the thermal comfort with the comfortable PMV range being -0.1 to 0.9 in this climate. As a result, an extended PMV model was utilized to consider the effects of expectancy factor. The PET index has shown a stronger correlation with actual sensation vote where the neutral PET temperature range was determined as 16.4 degrees C to 25.3 degrees C in the field study. Finally, the obtained correlations can be used for predicting actual thermal sensation in designing sustainable and appropriate urban spaces with a high frequency of use and improved comfort level in a campus in the hot-arid climate of Birjand.","[Khalili, Soheila; Fayaz, Rima] Univ Art, Fac Architecture & Urbanism, Dept Architectural Technol, Tehran, Iran; [Zolfaghari, Seyed Alireza] Univ Birjand, Dept Mech Engn, Birjand, Iran",University of Birjand,"Khalili, S (corresponding author), 14 East Saeedi St,Moddares Ave, Birjand 9713664678, South Khorasan, Iran.",s.khalili@student.art.ac.ir,,,,,,,117,1,1,10,16,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-0955,,,URBAN CLIM,Urban CLim.,MAY,2022,,,,,,,101128,10.1016/j.uclim.2022.101128,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.uclim.2022.101128,,,20,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,0N8LM,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000783083300003,View Full Record in Web of Science

The majority of the world's population is susceptible to pathological, infectious disease whose life cycles are sensitive to environmental factors across different physical phases including air, water and soil. Nearly all so-called neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) fall into this category, meaning that future geographic patterns of transmission of dozens of infections are likely to be affected by climate change over the short (seasonal), medium (annual) and long (decadal) term. This review offers an introduction into the terms and processes deployed in modelling climate change and reviews the state of the art in terms of research into how climate change may affect future transmission of NTDs. The 34 infections included in this chapter are drawn from the WHO NTD list and the WHO blueprint list of priority diseases. For the majority of infections, some evidence is available of which environmental factors contribute to the population biology of parasites, vectors and zoonotic hosts. There is a general paucity of published research on the potential effects of decadal climate change, with some exceptions, mainly in vectorborne diseases.","[Booth, Mark] Newcastle Univ, Inst Hlth & Soc, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England",Newcastle University - UK,"Booth, M (corresponding author), Newcastle Univ, Inst Hlth & Soc, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England.",mark.booth@ncl.ac.uk,"Booth, Mark/D-2266-2011","Booth, Mark/0000-0002-5507-888X",,,,,475,26,26,7,49,ELSEVIER ACADEMIC PRESS INC,SAN DIEGO,"525 B STREET, SUITE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0065-308X,2163-6079,978-0-12-815169-3,ADV PARASIT,Adv.Parasitol.,,2018,,,,,39,126,,10.1016/bs.apar.2018.02.001,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/bs.apar.2018.02.001,,,88,Parasitology,Book Citation Index – Science (BKCI-S); Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Parasitology,BK4IY,29753342,"Bronze, Green Published",,,12/21/22,WOS:000436560300003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Its warming rate was only recently matched by recent warming in the region. Unlike recent warming largely attributable to anthropogenic radiative forcing, atmospheric warming during the ETCAW was strongest in the mid-troposphere and is believed to be triggered by an exceptional case of natural climate variability. Nevertheless, ultimate mechanisms and causes for the ETCAW are still under discussion. Here we use state of the art multi-member global circulation models, reanalysis and reconstruction datasets to investigate the internal atmospheric dynamics of the ETCAW. We investigate the role of boreal winter mid-tropospheric heat transport and circulation in providing the energy for the large scale warming. Analyzing sensible heat flux components and regional differences, climate models are not able to reproduce the heat flux evolution found in reanalysis and reconstruction datasets. These datasets show an increase of stationary eddy heat flux and a decrease of transient eddy heat flux during the ETCAW. Moreover, tropospheric circulation analysis reveals the important role of both the Atlantic and the Pacific sectors in the convergence of southerly air masses into the Arctic during the warming event. Subsequently, it is suggested that the internal dynamics of the atmosphere played a major role in the formation in the ETCAW.","[Wegmann, Martin; Bronnimann, Stefan] Univ Bern, Oeschger Ctr Climate Change Res, Bern, Switzerland; [Wegmann, Martin; Bronnimann, Stefan] Univ Bern, Inst Geog, Hallerstr 12, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Compo, Gilbert P.] Univ Colorado, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Compo, Gilbert P.] NOAA Earth Syst Res Lab, Phys Sci Div, R PSD1 325 Broadway, Boulder, CO 80305 USA",University of Bern; University of Bern; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Wegmann, M (corresponding author), Univ Bern, Oeschger Ctr Climate Change Res, Bern, Switzerland.;Wegmann, M (corresponding author), Univ Bern, Inst Geog, Hallerstr 12, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland.",martin.wegmann@giub.unibe.ch,"COMPO, GILBERT P./X-3024-2019","COMPO, GILBERT P./0000-0001-5199-9633; Bronnimann, Stefan/0000-0001-9502-7991","European ERAnet.

In this paper, we analyse adaptive delta management (ADM), a policy development approach that relies on adaptation tipping points and adaptation pathways, used by the Dutch Delta Programme to climate proof the Dutch delta. ADM operationalizes adaptive management ideas for the long term governance of river deltas. Taking a governance perspective, we assess the potential of ADM to contribute to each of the five governance capabilities required to deal with wicked problems: reflexivity, responsiveness, resilience, revitalization and rescaling. We conclude that ADM can contribute substantially to the governance capabilities of resilience (through robustness and flexibility) and rescaling (through addressing the time scale mismatch). ADM has the potential to contribute to the governance capabilities of reflexivity and responsiveness, but also has some characteristics that could result in non-reflexivity and non-responsiveness. Enabling ADM as a policy development approach for long term issues requires a long term commitment to iterative policy revision, flexibility and learning in the broader governance system.","[Dewulf, Art; Termeer, Catrien] Wageningen Univ, Publ Adm & Policy Grp, Hollandseweg 1, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research,"Dewulf, A (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ, Publ Adm & Policy Grp, Hollandseweg 1, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands.",art.dewulf@wur.nl,"Dewulf, Art/C-1271-2010; Dewulf, Art/ABA-7434-2020","Dewulf, Art/0000-0002-4171-7644; Dewulf, Art/0000-0002-4171-7644",,,,,64,22,22,1,22,IWA PUBLISHING,LONDON,"ALLIANCE HOUSE, 12 CAXTON ST, LONDON SW1H0QS, ENGLAND",2040-2244,,,J WATER CLIM CHANGE,J.

J,"Wei, M; Qiao, FL",,,,Wei Meng; Qiao FangLi,,,Attribution analysis for the failure of CMIP5 climate models to simulate the recent global warming hiatus,SCIENCE CHINA-EARTH SCIENCES,,,English,Article,,,,,,Global warming hiatus; Secular trend; MDV; CMIP5 climate models; EEMD,OCEAN HEAT UPTAKE; DECADAL CHANGES; PACIFIC; TEMPERATURE; VARIABILITY; CIRCULATION; SLOWDOWN; DECOMPOSITION; OSCILLATION,"The Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) contains a group of state-of-the-art climate models and represents the highest level of climate simulation thus far. However, these models significantly overestimated global mean surface temperature (GMST) during 2006-2014. Based on the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) method, the long term change of the observed GMST time series of HadCRUT4 records during 1850-2014 was analyzed, then the simulated GMST by 33 CMIP5 climate models was assessed. The possible reason that climate models failed to project the recent global warming hiatus was revealed. Results show that during 1850-2014 the GMST on a centennial timescale rose with fluctuation, dominated by the secular trend and the multi-decadal variability (MDV). The secular trend was relatively steady beginning in the early 20th century, with an average warming rate of 0.0883A degrees C/decade over the last 50 years. While the MDV (with a similar to 65-year cycle) showed 2.5 multi-decadal waves during 1850-2014, which deepened and steepened with time, the alarming warming over the last quarter of the 20th century was a result of the concurrence of the secular warming trend and the warming phase of the MDV, both of which accounted one third of the temperature increase during 1975-1998. Recently the slowdown of global warming emerged as the MDV approached its third peak, leading to a reduction in the warming rate. A comparative analysis between the GMST time series derived from HadCRUT4 records and 33 CMIP5 model outputs reveals that the GMSTs during the historical simulation period of 1850-2005 can be reproduced well by models, especially on the accelerated global warming over the last quarter of 20th century. However, the projected GMSTs and their linear trends during 2006-2014 under the RCP4.5 scenario were significantly higher than observed. This is because the CMIP5 models confused the MDV with secular trend underlying the GMST time series, which results in a fast secular trend and an improper MDV with irregular phases and small amplitudes. This implies that the role of atmospheric CO2 in global warming may be overestimated, while the MDV which is an interior oscillation of the climate system may be underestimated, which should be related to insufficient understanding of key climatic internal dynamic processes. Our study puts forward an important criterion for the new generation of climate models: they should be able to simulate both the secular trend and the MDV of GMST.","[Wei Meng; Qiao FangLi] First Inst Oceanog, State Ocean Adm, Qingdao 266061, Peoples R China; [Wei Meng; Qiao FangLi] Qingdao Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol, Lab Reg Oceanog & Numer Modeling, Qingdao 266237, Peoples R China; [Wei Meng; Qiao FangLi] State Ocean Adm, Key Lab Marine Sci & Numer Modeling, Qingdao 266061, Peoples R China",First Institute of Oceanography (FIO); State Oceanic Administration; Qingdao National Laboratory for Marine Science & Technology; State Oceanic Administration,"Qiao, FL (corresponding author), First Inst Oceanog, State Ocean Adm, Qingdao 266061, Peoples R China.;Qiao, FL (corresponding author), Qingdao Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol, Lab Reg Oceanog & Numer Modeling, Qingdao 266237, Peoples R China.;Qiao, FL (corresponding author), State Ocean Adm, Key Lab Marine Sci & Numer Modeling, Qingdao 266061, Peoples R China.",qiaofl@fio.org.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China-Shandong Joint Fund for Marine Science Research Centers [U1406404]; Transparent Ocean Project [2015ASKJ01]; Ao-Shan Talent Program,National Natural Science Foundation of China-Shandong Joint Fund for Marine Science Research Centers; Transparent Ocean Project; Ao-Shan Talent Program,"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China-Shandong Joint Fund for Marine Science Research Centers (Grant No. U1406404) and the Transparent Ocean Project (Grant No. 2015ASKJ01), the corresponding author is also supported by Ao-Shan Talent Program.",,56,9,11,2,18,SCIENCE PRESS,BEIJING,"16 DONGHUANGCHENGGEN NORTH ST, BEIJING 100717, PEOPLES R CHINA",1674-7313,1869-1897,,SCI CHINA EARTH SCI,Sci.

A time-slice approach is used, whereby the atmospheric general circulation model, HadAM3P, was integrated for two periods, 1960-1990 and 2070-2100, using the SRES A2 scenario. For the first time an ensemble of such experiments was produced, along with appropriate statistical tests for assessing significance. The focus is on changes to the statistics of seasonal means, and includes analysis of both multi-year means and interannual variance. All four seasons are assessed, and anomalies are mapped for surface air temperature, precipitation and snow mass. Mechanisms are proposed where these are dominated by straightforward local processes. In winter, the largest warming occurs over eastern Europe, up to 7 degrees C, mean snow mass is reduced by at least 80% except over Scandinavia, and precipitation increases over all but the southernmost parts of Europe. In summer, temperatures rise by 6-9 degrees C south of about 50 degrees N, and mean rainfall is substantially reduced over the same area. In spring and autumn, anomalies tend to be weaker, but often display patterns similar to the preceding season, reflecting the inertia of the land surface component of the climate system. Changes in interannual variance are substantial in the solsticial seasons for many regions (note that for precipitation, variance estimates are scaled by the square of the mean). In winter, interannual variability of near-surface air temperature is considerably reduced over much of Europe, and the relative variability of precipitation is reduced north of about 50 degrees N. In summer, the (relative) interannual variance of both variables increases over much of the continent.","Hadley Ctr Climate Predict & Res, Met Off, Exeter EX1 3PB, Devon, England",Met Office - UK; Hadley Centre,"Rowell, DP (corresponding author), Hadley Ctr Climate Predict & Res, Met Off, Fitzroy Rd, Exeter EX1 3PB, Devon, England.",dave.rowell@metoffice.gov.uk,"Rowell, David P/AAF-3674-2019","Rowell, David P/0000-0002-6727-1732",,,,,48,130,134,0,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0930-7575,1432-0894,,CLIM DYNAM,Clim.

Studies of historical floods show flood-rich periods that could be associated with climate causes, but there is also a certain growing trend as a result of changes in land use and increased vulnerability. If climate scenarios point to an increase in the torrentiality of precipitation, with longer dry periods and more intense rainfall, there is still a high level of uncertainty in their impact in floods. This paper addresses this issue, also considering the complex role of changes to hazards, vulnerability, exposure and capacity. It presents a synthesis of the state of the art, with particular incidence in the first results of MedECC and the most recent bibliography on floods trend. Conclusions show that floods in this region are mainly consequence of flash-flood events. A common positive trend of flash floods in the past probably due to land use changes and the occupation of flood-prone areas has been found (high confidence). The increase of convective precipitation could also justify this positive trend in the most recent period, in some regions (low confidence). Vulnerabilities to water related hazards are expected to be influenced by the future socio-economic conditions at the regional scale (medium confidence). Although expected changes in flood risks are not univocal, nor evenly distributed, flood impacts will increase in the entire Mediterranean region, mainly as a consequence of global changes in the catchments (land use, vulnerability, exposure), joined in the Northern part of the basin to the increase of heavy rainfalls (medium confidence).","[Carmen Llasat, Maria] Univ Barcelona, Meteorol Res Grp, GAMA, Dept Appl Phys, Barcelona, Spain",University of Barcelona,"Llasat, MC (corresponding author), Univ Barcelona, Meteorol Res Grp, GAMA, Dept Appl Phys, Barcelona, Spain.",carmell@meteo.ub.edu,"Llasat, Maria Carmen/AAB-7873-2020","Llasat, Maria Carmen/0000-0001-8720-4193","Spanish project M-CostAdapt of the FEDER/Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities-AEI [CTM2017-83655-C2R]; INTERREG POCTEFA [EFA210/16/PIRAGUA]","Spanish project M-CostAdapt of the FEDER/Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities-AEI; INTERREG POCTEFA","This paper has received support from the Spanish project M-CostAdapt (CTM2017-83655-C2R) of the FEDER/Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities-AEI, and the project EFA210/16/PIRAGUA, INTERREG POCTEFA 2014-2020.

The survival was overall reduced by hyposalinity and broods varied in response to hyposalinity implying genetic variation in tolerance, with a stronger decrease in genetic diversity in future salinity.

Four levels of resolution are recognized: physiologically based models, population models, ecosystem models, and regional or global models. At the physiological level a number of important processes can be described in great detail, but these models often treat inadequately interactions with nutrient cycles, which operate on longer time scales. Population and ecosystem models can, on the other hand, encapsulate relationships between the plants and the soil system, but at the expense of requiring more ad hoc formulations of processes. At the regional and global scale we have so far only steady-state models, which cannot be used to predict transients caused by climate change. However, our conclusion is that, in spite of the gaps in knowledge, there are several models based on dominant processes that are well enough understood for the predictions of those models to be taken seriously.","CSIRO, DIV FORESTRY & FOREST PROD, QUEEN VICTORIA TERRACE, ACT 2600, AUSTRALIA; COLORADO STATE UNIV, NAT RESOURCE ECOL LAB, FT COLLINS, CO 80523 USA; NAT RESOURCES RES INST, DULUTH, MN 55811 USA; UNIV VIRGINIA, DEPT ENVIRONM SCI, CHARLOTTESVILLE, VA 22903 USA",Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Colorado State University; University of Virginia,"AGREN, GI (corresponding author), SWEDISH UNIV AGR SCI, DEPT ECOL & ENVIRONM RES, BOX 7072, S-75007 UPPSALA, SWEDEN.",,"Shugart, Herman/C-5156-2009","Shugart, Herman/0000-0002-1766-8379",,,,,134,143,151,0,39,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1051-0761,1939-5582,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

Here we explore the implications of the highest and lowest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change emissions pathways for climate change and associated impacts in California. Based on climate projections from two state-of-the-art climate models with low and medium sensitivity (Parallel Climate Model and Hadley Centre Climate Model, version 3, respectively), we find that annual temperature increases nearly double from the lower B1 to the higher A1fi emissions scenario before 2100. Three of four simulations also show greater increases in summer temperatures as compared with winter. Extreme heat and the associated impacts on a range of temperature-sensitive sectors are substantially greater under the higher emissions scenario, with some interscenario differences apparent before midcentury. By the end of the century under the B1 scenario, heatwaves and extreme heat in Los Angeles quadruple in frequency while heat-related mortality increases two to three times; alpine/subalpine forests are reduced by 50-75%; and Sierra snowpack is reduced 30-70%. Under A1fi, heatwaves in Los Angeles are six to eight times more frequent, with heat-related excess mortality increasing five to seven times; alpine/subalpine forests are reduced by 75-90%; and snowpack declines 73-90%, with cascading impacts on runoff and streamflow that, combined with projected modest declines in winter precipitation, could fundamentally disrupt California's water rights system. Although interscenario differences in climate impacts and costs of adaptation emerge mainly in the second half of the century, they are strongly dependent on emissions from preceding decades.","ATMOS Res & Consulting, South Bend, IN 46601 USA; Scripps Inst Oceanog, Climate Res Div, Div Water Resources, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; Carnegie Inst Washington, Dept Global Ecol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Union Concerned Sci, Cambridge, MA 02238 USA; Santa Clara Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Santa Clara, CA 95053 USA; Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Earth Sci, Atmosphere & Ocean Sci Grp, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Environm & Societal Impacts Grp, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; Stanford Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Stanford Univ, Inst Int Studies, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; USDA, Forest Serv, Corvallis Forestry Sci Lab, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Univ Delaware, Dept Geog, Clin Res Ctr, Newark, DE 19716 USA; Kent State Univ, Dept Geog, Kent, OH 44242 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego; Scripps Institution of Oceanography; Carnegie Institution for Science; Santa Clara University; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; Stanford University; Stanford University; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of Delaware; University System of Ohio; Kent State University; Kent State University Kent; Kent State University Salem,"Hayhoe, K (corresponding author), ATMOS Res & Consulting, 809 W Colfax Ave, South Bend, IN 46601 USA.",hayhoe@atmosresearch.com,"Nicholas, Kimberly A./W-7096-2019; Neilson, Ronald P/A-8588-2009; Maurer, Edwin P/C-7190-2009","Nicholas, Kimberly A./0000-0002-4756-7851; Maurer, Edwin P/0000-0001-7134-487X",,,,,34,608,627,7,201,NATL ACAD SCIENCES,WASHINGTON,"2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA",0027-8424,,,P NATL ACAD SCI USA,Proc.

We consider the nature of climate drift in such a model, and in particular address the question of whether or not climate drift is inherent to the model, or whether the drift can be averted by a suitable choice of initial conditions or coupling procedure. The ''synchronous'' approach to coupling was adopted in which the ocean, atmosphere and sea ice models were spun-up independently to equilibrium using climatological forcing fields. The models were then coupled and integrated forward in time. Several experiments were performed which were designed to assess the impact of different coupling methodologies and changes in the initial conditions of the component models on the climate drift of the system. The results of our experiments indicate that climate drift is a problem inherent to the coupled model in that systematic errors in the components lead to incompatibilities in the surface fluxes required by the component models to maintain realistic climatologies. We conclude that climate drift can be averted only if the parameterizations of certain important physical processes are improved which should have the effect of reducing or eliminating these incompatibilities.","CSIRO,DIV ATMOSPHER RES,MORDIALLOC,VIC 3195,AUSTRALIA",Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),,,,,,,,,33,25,25,0,0,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0930-7575,,,CLIM DYNAM,Clim.

The increasing efforts on reducing building energy use over the recent years have resulted in improved insulated and airtight buildings. Reduced infiltration can result in poor indoor air quality owing to insufficient ventilation rates. In cold climates, an energy-efficient mechanical ventilation system with heat recovery provides controlled airflow rates and thereby ensures healthy indoor air quality while using a limited amount of energy. This is of particular importance during the heating season when the windows and doors are closed to sustain indoor thermal comfort. This review examines the various heat recovery technologies employed in residential buildings, including state-of-the-art approaches adapted to cold climates. These technologies were compared in terms of various criteria. Frosting has been observed frequently in heat exchangers used in cold regions, which reduces their performance. Various frosting control strategies were discussed in this review including frosting prevention and defrosting. Currently, available frost control strategies degrade indoor air quality or result in increased energy consumption. Finally, The effects of applying heat recovery for mechanical ventilation on indoor air quality were addressed. Based on the current review, recommendations for future research are proposed.","[Bai, H. Y.; Alonso, M. Justo; Mathisen, H.

The installation was designed to experiment with two propositions: (1) that there is value in public engagement with sustainability based on the exploration and articulation of deeply held beliefs about the world-the worldviews, values, and presuppositions that mediate perception and action; (2) that there is value in replacing the infocentric tendency of most public engagement on sustainability with an approach premised in aesthetics and experiential resonance.

Visual images in different media, including rock art, represent one of the ways in which these complex relationships take place. While in the New World few comparative analyses of archaeofaunal and visual data have been addressed, in the Old World these studies have been framed by a dichotomist view between drawn (thought) and consumed (eaten) understanding, both terms as separate and disconnected social realms. This view also structures an abstract, non-pragmatic, rather passive, world drawn in art, against a concrete, practical, active world of consumption. The analysis we present here, based on principles of substantive economy theory, explores the relation between humans and animals in the prehistory of the Atacama Desert (ca. 13,000-410 BP), by comparing visual images of fauna depicted in rock art (engravings and paintings) with archaeofaunal remains from domestic and funerary contexts. The dataset (comprised of 1534 archaeofaunal items and 729 rock art animal motifs from 117 sites) was standardized by calculating the percentage of ubiquity of each animal item per period of time, using Spearman's rank correlation coefficients to identify synchronic and diachronic changes in the relative importance of certain animals consumed. We observed important temporal and contextual variations in the consumption of animals drawn in rock art in the Atacama Desert, and we conclude that they reflect a selection of a wide range of ritual and utilitarian, but not mutually exclusive, functions. In particular, images of camelids emphasized the importance of providing fiber for the creation of textile artifacts and camelid use as pack animals in the caravan trade, both activities that were fundamental in the economy of local societies.

The learning goals of the curriculum in this study included learning about both computational thinking and climate science. Including computer science in science classrooms also means a shift in the focus on design and creation of artifacts and attendant practices. One such design practice, widespread in the design and arts fields, is critique. This paper explores the role of critique in two urban, heterogenous 8th grade science classrooms in which students engaged in creating computer games on the topic of climate systems and climate change. It explores and compares how practices of critique resulted from curricular decisions to (i) scaffold intentional critique sessions for student game designers and (ii) allow for spontaneous feedback as students interacted with each other and their games during the process of game creation. Results: Although we designed formal opportunities for critique, the participatory dimension of the project meant that students were free to critique each other's games at any time during the building process and did so voluntarily. Data indicate that students focused much more on the game play dimension of the design than the science, particularly in those critique sessions that were student-initiated. Despite the de-emphasis on science in spontaneous critiques, students still focused on several dimensions of computational thinking, considering user experience, troubleshooting, modeling, and elegance of solutions. Conclusions: Students making games about science topics should have opportunities for both formal and spontaneous critiques. Spontaneous critiques allow for students to be authorities of knowledge and to determine what is acceptable and what is not. However, formal, teacher-designed critiques may be necessary for students to focus on science as part of the critique. Furthermore, one of the benefits to critiquing others was that students were able to see what others had done, how they had set up their games, the content they included, and how they had programmed certain features. Lastly, critiques can help facilitate iteration as students work to improve their games.","[Tucker-Raymond, Eli] Boston Univ, 2 Silber Way, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Puttick, Gillian; Cassidy, Michael] TERC, 2067 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02140 USA; [Harteveld, Casper; Troiano, Giovanni M.] Northeastern Univ, 102 Ryder Hall,360 Huntington Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA",Boston University; Northeastern University,"Tucker-Raymond, E (corresponding author), Boston Univ, 2 Silber Way, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",etuckerr@bu.edu,"Harteveld, Casper/AAO-3308-2021","Harteveld, Casper/0000-0002-8164-0303; Tucker-Raymond, Eli/0000-0002-7196-8655",National Science Foundation [1542954],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),This material is based upon the work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 1542954.

The models employed for these simulations were: (i) a fully coupled atmosphere-ocean global climate model (AOGCM), and (ii) a regional atmospheric climate model (RCM) to dynamically downscale results from the global model for a more detailed investigation of European climate conditions. The vegetation was simulated off-line by a dynamic vegetation model forced by the climate from the RCM. The resulting vegetation was then compared with the a priori vegetation used in the first simulation. In a subsequent step, the RCM was rerun to yield a new climate more consistent with the simulated vegetation. Forcing conditions included orbital forcing, land-sea distribution, ice-sheet configuration, and atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations representative for 44 ka BP. The results show a cold climate on the global scale, with global annual mean surface temperatures 5 degrees C colder than the modern climate. This is still significantly warmer than temperatures derived from the same model system for the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Regional, northern European climate is much colder than today, but still significantly warmer than during the LGM. Comparisons between the simulated climate and proxy-based sea-surface temperature reconstructions show that the results are in broad agreement, albeit with a possible cold bias in parts of the North Atlantic in summer. Given a prescribed restricted Marine Isotope Stage 3 ice-sheet configuration, with large ice-free regions in Sweden and Finland, the AOGCM and RCM model simulations produce a cold and dry climate in line with the restricted ice-sheet configuration during GS 12. The simulated temperature climate, with prescribed ice-free conditions in south-central Fennoscandia, is favourable for the development of permafrost, but does not allow local ice-sheet formation as all snow melts during summer.","[Kjellstrom, Erik; Strandberg, Gustav] Swedish Meteorol & Hydrol Inst, SE-60176 Norrkoping, Sweden; [Brandefelt, Jenny] KTH, Dept Mech, Linne Flow Ctr, SE-10044 Stockholm, Sweden; [Naslund, Jens-Ove] Swedish Nucl Fuel & Waste Management Co SKB, SE-10240 Stockholm, Sweden; [Smith, Ben] Lund Univ, Geocentrum 2, SE-22362 Lund, Sweden; [Voelker, Antje H.

While several studies investigated the savannization of, e.g., the Amazon rainforest, few studies considered the influence of fire. Fire is expected to potentially shift the savanna-forest boundary and hence impact the dynamical equilibrium between these two possible vegetation states under changing climate. To investigate the climate-induced hysteresis in pan-tropical forests and the impact of fire under future climate conditions, we employed the Earth system model CM2Mc, which is biophysically coupled to the fire-enabled state-of-the-art dynamic global vegetation model LPJmL. We conducted several simulation experiments where atmospheric CO2 concentrations increased (impact phase) and decreased from the new state (recovery phase), each with and without enabling wildfires. We find a hysteresis of the biomass and vegetation cover in tropical forest systems, with a strong regional heterogeneity. After biomass loss along increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations and accompanied mean surface temperature increase of about 4 degrees C (impact phase), the system does not recover completely into its original state on its return path, even though atmospheric CO2 concentrations return to their original state. While not detecting large-scale tipping points, our results show a climate-induced hysteresis in tropical forest and lagged responses in forest recovery after the climate has returned to its original state. Wildfires slightly widen the climate-induced hysteresis in tropical forests and lead to a lagged response in forest recovery by ca. 30 years.","[Drueke, Markus; von Bloh, Werner; Sakschewski, Boris; Wunderling, Nico; Petri, Stefan; Thonicke, Kirsten] Leibniz Assoc, Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, POB 60 12 03, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany; [Drueke, Markus; Wunderling, Nico] Humboldt Univ, Linden 6, D-10099 Berlin, Germany; [Wunderling, Nico] Univ Potsdam, Inst Phys & Astron, D-14476 Potsdam, Germany; [Cardoso, Manoel] Inst Nacl Pesquisas Espaciais, Av Astronautas,1-758 Jardim Granja, BR-12227010 Sao Jose Dos Campos, SP, Brazil; [Barbosa, Henrique M.

Recent work suggests an increase in recent decades in the occurrence of QRA-favorable conditions and associated extreme weather, possibly linked to amplified Arctic warming and thus a climate change influence. Here, we isolate a specific fingerprint in the zonal mean surface temperature profile that is associated with QRA-favorable conditions.

This study focuses on obtaining and/or calculating an efficient angle of the MDF, which would lead to the optimum performance in daylight availability and energy consumption in a single south-faced official space located in the hot-arid climate of Yazd, Iran. Design/methodology/approach The methodology consists of three fundamental parts: (1) based on previous related studies, a diamond-based dynamic skin facade was applied to a south-faced office building in a hot-arid climate; (2) the daylighting and energy performance of the model were simulated annually; and (3) the data obtained from the simulation were compared to reach the optimum angle of the MDF. Findings The results showed that when the angle of the MDF openings was set at 30 degrees, it could decrease energy consumption by 41.32% annually, while daylight simulation pointed that the space experienced the minimum possible glare at this angle. Therefore, the angle of 30 degrees was established as the optimum angle, which could be the basis for future investment in responsive building envelopes. Originality/value This angular study simultaneously assesses the daylight availability, visual comfort and energy consumption on a MDF in a hot-arid climate.","[Golzan, Seyedeh Samaneh; Pouyanmehr, Mina] Univ Art, Tehran, Iran; [Sadeghi Naeini, Hassan] Iran Univ Sci & Technol, Tehran, Iran",Iran University Science & Technology,"Pouyanmehr, M (corresponding author), Univ Art, Tehran, Iran.",s.samaneh.golzan@gmail.com; mina.pouyanmehr@gmail.com; naeini@iust.ac.ir,"Pouyanmehr, Mina/AAN-2614-2021; Sadeghi Naeini, Hassan/E-1218-2016","Pouyanmehr, Mina/0000-0002-5419-9815; Sadeghi Naeini, Hassan/0000-0003-4094-0809",,,,,30,2,2,1,3,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",2046-6099,2046-6102,,SMART SUSTAIN BUILT,Smart Sustain.

A strong MCT hinders the penetration of moisture bearing easterlies from the South Indian Ocean into the mainland, thus reducing rainfall there and vice versa for weak MCT summers. Given the link between the MCT and rainfall, it is important to analyse how climate models represent the trough. Here, output from 20 models within the CMIP6 ensemble of Coupled General Circulation Models (CGCMs) are analyzed to investigate how state-of-the-art CGCMs represent the MCT and its link to southern African rainfall. Overall, the ensemble mean insignificantly underestimates the observed MCT. There is a large spread among the models, with the strength of the MCT significantly correlated with the Froude number based on the mountain height over Madagascar. In models, the vorticity tendency in the MCT area is dominated by the stretching and friction terms, whereas the vertical advection, tilting and residual terms dominate in the ERA5 reanalysis. The link between MCT and rainfall in the southern African subcontinent is missing in the models. Large rainfall biases are depicted over mainland even in models with a very strong MCT. It is found that the impacts of the MCT in the models could be masked by a complex mix of processes such as the strength of the Angola low, moisture fluxes from the Indian and South Atlantic Oceans as well as overestimated convection in the Mozambique Channel area.","[Barimalala, Rondrotiana] Norwegian Res Ctr, Bergen, Norway; [Barimalala, Rondrotiana; Reason, Chris J.

The Arabian Peninsula is becoming increasingly significant in the story of human dispersals out of Africa during the Late Pleistocene. Although characterised largely by arid environments today, emerging climate records indicate that the peninsula was wetter many times in the past, suggesting that the region may have been inhabited considerably more than hitherto thought. Explaining the origins and spatial distribution of increased rainfall is challenging because palaeoenvironmental research in the region is in an early developmental stage. We address environmental oscillations by assembling and analysing an ensemble of five global climate models (CCSM3, COSMOS, HadCM3, KCM, and NorESM). We focus on precipitation, as the variable is key for the development of lakes, rivers and savannas. The climate models generated here were compared with published palaeoenvironmental data such as palaeolakes, speleothems and alluvial fan records as a means of validation. All five models showed, to varying degrees, that the Arabia Peninsula was significantly wetter than today during the Last Interglacial (130 ka and 126/125 ka timeslices), and that the main source of increased rainfall was from the North African summer monsoon rather than the Indian Ocean monsoon or from Mediterranean climate patterns. Where available, 104 ka (MIS 5c), 56 ka (early MIS 3) and 21 ka (LGM) timeslices showed rainfall was present but not as extensive as during the Last Interglacial. The results favour the hypothesis that humans potentially moved out of Africa and into Arabia on multiple occasions during pluvial phases of the Late Pleistocene. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

The models apply linear response theory to reproduce the characteristics of the climate response to external forcing computed with sophisticated state-of-the-art climate models like general circulation models of the physical ocean-atmosphere system and three-dimensional oceanic-plus-terrestrial carbon cycle models. Although highly computer efficient, IRF models are nonetheless capable of reproducing the full set of climate-change information generated by the complex models against which they are calibrated. While limited in principle to the linear response regime (less than about 3 degreesC global-mean temperature change), the applicability of the IRF model presented has been extended into the nonlinear domain through explicit treatment of the climate system's dominant nonlinearities: CO2 chemistry in ocean water, CO2 fertilization of land biota, and sublinear radiative forcing. The resultant nonlinear impulse-response model of the coupled carbon cycle-climate system (NICCS) computes the temporal evolution of spatial patterns of climate change for four climate variables of particular relevance for climate impact studies: near-surface temperature, cloud cover, precipitation, and sea level. The space-time response characteristics of the model are derived from an EOF analysis of a transient 850-year greenhouse warming simulation with the Hamburg atmosphere-ocean general circulation model ECHAM3-LSG and a similar response experiment with the Hamburg carbon cycle model HAMOCC. The model is applied to two long-term CO2 emission scenarios, demonstrating that the use of all currently estimated fossil fuel resources would carry the Earth's climate far beyond the range of climate change for which reliable quantitative predictions are possible today, and that even a freezing of emissions to present-day levels would cause a major global warming in the long term.","Max Planck Inst Meteorol, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany; Univ Bern, Inst Phys, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland",Max Planck Society; University of Bern,"Hooss, G (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Meteorol, Bundesstr 55, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany.",,"Joos, Fortunat/B-4118-2018","Joos, Fortunat/0000-0002-9483-6030",,,,,53,73,73,1,17,SPRINGER-VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0930-7575,,,CLIM DYNAM,Clim.

Thus, this research used a qualitative methodology based on ENVI-met software to study, investigate, and compare the thermal performance of two urban fabrics as case studies (traditional and modern districts) in the hot, arid climate of the United Arab Emirates. The thermal performance of the old urban districts was better than the new ones, with a lower maximum potential air temperature and an improvement in the level of thermal comfort, measured by a predicted mean vote. Moreover, it was found that enhancing the shade in the outdoor open areas in the modern district, mimicking the traditional passive design solutions, resulted in lower air temperature and PMVs.

The process is a result of the difference in saturation vapor pressures with respect to liquid and ice, and may in some circumstances lead to abrupt and complete cloud glaciation at temperatures between -40 degrees C and 0 degrees C in the Earth's atmosphere. The process is named after three eminent scientists who were active in the first half of the 20th century, among them being German meteorologist Walter Findeisen (1909-1945). In his classical paper published in 1938, Findeisen described the contemporary understanding of the Wegener-Bergeron-Findeisen process and other key cloud microphysical processes. Here, we compare the understanding of the aforementioned processes at the time with that of the present, and find that they are remarkably similar. We also discuss how the Wegener-Bergeron-Findeisen process is implemented in state-of-the-art numerical models of the atmosphere, and highlight its importance for both weather and climate.","[Storelvmo, Trude; Tan, Ivy] Yale Univ, Dept Geol & Geophys, New Haven, CT 06511 USA",Yale University,"Storelvmo, T (corresponding author), Yale Univ, Dept Geol & Geophys, POB 6666, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.",trude.storelvmo@yale.edu,,"Tan, Ivy/0000-0003-4203-4770; Storelvmo, Trude/0000-0002-0068-2430",Div Atmospheric & Geospace Sciences [1352417] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,Div Atmospheric & Geospace Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)),,,37,32,32,2,28,E SCHWEIZERBARTSCHE VERLAGSBUCHHANDLUNG,STUTTGART,"NAEGELE U OBERMILLER, SCIENCE PUBLISHERS, JOHANNESSTRASSE 3A, D 70176 STUTTGART, GERMANY",0941-2948,1610-1227,,METEOROL Z,Meteorol.

We use selected proxy-based reconstructions of different climate variables, together with state-of-the-art time series of natural forcings (orbital variations, solar activity variations, large tropical volcanic eruptions, land cover and greenhouse gases), underpinned by results from General Circulation Models (GCMs) and Earth System Models of Intermediate Complexity (EMICs), to establish a comprehensive explanatory framework for climate changes from the Mid-Holocene (MH) to pre-industrial time. The redistribution of solar energy, due to orbital forcing on a millennia] timescale, was the cause of a progressive southward shift of the Northern Hemisphere (NH) summer position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). This was accompanied by a pronounced weakening of the monsoon systems in Africa and Asia and increasing dryness and desertification on both continents. The associated summertime cooling of the NH, combined with changing temperature gradients in the world oceans, likely led to an increasing amplitude of the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and, possibly, increasingly negative North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) indices up to the beginning of the last millennium. On decadal to multi-century timescales, a worldwide coincidence between solar irradiance minima, tropical volcanic eruptions and decadal to multi-century scale cooling events was not found. However, reconstructions show that widespread decadal to multi-century scale cooling events, accompanied by advances of mountain glaciers, occurred in the NH (e.g., in Scandinavia and the European Alps). This occurred namely during the Little Ice Age (LIA) between AD similar to 1350 and 1850, when the lower summer insolation in the NH, due to orbital forcing, coincided with solar activity minima and several strong tropical volcanic eruptions. The role of orbital forcing in the NH cooling, the southward ITCZ shift and the desertification of the Sahara are supported by numerous model simulations. Other simulations have suggested that the fingerprint of solar activity variations should be strongest in the tropics, but there is also evidence that changes in the ocean heat transport took place during the LIA at high northern latitudes, with possible additional implications for climates of the Southern Hemisphere (SH).

In particular, we study how energy system and economy-wide models include and quantify rebound effects-the gap between actual and expected saving or the behavioral adjustment in response to an energy efficiency improvement, in terms of energy or greenhouse gas emissions. First, we explain the interaction between drivers of energy efficiency improvements, energy efficiency policies, and the rebound effect to provide a framework for a general theoretical revision from micro- to macro-economic levels. Using this classification, we analyze rebound effect representations in empirical models by four dimensions: actors (industry or the production side, and private households or the consumption side), the aggregation level (from micro- to macro-economic levels), income level (developed or developing countries), and time (short- and long-run). Furthermore, we review rebound effect studies whose models focus on three drivers of energy efficiency improvements: market-based policies, non-market-based policies, and a costless energy efficiency improvement that holds other attributes constant (zero-cost breakthrough). We find that a clear representation of one or simultaneous drivers of energy efficiency improvements is crucial to target the goals of energy savings, greenhouse gas mitigation, and welfare gains. Under this broader view, the rebound effect is one additional phenomenon to be taken into consideration. This perspective provokes and provides additional policy implications. Reporting rebound effects as a stand-alone percentage is not sufficiently informative for policy considerations and the distinction of the aggregation level is important to asses the scalability of energy efficiency policies. Finally, we identify some ideas and motivations for future research.","[Colmenares, Gloria; Loeschel, Andreas] Univ Munster, Ctr Appl Econ Res Munster CAWM, Stadtgraben 9, D-48143 Munster, Germany; [Loeschel, Andreas] Univ Int Business & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Loeschel, Andreas] ZEW Leibniz Ctr European Econ Res, Mannheim, Germany; [Madlener, Reinhard] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Inst Future Energy Consumer Needs & Behav FCN, Sch Business & Econ, EON Energy Res Ctr, Mathieustr 10, D-52074 Aachen, Germany; [Madlener, Reinhard] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Ind Econ & Technol Management, Sentralbygg 1, N-7491 Trondheim, Gloshaugen, Norway",University of Munster; University of International Business & Economics; Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW); E-ON; RWTH Aachen University; Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Colmenares, G (corresponding author), Univ Munster, Ctr Appl Econ Res Munster CAWM, Stadtgraben 9, D-48143 Munster, Germany.",g_colm01@uni-muenster.de; andreas.loeschel@uni-muenster.de; rmadlener@eonerc.rwth-aachen.de,"Löschel, Andreas/AAG-6699-2020","Löschel, Andreas/0000-0002-3366-8053; Colmenares, Gloria/0000-0003-2204-5296",111 Project by the Chinese Ministry of Education [B18014]; State Administration of Foreign Experts Affairs; Katholischer Akademischer Auslander-Dienst (KAAD),111 Project by the Chinese Ministry of Education; State Administration of Foreign Experts Affairs; Katholischer Akademischer Auslander-Dienst (KAAD),Andreas Loschel acknowledges support from the 111 Project [grant number B18014] by the Chinese Ministry of Education and the State Administration of Foreign Experts Affairs.

We conclude that the best evidence for evolutionary shifts in response to changing winters remain those related to changes in phenology, but all evidence points to cold hardiness as also having the potential to evolve in response to climate change.

The measures are mitigation of greenhouse gases (GHG) and adaptation to climate change based on the State-of-Art technologies.

Hourly rainfall is simulated over Southern Africa for 1998-2006 by the non-hydrostatic model weather research and forecasting (WRF), and compared to a network of 103 stations covering South Africa. We used five simulations, four of which consist of different parameterizations for atmospheric convection at a 0.5 x 0.5A degrees resolution, performed to test the physic-dependency of the results. The fifth experiment uses explicit convection over tropical South Africa at a 1/30A degrees resolution. WRF simulates realistic mean rainfall fields, albeit wet biases over tropical Africa. The model mean biases are strongly modulated by the convective scheme used for the simulations. The annual cycle of rainfall is well simulated over South Africa, mostly influenced by tropical summer rainfall except in the Western Cape region experiencing winter rainfall. The diurnal cycle shows a timing bias, with atmospheric convection occurring too early in the afternoon, and causing too abundant rainfall. This result, particularly true in summer over the northeastern part of the country, is weakly physic-dependent. Cloud-resolving simulations do not clearly reduce the diurnal cycle biases. In the end, the rainfall overestimations appear to be mostly imputable to the afternoon hours of the austral summer rainy season, i.e., the periods during which convective activity is intense over the region.","[Pohl, Benjamin] Univ Burgundy, Ctr Rech Climatol, CNRS, Biogeosci UMR6282, F-21000 Dijon, France; [Rouault, Mathieu] Univ Cape Town, Dept Oceanog, Mare Inst, ZA-7925 Cape Town, South Africa; [Rouault, Mathieu] Univ Cape Town, Nansen Tutu Ctr Marine Environm Res, ZA-7925 Cape Town, South Africa; [Sen Roy, Shouraseni] Univ Miami, Dept Geog & Reg Studies, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); Universite de Bourgogne; University of Cape Town; University of Cape Town; University of Miami,"Pohl, B (corresponding author), Univ Burgundy, Ctr Rech Climatol, CNRS, Biogeosci UMR6282, 6 Blvd Gabriel, F-21000 Dijon, France.",benjamin.pohl@u-bourgogne.fr,"Pohl, Benjamin/L-7696-2017; Rouault, Mathieu/A-5022-2008; Pohl, Benjamin/AAW-8018-2020; Roy, Shouraseni/ABF-5185-2021","Pohl, Benjamin/0000-0002-9339-797X; Rouault, Mathieu/0000-0002-3207-6777; Roy, Shouraseni/0000-0003-4158-7082",CNRS; NRF; WRC; ACCESS; Nansen-Tutu Center,CNRS(Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)); NRF; WRC; ACCESS; Nansen-Tutu Center,"This work is a contribution to the LEFE/IDAO VOASSI programme funded by CNRS.

Before the climate shift (Pre-77), the observed correlation between ISMR and SST was positive in the eastern equatorial Indian Ocean (EIO) and negative correlation prevailed in the western equatorial Indian Ocean (WIO), whereas after the climate shift (Post-77), the correlation pattern has reversed (i.e. positive correlation in WIO and negative correlation in EIO). The major reason for this shift is the consistent warming of SSTs throughout the tropics and frequent occurrence of IOD events. Further, it is noticed that during the earlier decades, the Indian Ocean was responding to the atmospheric forcing, particularly along the axis of strong cross equatorial flow, whereas in the recent decades, Indian Ocean dynamics are playing a crucial role in determining the SST in major parts of the Indian Ocean particularly in the EIO. Seasonal re-forecasts from six state-of-the-art global coupled atmosphere-ocean climate models which participated in ENSEMBLES faithfully capture the pre-77 dipole structure of correlations. But the post-77 correlation pattern is not simulated by any of the six models considered in this study. Two possible reasons are pointed out for the models' inability to capture the reversal of teleconnection: (1) in the coupled models, unchanged mean state of the winds inhibits ISMR to be governed by coupled dynamics in the TIO; (2) the strong, local SST-rainfall relationship in models even in post-77 period limits the influence of the teleconnections on the ISMR.","[Pradhan, Maheswar; Yadav, Ramesh Kumar; Dandi, A.

One of the key features of amplified Arctic warming concerns Arctic winter warming (AWW), which exceeds summer warming by at least a factor of 4. Here we use observation-driven reanalyses and state-of-the-art climate models in a variety of standardised climate change simulations to show that AWW is strongly linked to winter sea ice retreat through the associated release of surplus ocean heat gained in summer through the ice-albedo feedback (similar to 25%), and to infrared radiation feedbacks (similar to 75%). Arctic summer warming is surprisingly modest, even after summer sea ice has completely disappeared. Quantifying the seasonally varying changes in Arctic temperature and sea ice and the associated feedbacks helps to more accurately quantify the likelihood of Arctic's climate changes, and to assess their impact on local ecosystems and socio-economic activities.","[Bintanja, R.; van der Linden, E.

For short timescales, however, this pace can be masked by internal variability (IV). Over a few decades, this can cause climate change effects to exceed what would be expected from the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions alone or, to the contrary, cause slowdowns or even hiatuses. This phenomenon is difficult to explore using ensembles such as CMIP5, which are composed of multiple climate models and thus combine both IV and inter-model differences. This study instead uses CanESM2-LE and CESM-LE, two state-of-the-art large ensembles (LE) that comprise multiple realizations from a single climate model and a single GHG emission scenario, to quantify the relationship between IV and climate change over the next decades in Canada and the USA. The mean annual temperature and the 3-day maximum and minimum temperatures are assessed. Results indicate that under the RCP8.5, temperatures within most of the individual large ensemble members will increase in a roughly linear manner between 2021 and 2060. However, members of the large ensembles in which a slowdown of warming is found during the 2021-2040 period are two to five times more likely to experience a period of very fast warming in the following decades. The opposite scenario, where the changes expected by 2050 would occur early because of IV, remains fairly uncommon for the mean annual temperature, but occurs in 5 to 15% of the large ensemble members for the temperature extremes.","[Rondeau-Genesse, Gabriel; Braun, Marco] Ouranos, Montreal, PQ, Canada",Ouranos Consortium,"Rondeau-Genesse, G (corresponding author), Ouranos, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",rondeau-genesse.gabriel@ouranos.ca,,,U.S. Department of Energy's Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison,U.S. Department of Energy's Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison(United States Department of Energy (DOE)),"We also acknowledge Environment and Climate Change Canada's Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis for producing and making available the CanESM2 Large Ensemble simulations used in this study, and the Canadian Sea Ice and Snow Evolution Network for proposing the simulations.

This study estimated the potential impacts of the projected precipitation and temperature based on the downscaled Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP-5) on hydrology and crop yield of a rural watershed in Oklahoma, USA. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool was used to model the watershed with 43 sub-basins and 15,217 combinations of land use, land cover, soil, and slope. The model was driven by the observed climate in the watershed and was first calibrated and validated against the monthly observed streamflow. Three statistical matrices, coefficient of determination (R-2), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), and percentage bias (PB), were used to gauge the model performance with satisfactory values of R-2 = 0.64, NS = 0.61, and PB = +5% in the calibration period, and R-2 = 0.79, NSE = 0.62, and PB = -15% in the validation period for streamflow. The model parameterization for the yields of cotton (PB = -4.5%), grain sorghum (PB = -27.3%), and winter wheat (PB = -6.0%) resulted in an acceptable model performance. The CMIP-5 ensemble of three General Circulation Models under three Representative Concentration Pathways for the 2016-2040 period indicated an increase in both precipitation (+1.5%) and temperature (+1.8 degrees C) in the study area. This changed climate resulted in decreased evapotranspiration (-3.7%), increased water yield (23.9%), decreased wheat yield (-5.2%), decreased grain sorghum yield (-9.9%), and increased cotton yield (+54.2%) compared to the historical climate. The projected increase in water yield might provide opportunities for groundwater recharge and additional water to meet future water demand in the region. The projected decrease in winter wheat yieldthe major crop in the statedue to climate change, may require attention for ways to mitigate these effects.","[Gharibdousti, Solmaz Rasoulzadeh] Oklahoma State Univ, Div Agr Sci & Nat Resources, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA; [Kharel, Gehendra] Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Nat Resource Ecol & Management, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA; [Miller, Ronald B.] Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Biosyst & Agr Engn, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA; [Linde, Evan] Oklahoma State Univ, Ctr High Performance Comp, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA; [Stoecker, Art] Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA",Oklahoma State University System; Oklahoma State University - Stillwater; Oklahoma State University System; Oklahoma State University - Stillwater; Oklahoma State University System; Oklahoma State University - Stillwater; Oklahoma State University System; Oklahoma State University - Stillwater; Oklahoma State University System; Oklahoma State University - Stillwater,"Gharibdousti, SR (corresponding author), Oklahoma State Univ, Div Agr Sci & Nat Resources, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA.",rasoulz@okstate.edu; gehendra.kharel@okstate.edu; ron.miller@okstate.edu; elinde@okstate.edu; art.stoecker@okstate.edu,,"Kharel, Gehendra/0000-0002-7463-7181; Linde, Evan/0000-0002-2053-6721",USDA NIFA national Integrated Water Quality Program [2013-51130-21484]; National Science Foundation [OIA-1301789],USDA NIFA national Integrated Water Quality Program; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),This study was funded by the USDA NIFA national Integrated Water Quality Program under grant no. 2013-51130-21484 and by the National Science Foundation under grant No. OIA-1301789.,,53,4,4,4,13,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2073-4441,,,WATER-SUI,Water,JAN,2019,1,,,,,,105,10.3390/w11010105,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w11010105,,,17,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,HM8MJ,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000459735100104,View Full Record in Web of Science

Modeling studies evolved from analysis based on simple land or ocean carbon cycle models to comprehensive Earth System Models accounting for state-of-the-art climate models coupled to land and ocean biogeochemical models. So far, there is a general agreement that climate change negatively affects the oceanic uptake of carbon. On land there was a similar agreement until recently where new studies showed that warming could reduce nitrogen limitation to growth, reducing the amplitude, or even changing the sign of, the land feedback. In parallel, alternative approaches used the observational record of atmospheric CO2 and temperature, on time scales ranging from interannual to millennial, to estimate the climate-carbon cycle feedback. These studies confirmed that at the global scale, warming leads to a release of CO2 from the land/ocean system to the atmosphere. Whether these observations can strongly constrain the magnitude of the feedback under future climate change is still under investigation.","[Friedlingstein, P.] CE Saclay, IPSL LSCE, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Friedlingstein, P.; Prentice, I.

These in-use stocks link the services enjoyed by humans to energy and material consumption. Climate change mitigation requires us to transform current in-use stocks to decouple energy and material throughput from service provision. Assessing the potential environmental benefits of emissions mitigation and other sustainable development strategies requires a solid understanding of in-use stocks and their dynamics. We identified the different roles of in-use stocks in the social metabolism and showed to what extent they are included in current impact assessment models. We extended state-of-the-art dynamic stock models by including direct and indirect energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions. We applied the new modeling framework to three case studies in the major sectors transportation, buildings, and industry. We assessed the emissions reduction potential of the decoupling strategies energy efficiency, material efficiency, and moderate lifestyle changes. For the global steel industry and for residential buildings the emissions reduction potential of the above-mentioned strategies was so large that the benchmarks corresponding to the 2 degrees C climate target could be reached. Decoupling alone might be sufficient to reach the 2 degrees C benchmarks in some sectors. Considering decoupling next to supply side measures such as new energy technologies may make it easier to consider other objectives than emissions reduction. Decoupling may therefore revitalize the debate about sustainable development because it allows us to loosen the focus on climate change mitigation and put more weight on the economic, social, cultural, and other environmental aspects of sustainability.

In 2015, as part of the community-based World Urban Database and Access Portal Tools (WUDAPT) project, a protocol was developed that enables the mapping of cities into LCZs, using freely available data and software packages, yet performed on local computing facilities. The LCZ Generator described here further simplifies this process, providing an online platform that maps a city of interest into LCZs, solely expecting a valid training area file and some metadata as input. The web application (available at ) integrates the state-of-the-art of LCZ mapping, and simultaneously provides an automated accuracy assessment, training data derivatives, and a novel approach to identify suspicious training areas. As this contribution explains all front- and back-end procedures, databases, and underlying datasets in detail, it serves as the primary User Guide for this web application.

This article argues that this increasingly significant area of sound arts practice should be recognised as a distinct field in its own right, and proposes that it be termed 'ecological sound art', reflecting its equivalent in the visual arts. After establishing its current absence from both ecocritical and sound arts scholarship, it proceeds to outline some of the core approaches which characterise works of ecological sound art, as the first step towards its establishment as a coherent field of practice. The final section draws from key works of contemporary ecological theory, examining the fundamental accord that exists between the new modes of thought they propose and the ways in which we experience and relate to sound art, demonstrating that ecological sound art represents not only a significant new field of sound arts practice, but also a powerful ecological art form.","[Gilmurray, Jonathan] Univ Arts London, CRiSAP, London Coll Commun, London SE1 6SB, England",University of Arts London,"Gilmurray, J (corresponding author), Univ Arts London, CRiSAP, London Coll Commun, London SE1 6SB, England.",jonathangilmurray@yahoo.co.uk,"Gilmurray, Jonathan/E-2146-2017","Gilmurray, Jonathan/0000-0003-3436-6732",Arts and Humanities Research Council [1510571] Funding Source: researchfish,Arts and Humanities Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Arts & Humanities Research Council (AHRC)),,,79,7,7,0,5,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1355-7718,1469-8153,,ORGAN SOUND,Organ.

The discourse about the curve has spread from climate science to the public and political arenas in the 1990s and may be characterized by terms such as hockey stick or global warming hiatus. Despite its discussion in the public and the searches for the impact of the warming in climate science, it is statistical science that puts numbers to the warming. Statistics has developed methods to quantify the warming trend and detect change points. Statistics serves to place error bars and other measures of uncertainty to the estimated trend parameters. Uncertainties are ubiquitous in all natural and life sciences, and error bars are an indispensable guide for the interpretation of any estimated curve to assess, for example, whether global temperature really made a pause after the year 1998. Statistical trend estimation methods are well developed and include not only linear curves, but also change points, accelerated increases, other nonlinear behavior, and nonparametric descriptions. State-of-the-art, computing -intensive simulation algorithms take into account the peculiar aspects of climate data, namely non Gaussian distributional shape and autocorrelation. The reliability of such computer age statistical methods has been testified by Monte Carlo simulation methods using artificial data. The application of the state-of-the-art statistical methods to the GISTEMP time series of global surface temperature reveals an accelerated warming since the year 1974. It shows that a relative peak in warming for the years around World War II may not be a real feature but a product of inferior data quality for that time interval. Statistics also reveals that there is no basis to infer a global warming hiatus after the year 1998. The post-1998 hiatus only seems to exist, hidden behind large error bars, when considering data up to the year 2013. If the fit interval is extended to the year 2017, there is no significant hiatus. The researcher has the power to select the fit interval, which allows her or him to suppress certain fit solutions and favor other solutions. Power necessitates responsibility.

Along with global warming, remarkable interannual and interdecadal variations in sea surface temperature (SST) and sea surface height have been observed in the WNP. Here we demonstrated that boreal summer SST variability in the western hemisphere warm pool (WHWP, a.k.a. Atlantic Warm Pool) near the Intra-Americas Sea, which is known as the second largest warm pool on the planet, has considerably contributed to the climate variability in the WNP in subsequent winter. This is possible due to westward propagation of Rossby waves associated with a WHWP-SST warming (cooling) in mid-summer to early fall season, which induces northerly (southerly) wind anomalies over the North Pacific. In the presence of northeasterly mean trade winds, the anomalous meridional winds interact with SST and precipitation anomalies. Such air-sea coupling processes gradually move equatorward and westward along the climatological migration of the Pacific Intertropical Convergence Zone, and it has finally an effect on the climate variability over the WNP in winter. Further diagnosis verifies that WHWP-WNP connection exists not only on interannual time scale but also on decadal time scale. The analysis using state-of-the-art climate models reasonably supports this argument. A better understanding of the WHWP influence is expected to improve forecasts for the WNP climate and assist socioeconomic development in the East Asia.","[Park, Jae-Heung; Li, Tim] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci & Technol, Int Pacific Res Ctr, Dept Atmospher Sci, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Kug, Jong-Seong] Pohang Univ Sci & Technol POSTECH, Div Environm Sci & Engn, 77 Cheongam Ro, Pohang 790784, South Korea; [An, Soon-Il] Yonsei Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, 50 Yonsei Ro, Seoul 120749, South Korea; [Li, Tim] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Joint Int Res Lab Climate & Environm Change ILCEC, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster, Minist Educ KLME,CIC FEMD, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; Pohang University of Science & Technology (POSTECH); Yonsei University; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology,"Kug, JS (corresponding author), Pohang Univ Sci & Technol POSTECH, Div Environm Sci & Engn, 77 Cheongam Ro, Pohang 790784, South Korea.",jskug1@gmail.com,"AN, SOON-IL/CWF-6596-2022","KUG, JONG-SEONG/0000-0003-2251-2579",Korea Meteorological Administration Research and Development Program [KMI2018-03214]; National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korea government (MSIT) [NRF-2018R1A5A1024958]; NSFC [41630423]; NSF [AGS-1565653]; NOAA [NA18OAR4310298]; JAMSTEC JIJI project,"Korea Meteorological Administration Research and Development Program(Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA)); National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korea government (MSIT)(National Research Foundation of KoreaMinistry of Science, ICT & Future Planning, Republic of Korea); NSFC(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); JAMSTEC JIJI project","J.-S.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicts that, as a result, floods and prolonged droughts will take place at increasingly frequent periods. The Mediterranean has been described as one of the main climate change hot-spots, with recent simulations showing a collective picture of substantial drying and warming. This effect appears more pronounced during warm periods, when the seasonal decrease of precipitation can exceed control climatology by 25-30%. Despite the decreasing annual rainfall trend, an increase in the amount and intensity of wintertime rainfall is evident. However, the scientific question on the quantitative impact of these signals to small scale coastal watersheds and Mediterranean islands has not been answered. The state-of-the-art Ensembles dataset was employed to assess the impact of the changing climate on the water availability of the island of Crete at basin scale. Here, the Ensembles precipitation and temperature data is used as input for a rainfall-runoff model previous calibrated for the whole island with the principle of regionalization. Data analysis for the period 1970-2100 reveals an overall decreasing precipitation trend which, combined with a temperature rise, leads to substantial reduction of water availability.

Adaptive responses may originate either in genetic variation or in phenotypic plasticity, but the relative importance of these factors is poorly understood. Here, we tested the tolerance of Fucus radicans to the combination of hyposalinity and warming projected by climate models for 2070-2099. We measured the growth and survival responses of thalli in both current and future conditions, focusing on variations in tolerance among and within different clonal lineages. Survival was 32% lower in future than in current conditions, but the weight and length of the thalli which survived was respectively 267% and 178% higher when exposed to future conditions. The relatively high tolerance to the future conditions suggests that F. radicans is likely to persist in its current distributional range, which is limited to the Gulf of Bothia and Estonian coast in the Baltic Sea. Furthermore, this species may be able to expand its distribution southward and replace its congener F. vesiculosus, which, in previous studies, has not tolerated the future conditions as well. In addition, we discovered variation in tolerance to future conditions within one of the clonal lineages, which have been hitherto presumed to lack adaptive variation. The discovery of intra-clonal phenotypic plasticity means that this alga has the potential for adaptive responses to climate change, which may be the key to the future persistence of F. radicans in the Baltic Sea.","[Rugiu, Luca; Manninen, Iita; Rothausler, Eva; Jormalainen, Veijo] Univ Turku, Dept Biol, Sect Ecol, FIN-20014 Turku, Finland",University of Turku,"Rugiu, L (corresponding author), Univ Turku, Dept Biol, Sect Ecol, FIN-20014 Turku, Finland.",luca.rugiu@utu.fi,"Jormalainen, Veijo/B-2073-2008","Jormalainen, Veijo/0000-0001-6346-2585; Rothausler, Eva/0000-0002-3185-4290","BONUS, the EU joint Baltic Sea research and development programme (Art 185); European Union; Academy of Finland [273623]","BONUS, the EU joint Baltic Sea research and development programme (Art 185); European Union(European Commission); Academy of Finland(Academy of Finland)","We wish to thank Lena Kautsky and Ellen Schagerstrom for collecting the algae for the experiment, and J.

Recent deep learning-based LCZ classification studies have adopted a scene classification approach with computer vision-inspired models. In light of these advancements, this study introduces a multi-scale, multi-level attention network (MSMLA-Net) for deep learning-based LCZ classification. MSMLA-Net integrates a multi-scale (MS) module to generate multi-scale features from the input data and a novel multi-level attention (MLA) module as a branch unit from the model's main ResNet backbone. MLA uses the convolutional block attention module (CBAM) at multiple stages to generate multi-level spatially and spectrally enhanced features for context aggregation. This study presents comprehensive model-based experiments on model depth, the individual and combined influence of MS and MLA modules, and the addition of attention mechanisms. Furthermore, data-based experiments are conducted to determine optimal Sentinel-2 spectral bands, while OpenStreetMap (OSM) building data, ALOS World 3D DSM height information, and a national land cover map are included as ancillary bands. LCZ classification tests are conducted on six major cities in South Korea. With regards to model-based performance, MSMLA-Net was built using a modified SE-ResNet50 backbone (MSMLA-50) and obtained the best classification results using 48 by 48-pixel input patches with a combination of all Sentinel-2 and ancillary bands, outperforming three state-of-the-art LCZ classification models. In particular, only MSMLA-50 reached over 70% built-up overall accuracy and maintained high accuracy even when tested on completely unseen areas in a citywise leave-one-out sampling strategy. For data-based results, the combination of Sentinel-2 Red Edge bands were helpful, mainly due to the greater number of available bands. Training only ancillary data generated up to 75.0% for built-up overall accuracy, albeit at the cost of low natural overall accuracy. Using all available bands and ancillary data produced the best results, but a combination of only OSM and Sentinel-2 bands also generated comparable accuracy. Ultimately, the proposed MSMLA-Net bridges advanced computer vision techniques such as attention mechanisms and multi-level context aggregation to improve LCZ classification. The MS and MLA modules can be applied on different backbones, sophisticated sampling schemes, and data inputs to flexibly achieve improved classification results.","[Kim, Minho; Jeong, Doyoung; Kim, Yongil] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 1 Gwanak Ro, Seoul 08826, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU),"Kim, Y (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 1 Gwanak Ro, Seoul 08826, South Korea.",yik@snu.ac.kr,"Kim, Minho/AAO-2227-2021","Kim, Minho/0000-0002-9504-5935","Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education [NRF-2019R1I1A2A01058144]; Ministry-Cooperation R&D program of Disaster-Safety - Ministry of Interior and Safety (MOIS, Korea) [20009742]","Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education(National Research Foundation of KoreaMinistry of Education (MOE), Republic of KoreaNational Research Council for Economics, Humanities & Social Sciences, Republic of Korea); Ministry-Cooperation R&D program of Disaster-Safety - Ministry of Interior and Safety (MOIS, Korea)(Ministry of the Interior & Safety (MOIS), Republic of Korea)","This research was supported by Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education (NRF-2019R1I1A2A01058144).

Changes in solar radiation, temperature and PPV are calculated for the near-term (2021-2050) and end-century (2071-2100) future, concerning the historical period (1981-2010). For the future, the sign of climate change is consistent in both scenarios, but with more intense magnitudes in the SSP5-8.5 for the end-century, and indicate a brightening in North region and warming in the whole country. For the near-term future, PPV projects the maximum increases (z3%) in the North under both scenarios. The most notable decreases in PPV are noticed by the end-century (-5%) over the country, except for the extreme north. The sensitivity to the increase in temperature of current PPV systems' technology would not allow increases in the yield of PPV, canceling the positive effect of the brightening.(c) 2022 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","[Zuluaga, Cristian Felipe; Justino, Flavio B.] Univ Fed Vicosa, Dept Agr Engn, BR-36570900 Vicosa, MG, Brazil; [Avila-Diaz, Alvaro] Univ Ciencias Aplicadas & Ambientales UDCA, Fac Environm & Sustainabil Sci, Bogota 111166, Colombia; [Martins, Fernando Ramos] Univ Fed Sao Paulo, Dept Marine Sci, Campus Baixada Santista, BR-11070100 Santos, SP, Brazil; [Ceron, Wilmar L.] Univ Valle, Fac Humanities, Dept Geog, Cali, Valle Del Cauca, Colombia",Universidade Federal de Vicosa; Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo (UNIFESP); Universidad del Valle,"Zuluaga, CF (corresponding author), Univ Fed Vicosa, Dept Agr Engn, BR-36570900 Vicosa, MG, Brazil.",cristian.aristizabal@ufv.br,"Martins, Fernando Ramos/A-7699-2012; Ávila-Díaz, Álvaro/L-6200-2019; LOAIZA CERON, WILMAR/P-3678-2018","Martins, Fernando Ramos/0000-0002-7618-4462; Ávila-Díaz, Álvaro/0000-0002-0404-4559; Zuluaga Aristizabal, Cristian Felipe/0000-0001-7580-962X; LOAIZA CERON, WILMAR/0000-0003-1901-9572",Coordination for the Improvement ofHigher Education Personnel (CAPES); National Council for Scientific andTechnological Development (CNPq); Universidad del Valle (Cali-Colombia); CMIP6; ESGF,Coordination for the Improvement ofHigher Education Personnel (CAPES)(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); National Council for Scientific andTechnological Development (CNPq)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); Universidad del Valle (Cali-Colombia); CMIP6; ESGF,"We acknowledge the Coordination for the Improvement ofHigher Education Personnel (CAPES) for supporting this research.The author thanks the graduate program in Applied Meteorology atthe Universidade Federal de Vicosa.

State-of-the-art regional climate model (RCM) simulations at 90- and 30-km resolutions are run and analyzed along with output from five coupled atmosphere-ocean GCMs (AOGCMs) from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) to predict how the Sahel summer surface temperature, precipitation, and surface moisture are likely to change at the mid- and late-twenty-first century due to increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations under the representative concentration pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5) emission scenario and evaluate confidence in such projections. Future lateral boundary conditions are derived from CMIP5 AOGCMs.It is shown that the regional climate model can realistically simulate the current summer evolution of the West African monsoon climate including the onset and demise of the Sahel wet season, a necessary but not sufficient condition for confident prediction.RCM and AOGCM projections indicate the likelihood for increased surface air temperatures over this century, with Sahara and Sahel temperature increases of 2-3.5 K by midcentury, and 3-6 K by late century. Summer rainfall and surface moisture are also projected to increase over most of the Sahel. This is primarily associated with an increase in rainfall intensity and not a lengthening of the wet season. Pinpointing exactly when the rainfall and surface moisture increase will first commence and by exactly what magnitude is less certain as these predictions appear to be model dependent. Models that simulate stronger warming over the Sahara are associated with larger and earlier rainfall increases over the Sahel due to an intensification of the low-level West African westerly jet, and vice versa.","[Vizy, Edward K.; Cook, Kerry H.; Cretat, Julien; Neupane, Naresh] Univ Texas Austin, Jackson Sch Geosci, Dept Geol Sci, Austin, TX 78712 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Vizy, EK (corresponding author), Univ Texas Austin, Jackson Sch Geosci, Dept Geol Sci, 1 Univ Stn C1100, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",ned@jsg.utexas.edu,"Vizy, Edward/A-1577-2009","Vizy, Edward/0000-0002-5019-2819","National Science Foundation [ATM-1036604]; U.S. Army Research Laboratory Minerva Project [W911NF-09-1-0077]; Office of Science, U.S. Department of Energy","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); U.S. Army Research Laboratory Minerva Project; Office of Science, U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE))","Support from the National Science Foundation (Award ATM-1036604) and the U.S. Army Research Laboratory Minerva Project (Contract W911NF-09-1-0077) is gratefully acknowledged.

We find that whilst a small number of cities, mostly in OECD countries, have derived quantitative estimates of the costs of climate change risks under alternative scenarios, this form of analysis is in its infancy. The climate risks most frequently addressed in existing studies are associated with sea-level rise, health and water resources. Other sectors such as energy, transport, and built infrastructure remain less studied. The review has also undertaken a case study to examine the progress in two cities-London and New York-which are relatively advanced in the assessment of climate risks and adaptation. The case studies show that these cities have benefited from stakeholder engagement at an early stage in their risk assessments. They have also benefited from the development of specific institutional responsibilities for co-ordinating such research from the outset.

The potential presence of liquid water on a planetary surface depends on many factors such as, most importantly, surface temperatures. The properties of the planetary atmosphere and its interaction with the radiative energy provided by the planet's host star are thereby of decisive importance. In this study we investigate the influence of different main-sequence stars (F, G, and K-type stars) upon the climate of Earth-like extrasolar planets and their potential habitability by applying a state-of-the-art three-dimensional (3D) Earth climate model accounting for local and dynamical processes. The calculations have been performed for planets with Earth-like atmospheres at orbital distances (and corresponding orbital periods) where the total amount of energy received from the various host stars equals the solar constant. In contrast to previous 3D modeling studies, we include the effect of ozone radiative heating upon the vertical temperature structure of the atmospheres. The global orbital mean results obtained have been compared to those of a one-dimensional (1D) radiative convective climate model to investigate the approximation of global mean 3D results by those of 1D models. The different stellar spectral energy distributions lead to different surface temperatures and due to ozone heating to very different vertical temperature structures. As previous 1D studies we find higher surface temperatures for the Earth-like planet around the K-type star, and lower temperatures for the planet around the F-type star compared to an Earth-like planet around the Sun. However, this effect is more pronounced in the 3D model results than in the 1D model because the 3D model accounts for feedback processes such as the ice-albedo and the water vapor feedback. Whether the 1D model may approximate the global mean of the 3D model results strongly depends on the choice of the relative humidity profile in the 1D model, which is used to determine the water vapor profile. Hence, possible changes in the hydrological cycle need to be accounted for when estimating the potential habitability of an extrasolar planet. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This IR is commonly low-level and close to machine instructions. As a result, optimizations relying on domain-specific information are either not possible or require complex analysis to recover the missing information. In contrast, multi-level rewriting instantiates a hierarchy of dialects (IRs), lowers programs level-by-level, and performs code transformations at the most suitable level. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach for the weather and climate domain. In particular, we develop a prototype compiler and design stencil- and GPU-specific dialects based on a set of newly introduced design principles. We find that two domain-specific optimizations (500 lines of code) realized on top of LLVM's extensible MLIR compiler infrastructure suffice to outperform state-of-the-art solutions. In essence, multilevel rewriting promises to herald the age of specialized compilers composed from domain- and target-specific dialects implemented on top of a shared infrastructure.","[Gysi, Tobias; Mueller, Christoph; Hoefler, Torsten] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Zurich, Switzerland; [Zinenko, Oleksandr] Google, Paris, France; [Herhut, Stephan] Google, Berlin, Germany; [Davis, Eddie; Wicky, Tobias; Fuhrer, Oliver] Vulcan Inc, Seattle, WA USA; [Grosser, Tobias] Univ Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Google Incorporated; Google Incorporated; University of Edinburgh,"Gysi, T (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Zurich, Switzerland.",gysit@google.com; christoph.mueller@inf.ethz.ch; zinenko@google.com; herhut@google.com; EddieD@vulcan.com; TobiasW@vulcan.com; OliverP@vulcan.com; htor@inf.ethz.ch; tobias.grosser@ed.ac.uk,"Hoefler, Torsten/AAB-7478-2022",,European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 programme (grant agreement DAPP) [678880]; Swiss National Science Foundation under the Ambizione programme [PZ00P2168016]; ARM Holdings plc; Xilinx Inc,European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 programme (grant agreement DAPP)(European Research Council (ERC)); Swiss National Science Foundation under the Ambizione programme; ARM Holdings plc; Xilinx Inc,"The work done at ETH Zurich has received funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 programme (grant agreement DAPP, No. 678880), the Swiss National Science Foundation under the Ambizione programme (grant PZ00P2168016), and ARM Holdings plc and Xilinx Inc in the context of Polly Labs.",,54,1,1,2,3,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY USA",1544-3566,1544-3973,,ACM T ARCHIT CODE OP,ACM Trans.

This article explores the ways in which this shift has shaped the current academic and cultural landscape in Pakistan, with a focus on the institutional space of the art school. The recent growth in these spheres has taken place alongside a simultaneous intensification in the policing and militarisation of spaces of knowledge and cultural production. We consider the possibilities of formulating a dissident art/academic practice in a sphere shaped and disciplined by the dual forces of militarisation and imperialist agendas. To this end, we explore the work of three non-institutional pedagogical/cultural/community spaces in Karachi as engaged, immersive and participatory forms of knowledge production. We find in these spaces a heightened visibility of how much is at stake in conflicts and contestations over knowledge and culture in contemporary Pakistan, as well as a realisation of the possibilities of disrupting institutionalised colonial modes of knowledge production, dissemination and circulation.","[Malkani, Zahra; Rajani, Shahana] Indus Valley Sch Art & Architecture, Karachi, Pakistan",,"Malkani, Z (corresponding author), Indus Valley Sch Art & Architecture, Karachi, Pakistan.",zahramalkani@gmail.com,,,,,,,16,1,1,0,1,OPEN LIBRARY HUMANITIES,CAMBRIDGE,"SALISBURY HOUSE, STATION RD, CAMBRIDGE, CB1 2LA, ENGLAND",2056-6700,,,OPEN LIBR HUMANIT,Open Libr.

Study focus: Climate change and urbanization pose significant threats for flooding and water quality in urban areas. This paper reviews the evidence concerning the combined impacts of urbanisation and climate on the urban water environment of inland catchments of the United Kingdom and assesses the degree of confidence in reported directions of change and response. It also assesses the utility of the evidence for setting environmental legislation and managing the urban water environment in the future and identifies knowledge gaps that limit effective and management interventions. New hydrological insights: There is a lack of nationally research focused on the dual impacts of climate change and urbanisation on flooding and water quality in UK urban areas. This is despite there being a clear acceptance that flood risk is increasing, water quality is generally not meeting desirable levels, and that combined population and climate change projections pose a pressing challenge. The available evidence has been found to be of medium-high confidence that both pressures will result in (i) an increase in pluvial and fluvial flood risk, and (ii) further reduction in water quality caused by point source pollution and altered flow regimes. Evidence concerning urban groundwater flooding, diffuse pollution and water temperature was found to be more sparse and was ascribed a low-medium confidence that both pressures will further exacerbate existing issues. The confidence ascribed to evidence was also found to reflect the utility of current science for setting policy and urban planning. Recurring factors that limit the utility of evidence for managing the urban environment includes: (i) climate change projection uncertainty and suitability, (ii) lack of sub-daily projections for storm rainfall, (iii) the complexity of managing and modelling the urban environment, and (iv) lack of probable national-scale future urban land use projections. Suitable climate products are increasingly being developed and their application in applied urban research is critical in the wake of a series of extreme flooding events across the UK and timely for providing state-of-the-art evidence on which to base possible future water quality legislation in a post Brexit-WFD era.","[Miller, James D.; Hutchins, Michael] Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Oxford OX10 8BB, England",UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (UKCEH),"Miller, JD (corresponding author), Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Oxford OX10 8BB, England.",millj@ceh.ac.uk; mihu@ceh.ac.uk,"Hutchins, Michael G/K-3370-2012",,"PollCURB; UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) [WC1052]; Natural Environment Research Council (NERC UK); NERC Changing Water Cycle program [NE/K002317/1]; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/K002317/1] Funding Source: researchfish; NERC [NE/K002317/1] Funding Source: UKRI","PollCURB; UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA)(Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA)); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC UK)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); NERC Changing Water Cycle program; Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC))","We are grateful to Elizabeth Kendon of the UK Met Office and Alison Kay and Gianni Vesuviano of the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology for figures that have greatly added to the paper.

I begin my analysis with a discussion of specific works of art and expand to the local and global context to which these works respond and help to construct. Both urban space and artistic production, consumption and the social meaning attached to art by artists, critics, audiences and other art world actors have felt the impact of the turn to free market policies and ideology that have attended global economic restructuring and the rapid pace of globalisation. At the same time, art's new role as an engine of urban commerce and the accompanying expansion of the art market have helped to shape city districts like West Chelsea and have left their mark on the work that is exhibited and sold there. My analysis integrates a close study of two works of art exhibited in West Chelsea, interviews and other ethnographic data and recent literature on the arts and urban restructuring and the perspective of critical theory. I also provide photographic documentation of social interaction and the built environment of West Chelsea as it evolved in response to the expansion of the art worlds there.

Making that potential a reality will require indicators of success for various stakeholders from multidisciplinary backgrounds, plus promotion of long-term implementation of strategic action towards civil society (e.g., law and policy makers, economists, and farmers). To help meet those challenges, this discussion paper summarizes the state of the art and uncertainties regarding CoCS, taking an interdisciplinary, holistic approach toward understanding these complex issues. The first part of the paper discusses the carbon cycle's bio-geophysical processes, while the second introduces the plurality of geographical scales to be addressed when dealing with landscape management for CoCS. The third part addresses systemic viability, vulnerability, and resilience in CoCS practices, before concluding with the need to develop inter-disciplinarity in sustainable science, participative research, and the societal implications of sustainable CoCS actions.","[Chevallier, Tiphaine;

Changes in the Atlantic Ocean overturning circulation in response to freshwater fluxes from melting ice are frequently invoked to explain this and other past climate changes. Here we propose an alternative mechanism in which the receding glacial ice sheets cause the atmospheric circulation to enter a regime with greater net precipitation in the North Atlantic region. This leads to a significant reduction in ocean overturning circulation, causing an increase in sea ice extent and hence colder temperatures. Positive feedbacks associated with sea ice amplify the cooling. We support the proposed mechanism with the results of a state-of-the-art global climate model. Our results suggest that the atmospheric precipitation response to receding glacial ice sheets could have contributed to the Younger Dryas cooling, as well as to other past climate changes involving the ocean overturning circulation.","[Eisenman, Ian] CALTECH, Div Geol & Planetary Sci, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Eisenman, Ian; Bitz, Cecilia M.] Univ Washington, Dept Atmospher Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Tziperman, Eli] Harvard Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Tziperman, Eli] Harvard Univ, Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",California Institute of Technology; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; Harvard University; Harvard University,"Eisenman, I (corresponding author), CALTECH, Div Geol & Planetary Sci, 1200 Calif Blvd, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",ian@gps.caltech.edu,"Tziperman, Eli/A-1219-2008; Eisenman, Ian/B-9329-2009; Bitz, Cecilia M/S-8423-2016","Bitz, Cecilia M/0000-0002-9477-7499; Eisenman, Ian/0000-0003-0190-2869",NSF [ATM-0502482]; McDonnell foundation; NASA; Prize Postdoctoral Fellowship through the California Institute of Technology Division of Geological and Planetary Sciences; NOAA Climate and Global Change,NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); McDonnell foundation; NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); Prize Postdoctoral Fellowship through the California Institute of Technology Division of Geological and Planetary Sciences; NOAA Climate and Global Change(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA),"We are grateful for helpful conversations with Brian Farrell, Dan Schrag, Peter Huybers, Carl Wunsch, Tapio Schneider, Greg Ravizza, Lorraine Lisiecki, Chris Walker, and Dorian Abbot.

The authors also present a comprehensive assessment of errors arising from use of physical parameterization schemes, and their consequent impact on model performance in a region of complex topography. An error range related to the choice of physical parameterization is provided for 2-m air temperature T-2m and precipitation. Two state-of-the-art nonhydrostatic mesoscale regional climate models, the fifth-generation Pennsylvania State University-National Center for Atmospheric Research Mesoscale Model (MM5) and the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, are used to dynamically downscale the 40-yr ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA-40) to a spatial resolution of 10 km X 10 km in the European alpine region. Simulated T-2m and precipitation are compared with gridded observational datasets. The model performance on regional and subregional scales is evaluated on daily, monthly, seasonal, and annual time scales. The results are based on a mixed physics ensemble of twenty-nine 1-yr-long hindcast simulations generated by choosing different model configurations. These results indicate that performance of both models is sensitive to the choice of physical parameterization and WRF is more sensitive than MM5. This sensitivity is higher during summer than during winter. The cumulus and microphysics scheme have the dominant effect on model performance during summer while boundary layer and radiation schemes affect the results during all seasons. It is found that annual mean error in the alpine region for T-2m and precipitation lies between -2.75 degrees and -1.08 degrees C (-1.12 degrees and 1.33 degrees C) and 0.27 and 0.80 mm day(-1) (0.13 and 1.51 mm day(-1)) for MM5 (WRF), respectively. The authors also found that the error range during winter for subregional scales is higher than the regional-scale error range, while during the other seasons the subregional error ranges are higher only in case of precipitation but not for T-2m. These results suggest that significant reductions of errors can be achieved by choosing a suitable model configuration for the region of interest. The other outcome of these experiments is a suitable setup, which can be used to conduct further long-term high-resolution climate simulations.","[Awan, Nauman K.] Graz Univ, Reg & Local Climate Modeling & Anal Res Grp, Wegener Ctr Climate & Global Change, Inst Geophys Astrophys & Meteorol, A-8010 Graz, Austria",University of Graz,"Awan, NK (corresponding author), Graz Univ, Reg & Local Climate Modeling & Anal Res Grp, Wegener Ctr Climate & Global Change, Inst Geophys Astrophys & Meteorol, Leechgasse 25, A-8010 Graz, Austria.",nauman.awan@edu.uni-graz.at,"Gobiet, Andreas/AAX-2537-2020; Awan, Nauman Khurshid/ABH-7373-2020; Gobiet, Andreas/AAF-6039-2020","Gobiet, Andreas/0000-0001-5751-2961; Truhetz, Heimo/0000-0002-1255-302X","Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [NHCM-1, P19619]; Austrian Exchange Service (OAD); Higher Education Commission (HEC) of Pakistan",Austrian Science Fund (FWF)(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)); Austrian Exchange Service (OAD); Higher Education Commission (HEC) of Pakistan(Higher Education Commission of Pakistan),"We thank the two anonymous reviewers for their valuable suggestions and comments.

A temptation in transdisciplinary work is to focus on improving scientific practices rather than engage research partners in spaces that mutually respect how we learn from each other and set the stage for change. We used the concept of Nicolescu's Hidden Third to identify and operationalize this transformative space, because it focused on bridging objective and subjective worldviews through art. Between 2014 and 2017, we explored the engagement of indigenous peoples from three inland delta regions in Canada and asa team of interdisciplinary scholars and students who worked together to better understand long-term social-ecological change in those regions. In working together, we identified five characteristics associated with respectful, transformative transdisciplinary space. These included (1) establishing an unfiltered safe place where (2) subjective and objective experiences and (3) different world views could come together through (4) interactive and (5) multiple sensory experiences. On the whole, we were more effective in achieving characteristics 2-5bringing together the subjective and objective experiences, where different worldviews could come togetherthan in achieving characteristic 1creating a truly unfiltered and safe space for expression. The novelty of this work is in how we sought to change our own engagement practices to advance sustainability rather than improving scientific techniques.

In this study, the operational forecasting system combining an advanced eddy-permitting ocean-sea ice ensemble reanalysis ORAS5 and state-of-the-art seasonal model-based forecasting system SEAS5 is used to investigate effects of sea ice dynamics and thermodynamics on seasonal (growth-to-melt) Arctic sea ice predictability in 1993-2020. We demonstrate that thermodynamics (growth/melt) dominates the seasonal evolution of mean sea ice thickness at pan-Arctic and regional scales. The thermodynamics also dominates the seasonal predictability of sea ice thickness at pan-Arctic scale; however, at regional scales, the predictability is dominated by dynamics (advection), although the contribution from ice growth/melt remains perceptible. We show competing influences of sea ice dynamics and thermodynamics on the temporal change of ice thickness predictability from 1993-2006 to 2007-20. Over these decades, there was increasing predictability due to growth/melt, attributed to increased winter ocean heat flux in both Eurasian and Amerasian basins, and decreasing predictability due to advection. Our results demonstrate an increasing impact of advection on seasonal sea ice predictability as the region of interest becomes smaller, implying that correct modeling of sea ice drift is crucial for developing reliable regional sea ice predictions. This study delivers important information about sea ice predictability in the new Arctic conditions. It increases awareness regarding sea ice state and implementation of sea ice forecasts for various scientific and practical needs that depend on accurate seasonal sea ice forecasts.","[Polyakov, Igor, V] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Int Arctic Res Ctr, Fairbanks, AK 99709 USA; [Polyakov, Igor, V] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Coll Nat Sci & Math, Fairbanks, AK 99709 USA; [Polyakov, Igor, V; Karpechko, Alexey Yu] Finnish Meteorol Inst, Helsinki, Finland; [Mayer, Michael; Tietsche, Steffen] European Ctr Medium Range Weather Forecasts, Bonn, Germany; [Mayer, Michael] Univ Vienna, Dept Meteorol & Geophys, Vienna, Austria",University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Fairbanks; University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Fairbanks; Finnish Meteorological Institute; University of Vienna,"Polyakov, IV (corresponding author), Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Int Arctic Res Ctr, Fairbanks, AK 99709 USA.;Polyakov, IV (corresponding author), Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Coll Nat Sci & Math, Fairbanks, AK 99709 USA.;Polyakov, IV (corresponding author), Finnish Meteorol Inst, Helsinki, Finland.",ivpolyakov@alaska.edu,,,"National Science Foundation [1708424, 1708427, 1724523]; EU [821984, 862626]; Austrian Science Fund [P33177]",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); EU(European Commission); Austrian Science Fund(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)),"IP contribution was supported by National Science Foundation Grants 1708424, 1708427, and 1724523.

Based on AOGCM experiments conducted for two types of future greenhouse gas emission scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) extending up to the end of 21st century, scenarios of temperature and hydrological cycle are presented. The AOGCMs, despite their relatively coarse resolution, have shown a reasonable skill in depicting the hydrological cycle over the South Asian region. However, considerable biases do exist with reference to the observed hydrological cycle and also inter-model differences. The regional climate change scenarios of temperature (T), atmospheric water balance components, precipitation, moisture convergence and evaporation (P, C and E) up to the end of the 21st century based on CMIP5 modeling experiments conducted for (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) indicate marked increase in both rainfall and temperature into the 21st century, particularly becoming conspicuous after the 2050s. The monsoon rainfall and atmospheric water balance changes under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios are discussed in detail in this paper. Spatial patterns of rainfall change projections indicate maximum increase over South Asia in most of the models. Model simulations under scenarios of increased greenhouse gas concentrations suggests that the intensification of the hydrological cycle is driven mainly by the increased moisture convergence due to increase in the water holding capacity of the atmosphere in a warmer environment, the intensification of the hydrological cycle is greater for RCP8.5 compared to RCP4.5, also fewer models indicate increased variance of temperature and rainfall in a warmer environment. While the scenarios presented in this study are indicative of the expected range of rainfall and water balance changes, it must be noted that the quantitative estimates still have large uncertainties associated with them.

In order to understand the causes of the low accuracy in the current prediction of the A-AM precipitation, this study strives to determine to what extent the ten state-of-the-art coupled atmosphere-ocean-land climate models and their multi-model ensemble (MME) can capture the two observed major modes of A-AM rainfall variability-which account for 43% of the total interannual variances during the retrospective prediction period of 1981-2001. The first mode is associated with the turnabout of warming to cooling in the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), whereas the second mode leads the warming/cooling by about 1 year, signaling precursory conditions for ENSO. The first mode has a strong biennial tendency and reflects the Tropical Biennial Oscillation (Meehl in J Clim 6:31-41, 1993). We show that the MME 1-month lead prediction of the seasonal precipitation anomalies captures the first two leading modes of variability with high fidelity in terms of seasonally evolving spatial patterns and year-to-year temporal variations, as well as their relationships with ENSO. The MME shows a potential to capture the precursors of ENSO in the second mode about five seasons prior to the maturation of a strong El Nino. However, the MME underestimates the total variances of the two modes and the biennial tendency of the first mode. The models have difficulties in capturing precipitation over the maritime continent and the Walker-type teleconnection in the decaying phase of ENSO, which may contribute in part to a monsoon spring prediction barrier (SPB). The NCEP/CFS model hindcast results show that, as the lead time increases, the fractional variance of the first mode increases, suggesting that the long-lead predictability of A-AM rainfall comes primarily from ENSO predictability. In the CFS model, the correlation skill for the first principal component remains about 0.9 up to 6 months before it drops rapidly, but for the spatial pattern it exhibits a drop across the boreal spring. This study uncovered two surprising findings. First, the coupled models' MME predictions capture the first two leading modes of precipitation variability better than those captured by the ERA-40 and NCEP-2 reanalysis datasets, suggesting that treating the atmosphere as a slave may be inherently unable to simulate summer monsoon rainfall variations in the heavily precipitating regions (Wang et al. in J Clim 17:803-818, 2004). It is recommended that future reanalysis should be carried out with coupled atmosphere and ocean models. Second, While the MME in general better than any individual models, the CFS ensemble hindcast outperforms the MME in terms of the biennial tendency and the amplitude of the anomalies, suggesting that the improved skill of MME prediction is at the expense of overestimating the fractional variance of the leading mode. Other outstanding issues are also discussed.","[Wang, Bin; Lee, June-Yi] Univ Hawaii, IPRC, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Kang, I. -S.; Kug, J. -S.] Seoul Natl Univ, Seoul, South Korea; [Shukla, J.] George Mason Univ, Calverton, MD USA; [Shukla, J.] COLA, Calverton, MD USA; [Kumar, A.; Schemm, J.] NCEP, NOAA, Climate Predict Ctr, Camp Springs, MD USA; [Luo, J. -J.; Yamagata, T.] FRCGC JAMSTEC, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan; [Park, C. -K.] APEC Climate Ctr, Pusan, South Korea",University of Hawaii System; Seoul National University (SNU); George Mason University; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science & Technology (JAMSTEC),"Wang, B (corresponding author), Univ Hawaii, IPRC, POST Bldg,Room 401,1680 E W Rd, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",wangbin@hawaii.edu,"KUG, JONG-SEONG/A-8053-2013; Yamagata, Toshio/A-1807-2009; Luo, Jing-Jia/T-9612-2019; Lee, June-Yi/D-5752-2012; Luo, Jing-Jia/B-2481-2008; Lee, June-Yi/AAT-3407-2021; , AK/B-6517-2008","Luo, Jing-Jia/0000-0003-2181-0638; Lee, June-Yi/0000-0002-3986-9753; Luo, Jing-Jia/0000-0003-2181-0638; Lee, June-Yi/0000-0002-3986-9753; KUG, JONG-SEONG/0000-0003-2251-2579",,,,,55,121,131,2,27,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0930-7575,1432-0894,,CLIM DYNAM,Clim.

Key priorities are balancing flood risk and hydropower production, and improving aquatic ecosystem function while incorporating projected effects of climate change. In support of the US effort, Chegwidden et al. (2017) developed a large-ensemble dataset of past and future daily streamflows at 396 sites throughout the Columbia River basin (CRB) and selected other watersheds in western Washington and Oregon, using state-of-the art climate and hydrologic models. In this study, we use that dataset to present new analyses of the effects of future climate change on flooding using water year maximum daily streamflows. For each simulation, flood statistics are estimated from generalized extreme value distributions fit to simulated water year maximum daily streamflows for 50-year windows of the past (1950-1999) and future (2050-2099) periods. Our results contrast with previous findings: we find that the vast majority of locations in the CRB are estimated to experience an increase in future streamflow magnitudes. The near ubiquity of increases is all the more remarkable in that our approach explores a larger set of methodological variation than previous studies; however, like previous studies, our modeling system was not calibrated to minimize error in maximum daily streamflow and may be affected by unquantifiable errors. We show that on the Columbia and Willamette rivers increases in streamflow magnitudes are smallest downstream and grow larger moving upstream. For the Snake River, however, the pattern is reversed, with increases in streamflow magnitudes growing larger moving downstream to the confluence with the Salmon River tributary and then abruptly dropping. We decompose the variation in results attributable to variability in climate and hydrologic factors across the ensemble, finding that climate contributes more variation in larger basins, while hydrology contributes more in smaller basins. Equally important for practical applications like flood control rule curves, the seasonal timing of flooding shifts dramatically on some rivers (e.g., on the Snake, 20th-century floods occur exclusively in late spring, but by the end of the 21st century some floods occur as early as December) and not at all on others (e.g., the Willamette River).","[Queen, Laura E.; Mote, Philip W.; Rupp, David E.] Oregon State Univ, Oregon Climate Change Res Inst, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Chegwidden, Oriana; Nijssen, Bart] Univ Washington, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Seattle, WA 98105 USA",Oregon State University; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Queen, LE (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Oregon Climate Change Res Inst, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",lqueen@uoregon.edu,"; Nijssen, Bart/B-1013-2012","Queen, Laura/0000-0003-2096-9452; Mote, Philip/0000-0002-3580-3730; Nijssen, Bart/0000-0002-4062-0322",NOAA [NA15OAR4310145],NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA),This research has been supported by the NOAA (grant no.

However, their deficiencies also result in model biases. The role of convection schemes in modern atmospheric models is examined using Selected Process On/Off Klima Intercomparison Experiment simulations without parameterized convection and forced with observed sea surface temperatures. Convection schemes are not required for reasonable climatological precipitation. However, they are essential for reasonable daily precipitation and constraining extreme daily precipitation that otherwise develops. Systematic effects on lapse rate and humidity are likewise modest compared with the intermodel spread. Without parameterized convection Kelvin waves are more realistic. An unexpectedly large moist Southern Hemisphere storm track bias is identified. This storm track bias persists without convection schemes, as does the double Intertropical Convergence Zone and excessive ocean precipitation biases. This suggests that model biases originate from processes other than convection or that convection schemes are missing key processes. Plain Language Summary Accurately modeling rainfall is critical for predicting weather and climate. Convective clouds are much smaller than climate models can simulate so the rainfall generated is estimated using a convection scheme. Rainfall is difficult to estimate, and deficiencies in the schemes result in model errors. Using simulations with and without convection schemes, we assess what impact convection schemes have on mean rainfall in state-of-the-art climate models. We find that long-term rainfall patterns are similar regardless of whether the convection schemes are used or not. Without convection schemes the atmosphere is drier and cooler. However, these differences are smaller than might be expected. In this study we show that convection schemes are not required for reasonable long-term rainfall patterns for prescribed SST model runs but are essential for reasonable daily precipitation. We aim to provide guidance for modeling centers on the impact of convection schemes on long-term mean rainfall and on long standing model biases.","[Maher, Penelope; Vallis, Geoffrey K.; Sansom, Philip G.] Univ Exeter, Dept Math, Exeter, Devon, England; [Sherwood, Steven C.] Univ New South Wales, ARC Ctr Excellence Climate Extremes, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Webb, Mark J.] Met Off Hadley Ctr, Exeter, Devon, England",University of Exeter; University of New South Wales Sydney; Met Office - UK; Hadley Centre,"Maher, P (corresponding author), Univ Exeter, Dept Math, Exeter, Devon, England.",p.maher@exeter.ac.uk,"; Sherwood, Steven/B-5673-2008","Maher, Penelope/0000-0001-8513-8700; Webb, Mark/0000-0002-7709-7088; Sansom, Philip/0000-0002-5596-4507; Sherwood, Steven/0000-0001-7420-8216",Natural Environment Research Council; Met Office as part of the EuroClim project [NE/M006123/1]; ParaCon project [NE/N013123/1]; Royal Society (Wolfson Foundation); Joint UK BEIS/Defra Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme [GA01101]; Australian Research Council [FL150100035]; NERC [NE/N013123/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Met Office as part of the EuroClim project; ParaCon project; Royal Society (Wolfson Foundation)(Royal Society of London); Joint UK BEIS/Defra Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme; Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"P.

In most models, IOD peak-season amplitudes are systematically larger than that of the observed, a bias that deterministically affects climate projections in IOD-affected regions. Understanding the cause of this bias is therefore essential for alleviating model errors and reducing uncertainty in climate projections. Here it is shown that most Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase Three (CMIP3) and CMIP5 models produce too strong a Bjerknes feedback in the equatorial Indian Ocean, leading to the IOD bias. The thermocline-sea surface temperature (SST) feedback exerts the strongest influence on the simulated IOD amplitude; models simulating a stronger thermocline-SST feedback systematically generate a greater IOD amplitude. The strength of the thermocline-SST feedback in most models is predominantly controlled by the climatological west-east slope of the equatorial thermocline, which features an unrealistic mean slope tilting upward toward the eastern Indian Ocean. The unrealistic thermocline structure is accompanied by too strong a mean easterly wind and an overly strong west-minus-east SST gradient. The linkage of the mean climatic conditions, feedback strength, and projected climate highlights the fundamental importance of realistically simulating these components of the climate system for reducing uncertainty in climate change projections in IOD-affected regions.","[Cai, Wenju; Cowan, Tim] CSIRO Marine & Atmospher Res, Aspendale, Vic 3195, Australia",Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Cai, WJ (corresponding author), CSIRO Marine & Atmospher Res, PMB 1, Aspendale, Vic 3195, Australia.",Wenju.Cai@csiro.au,"Cai, Wenju/C-2864-2012; Cowan, Tim/A-5797-2013; Cowan, Timothy D/AAA-7372-2019","Cai, Wenju/0000-0001-6520-0829; Cowan, Timothy D/0000-0002-8376-4879",Australian Climate Change Science Program; Goyder Institute for Water Research; CSIRO Wealth from Oceans National Research Flagship,Australian Climate Change Science Program; Goyder Institute for Water Research; CSIRO Wealth from Oceans National Research Flagship,"We thank Arnold Sullivan and Evan Weller for reviewing the paper before submission and the two anonymous reviewers for their comments and suggestions.

The simulation results were used to assess the inter-annual variability and long-term changes in the SCS wave climate for the period 1979 to 2009. The model was forced with Climate Forecast System Reanalysis winds and validated against altimeter data and limited available measurements from an Acoustic Wave and Current recorder located offshore of Terengganu, Malaysia. The mean annual significant wave height and peak wave period indicate the occurrence of higher wave heights and wave periods in the central SCS and lower in the Sunda shelf region. Consistent with wind patterns, the wave direction also shows southeasterly (northwesterly) waves during the summer (winter) monsoon. This detailed hindcast demonstrates strong inter-annual variability of wave heights, especially during the winter months in the SCS. Significant wave height correlated negatively with Nio3.4 index during winter, spring and autumn seasons but became positive in the summer monsoon. Such correlations correspond well with surface wind anomalies over the SCS during El Nino events. During El Nio Modoki, the summer time positive correlation extends northeastwards to cover the entire domain. Although significant positive trends were found at 95 % confidence levels during May, July and September, there is significant negative trend in December covering the Sunda shelf region.

Future changes in climate may affect forest growth and productivity. Currently, state-of-the-art Earth system models use prescribed wood harvest rates in future climate projections. These rates are defined by integrated assessment models (IAMs), only accounting for regional wood demand and largely ignoring the supply side from forests. Therefore, we assess how global growth and harvest potentials of forests change when they are allowed to respond to changes in environmental conditions. For this, we simulate wood harvest rates oriented towards the actual rate of forest growth. Applying this growth-based harvest rule (GB) in JSBACH, the land component of the Max Planck Institute's Earth system model, forced by several future climate scenarios, we realized a growth potential 2 to 4 times (3-9 PgC yr(-1)) the harvest rates prescribed by IAMs (1-3 PgC yr(-1)). Limiting GB to managed forest areas (MF), we simulated a harvest potential of 3-7 PgC yr(-1), 2 to 3 times higher than IAMs. This highlights the need to account for the dependence of forest growth on climate. To account for the long-term effects of wood harvest as integrated in IAMs, we added a life cycle analysis, showing that the higher supply with MF as an adaptive forest harvesting rule may improve the net mitigation effects of forest harvest during the 21st century by sequestering carbon in anthropogenic wood products.","[Yousefpour, Rasoul; Nabel, Julia E.

While the former process is well established in state-of-the-art climate model simulations, less attention has been paid to the latter. However, the low latitudes appear to be particularly sensitive to land use changes, especially in tropical Africa where frequent drought episodes were observed during recent decades. Here several ensembles of long-term transient climate change experiments are presented with a regional climate model to estimate the future pathway of African climate under fairly realistic forcing conditions. Therefore, the simulations are forced with increasing greenhouse gas concentrations as well as land use changes until 2050. Three different scenarios are prescribed in order to assess the range of options inferred from global political, social, and economical development. The authors find a prominent surface heating and a weakening of the hydrological cycle over most of tropical Africa, resulting in enhanced heat stress and extended dry spells. In contrast, the large-scale atmospheric circulation in upper levels is less affected, pointing to a primarily local effect of land degradation on near-surface climate. In the model study, it turns out that land use changes are primarily responsible for the simulated climate response. In general, simulated climate changes are not concealed by internal variability. Thus, the effect of land use changes has to be accounted for when developing more realistic scenarios for future African climate.","[Paeth, Heiko] Univ Wurzburg, Inst Geog, D-97074 Wurzburg, Germany; [Born, Kai] Univ Cologne, Inst Geophys & Meteorol, D-5000 Cologne, Germany; [Girmes, Robin] Univ Bonn, Inst Meteorol, D-5300 Bonn, Germany; [Podzun, Ralf; Jacob, Daniela] Max Planck Inst Meteorol, Hamburg, Germany",University of Wurzburg; University of Cologne; University of Bonn; Max Planck Society,"Paeth, H (corresponding author), Univ Wurzburg, Inst Geog, D-97074 Wurzburg, Germany.",heiko.paeth@uni-wuerzburg.de,,,"Federal German Minister of Education and Research (BMBF) [07 GWK 02]; Ministry of Education, Science and Research (MSWF); Federal State of Northrhine-Westfalia [223-21200200]; German interdisciplinary IMPETUS","Federal German Minister of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); Ministry of Education, Science and Research (MSWF); Federal State of Northrhine-Westfalia; German interdisciplinary IMPETUS","This work was supported by the Federal German Minister of Education and Research (BMBF) under Grant 07 GWK 02 and by the Ministry of Education, Science and Research (MSWF) of the Federal State of Northrhine-Westfalia under Grant 223-21200200.

Insured storm-related losses depend on (i) the frequency, nature and dynamics of storms, (ii) the vulnerability of the values at risk, (iii) the geographical distribution of these values, and (iv) the particular conditions of the risk transfer. It is thus of great importance to assess the impact of climate change on future storm losses. To this end, the current study employs-to our knowledge for the first time-a coupled approach, using output from high-resolution regional climate model scenarios for the European sector to drive an operational insurance loss model. An ensemble of coupled climate-damage scenarios is used to provide an estimate of the inherent uncertainties. Output of two state-of-the-art global climate models (HadAM3, ECHAM5) is used for present (1961-1990) and future climates (2071-2100, SRES A2 scenario). These serve as boundary data for two nested regional climate models with a sophisticated gust parametrizations (CLM, CHRM). For validation and calibration purposes, an additional simulation is undertaken with the CHRM driven by the ERA40 reanalysis. The operational insurance model (Swiss Re) uses a European-wide damage function, an average vulnerability curve for all risk types, and contains the actual value distribution of a complete European market portfolio. The coupling between climate and damage models is based on daily maxima of 10 m gust winds, and the strategy adopted consists of three main steps: (i) development and application of a pragmatic selection criterion to retrieve significant storm events, (ii) generation of a probabilistic event set using a Monte-Carlo approach in the hazard module of the insurance model, and (iii) calibration of the simulated annual expected losses with a historic loss data base. The climate models considered agree regarding an increase in the intensity of extreme storms in a band across central Europe (stretching from southern UK and northern France to Denmark, northern Germany into eastern Europe). This effect increases with event strength, and rare storms show the largest climate change sensitivity, but are also beset with the largest uncertainties. Wind gusts decrease over northern Scandinavia and Southern Europe. Highest intra-ensemble variability is simulated for Ireland, the UK, the Mediterranean, and parts of Eastern Europe. The resulting changes on European-wide losses over the 110-year period are positive for all layers and all model runs considered and amount to 44% (annual expected loss), 23% (10 years loss), 50% (30 years loss), and 104% (100 years loss). There is a disproportionate increase in losses for rare high-impact events. The changes result from increases in both severity and frequency of wind gusts. Considerable geographical variability of the expected losses exists, with Denmark and Germany experiencing the largest loss increases (116% and 114%, respectively). All countries considered except for Ireland (-22%) experience some loss increases. Some ramifications of these results for the socio-economic sector are discussed, and future avenues for research are highlighted. The technique introduced in this study and its application to realistic market portfolios offer exciting prospects for future research on the impact of climate change that is relevant for policy makers, scientists and economists.","[Schwierz, Cornelia] ETH, Seminar Stat, Zurich, Switzerland; [Koellner-Heck, Pamela; Bresch, David N.] Swiss Reinsurance Co, Zurich, Switzerland; ETH, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Schwierz, C (corresponding author), ETH, Seminar Stat, Zurich, Switzerland.",schwierz@stat.math.ethz.ch,"Wild, Martin/J-8977-2012; Bresch, David N./D-5298-2018; Vidale, Pier Luigi/AAF-6468-2019; Schar, Christoph/A-1033-2008","Bresch, David N./0000-0002-8431-4263; Vidale, Pier Luigi/0000-0002-1800-8460; Schar, Christoph/0000-0002-4171-1613",EU [EVK2-CT2001-00132]; Swiss National Science Foundation; Swiss Re; Natural Environment Research Council [ncas10009] Funding Source: researchfish,EU(European Commission); Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission); Swiss Re; Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"Parts of the data have been provided through the PRUDENCE data archive, funded by the EU through contract EVK2-CT2001-00132.

The analysis focuses on practical methodological guidance based on lessons from how different research teams have approached the challenges of complex collaborative research. We begin by identifying broad factors or actions that inhibit or facilitate the process, then highlight specific practices associated with co-production of knowledge and necessary competencies for undertaking co-production. We provide insights on issues such as the integration of social and professional cultures, gender and social equity, and power dynamics, and illustrate the different ways in which researchers have addressed these issues.

Physically-based crop models have been designed, which require large sets of input var-iables, besides being timeworn, tedious, and not user-friendly in the current situation. There is a rapid advancement in the modeling approaches in agricultural practices. But, still, there is a shortage of comprehensive information related to the recent technological advancement in the modeling applications toward CSA and its prospects. The paper reviews, critically assess, and discusses the present state-of-art modeling technologies related to the CSA. Special emphasis is placed on highlighting the current research trends in the different crop simulation models and their CSA applications. The assessment and analysis of the combined implications of crop simulation and hydrological models form another vital area of our review. Subsequently, the suitability and future scope of AI in crop simulation models is thoroughly assessed. Finally, the ways to address future chal-lenges for CSA through the models and AI-based approaches are evaluated. We have selected and critically reviewed the literature to deliberate on the various aspects of modeling and their impact on CSA. Overall, we attempted to distinctly bring out the different latest and advanced technologies and their potential roles in modeling exercises towards CSA. The current review also collates and presents new and innovative modeling approaches toward CSA with techno-feasible solutions. The review involves the simulation-optimization framework for coupling hydrological and climate models with crop models that presently have the utmost importance for the CSA. Concurrently it also highlights the overarching significance of different models and suggests refined solutions that enable better crop and environment estimation, field management, and decision -making.","[Gupta, Debaditya; Gujre, Nihal; Singha, Siddhartha; Mitra, Sudip] Indian Inst Technol Guwahati IITG, Sch Agro & Rural Technol, Assam 781039, India; [Gujre, Nihal] Indian Inst Trop Meterol, Pune 411008, Maharashtra, India; [Mitra, Sudip] Indian Inst Technol Guwahati, Sch Agro & Rural Technol, Agroecotechnol Lab, Assam 781039, India",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Guwahati; Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) - India; Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM); Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Guwahati,"Mitra, S (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol Guwahati, Sch Agro & Rural Technol, Agroecotechnol Lab, Assam 781039, India.",sudipmitra@iitg.ac.in,,,"Ministry of Education (MoE) , Government of India","Ministry of Education (MoE) , Government of India","No specific grant was obtained for this work.

Current state-of-the-art climate models are Convection Permitting Models (CPMs) at kilometre scale grid-spacing. CPMs are often used together with convective parameterised Regional Climate Models (RCMs) due to high computational costs of CPMs. This study compares the representation of extreme precipitation events between a 12 km resolution RCM and a 2.2 km resolution CPM. Precipitation events are tracked in both models, and extreme events, identified by peak intensity, are analysed in a Northern European case area. Extreme event tracks show large differences in both location and movement patterns between the CPM and RCM. This indicates that different event types are sampled in the two models, with differences extending to much larger scales. We visualise event-development using area-intensity evolution diagrams. This reveals that for the 100 most extreme events, the RCM data is likely dominated by physically implausible events, so called 'grid-point storms', with unrealistically high intensities. For the 1000 and 10,000 most extreme events, intensities are higher for CPM events, while areas are larger for RCM extreme events. Sampling extreme events by season shows that differences between RCM and CPM in intensity and area in the top 100 extreme events are largest in autumn and winter, while for the top 1000 and top 10,000 events differences are largest in summer. Overall this study indicates that extreme precipitation projections from traditional coarse resolution RCMs need to be used with caution, due to the possible influence of grid-point storms.","[Thomassen, Emma D.; Sorup, Hjalte J.

It can experience an interannual extreme swing, moving hundreds of kilometres northwards during boreal spring, causing severe droughts in central-eastern Amazon and floods in northern South America. How its interannual variability will respond to global warming remains unknown. Here using state-of-the-art climate models under a high-emission scenario, we project a more-than-doubling increase of extreme northward swings. This increase from one event per 20.4 years in the twentieth century to one per 9.3 years in the twenty-first century is underpinned by a mean state change of sea surface temperature, with faster warming north of the Equator. The warming differential facilitates the increased frequency of extreme swings, as the ITCZ follows the maximum sea surface temperature. Our finding suggests a substantial increase in ITCZ swing-induced severe droughts/floods in the Atlantic-rim countries. The Atlantic intertropical convergence zone can experience extreme northward shifts, with resultant precipitation changes. Model projections show the frequency of these extreme shifts will increase under climate change, driven by faster sea surface warming north of the Equator.","[Liu, Yi; Cai, Wenju; Lin, Xiaopei; Li, Ziguang] Ocean Univ China, Frontiers Sci Ctr Deep Ocean Multispheres & Earth, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Liu, Yi; Cai, Wenju; Lin, Xiaopei; Li, Ziguang] Ocean Univ China, Key Lab Phys Oceanog, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Liu, Yi; Cai, Wenju; Lin, Xiaopei; Li, Ziguang] Pilot Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol Qingdao, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Cai, Wenju] CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere, Ctr Southern Hemisphere Oceans Res CSHOR, Hobart, Tas, Australia",Ocean University of China; Ocean University of China; Qingdao National Laboratory for Marine Science & Technology; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Lin, XP; Li, ZG (corresponding author), Ocean Univ China, Frontiers Sci Ctr Deep Ocean Multispheres & Earth, Qingdao, Peoples R China.;Lin, XP; Li, ZG (corresponding author), Ocean Univ China, Key Lab Phys Oceanog, Qingdao, Peoples R China.;Lin, XP; Li, ZG (corresponding author), Pilot Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol Qingdao, Qingdao, Peoples R China.",linxiaop@ouc.edu.cn; ziguangli@ouc.edu.cn,"cai, wenju/C-2864-2012","cai, wenju/0000-0001-6520-0829; Liu, Yi/0000-0002-7488-4481; Li, Ziguang/0000-0002-3009-0700","China's National Key Research and Development Projects [2018YFA0605704]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [92058203, 41806007, 41925025]; CSHOR, a joint research Centre for Southern Hemisphere Oceans Research between QNLM; CSIRO; China Scholarship Council [202106330019]; CMIP6; ESGF","China's National Key Research and Development Projects; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); CSHOR, a joint research Centre for Southern Hemisphere Oceans Research between QNLM; CSIRO(Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)); China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council); CMIP6; ESGF","This work is supported by China's National Key Research and Development Projects (2018YFA0605704) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (92058203 and 41806007) (Z.L.) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (92058203 and 41925025) (X.L.).

We circumvent this shortcoming by employing the SURFEX land-surface model coupled to TEB (Town Energy Balance) urban canopy model, forced by EURO-CORDEX regional climate simulations. We demonstrate the added-value of CORDEX-SURFEX-TEB compared to EURO-CORDEX in reproducing Lisbon's temperature observations, halving the bias and improving the PDF matching by similar to 5%. Furthermore, the proposed framework allows characterizing the urban heat island (UHI) effect. Over Lisbon, the annual-mean UHI was similar to+3 degrees C (city warmer than rural) during nighttime, and around -0.5 to -1 degrees C (city cooler than rural) during daytime. The CORDEX-SURFEX-TEB climate projections for Lisbon, under fixed land-use and RCP8.5 scenario, showed a warming of similar to+1 degrees C by 2021-2050 and similar to+3.5 degrees C by 2070-2099. Despite the large multi-model spread, these long-term temperature changes were roughly constant for all hours and for urban and rural environments (corresponding to roughly constant UHI magnitude). Our results also reveal large seasonality of Lisbon's UHI effect and of long-term warming. Finally, the projections show a striking growth in the number of extreme hot days and nights, respectively nearly tripling and quintupling its current value by 2070-2099.","[Nogueira, Miguel; Lima, Daniela C.

To address this question we use several data sources: (1) multidecadal trends derived from various observational data sets, (2) estimates of natural variability provided by a 2000 year paleoclimatic model simulation, and (3) response to greenhouse gas forcing derived from regional climate simulations driven by the A1B and RCP4.5 scenarios (from ENSEMBLES and CORDEX projects). Results indicate that, over the past decades, the climate in the Baltic Sea Basin has undergone a change that is beyond the estimated range of natural variability. We test the hypothesis that this change may be understood as a manifestation of global warming due to increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs). We find that changes in near-surface temperature support our hypothesis that the effect of GHG is needed to simulate the observed changes. The pattern correlation and regression results clearly illustrate the concerted emergence of an anthropogenic signal consistent with the GHG signal in summer and autumn in the 21st century. However, none of the 19 regional climate simulations used in this study reproduce the observed warming. The observed trends in precipitation and surface solar radiation are also partially inconsistent with the expected changes due to GHG forcing. We conclude that, besides the regional response to GHG forcing, other human-made drivers have had an imprint. Regional emission of industrial aerosols has been strongly reduced in this region, and we suggest that this reduction may be the missing driver.","[Barkhordarian, A.; von Storch, H.; Zorita, E.] Helmholtz Zentrum Geesthacht, Inst Coastal Res, Geesthacht, Germany; [Barkhordarian, A.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Barkhordarian, A.] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Gomez-Navarro, J.

J,"McKie, A",,,,"McKie, Andrew",,,Using the arts and humanities to promote a liberal nursing education: Strengths and weaknesses,NURSE EDUCATION TODAY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Liberal education; Arts; Humanities; Graduate attributes; Educational standards; Narrative,ENTERPRISE; KNOWLEDGE,"Background: The requirement that all student nurses in the United Kingdom will be educated to degree level from 2013 permits a review of the current state of nursing education in university contexts. Recent educational standards for these new programmes (NMC, 2010) allow a liberal, or broad-based, education, with its features of breadth of knowledge, formativity, critical thinking and working with others, to be considered. Objective: Select narratives from a PhD study featuring student nurses and nurse teachers exploring the relationship between reading literature and poetry and ethical practice are presented to critically support the place of liberal education within these programmes. Design: These narratives are drawn from a research study based upon the use of a narrative methodology. Settings: The study was set within the educational context of a school of nursing and midwifery in one Scottish university. Participants: Eight student nurses and four nurse teachers participated in the study. Methods: These narratives were constructed from data derived from focus groups and individual interviews. Results: These narratives suggest that liberal education can be promoted within international curricula via careful positioning of, and student nurse engagement with, the arts and humanities. A liberal education can influence student nurses' sense of discernment, enhance their own responsibility for learning, support ethical regard for others, provide different perspectives on human experience and contribute to a balanced curriculum. Although a liberal education cannot guarantee fully skilled and ethically sensitive practitioners, it can contribute towards its achievement. Conclusion: The current university education climate presents obstacles to the promotion of liberal education. Nevertheless, the considerable professional and personal challenges of nursing practice in global terms make such an educational preparation essential. If nursing education to degree level is to commence from 2013, these principal features of liberal education, via these educational standards, must be embedded prominently into new programmes.

Resilience research among social scientists is characterized by much more diversity today than a few decades ago. Different definitions and understandings of resilience appear in publications during the last 10 years. Resilience research increasingly bears the mark of social constructivism, a relative newcomer compared to the more longstanding tradition of naturalism. There are also approaches that are indebted to both naturalism and constructivism, which, of course, come in many varieties. Based on our overview of recent scholarship, which is far from being exhaustive, we have identified six research avenues that arguably deserve continued attention. They combine naturalist and constructivist insights and approaches so that human agency, reflexivity, and considerations of justice and equity are incorporated into systems thinking research or supplement such research. Ultimately, we believe that the overarching challenge for future research is to ensure that resilience to climate change does not compromise sustainability and considerations of justice (including environmental, climate, and energy justice).","[Ossewaarde, Ringo; Torenvlied, Rene] Univ Twente, Dept Publ Adm, Drienerlolaan 5, NL-7522 NB Enschede, Netherlands; [Filatova, Tatiana; Ozerol, Gul] Univ Twente, Dept Governance & Technol Sustainabil, Drienerlolaan 5, NL-7522 NB Enschede, Netherlands; [Georgiadou, Yola; Pfeffer, Karin] Univ Twente, Dept Urban & Reg Planning & Geoinformat Managemen, Hengelosestr 99, NL-7514 AE Enschede, Netherlands; [Hartmann, Andreas] Univ Twente, Dept Construct Management & Engn, Drienerlolaan 5, NL-7522 NB Enschede, Netherlands; [Stegmaier, Peter] Univ Twente, Dept Sci Technol & Policy Studies, Drienerlolaan 5, NL-7522 NB Enschede, Netherlands; [van der Voort, Mascha] Univ Twente, Dept Design Prod & Management, Drienerlolaan 5, NL-7522 NB Enschede, Netherlands; [Warmink, Jord; Borsje, Bas] Univ Twente, Dept Water Engn & Management, Drienerlolaan 5, NL-7522 NB Enschede, Netherlands",University of Twente; University of Twente; University of Twente; University of Twente; University of Twente; University of Twente; University of Twente,"Ossewaarde, R (corresponding author), Univ Twente, Dept Publ Adm, Drienerlolaan 5, NL-7522 NB Enschede, Netherlands.",m.r.r.ossewaarde@utwente.nl,"; Pfeffer, Karin/E-1408-2017","Warmink, Jord/0000-0002-3273-5664; van der Voort, Mascha/0000-0002-4800-7557; Pfeffer, Karin/0000-0002-6080-1323; Ossewaarde, Marinus/0000-0003-3449-1074",,,,,145,1,1,3,15,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1561-8633,1684-9981,,NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS,Nat.

Previous review papers have mainly focused on the performance and advantages of green roofs. The objective of this paper is to examine the primary layers: The waterproof and anti-root membranes; the protection, filter, and drainage layers; the substrate; and the vegetation. First, the history, modern applications, benefits and classification are analyzed in order to present a well-defined state of the art of this technology. Then, the roles, requirements, characteristics, and materials are assessed for each green roof layers. This technology was compared to a conventional roof technology, Mediterranean climate conditions and their influence on green roof design were assessed, also comparing them with Tropical area and focusing on irrigation systems, examples about the commercial materials and products available in the market were provided and innovative materials coming from recycled sources were analyzed. Future research should evaluate new materials for green roof technologies, in order to enhance their performance and increase their sustainability.

While multiple individual forecasts are generated to represent the uncertain weather system, the performance of ensemble forecasting is unsatisfactory. In this paper we conduct data analysis based on the expertise of human forecasters and introduce a machine learning method for ensemble forecasting. The proposed method, Label Distribution Learning with Climate Probability (LDLCP), can improve the accuracy of both deterministic forecasting and probabilistic forecasting. The LDLCP method utilizes the relevant variables of previous forecasts to construct the feature matrix and applies label distribution learning (LDL) to adjust the probability distribution of ensemble forecast. Our proposal is novel in its specialized target function and appropriate conditional probability function for the ensemble forecasting task, which can optimize the forecasts to be consistent with local climate. Experimental testing is performed on both artificial data and the data set for ensemble forecasting of precipitation in East China from August to November, 2017. Experimental results show that, compared with a baseline method and two state-of-the-art machine learning methods, LDLCP shows significantly better performance on measures of RMSE and average continuous ranked probability score.","[Yang, Xuebing; Wu, Yajing; Zhang, Wensheng] Chinese Acad Sci, Res Ctr Precis Sensing & Control, Inst Automat, 95 Zhongguancun East Rd, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Wu, Yajing] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Wensheng] Foshan Univ, Sch Math & Big Data, Foshan, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Tang, Wei] Publ Meteorol Serv Ctr China Meteorol Adm, Beijing, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Automation, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Foshan University","Yang, XB (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Res Ctr Precis Sensing & Control, Inst Automat, 95 Zhongguancun East Rd, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China.",yangxuebing2013@ia.ac.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [U1636220, 61602482]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),The authors would like to express their gratitude to the CMA Public Meteorological Service Center for providing the meteorological data.

The uncertainty of five state-of-the-art climate forcings and the resulting range of cell runoff that is simulated by the global hydrological modelWaterGAP is presented. On the global land surface, about 62% of precipitation evapotranspires, whereas 38% discharges into oceans and inland sinks. During 1971-2000, evapotranspiration due to human water use amounted to almost 1% of precipitation, while this anthropogenic water flow increased by a factor of approximately 5 between 1901 and 2010. Deviation of estimated global discharge from the ensemble mean due to climate forcing uncertainty is approximately 4 %. Precipitation uncertainty is the most important reason for the uncertainty of discharge and evapotranspiration, followed by shortwave downward radiation. At continental levels, deviations of water balance components due to uncertain climate forcing are higher, with the highest discharge deviations occurring for river discharge in Africa (-6 to 11% from the ensemble mean). Uncertain climate forcings also affect the estimation of irrigation water use and thus the estimated human impact of river discharge. The uncertainty range of global irrigation water consumption amounts to approximately 50% of the global sum of water consumption in the other water use sector.","[Mueller Schmied, Hannes; Adam, Linda; Portmann, Felix Theodor; Reinecke, Robert; Riedel, Claudia; Song, Qi; Zhang, Jing; Doell, Petra] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Inst Phys Geog, Frankfurt, Germany; [Mueller Schmied, Hannes] Senckenberg Biodivers & Climate Res Ctr BiK F, Frankfurt, Germany; [Eisner, Stephanie; Fink, Gabriel; Floerke, Martina] Univ Kassel, CESR, Kassel, Germany; [Kim, Hyungjun; Oki, Taikan] Univ Tokyo, Inst Ind Sci, Tokyo, Japan",Goethe University Frankfurt; Senckenberg Biodiversitat & Klima- Forschungszentrum (BiK-F); Senckenberg Gesellschaft fur Naturforschung (SGN); Universitat Kassel; University of Tokyo,"Muller Schmied, H (corresponding author), Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Inst Phys Geog, Frankfurt, Germany.;Muller Schmied, H (corresponding author), Senckenberg Biodivers & Climate Res Ctr BiK F, Frankfurt, Germany.",hannes.mueller.schmied@em.uni-frankfurt.de,"Oki, Taikan/E-5778-2010; Schmied, Hannes Müller/K-6231-2013; KIM, HYUNGJUN/I-5099-2014; Floerke, Martina/ABE-6288-2020; Döll, Petra/A-3784-2009; Reinecke, Robert/K-3693-2019","Oki, Taikan/0000-0003-4067-4678; Schmied, Hannes Müller/0000-0001-5330-9923; KIM, HYUNGJUN/0000-0003-1083-8416; Döll, Petra/0000-0003-2238-4546; Reinecke, Robert/0000-0001-5699-8584; Eisner, Stephanie/0000-0002-0157-1636",ISI-MIP coordination team,ISI-MIP coordination team,"The authors thank the Global Runoff Data Centre (GRDC, http://grdc.bafg.de), 56068 Koblenz, Germany, for providing the discharge data used in this study for calibrating the model.

Comparison of precipitation and temperature estimates from the three models with gridded observations reveals large differences between the reanalyses and also of the observation datasets. A major source of uncertainty in the observations is the spatial distribution and change of the number of gauges over time. In South America, active measuring stations were reduced from 4267 to 390. The quality of precipitation estimates from the reanalyses strongly depends on the geographic location, as there are significant differences especially in tropical regions. The closure of the water cycle in the three reanalyses is analyzed by estimating long-term mean values for precipitation, evapotranspiration, surface runoff, and moisture flux divergence. Major shortcomings in the moisture budgets of the datasets are mainly due to inconsistencies of the net precipitation minus evaporation and evapotranspiration, respectively, (P - E) estimates over the oceans and landmasses. This imbalance largely originates from the assimilation of radiance sounding data from the NOAA-15 satellite, which results in an unrealistic increase of oceanic P - E in the MERRA and CFSR budgets. Overall, ERA-Interim shows both a comparatively reasonable closure of the terrestrial and atmospheric water balance and a reasonable agreement with the observation datasets. The limited performance of the three state-of-the-art reanalyses in reproducing the hydrological cycle, however, puts the use of these models for climate trend analyses and long-term water budget studies into question.","[Lorenz, Christof; Kunstmann, Harald] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Dept Atmospher Environm Res IMK IFU, D-82467 Garmisch Partenkirchen, Germany; [Kunstmann, Harald] Univ Augsburg, Inst Geog Reg Climate & Hydrol, Augsburg, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; University of Augsburg,"Lorenz, C (corresponding author), Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Dept Atmospher Environm Res IMK IFU, Kreuzeckbahnstr 19, D-82467 Garmisch Partenkirchen, Germany.",christof.lorenz@kit.edu,"Kunstmann, Harald/A-7071-2013; Lorenz, Christof/ABE-7130-2020","Kunstmann, Harald/0000-0001-9573-1743; Lorenz, Christof/0000-0001-5590-5470",DFG [1257],DFG(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"We thank the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecast, the Global Modeling and Assimilation Office, the Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center, the National Centers for Environmental Prediction, and the National Center for Atmospheric Research for creating and providing the reanalysis data.

Over the thermocline dome, the El Nino-forced Rossby waves help sustain the IO basin (IOB) mode and offer climate predictability for the IO and surrounding countries. This study shows that a common equatorial easterly wind bias, by forcing a westward-propagating downwelling Rossby wave in the southern IO, induces too deep a thermocline dome over the southwestern IO (SWIO) in state-of-the-art climate models. Such a deep SWIO thermocline weakens the influence of subsurface variability on sea surface temperature (SST), reducing the IOB amplitude and possibly limiting the models' skill of regional climate prediction. To the extent that the equatorial easterly wind bias originates from errors of the South Asian summer monsoon, improving the monsoon simulation can lead to substantial improvements in simulating and predicting interannual variability in the IO.","[Li, Gen; Du, Yan] Chinese Acad Sci, South China Sea Inst Oceanol, State Key Lab Trop Oceanog, Guangzhou 510301, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Li, Gen] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Minist Educ, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Xie, Shang-Ping] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Xie, Shang-Ping] Ocean Univ China, Phys Oceanog Lab, Qingdao, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; South China Sea Institute of Oceanology, CAS; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; University of California System; University of California San Diego; Scripps Institution of Oceanography; Ocean University of China","Li, G (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, South China Sea Inst Oceanol, State Key Lab Trop Oceanog, 164 West Xingang Rd, Guangzhou 510301, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",ligen@scsio.ac.cn,"DU, Yan/C-4496-2013; Xie, Shang-Ping/C-1254-2009","DU, Yan/0000-0002-7842-0801; Xie, Shang-Ping/0000-0002-3676-1325","National Basic Research Program of China [2012CB955603, 2010CB950302]; Natural Science Foundation of China [41406026]; Pearl River Nova Program of Guangzhou; Technology Foundation for Selected Overseas Chinese Scholars (Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security of the People's Republic of China); Open Project Program of Key Laboratory of Meteorological Disaster of Ministry of Education (Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology) [KLME1402]; U.S. National Science Foundation; CAS/SAFEA International Partnership Program for Creative Research Teams; Open Project Program of State Key Laboratory of Tropical Oceanography [LTOZZ1202]",National Basic Research Program of China(National Basic Research Program of China); Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Pearl River Nova Program of Guangzhou; Technology Foundation for Selected Overseas Chinese Scholars (Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security of the People's Republic of China); Open Project Program of Key Laboratory of Meteorological Disaster of Ministry of Education (Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology); U.S. National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); CAS/SAFEA International Partnership Program for Creative Research Teams(Chinese Academy of Sciences); Open Project Program of State Key Laboratory of Tropical Oceanography,"This work was supported by the National Basic Research Program of China (Grants 2012CB955603 and 2010CB950302), the Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant 41406026), the Pearl River Nova Program of Guangzhou, the Technology Foundation for Selected Overseas Chinese Scholars (Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security of the People's Republic of China), the Open Project Program of Key Laboratory of Meteorological Disaster of Ministry of Education (Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology; Grant KLME1402), the U.S. National Science Foundation, the CAS/SAFEA International Partnership Program for Creative Research Teams, and the Open Project Program of State Key Laboratory of Tropical Oceanography (Grant LTOZZ1202).

The aim was to assess the degree to which local stakeholders sought to address the climate challenge. We found that the mitigation of climate impacts and the development of renewable energy did not feature prominently in the analysed documents, suggesting that both central policymakers and local stakeholders in Polish fisheries regions had a low level of awareness about the climate problem and their potentially important role in addressing it.

They include crop and/or cultivar-specific parameters that need to be calibrated. However, the availability of reference data is often limited. An alternative is to use yield records from widely available Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN). The goal of this study was therefore to propose and test a crop model calibration procedure that makes use of FADN data. To account for the lack of management information in the FADN databases, the concept of 'Meteorologically Possible Yield' (MPY) was adopted. This concept is particularly relevant in the context of climate impact studies as MPYs are by definition only driven by climate variability. As an example, the procedure was applied to calibrate the generic crop model CropSyst for a region located in north-eastern Switzerland. Validation using data from a long-term field trial with detailed information on fertilizer applications showed that the proposed procedure provides robust simulation results and is therefore suitable for climate impact studies in regions where detailed experimental data are scarce. In a case study application, the transferability of the local calibration to a site with drier conditions was tested and simulation results for this new site were compared to results obtained using local recalibration. Results showed that predicted yields can differ substantially and the differences can be strongly amplified when impacts of climate change are considered. This highlights the need for adjusting model calibrations to local site conditions and for considering parameter uncertainties in climate impact studies. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The CCMI aims to conduct a detailed evaluation of participating models using process-oriented diagnostics derived from observations in order to gain confidence in the models' projections of the stratospheric ozone layer, tropospheric composition, air quality, where applicable global climate change, and the interactions between them. Interpretation of these diagnostics requires detailed knowledge of the radiative, chemical, dynamical, and physical processes incorporated in the models. Also an understanding of the degree to which CCMI-1 recommendations for simulations have been followed is necessary to understand model responses to anthropogenic and natural forcing and also to explain intermodel differences. This becomes even more important given the ongoing development and the ever-growing complexity of these models. This paper also provides an overview of the available CCMI-1 simulations with the aim of informing CCMI data users.","[Morgenstern, Olaf; Zeng, Guang] Natl Inst Water & Atmospher Res NIWA, Wellington, New Zealand; [Hegglin, Michaela I.] Univ Reading, Dept Meteorol, Reading, Berks, England; [Mancini, Eva; Pitari, Giovanni] Univ Aquila, Dept Phys & Chem Sci, Laquila, Italy; [Plummer, David A.] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Rozanov, Eugene; Revell, Laura E.; Stenke, Andrea] ETHZ, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, Zurich, Switzerland; [Revell, Laura E.] Bodeker Sci, Christchurch, New Zealand; [Garcia, Rolando R.; Kinnison, Douglas; Tilmes, Simone] NCAR, Boulder, CO USA; [Akiyoshi, Hideharu; Yamashita, Yousuke] NIES, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Josse, Beatrice; Marecal, Virginie; Michou, Martine; Saint-Martin, David; Sudo, Kengo] Meteo France CNRS, CNRM, UMR 3589, Toulouse, France; [Joeckel, Patrick] Deutsch Zentrum Luft & Raumfahrt DLR, Inst Phys Atmosphare, Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany; [Schofield, Robyn; Stone, Kane] Univ Melbourne, Sch Earth Sci, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Manyin, Michael E.; Oman, Luke D.] NASA, GSFC, Greenbelt, MD USA; [Horowitz, Larry W.; Lin, Meiyun] NOAA, GFDL, Princeton, NJ USA; [O'Connor, Fiona M.; Butchart, Neal; Hardiman, Steven C.] MOHC, Exeter, Devon, England; [Deushi, Makoto; Tanaka, Taichu Y.; Yoshida, Kohei] Mission Res Inc, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Chipperfield, Martyn P.; Dhomse, Sandip S.] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Abraham, N.

This article describes the data envelopment analysis (DEA) technique for evaluating the relative efficiencies of organizations that consume multiple inputs and produce multiple outputs and demonstrates its application to organizational research. The use of DEA is illustrated by calculating the relative efficiencies of the branch offices in a retail banking network, and it is shown that measures of efficiency calculated using the DEA method correlate significantly with organizational climate as measured by employee's perceptions of operational and management practices. It is suggested that researchers studying the relationship between organizational effectiveness and the psychology of the workplace should consider using DEA, especially when multiple dimensions of effectiveness are involved.","Business Analyt Ltd, London NW8 9JL, England; Int Survey Res, London, England",,"Gelade, G (corresponding author), Business Analyt Ltd, 1 Circus Lodge,Circus Rd, London NW8 9JL, England.",,,,,,,,68,15,16,1,30,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1094-4281,,,ORGAN RES METHODS,Organ.

The effect of such changes on environmental impacts must be assessed, if the environmental goals of agriculture are also to be achieved in the future. We therefore assess the environmental impacts of adaptation scenarios previously developed with a purely economic perspective, for two case study regions in Switzerland. We use life cycle assessment at the whole-farm level, which enables the consideration of multiple environmental impact indicators, allowing us to identify potential trade-offs. We assess a simulated mixed livestock and arable crop farm representative of average farms in the two case study regions. The simulated farm is economically optimized for a reference scenario (current situation) and four future scenarios combining a climate change scenario representing a worst case change signal, and various price and policy scenarios. Results show that environmental impacts tend to increase in the future climate. Farms tend to extensify production, leading to a decrease in eco-efficiency, even more so if a decrease in agricultural product prices is assumed: socio-economic conditions may have even more influence than climate change, suggesting that there is a high potential for policy-makers to influence and mitigate the effects of climate change on agricultural productivity and the associated environmental impacts. The impacts of irrigation water use on aquatic biodiversity are revealed to be an important trade-off with farm economic optimization in the future. It is therefore recommended that aquatic biodiversity impacts be considered in assessments of agricultural adaptation to climate change. Policies directly targeting restriction of water use do not resolve this trade-off, although they do reduce impacts on aquatic biodiversity. Broader and more integrative policies are therefore required to support agricultural adaptation to the future climate while mitigating environmental impacts. In addition, different regions are found to react in a different way, suggesting that differentiated policies may be required for specific regions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

A literature review was carried out in English, Chinese, and Russian languages for defining key issues in the river management. New hydrological insights for the region: Melting of permafrost, glaciers, and snow in the upstream mountains of the River should be considered as one of the key processes in the hydrological budget. However, the high impact of evapotranspiration rate could offset the effect of the increased melting rate along the basin. Efficient operating of existing large dams and reservoirs and the planning of future installations deserves special attention in assurance of the respective water level for restoration of the ecological diversity of the basin. Implementation of water-saving techniques and restoration of tributaries of Irtysh also play a significant role in keeping the resilience of the river. Handling historical and existing contamination will also guarantee restoration of the river health. The basin management still lacks tripartite agreement, however the principles of hydrosolidarity and no-harm effect are followed by involved countries.","[Radelyuk, Ivan; Zhang, Linus; Tussupova, Kamshat] Lund Univ, Dept Water Resources Engn, Box 118, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Radelyuk, Ivan] Toraighyrov Univ, Dept Chem & Chem Technol, Pavlodar 140000, Kazakhstan; [Assanov, Daulet] D Serikbayev East Kazakhstan Tech Univ, Excellence Ctr Veritas, Ust Kamenogorsk 070010, Kazakhstan; [Maratova, Gulira] D Serikbayev East Kazakhstan Tech Univ, Sch Met & Enrichment, Ust Kamenogorsk 070010, Kazakhstan",Lund University,"Zhang, LN (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Dept Water Resources Engn, Box 118, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden.",linus.zhang@tvrl.lth.se,"Assanov, Daulet/P-6576-2017","Zhang, Linus/0000-0003-2676-3420; Assanov, Daulet/0000-0002-1652-4074","Lund University, Sweden","Lund University, Sweden","Open access funding provided by Lund University, Sweden.

Ragweed pollen can be transported over large distances by the wind. Even low pollen concentrations of less than 10 pollen m(-3) can lead to health problems in sensitive persons. Therefore, forecasting the airborne concentrations of ragweed pollen is becoming more and more important for public health. The question remains whether distant pollen sources need to be considered in reliable forecasts. We used the extended numerical weather prediction system COSMO-ART to simulate the release and transport of ragweed pollen in central Europe. A pollen episode (September 12-16, 2006) in north-eastern Germany was modeled in order to find out where the pollen originated. For this purpose, several different source regions were taken into account and their individual impact on the daily mean pollen concentration and the performance of the forecast were studied with the means of a 2 x 2 contingency table and skill scores. It was found that the majority of the pollen originated in local areas, but up to 20% of the total pollen load came from distant sources in Hungary. It is concluded that long-distance transport should not be neglected when predicting pollen concentrations.","[Zink, Katrin; Vogel, Heike; Vogel, Bernhard; Kottmeier, Christoph] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Karlsruhe, Germany; [Magyar, Donat] Natl Inst Environm Hlth, Dept Aerobiol Monitoring, Budapest, Hungary",Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology,"Vogel, H (corresponding author), Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Karlsruhe, Germany.",heike.vogel@kit.edu,"Vogel, Bernhard/A-9558-2013; Magyar, Donat/B-2971-2009; Vogel, Heike/A-3196-2013; Kottmeier, Christoph/A-9553-2013","Vogel, Bernhard/0000-0002-8894-0165; Kottmeier, Christoph/0000-0002-2196-2052",,,,,49,63,64,2,37,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0020-7128,1432-1254,,INT J BIOMETEOROL,Int.

Thus, the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology was applied under a 'cradle-to-port' approach, setting the functional unit as 1 kg of fresh fish landed. Inventory data on the main inputs and outputs were collected from a sample of 57 vessels covering for the first time the main tech-niques, purse seine and minor art fisheries.The results identified that the vessel use stage was the responsible of most of the impacts. In line with the literature, diesel consumption stood as the chief hotspot in six of the seven impact categories analysed. Purse seiners got a value of 0.25 kg of fuel per kg of fish landed, while the performance of the minor art fleet showed significantly lower consumption (0.07). Regarding impacts on climate change, this study found a quantity of 1.00 and 0.34 kg CO2 eq. per FU, for purse seine and minor arts, respectively. These figures were consistent with the expected results for pelagic fisheries. For the remaining indicators, purse seiners generally performed worse.The LCA methodology provided outcomes that allow the proposal of potential improvements and measures to foster the transition towards a more sustainable smart-fishing sector. Further research efforts should focus on the develop-ment and implementation of renewable energy and low-carbon vessel propulsion technologies.","[Ceballos-Santos, Sandra; Laso, Jara; Ulloa, Laura; Ruiz Salmon, Israel; Margallo, Maria; Aldaco, Ruben] Univ Cantabria, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Avda Castros S-N, Santander 39005, Spain",Universidad de Cantabria,"Aldaco, R (corresponding author), Univ Cantabria, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Avda Castros S-N, Santander 39005, Spain.",aldator@unican.es,,,Interreg Atlantic Area [EAPA_576/2018NEPTUNUS],Interreg Atlantic Area,This work was supported by the EAPA_576/2018NEPTUNUS project.

The impact of climate change on the hotel is assessed via hourly simulations of a calibrated model developed using the software TRNSYS. Additionally, the paper aims to identify optimal refurbishment strategies, given the constraints of the existing case-study building when transposed to the three different climatic zones in Greece. Two modes of the hotel building were studied: 'all year' and 'seasonally' operated.

While the implications of such changes for human societies are potentially profound, the empirical evidence base for understanding human-environment interactions focuses largely on the relatively recent past, during which examples of rapid and severe climate change are lacking. While there are no precise past analogues for twenty-first century climate change, the Middle Holocene Climatic Transition (MHCT), from about 6400-5000 years before present, provides us with an example of a period of large-scale global climatic reorganisation, punctuated by episodes of rapid and severe climate change, at a time when human societies were beginning to resemble those of today. A survey of archaeological and palaeo-environmental data from the northern hemisphere subtropics and other regions provides us with evidence for linked climatic, environmental and societal change during the MHCT. This evidence, the strength of which varies with location, allows us to construct convincing narratives of linked climatic, environmental and societal changes that accommodate a variety of responses and outcomes, and that are much more nuanced than narratives of the proposed climate-induced collapse of individual societies.

The model is used to examine optimal nitrogen (N) application rates in a grass-clover system in Switzerland under current and future climatic conditions. Results for present-day climatic conditions suggest that an increase in N inputs has positive effects on yields but also leads to higher yield variability, yield distributions more skewed to the left and therefore higher downside risks. As a result, accounting for farmers' risk aversion in solving the optimisation problem leads to lower optimal N inputs. Simulations with a climate change scenario that predicts higher temperatures throughout the year and lower rainfall amounts during the growing season indicate higher yields, increasing yield variability, and changes in yield quality. By allowing herbage prices to vary as a function of yield quality, we find overall lower optimal N inputs and more marked effects of risk aversion on optimal N levels under climate change than under present conditions. However, disregarding yield quality in solving the optimisation problem gives higher optimal N inputs under future conditions.","[Finger, Robert] Univ Bonn, D-53115 Bonn, Germany; [Calanca, Pierluigi] ART Res Stn, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland; [Briner, Simon] ETH, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland",University of Bonn; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Finger, R (corresponding author), Univ Bonn, Meckenheimer Allee 174, D-53115 Bonn, Germany.",r.finger@ilr.uni-bonn.de,"Finger, Robert/A-6248-2011","Finger, Robert/0000-0002-0634-5742; Calanca, Pierluigi/0000-0003-3113-2885",EU [EVK2-CT2001-00132],EU(European Commission),"The authors thank the Swiss Federal Office for Meteorology and Climatology for providing access to its data, Patrick Lazzarotto for data simulation and an anonymous reviewer for helpful comments and suggestions.

Monthly discharge simulations from global hydrological models (GHMs), run with and without human influence using CMIP5 projections under the framework of the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project, are utilized to address the scientific questions related to the quantification of the future impacts of climate change and the historical impacts of human activities on these river basins. The five state-of-the-art GHMs were considered and subsequently used to evaluate the human and climate change impacts on river discharges (seasonal mean discharge and extreme flows) during the pre-monsoon, monsoon, and post-monsoon seasons under the RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 emission scenarios. Results showed that human impacts during the baseline period on long-term seasonal discharge in the Ganges and Godavari River basins for the pre-monsoon season are around 40% and 23%, respectively, and these impacts are stronger than the future climate change impact in the pre-monsoon season for the Ganges basin, whereas, for the Godavari basin, the same pattern is observed with some exceptions. The human impact in the course of the historical period on the pre-monsoon flows of both the Ganges and the Godavari are more significant than on the monsoon and post-monsoon flows. In the near future (2010-39) time slice, the impact of climate change on the streamflow of the Ganges is highest for the post-monsoon season (13.4%) under RCP 8.5 as compared to other seasons. For Godavari, in the near-future period, this impact is highest for the pre-monsoon season (18.2%) under RCP 2.6. Climate-induced changes in both of the basins during both the monsoon and post-monsoon seasons is observed to have a higher impact on future flows than direct human impact-induced changes to flow during the current period. High flows (31.4% and 19.9%) and low flows (51.2% and 36.8%) gain greater influence due to anthropogenic actions in the time of the pre-monsoon season compared to other times of year for the Ganges and Godavari basins, respectively. High flows for the Ganges during the near future time slice are most affected in the monsoon season (15.8%) under RCP 8.5 and, in the case of the Godavari, in the pre-monsoon season (18.4%) under the RCP 2.6 scenario. Low flows of the Ganges during the near-future period are most affected during the monsoon season (22.3%) and for the Godavari, low flows are affected most for the post-monsoon season (22.1%) under RCP 2.6. Uncertainty in the streamflow estimates is more pronounced for the Godavari basin compared to the Ganges basin. The findings of this study enhance our understanding of the natural and human-influenced flow regimes in these river basins, which helps the formation of future strategies, especially for inter-state and transboundary river management.","[Somisetty, Anusha; Pachore, Akshay; Remesan, Renji] Indian Inst Technol Kharagpur, Sch Water Resources, Kharagpur 721302, India; [Kumar, Rohini] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res GmbH, Permoser Str 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Kharagpur; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ),"Remesan, R (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol Kharagpur, Sch Water Resources, Kharagpur 721302, India.;Kumar, R (corresponding author), UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res GmbH, Permoser Str 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany.",anu.somisetty11896@gmail.com; abpachore@gmail.com; renji.remesan@swr.iitkgp.ac.in; rohini.kumar@ufz.de,"Kumar, Rohini/B-2299-2013; Remesan, Renji/H-6614-2013","Kumar, Rohini/0000-0002-4396-2037; SOMISETTY, ANUSHA/0000-0002-9133-0923; Remesan, Renji/0000-0001-9948-4321",German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) [91755431],German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD)(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)),This research was funded by the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) in 2019 with a grant number #91755431.,,77,0,0,1,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,JAN,2022,2,,,,,,194,10.3390/w14020194,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w14020194,,,26,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,YM8PB,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000746829800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Therefore, the efforts to integrate these two approaches have been made by the political arrangements to seek the synergy effects and deal with trade-offs. To study the state of the art linkages and forest policies to realize both adaptation and mitigation, we systematically review the literature highlighting the topic (136 publications) and outline two different approaches from Germany and Japan as countries with substantial forest resources and high influences on international forest policies and wood trade. We identify three linkages: (1) an ecosystem (based) approach assuming that a resilient ecosystem (adaptation), has high potential as a carbon sink (mitigation), (2) a sustainable forest management (SFM) aiming for enhancing forests' resilience and carbon sink potential simultaneously, and (3) a cross-sectoral approach generating synergies among multiple sectors of agriculture, forestry, urban design, and nature conservation. We find that a significant objective is still SFM for sustaining the forest area andwood production, where SFM examples in Germany and Japan exemplify contributions to carbon sinks and ongoing disaster risk management, respectively. Overall, the current differentiated objectives of SFM do not underpin the twofold approach and their synergy effects.","[Yousefpour, Rasoul] Univ Freiburg, Fac Environm & Nat Resources, Tennenbacherstr 4, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany; [Nakamura, N.] Wageningen Univ & Res, Dept Social Sci, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Matsumura, N.] Mie Univ, Grad Sch, Fac Bioresources, Tsu, Mie, Japan",University of Freiburg; Wageningen University & Research; Mie University,"Yousefpour, R (corresponding author), Univ Freiburg, Fac Environm & Nat Resources, Tennenbacherstr 4, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany.",RASOUL.YOUSEFPOUR@ife.uni-freiburg.de,,"Nakamura, Nanako/0000-0002-0193-7001; Matsumura, Naoto/0000-0002-4205-6307",European Commission [691149],European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre),This work was supported by the European Commission [691149].,,71,3,3,5,39,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1054-9811,1540-756X,,J SUSTAIN FOREST,J.

Traditionally, climate information deduced from biological or chemical proxies have been used to test computer model simulations of past climatic conditions and hence establish some of the uncertainties associated with model-based predictions. However, extracting climate information from proxies is itself an interpretative process and discrepancies between climate information inferred from different types of proxy undermines the assumption that model-data conflicts automatically mean that the model is inherently flawed. A new approach which both acknowledges and reduces the uncertainties associated with both model and data is required. Although the oxygen isotopic ratio (delta O-18) preserved in calcareous marine fossils has been used to reconstruct past seawater temperature for several decades, significant uncertainties associated with this method persist. These include assumptions about past seawater delta O-18 for which no proxy exists and which is a key control on the temperature inferred from fossil carbonate. Here we present the results of an early Eocene simulation made using a state-of-the-art General Circulation Model (GCM; HadCM3) with CO2 set at six times pre-industrial values and which has oxygen isotopes incorporated into the full hydrological cycle and hence simulates the delta O-18 of past seawater. This allows us to explore the implications of the different seawater delta O-18 correction factors commonly used for delta O-18-basecl temperature reconstruction. It also allows us to focus model-data comparison on delta O-18 rather than interpret ocean temperature, an approach that reduces uncertainties in model-data comparison since the effects of both the temperature and the isotopic composition of ocean water on delta O-18 of carbonate are accounted for. The good agreement between model and data for both modern and well-preserved early Eocene carbonate increases confidence in climate reconstructions of this time. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Analyzing the design of Brazil's National Adaptation Plan sheds light on the main goals and tools of the country's adaptation strategy for the rural sector and its divergent policy approaches at distinct subnational levels. This study shows that the government's ambition for promoting change drove the design process by mainstreaming climate adaptation goals into well-established development agendas, but it resulted in the layering of existing sector-based instruments. The Plan became a mix of loosely coordinated and inconsistent strategies, lacking a common implementation approach. Thereby, this analysis provides insight into the politics of adaptation policies and the challenges of promoting policy integration in this field.","[Milhorance, Carolina; Sabourin, Eric] Ctr Agr Res & Dev CIRAD UMR ART Dev, Montpellier, France; [Milhorance, Carolina; Sabourin, Eric; Mendes, Priscylla] Univ Brasilia CSD UnB, Ctr Sustainable Dev, Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Sabourin, Eric] Montpellier Univ Excellence MUSE, Montpellier, France; [Chechi, Leticia] Reconcavo Bahia Fed Univ UFRB, Ctr Agr Environm & Biol Sci, Cruz Das Almas, Brazil",Universite de Montpellier; Universite de Montpellier,"Milhorance, C (corresponding author), Ctr Agr Res & Dev CIRAD UMR ART Dev, Montpellier, France.;Milhorance, C (corresponding author), Univ Brasilia CSD UnB, Ctr Sustainable Dev, Brasilia, DF, Brazil.",cmilhorance@gmail.com,,"Milhorance, Carolina/0000-0002-3290-8596; Mendes, Priscylla/0000-0001-7074-680X; SABOURIN, Eric/0000-0002-1171-2535","Association Nationale de la Recherche et de la Technologie [ANR-17-CE03-0005, ANR-16-IDEX-0006]; FAPERGS [17/2551-0000959-2]; CNPq/Capes/FAPDF [INCT] [16-2014]",Association Nationale de la Recherche et de la Technologie(French National Research Agency (ANR)); FAPERGS(Fundacao de Amparo a Ciencia e Tecnologia do Estado do Rio Grande do Sul (FAPERGS)); CNPq/Capes/FAPDF [INCT],This work was supported by the Association Nationale de la Recherche et de la Technologie [ARTIMIX N degrees ANR-17-CE03-0005]; Association Nationale de la Recherche et de la Technologie [TYPOCLIM ANR-16-IDEX-0006]; FAPERGS [project 17/2551-0000959-2]; CNPq/Capes/FAPDF [INCT n degrees 16-2014 ODISSEIA].,,51,4,4,3,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0964-4016,1743-8934,,ENVIRON POLIT,Environ.

In the tropics, the response of surface O-3 to changing climate is relatively understudied but has important consequences for air pollution and human and ecosystem health. In this study, we evaluate the change in surface O-3 due to climate change over South America and Africa using three state-of-the-art Earth system models that follow the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 3-7.0 emission scenario from CMIP6. In order to quantify changes due to climate change alone, we evaluate the difference between simulations including climate change and simulations with a fixed present-day climate. We find that by 2100, models predict an ozone-climate penalty in areas where O-3 is already predicted to be high due to the impacts of precursor emissions, namely urban and biomass burning areas, although on average, models predict a decrease in surface O-3 due to climate change. We identify a small but robust positive trend in annual mean surface O-3 over polluted areas. Additionally, during biomass burning seasons, seasonal mean O-3 concentrations increase by 15 ppb (model range 12 to 18 ppb) in areas with substantial biomass burning such as the arc of deforestation in the Amazon. The ozone-climate penalty in polluted areas is shown to be driven by an increased rate of O-3 chemical production, which is strongly influenced by NOx concentrations and is therefore specific to the emission pathway chosen. Multiple linear regression finds the change in NOx concentration to be a strong predictor of the change in O-3 production, whereas increased isoprene emission rate is positively correlated with increased O-3 destruction, suggesting NOx-limited conditions over the majority of tropical Africa and South America. However, models disagree on the role of climate change in remote, low-NOx regions, partly because of significant differences in NOx concentrations produced by each model. We also find that the magnitude and location of the ozone-climate penalty in the Congo Basin has greater inter-model variation than that in the Amazon, so further model development and validation are needed to constrain the response in central Africa. We conclude that if the climate were to change according to the emission scenario used here, models predict that forested areas in biomass burning locations and urban populations will be at increasing risk of high O-3 exposure, irrespective of any direct impacts on O-3 via the prescribed emission scenario.","[Brown, Flossie; Haywood, James] Univ Exeter, Coll Engn Math & Phys Sci, Exeter, Devon, England; [Folberth, Gerd A.; Haywood, James; O'Connor, Fiona M.] Hadley Ctr, UK Met Off, Exeter, Devon, England; [Sitch, Stephen; Cheesman, Alexander W.; Mercado, Lina M.] Univ Exeter, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Exeter, Devon, England; [Bauer, Susanne; Tsigaridis, Kostas] Columbia Univ, Ctr Climate Syst Res, New York, NY USA; [Bauer, Susanne; Tsigaridis, Kostas] NASA, Goddard Inst Space Studies, New York, NY 10025 USA; [Bauters, Marijin; Boeckx, Pascal; Dos Santos, Ines; Verbeeck, Hans] Univ Ghent, Dept Environm, Ghent, Belgium; [Cheesman, Alexander W.] James Cook Univ, Ctr Trop Environm & Sustainabil Sci, Cairns, Qld, Australia; [Deushi, Makoto; Oshima, Naga] Japan Meteorol Agcy, Meteorol Res Inst, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Galy-Lacaux, Corinne] Univ Toulouse III Paul Sabatier, CNRS, Lab Aerol, Toulouse, France; [Keeble, James] Univ Cambridge, Yusuf Hamied Dept Chem, Cambridge, England; [Keeble, James] Univ Cambridge, Natl Ctr Atmospher Sci NCAS, Cambridge, England; [Mercado, Lina M.] UK Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Wallingford, Oxon, England",University of Exeter; Met Office - UK; Hadley Centre; University of Exeter; Columbia University; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; Ghent University; James Cook University; Japan Meteorological Agency; Meteorological Research Institute - Japan; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); University of Cambridge; University of Cambridge; UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (UKCEH),"Brown, F (corresponding author), Univ Exeter, Coll Engn Math & Phys Sci, Exeter, Devon, England.",fb428@exeter.ac.uk,"Tsigaridis, Kostas/K-8292-2012; Folberth, Gerd A./F-7376-2010; Cheesman, Alexander/H-5918-2013","Tsigaridis, Kostas/0000-0001-5328-819X; Folberth, Gerd A./0000-0002-1075-440X; Viera, Ines/0000-0002-8123-4970; Cheesman, Alexander/0000-0003-3931-5766; Deushi, Makoto/0000-0002-0373-3918",UK Research and Innovation [NE/S007504/1],UK Research and Innovation(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)),This research has been supported by UK Research and Innovation (grant no.

Besides, frames have the potential to increase the UDI while keeping the overall illuminance of the space within the specific range.

Compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, this methodology includes the assessment of the uncertainty by means of Monte Carlo simulations, constituting a valuable step forward. The methodology is based on the simulation of N-y-year time series of wave climate variables that maintain the same statistical descriptors and seasonal and year-to-years variations of a hindcasted time series. This step is repeated N-e times to provide a sample size large enough to assess the uncertainty of the predictions. Because the wave energy resource is obtained from the nearshore, a large amount of wave propagations would be required. However, our methodology incorporates downscaling techniques that significantly improve the computational efficiency, and only a reduced number of N-w sea states should be propagated using an advanced numerical model. The methodology was applied to Playa Granada beach (southern Spain), obtaining the wave energy resource at 24 locations in the nearshore for 25-year time series repeated 1000 times. The selection of the most promising location for WECs on the basis of hindcasted or forecasted data provides different results. This highlights the importance of the proposed methodology for the advanced planning and design of any prospective energy extraction project. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The approach rests on results obtained in an innovative measurement campaign and by means of air pollution dispersion-models, followed by an impact assessment and economic valuation of the potential externalities. This makes a state-of-the-art methodological technique to reach greater knowledge on the economic costs of urban air quality impacts resulting as a side effect of climate change policy. The social economic costs estimated in this paper are then compared to likely social economic benefits (i.e. avoided social economic damage cost) of reduced nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and carbon dioxide-(CO2) emissions. The carcinogenic risk from long-term inhalation exposure to acetaldehyde emissions, leads in this paper to a moderate cost estimate associated with the combustion of bioethanol in vehicles in Oslo. Productivity and welfare loss is the dominant cost component, whereas the direct medical costs constitutes only a small part of the total social economic costs.

Once completed, the period covered will span from 1950 to the present, with continuous updates to support land monitoring applications. ERA5-Land describes the evolution of the water and energy cycles over land in a consistent manner over the production period, which, among others, could be used to analyse trends and anomalies. This is achieved through global high-resolution numerical integrations of the ECMWF land surface model driven by the downscaled meteorological forcing from the ERA5 climate reanalysis, including an elevation correction for the thermodynamic near-surface state. ERA5-Land shares with ERA5 most of the parameterizations that guarantees the use of the state-of-the-art land surface modelling applied to numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. A main advantage of ERA5-Land compared to ERA5 and the older ERA-Interim is the horizontal resolution, which is enhanced globally to 9 km compared to 31 km (ERA5) or 80 km (ERA-Interim), whereas the temporal resolution is hourly as in ERA5. Evaluation against independent in situ observations and global model or satellite-based reference datasets shows the added value of ERA5-Land in the description of the hydrological cycle, in particular with enhanced soil moisture and lake description, and an overall better agreement of river discharge estimations with available observations. However, ERA5-Land snow depth fields present a mixed performance when compared to those of ERA5, depending on geographical location and altitude. The description of the energy cycle shows comparable results with ERA5. Nevertheless, ERA5-Land reduces the global averaged root mean square error of the skin temperature, taking as reference MODIS data, mainly due to the contribution of coastal points where spatial resolution is important. Since January 2020, the ERA5-Land period available has extended from January 1981 to the near present, with a 2- to 3-month delay with respect to real time. The segment prior to 1981 is in production, aiming for a release of the whole dataset in summer/autumn 2021. The high spatial and temporal resolution of ERA5-Land, its extended period, and the consistency of the fields produced makes it a valuable dataset to support hydrological studies, to initialize NWP and climate models, and to support diverse applications dealing with water resource, land, and environmental management.","[Munoz-Sabater, Joaquin; Agusti-Panareda, Anna; Arduini, Gabriele; Balsamo, Gianpaolo; Boussetta, Souhail; Choulga, Margarita; Harrigan, Shaun; Hersbach, Hans; Zsoter, Ervin; Buontempo, Carlo; Thepaut, Jean-Noel] European Ctr Medium Range Weather Forecasts, Reading, Berks, England; [Dutra, Emanuel] Inst Portugues Mar & Atmosfera, Lisbon, Portugal; [Dutra, Emanuel] Univ Lisbon, Fac Sci, IDL, Inst Dom Luiz, Lisbon, Portugal; [Albergel, Clement] Univ Toulouse, CNRS, Meteo France, CNRM, Toulouse, France; [Albergel, Clement] European Space Agcy Climate Off, ECSAT, Didcot, Oxon, England; [Martens, Brecht; Miralles, Diego G.] Univ Ghent, Hydroclimate Extremes Lab H CEL, Ghent, Belgium; [Piles, Maria] Univ Valencia, Image Proc Lab IPL, Valencia, Spain; [Rodriguez-Fernandez, Nemesio J.] Univ Toulouse 3, Ctr Etud Spatiales Biosphere CESBIO, CNES, CNRS,INRAE,IRDe, Toulouse, France",European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF); Instituto Portugues do Mar e da Atmosfera; Universidade de Lisboa; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Meteo France; Universite de Toulouse; Ghent University; University of Valencia; INRAE; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD),"Munoz-Sabater, J (corresponding author), European Ctr Medium Range Weather Forecasts, Reading, Berks, England.",joaquin.munoz@ecmwf.int,"Buontempo, Carlo/GLQ-7538-2022; Balsamo, Gianpaolo/I-3362-2013; Miralles, Diego G/K-8857-2013; Dutra, Emanuel/A-3774-2010; Rodriguez-Fernandez, Nemesio/N-7710-2015; Harrigan, Shaun/C-9370-2014","Buontempo, Carlo/0000-0002-1874-5380; Balsamo, Gianpaolo/0000-0002-1745-3634; Miralles, Diego G/0000-0001-6186-5751; Dutra, Emanuel/0000-0002-0643-2643; Rodriguez-Fernandez, Nemesio/0000-0003-3796-149X; Munoz-Sabater, Joaquin/0000-0002-5997-290X; Albergel, Clement/0000-0003-1095-2702; Harrigan, Shaun/0000-0002-0992-3667; Choulga, Margarita/0000-0003-4393-931X",European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Service,European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Service,ERA5-Land was produced with funding from the European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Service.,,110,302,304,120,227,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1866-3508,1866-3516,,EARTH SYST SCI DATA,Earth Syst.

Solar variability may account for part of this warming which, during the past 350 years, generally tracks fluctuating solar activity levels. While increases in greenhouse gas concentrations art: widely assumed to be the primary cause of recent climate change, surface temperatures nevertheless varied significantly during pre-industrial periods, under minimal levels of greenhouse gas variations. A climate forcing of 0.3 W m(-2) arising from a speculated 0.13% solar irradiance increase can account for the 0.3 degrees C surface warming evident in the paleoclimate record from 1650 to 1790, assuming that climate sensitivity is 1 degrees C W-1 m(-2) (which is within the IPCC range). The empirical Sun-climate relationship defined by these pre-industrial data suggests that solar variability may have contributed 0.25 degrees C of the 0.6 degrees C subsequent warming from 1900 to 1990, a scenario which time dependent GCM simulations replicate when forced with reconstructed solar irradiance. Thus, while solar Variability likely played a dominant role in modulating climate during the Little Ice Age prior to 1850, its influence since 1900 has become an increasingly less significant component of climate change in the industrial epoch. It is unlikely that Sun-climate relationships can account for much of the warming since 1970, not withstanding recent attempts to deduce long term solar irradiance fluctuations from the observational data base, which has notable occurrences of instrumental drifts. Empirical evidence suggests that Sun-climate relationships exist on decadal as well as centennial time scales, but present sensitivities of the climate system are insufficient to explain these short-term relationships. Still to be simulated over the time scale of the Little Ice Age to the present is the combined effect of direct radiative forcing, indirect forcing via solar-induced ozone changes in the atmosphere, and speculated charged particle mechanisms whose pathways and sensitivities are not yet specified.

As this approach has been shown to increase educational success, it is vital to prepare and develop interest in middle school students to participate in STEAM subjects-related learning opportunities. This study examined the impact of hands-on global climate change monitoring projects whose curriculum was designed based on the six structured inventive thinking (SSIT) approach that can facilitate the development of the knowledge of STEAM content and investigate the perceptions of STEAM subjects by middle school students. The participants in the study were sixty-eight grade 7 students from a middle school in Seoul, Korea. Employing a quasi-experimental research design, the participants were measured on their STEAM knowledge and perceptions before and after participation. The findings indicate that students who participated in global climate change monitoring activities reported gains in their STEAM content knowledge and showed an improvement in their perceptions of STEAM subjects. The latter finding was more pronounced for female students who had significantly higher science achievement and positive perceptions of the STEAM program than for male students. The results of this study suggest that carefully designed projects comprised of SSIT-based environmental activities can be effective in STEAM education at the middle school level.","[Jeong, Sophia (Sun Kyung)] Univ Georgia, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Kim, Hyoungbum] Chungbuk Natl Univ, Cheongju Chungbuk 361763, South Korea",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; Chungbuk National University,"Kim, H (corresponding author), Chungbuk Natl Univ, Dept Earth Sci Educ, Cheongju Chungbuk 361763, South Korea.",hyoungbum21@chungbuk.ac.kr,,,Chungbuk National University,Chungbuk National University,This work was supported by the research grant of the Chungbuk National University in 2014.,,23,19,19,5,68,MODESTUM LTD,LONDON,"STE 124 CHALLENGE HOUSE 616 MITCHAM RD, CROYDON, LONDON, CRO 3AA, ENGLAND",1305-8215,1305-8223,,EURASIA J MATH SCI T,Eurasia J.

We present in this article two cases which seemed to us interesting and complementary: the consequences of dysfunctions of an air handling system and the instability of climates produced by a Mechanical Extract Ventilation system. Even if the fungal situations seem identical, causes of fungal growth can vary greatly. Thus, it is essential to go back up to the origins of the dysfunctions and climate instabilities. The microbiological study states levels of viable species on documents, in environment and in the ambient air. It localizes the areas of strong concentration that it connects directly to the microclimate data collected in the storerooms. Thus while leaning on the study of the microclimates, on the analysis of climate-related events in archives and environmental weather conditions one can hope to determine the factors of contamination.","[Roche, Alain; Gilot, Sebastien] Lab Anal & Rech Conservat & Restaurat Ceuvres Art, Paris, France",,"Roche, A (corresponding author), Lab Anal & Rech Conservat & Restaurat Ceuvres Art, Paris, France.",a.roche@larcroa.fr; Sebgil@wanadoo.fr,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,0,MINISTERE CULTURE & COMMUNICATION,PARIS,"3 RUE DE VALOIS, PARIS, 75033, FRANCE",1630-7305,,,IN SITU-REV PATRIMOI,,,2012,19,,,,,,,10.4000/insitu.9788,http://dx.doi.org/10.4000/insitu.9788,,,14,"Humanities, Multidisciplinary",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Arts & Humanities - Other Topics,V7N8W,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,12/21/22,WOS:000421130500002,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this study, we consider three scenarios for extreme high water levels based on climate change scenarios and estimates for land subsidence, rising mean sea levels, and return period analysis for extreme events (from previous studies). We also investigate the effect of ocean waves on these estimates for extreme high water levels. Because the most damaging storm to make landfall in Nova Scotia over the last century was Hurricane Juan (2003), it was chosen to simulate the extreme case of storm-generated waves and wave run-up in Halifax Harbour. To simulate waves generated by Hurricane Juan, a nested-grid system consisting of two modern state-of-the-art operational wave models was used. High quality winds were used to drive the wave models, and the simulations used recently updated high resolution coastal bathymetry. Observed water elevation changes in Halifax Harbour were used in wave model simulations of Hurricane Juan. The Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) run-up model is used to estimate wave run-up elevation, which is validated with recorded high water observations along the coastline. Simulated waves and wave run-up elevations for Hurricane Juan suggest that the maximum significant wave heights at the mouth of the Harbour were 9.0 m, and the wave run-up was as high as 2.0 m along the shoreline of Halifax Harbour. In this way, we estimated the impact of waves and wave run-up on extreme high water elevations for three climate change scenarios in Halifax Harbour, under worst-case conditions. The sensitivity of these estimates is analyzed for different water level variations, wave propagation directions and shore slope profiles.","[Xu, Fumin] Hohai Univ, Key Lab Coastal Disaster & Def, Minist Educ, Coll Harbour Coastal & Offshore Engn, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Xu, Fumin; Perrie, William] Fisheries & Oceans Canada, Bedford Inst Oceanog, Dartmouth, NS B2Y 4A2, Canada",Hohai University; Bedford Institute of Oceanography; Fisheries & Oceans Canada,"Xu, FM (corresponding author), Hohai Univ, Key Lab Coastal Disaster & Def, Minist Educ, Coll Harbour Coastal & Offshore Engn, Nanjing, Peoples R China.",xfm67@hotmail.com,,,Halifax Regional Municipality; Nova Scotia Department of Environment; Natural Resources Canada (NRCan),Halifax Regional Municipality; Nova Scotia Department of Environment; Natural Resources Canada (NRCan)(Natural Resources CanadaCanadian Forest Service),"We would like to acknowledge the enormous inspiration and support of the Halifax Regional Municipality, the Nova Scotia Department of Environment, and Natural Resources Canada (NRCan).

In this context, one of the most important carbon reservoirs, both in terms of living biomass and soil organic matter, is represented by beech forests, which are highly vulnerable to global warming. Accordingly, we investigated how the effects of climate change predicted for 2070 could affect both beech distribution and soil carbon stocks in Italy. In order to achieve this goal, we predicted beech distribution using state of the art ecological niche modeling, projecting its potential range under climate change scenarios. Moreover, a field survey was carried out to quantify the proportion of organic carbon in the first 5 cm of soil, which are the most sensitive to climate effects. The latter results were used to explore the relationship between organic carbon and ecogeographical variables, projecting this relationship onto the predicted beech distribution. Our outcomes showed a substantial reduction in beech distribution, especially at its southern range limits, along with a remarkable shift towards higher elevations and latitudes. The organic carbon in beech forests was significantly related to temperature seasonality and elevation, showing a decrease between 64.5 and 98.8% under different IPCC scenarios.","[Innangi, Michele; d'Alessandro, Francesco; Fioretto, Antonietta] Univ Naples 2, Dept Environm Biol & Pharmaceut Sci & Technol, I-81100 Caserta, Italy; [Di Febbraro, Mirko] Univ Molise, Dept Biosci & Terr, I-86090 Pesche, Isernia, Italy",Universita della Campania Vanvitelli; University of Molise,"Di Febbraro, M (corresponding author), Univ Molise, Dept Biosci & Terr, I-86090 Pesche, Isernia, Italy.",mirkodifebbraro@gmail.com,"Di Febbraro, Mirko/GQA-4462-2022; Di Febbraro, Mirko/I-3167-2019; Innangi, Michele/M-2205-2015","Innangi, Michele/0000-0003-2362-6025; Di Febbraro, Mirko/0000-0001-8898-7046",,,,,95,19,20,5,20,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0936-577X,1616-1572,,CLIM RES,Clim.

In particular, we performed an evaluation of the possible surface recession, biomass accumulation, and deterioration due to salt crystallisation cycles on these sites in the future (by midcentury, 2039-2068) compared to the recent past (1979-2008), considering a future scenario of high greenhouse gas emissions.","[Ciantelli, Chiara; Bonazza, Alessandra] Italian Natl Res Council, Inst Atmospher Sci & Climate, Via Gobetti 101, I-40129 Bologna, Italy; [Palazzi, Elisa; von Hardenberg, Jost] Italian Natl Res Council, Inst Atmospher Sci & Climate, Corso Fiume 4, I-10133 Turin, Italy; [Vaccaro, Carmela] Univ Ferrara, Dept Phys & Earth Sci, Via Giuseppe Saragat 1, I-44124 Ferrara, Italy; [Tittarelli, Francesca] Univ Politecn Marche, Dept Mat Environm Sci & Urban Planning SIMAU, Via Brecce Bianche 12, I-60131 Ancona, Italy",Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Scienze dell'Atmosfera e del Clima (ISAC-CNR); Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Scienze dell'Atmosfera e del Clima (ISAC-CNR); University of Ferrara; Marche Polytechnic University,"Bonazza, A (corresponding author), Italian Natl Res Council, Inst Atmospher Sci & Climate, Via Gobetti 101, I-40129 Bologna, Italy.",c.ciantelli@isac.cnr.it; e.palazzi@isac.cnr.it; j.vonhardenberg@isac.cnr.it; vcr@unife.it; f.tittarelli@univpm.it; a.bonazza@isac.cnr.it,"palazzi, elisa/C-7048-2015; vaccaro, carmela/C-1324-2013; Ciantelli, Chiara/HGB-6828-2022; Bonazza, Alessandra/AAQ-1947-2020; Vaccaro, Carmela/I-3380-2019","palazzi, elisa/0000-0003-1683-5267; vaccaro, carmela/0000-0002-4954-8697; Vaccaro, Carmela/0000-0002-4954-8697; CIANTELLI, CHIARA/0000-0002-2521-7105; Bonazza, Alessandra/0000-0002-9842-9731; Tittarelli, Francesca/0000-0001-5805-6822",,,,,51,11,12,1,8,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3263,,GEOSCIENCES,Geosciences,AUG,2018,8,,,,,,296,10.3390/geosciences8080296,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/geosciences8080296,,,18,"Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Geology,GS1DB,,"Green Published, Green Submitted, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000443254500026,View Full Record in Web of Science

These interventions are often framed by narratives of climate collapse, implying that there is not enough time to engage citizens in participatory planning processes. Some scholars have argued that this may also enable the realization of urban interventions that would otherwise be difficult to implement under ordinary circumstances. At the same time, research has demonstrated that mitigation and adaptation policies and projects may result in the displacement of vulnerable populations. To avoid this scenario, city governments must ensure vulnerability assessments, transparency, and accountability to all affected communities throughout the design process, and examination of projects proposed by residents and developed by the city authorities. Based on interviews, fieldwork observation, and secondary analysis of open-source documents, this article examines the complexity of appropriate urban climate planning through a comparative analysis. Taking the East Side Coast Resilience (ESCR) project in New York as an exemplary case study, we analyze multiple perspectives, expertise, and rights involved in climate urbanism in global cities under the neoliberal present. We conclude that democratic city planning for climate change cannot be separated from questions of climate justice, which concerns democratic decision making and the impact of interventions on local communities and ecosystems.","[Chiesi, Leonardo] Univ Firenze, Dipartimento Sci Polit & Sociali, I-50127 Florence, Italy; [Chiesi, Leonardo] Univ Firenze, Scuola Architettura, I-50122 Florence, Italy; [Chiesi, Leonardo] Fdn Futuro Citta, I-50133 Florence, Italy; [Forte, Giuseppina] Williams Coll, Dept Art & Environm Studies, Williamstown, MA 01267 USA; [Forte, Giuseppina] Univ Calif Berkeley, Global Metropolitan Studies, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of Florence; University of Florence; Williams College; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Chiesi, L (corresponding author), Univ Firenze, Dipartimento Sci Polit & Sociali, I-50127 Florence, Italy.;Chiesi, L (corresponding author), Univ Firenze, Scuola Architettura, I-50122 Florence, Italy.;Chiesi, L (corresponding author), Fdn Futuro Citta, I-50133 Florence, Italy.;Forte, G (corresponding author), Williams Coll, Dept Art & Environm Studies, Williamstown, MA 01267 USA.;Forte, G (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Global Metropolitan Studies, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",chiesi@unifi.it; gf5@williams.edu,,,"Dipartimento di Scienze Politiche e Sociali, Universita degli Studi di Firenze, Protocollo [0330220]","Dipartimento di Scienze Politiche e Sociali, Universita degli Studi di Firenze, Protocollo","This research was funded by the Dipartimento di Scienze Politiche e Sociali, Universita degli Studi di Firenze, Protocollo n. 0330220.",,91,0,0,2,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-0760,,SOC SCI-BASEL,Soc.

The regional coupled model has been implemented and tested over some of the COordinated Regional climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) domains and more regional settings featuring climatically important coupled phenomena. Regional coupled ocean-atmosphere models can be especially useful tools to provide information on the mechanisms of air-sea interactions and feedbacks occurring at fine spatial and temporal scales. RegCM-ES shows a good representation of precipitation and SST fields over the domains tested, as well as realistic simulations of coupled air-sea processes and interactions. The RegCM-ES model, which can be easily implemented over any regional domain of interest, is open source, making it suitable for usage by the broad scientific community. Plain Language Summary The increasing availability of observational data sets of high temporal and spatial resolution is providing a more complete view of the ocean and atmosphere, revealing strong air-sea coupling processes. In order to obtain an accurate representation and better understanding of the climate system, its variability, and possible future change, the inclusion of all mechanisms of interaction among the different climate components becomes ever more desirable. Regional coupled ocean-atmosphere models can be especially useful tools to provide information on the mechanisms of air-sea interactions and feedback occurring at regional fine spatial and temporal scales.

The surface environment of the TP has undergone significant changes against the background of global warming. It is projected that the continuation of climate change in the future will result in most of the glaciers and frozen soil disappearing by the end of this century, and freshwater resources will be greatly reduced, on which 22% of the world's population depends. These environmental changes are of great concern to global society given the influences of the TP on the climate at the global scale. However, great uncertainties exist in global climate simulations over the TP, which affects our ability to properly understand the associated water security crisis. Based on atmospheric dynamics and physical processes, dynamical downscaling can characterize surface conditions more accurately than global simulations, and better simulate and predict regional or local weather and climate situations. With advances in supercomputing, the grid spacing of dynamical downscaling simulations has been continuously increasing, marching the technique into the kilometer-scale era. In this paper, the origin and development of dynamical downscaling in the TP region from the quarter-degree to kilometer scale is firstly introduced, including an assessment of the advantages and disadvantages of dynamical downscaling at the kilometer scale over the TP. Then, the main land surface factors affecting the performance of dynamical downscaling over the TP are described, as well as a brief introduction to a land surface model with specific plateau characteristics. Specifically, it has emerged that perfecting the land surface model and improving the performance of land-atmosphere interaction are the most effective ways to advance the performance of dynamic downscaling in this region. Finally, the challenges and some recommended future research directions are discussed and proposed.","[Gao, Yanhong; Zhang, Meng; Liu, Zhaoyang; Dan, Jingyu] Fudan Univ, Inst Atmospher Sci, Shanghai 200438, Peoples R China; [Gao, Yanhong; Zhang, Meng; Liu, Zhaoyang; Dan, Jingyu] Fudan Univ, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Shanghai 200438, Peoples R China; [Gao, Yanhong] Shanghai Frontiers Sci Ctr Atmosphere Ocean Inter, Shanghai 200438, Peoples R China; [Gao, Yanhong] Natiobal Observat & Res Stn Wetland Ecosyst, Shanghai 200438, Peoples R China; [Xu, Jianwei] Hunan Univ Art & Sci, Coll Resource & Environm, Changde 415000, Peoples R China",Fudan University; Fudan University; Hunan University of Arts & Science,"Gao, YH (corresponding author), Fudan Univ, Inst Atmospher Sci, Shanghai 200438, Peoples R China.;Gao, YH (corresponding author), Fudan Univ, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Shanghai 200438, Peoples R China.;Gao, YH (corresponding author), Shanghai Frontiers Sci Ctr Atmosphere Ocean Inter, Shanghai 200438, Peoples R China.;Gao, YH (corresponding author), Natiobal Observat & Res Stn Wetland Ecosyst, Shanghai 200438, Peoples R China.",gaoyh@fudan.edu.cn,,,Fudan University-Tibet University Joint Laboratory for Biodiversity and Global Change; CORDEX-FPS-CPTP; Second Scientific Expedition [2019QZKK010314]; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA2006010202]; Key Laboratory Program of the Western Light-Western Cross-Cutting Team of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [bzg-zdsys-202102],Fudan University-Tibet University Joint Laboratory for Biodiversity and Global Change; CORDEX-FPS-CPTP; Second Scientific Expedition; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); Key Laboratory Program of the Western Light-Western Cross-Cutting Team of the Chinese Academy of Sciences,"We thank the Fudan University-Tibet University Joint Laboratory for Biodiversity and Global Change and the international cooperation project CORDEX-FPS-CPTP for their support.

If the construction of these threats appears similar then so are the pleas for preemptive and precautionary action. In this paper we explore the ways in which terrorism and climate change are imagined, drawing on a conjoined history in which preemption and precaution are not easily separable. We then trace this through the knowledges, models, and ideas of risk that inform contemporary debates on these issues and suggest that these are caught between a desire for rationality and affective governance through catastrophic visions. Furthermore, we argue that these imaginations of an actionable future have political consequences that depoliticize and delegitimate debate and that potentially bring the unimaginable into being. Reconceiving precautionary politics is thus vital if we are to engage ethically with the world.","[de Goede, Maricke] Univ Amsterdam, Dept European Studies, NL-1012 VB Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Randalls, Samuel] UCL, Dept Geog, London WC1E 6BT, England",University of Amsterdam; University of London; University College London,"de Goede, M (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, Dept European Studies, Spuistr 134, NL-1012 VB Amsterdam, Netherlands.",m.degoede@uva.nl; s.randalls@ucl.ac.uk,,"de Goede, Marieke/0000-0001-5726-1795",,,,,115,110,110,0,24,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0263-7758,1472-3433,,ENVIRON PLANN D,Environ.

Therefore, a better understanding of how anthropogenic climate change may affect TCs and how these changes translate in socio-economic impacts is required. Here, we apply a TC detection and tracking method that was developed for ERA-40 data to time-slice experiments of two atmospheric general circulation models, namely the fifth version of the European Centre model of Hamburg model (MPI, Hamburg, Germany, T213) and the Japan Meteorological Agency/Meteorological research Institute model (MRI, Tsukuba city, Japan, T(L)959). For each model, two climate simulations are available: a control simulation for present-day conditions to evaluate the model against observations, and a scenario simulation to assess future changes. The evaluation of the control simulations shows that the number of intense storms is underestimated due to the model resolution. To overcome this deficiency, simulated cyclone intensities are scaled to the best track data leading to a better representation of the TC intensities. Both models project an increased number of major hurricanes and modified trajectories in their scenario simulations. These changes have an effect on the projected loss potentials. However, these state-of-the-art models still yield contradicting results, and therefore they are not yet suitable to provide robust estimates of losses due to uncertainties in simulated hurricane intensity, location and frequency.","[Raible, Christoph C.; Kleppek, Sabine; Stocker, Thomas F.] Univ Bern, Inst Phys, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Raible, Christoph C.; Kleppek, Sabine; Stocker, Thomas F.] Univ Bern, Oeschger Ctr Climate Change Res, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Wueest, Marc; Bresch, David N.] Swiss Reinsurance Co Ltd, CH-8022 Zurich, Switzerland; [Kitoh, Akio; Murakami, Hiroyuki] Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, Meteorol Res Inst, Climate Res Dept, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050052, Japan",University of Bern; University of Bern; Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science & Technology (JAMSTEC); Meteorological Research Institute - Japan,"Raible, CC (corresponding author), Univ Bern, Inst Phys, Sidlerstr 5, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland.",raible@climate.unibe.ch,"Kitoh, Akio/F-1765-2010; Murakami, Hiroyuki/L-5745-2015; Stocker, Thomas/B-1273-2013; Bresch, David N./D-5298-2018; Raible, Christoph/M-8309-2016","Murakami, Hiroyuki/0000-0002-1816-3452; Bresch, David N./0000-0002-8431-4263; Raible, Christoph/0000-0003-0176-0602","KAKUSHIN of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports and Technology; National Centre for Competence in Research (NCCR) in Climate; Swiss National Science Foundation","KAKUSHIN of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports and Technology; National Centre for Competence in Research (NCCR) in Climate(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission)","The authors would like to thank the MPI Hamburg, in particular Monika Esch, Lennart Bengtsson and Uwe Schulzweida for making the ECHAM5 time-slice experiments available for this study.

Given their economic and ecological relevance, detailed forecasting tools for various pests and diseases have been developed, which model their phenology, depending on actual weather conditions, and suggest management decisions on that basis. Assessing the future risk of pest-related damages requires future weather data at high temporal and spatial resolution. Here, we use a combined stochastic weather generator and re-sampling procedure for producing site-specific hourly weather series representing present and future (1980-2009 and 2045-2074 time periods) climate conditions in Switzerland. The climate change scenarios originate from the ENSEMBLES multi-model projections and provide probabilistic information on future regional changes in temperature and precipitation. Hourly weather series are produced by first generating daily weather data for these climate scenarios and then using a nearest neighbor re-sampling approach for creating realistic diurnal cycles. These hourly weather series are then used for modeling the impact of climate change on important life phases of the codling moth and on the number of predicted infection days of fire blight. Codling moth (Cydia pomonella) and fire blight (Erwinia amylovora) are two major pest and disease threats to apple, one of the most important commercial and rural crops across Europe. Results for the codling moth indicate a shift in the occurrence and duration of life phases relevant for pest control. In southern Switzerland, a 3rd generation per season occurs only very rarely under today's climate conditions but is projected to become normal in the 2045-2074 time period. While the potential risk for a 3rd generation is also significantly increasing in northern Switzerland (for most stations from roughly 1% on average today to over 60% in the future for the median climate change signal of the multi-model projections), the actual risk will critically depend on the pace of the adaptation of the codling moth with respect to the critical photoperiod. To control this additional generation, an intensification and prolongation of control measures (e.g. insecticides) will be required, implying an increasing risk of pesticide resistances. For fire blight, the projected changes in infection days are less certain due to uncertainties in the leaf wetness approximation and the simulation of the blooming period. Two compensating effects are projected, warmer temperatures favoring infections are balanced by a temperature-induced advancement of the blooming period, leading to no significant change in the number of infection days under future climate conditions for most stations.","[Hirschi, M.; Spirig, C.; Rotach, M.

First, we present a model which has 78% accuracy in predicting drivers' reactions to different advice in different situations. Using the prediction model, we designed a Markov Decision Process which solution provided the advising policy for MACS. Through empirical evaluation using an electric car, with 83 human subjects, we show that MACS successfully reduced the energy consumption of the subjects by 33% compared to subjects who were not equipped with MACS.

Some models employ large-scale spectral nudging techniques. Cyclone characteristics simulated by the ensemble are compared with the results forced by four reanalyses (ERA-Interim, National Centers for Environmental Prediction-Climate Forecast System Reanalysis, National Aeronautics and Space Administration-Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications Version 2, and Japan Meteorological Agency-Japanese 55-year reanalysis) in winter and summer for 1981-2010 period. In addition, we compare cyclone statistics between ERA-Interim and the Arctic System Reanalysis reanalyses for 2000-2010. Biases in cyclone frequency, intensity, and size over the Arctic are also quantified. Variations in cyclone frequency across the models are partly attributed to the differences in cyclone frequency over land. The variations across the models are largest for small and shallow cyclones for both seasons. A connection between biases in the zonal wind at 200hPa and cyclone characteristics is found for both seasons. Most models underestimate zonal wind speed in both seasons, which likely leads to underestimation of cyclone mean depth and deep cyclone frequency in the Arctic. In general, the regional climate models are able to represent the spatial distribution of cyclone characteristics in the Arctic but models that employ large-scale spectral nudging show a better agreement with ERA-Interim reanalysis than the rest of the models. Trends also exhibit the benefits of nudging. Models with spectral nudging are able to reproduce the cyclone trends, whereas most of the nonnudged models fail to do so. However, the cyclone characteristics and trends are sensitive to the choice of nudged variables.","[Akperov, Mirseid; Mokhov, Igor I.; Semenov, Vladimir A.; Dembitskaya, Mariya A.] RAS, AM Obukhov Inst Atmospher Phys, Moscow, Russia; [Rinke, Annette; Matthes, Heidrun; Dethloff, Klaus] Helmholtz Ctr Polar & Marine Res, Alfred Wegener Inst, Potsdam, Germany; [Mokhov, Igor I.] Lomonosov Moscow State Univ, Dept Phys, Moscow, Russia; [Semenov, Vladimir A.] RAS, Inst Geog, Moscow, Russia; [Adakudlu, Muralidhar; Christensen, Jens H.; Sobolowski, Stefan] Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, Uni Res Climate, Bergen, Norway; [Cassano, John] Univ Colorado, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Cassano, John] Univ Colorado, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Christensen, Jens H.] Univ Copenhagen, Niels Bohr Inst, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Fettweis, Xavier] Univ Liege, Dept Geog, Liege, Belgium; [Glisan, Justin] Iowa State Univ, Dept Geol & Atmospher Sci, Ames, IA USA; [Gutjahr, Oliver] Max Planck Inst Meteorol, Hamburg, Germany; [Heinemann, Guenther] Univ Trier, Fac Reg & Environm Sci, Environm Meteorol, Trier, Germany; [Koenigk, Torben] Swedish Meteorol & Hydrol Inst, Rossby Ctr, Norrkoping, Sweden; [Koenigk, Torben] Stockholm Univ, Dept Meteorol, Bert Bolin Ctr Climate Res, Stockholm, Sweden; [Koldunov, Nikolay V.; Sein, Dmitry] Helmholtz Ctr Polar & Marine Res, Alfred Wegener Inst, Bremerhaven, Germany; [Koldunov, Nikolay V.] Ctr Marine Environm Sci, MARUM, Bremen, Germany; [Laprise, Rene; Nikiema, Oumarou; Winger, Katja] Univ Quebec, Ctr ESCER, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Mottram, Ruth] Danish Meteorol Inst, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Scinocca, John F.] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Canadian Ctr Climate Modelling & Anal, Victoria, BC, Canada; [Sein, Dmitry] RAS, Shirshov Inst Oceanol, Moscow, Russia; [Zhang, Wenxin] Lund Univ, Dept Phys Geog & Ecosyst Sci, Lund, Sweden; [Zhang, Wenxin] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Geosci & Nat Resource Management, Ctr Permafrost, Copenhagen, Denmark","Russian Academy of Sciences; Obukhov Institute of Atmospheric Physics of Russian Academy of Sciences; Helmholtz Association; Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar & Marine Research; Lomonosov Moscow State University; Institute of Geography, Russian Academy of Sciences; Russian Academy of Sciences; Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; University of Copenhagen; Niels Bohr Institute; University of Liege; Iowa State University; Max Planck Society; Universitat Trier; Swedish Meteorological & Hydrological Institute; Stockholm University; Helmholtz Association; Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar & Marine Research; University of Bremen; University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal; Danish Meteorological Institute DMI; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling & Analysis (CCCma); Russian Academy of Sciences; Shirshov Institute of Oceanology; Lund University; University of Copenhagen","Akperov, M (corresponding author), RAS, AM Obukhov Inst Atmospher Phys, Moscow, Russia.",aseid@ifaran.ru,"Matthes, Heidrun/N-1833-2018; Akperov, Mirseid G/J-2867-2016; Sein, Dmitry V/GLS-0252-2022; Christensen, Jens Hesselbjerg/C-4162-2013; Sein, Dmitry V./P-6419-2018; Mokhov, Igor/U-9564-2019; Koldunov, Nikolay V.

The state-of-the-art general circulation models, participating in the Fourth Assessment Report for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), included in the present study are the U. S. Community Climate System Model version 3 (CCSM3), the Parallel Climate Model (PCM), the Goddard Institute for Space Studies model version EH (GISS-EH), and the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Coupled Model version 2.1 (GFDL-CM2.1); the Met Office's Third Hadley Centre Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere GCM (UKMO-HadCM3); and the Japanese Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate version 3.2 [MIROC3.2(hires)]. Datasets with proven high quality such as NCEP's North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR), and the Climate Prediction Center (CPC) U. S.-Mexico precipitation analysis are used as targets for simulations. Climatological precipitation is not easily simulated. While models capture winter precipitation very well over the U. S. northwest, they encounter failure over the U. S. southeast in the same season. Summer precipitation over the central United States and Mexico is also a great challenge for models, particularly the timing. In general the UKMO-HadCM3 is closest to the observations. The models' potential in simulating interannual hydroclimate variability over North America during the warm season is varied and limited to the central United States. Models like PCM, and in particular UKMO-HadCM3, exhibit reasonably well the observed distribution and relative importance of remote and local contributions to precipitation variability over the region (i.e., convergence of remote moisture fluxes dominate over local evapotranspiration). However, in models like CCSM3 and GFDL-CM2.1 local contributions dominate over remote ones, in contrast with warm-season observations. In the other extreme are models like GISS-EH and MIROC3.2(hires) that prioritize the remote influence of moisture fluxes and neglect the local influence of land surface processes to the regional precipitation variability.","Univ Maryland, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; Univ Maryland, Earth Syst Sci Interdisciplinary Ctr, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Ruiz-Barradas, A (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, 3405 Comp & Space Sci Bldg, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",alfredo@atmos.umd.edu,"Ruiz-Barradas, Alfredo/F-4499-2010; Nigam, Sumant/A-8338-2009","Ruiz-Barradas, Alfredo/0000-0003-3633-3950; ",,,,,15,23,24,2,12,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0894-8755,,,J CLIMATE,J.

Moreover, studied climate changes projects an unacceptable outlook of future unless we modify our today technology consumption in the first step, and direct our technics toward procedures that has each ecosystem energy pathways at the root, literally toward sustainability. In this study we seek if presumably there exist threads of sustainable methods we used in past (e.g. organic production methods that has closer forms to natural ecosystems). As the ultimate goal we aim to develop them to scales or intensities that responds to today world's rates leading to take a step ahead in modern responsive urban design solutions. Traditional context of Bushehr a city located in the south of Iran is a case study with significant advantages, one due to using traditional solutions to wide range of severe climate conditions and the other, it has an extremely unexploited traditional pattern as the date study performed. This study derives the common patterns of Bushehr's urban design from the large-scale to the small-scale, and proceeds to analysis and evaluation of these patterns. Reviewing the traditional patterns gives us a benevolent handbook of experimented solutions used in the past. Also there is a gradually emerging need for primitive or iconic design objects to represent originality of the context.

However, climate change is a complex phenomenon that cannot be adequately addressed from a single discipline's perspective. Hence, we propose a comprehensive conceptual framework on the relationships between climate change and human responses. This framework includes biological, psychological, and behavioural aspects and provides a multidisciplinary overview and critical information for focused interventions. The role of tipping points and regime shifts is explored, and a historical perspective is presented to describe the relationship between climate evolution and socio-cultural crisis. Vulnerability, resilience, and adaptation are analysed from an individual and a community point of view. Finally, emergent behaviours and mass effect phenomena are examined that account for mental maladjustment and conflicts.","[Cianconi, Paolo; Janiri, Luigi] Catholic Univ, Sect Psychiat, Dept Neurosci, I-00168 Rome, Italy; [Hanife, Batul] Inst Autonomous Prov Trento, Prov Agcy Hlth Serv, I-380123 Trento, Italy; [Grillo, Francesco] Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Hist Anthropol Relig Art Hist Media & Perfor, I-00185 Rome, Italy; [Zhang, Kai] SUNY Albany, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Environm Hlth Sci, Rensselaer, NY 12144 USA",Catholic University of the Sacred Heart; IRCCS Policlinico Gemelli; Sapienza University Rome; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Albany,"Cianconi, P (corresponding author), Catholic Univ, Sect Psychiat, Dept Neurosci, I-00168 Rome, Italy.",pcianco@gmail.com; batul.hanife@gmail.com; franpaog@yahoo.it; kzhang9@albany.edu; luigi.janiri@unicatt.it,,"Cianconi, Paolo/0000-0001-6067-0354",,,,,182,2,2,6,9,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2075-1729,,LIFE-BASEL,Life-Basel,SEP,2021,9,,,,,,895,10.3390/life11090895,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/life11090895,,,20,Biology; Microbiology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics; Microbiology,UV9IR,34575043,"Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000699783600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Consequently, a reduction in cirrus cloud amount or optical thickness would cool the climate. Recent research indicates that by seeding cirrus clouds with particles that promote ice nucleation, their lifetimes and coverage could be reduced. We have tested this hypothesis in a global climate model with a state-of-the-art representation of cirrus clouds and find that cirrus cloud seeding has the potential to cancel the entire warming caused by human activity from pre-industrial times to present day. However, the desired effect is only obtained for seeding particle concentrations that lie within an optimal range. With lower than optimal particle concentrations, a seeding exercise would have no effect. Moreover, a higher than optimal concentration results in an over-seeding that could have the deleterious effect of prolonging cirrus lifetime and contributing to global warming.

However, very airtight houses may have a negative impact on thermal comfort and indoor air quality. Focussing on ventilation systems then becomes a requirement. In cold climates, temperature differences between indoor and outdoor air often exceed 40 C during winter. State-of-the-art heat recovery systems may not be able to handle these differences while providing proper air quality and preventing excessively dry indoor air. The present study of energy recovery systems focuses on apartment buildings located in cold climates countries using central air handling units. Heat exchangers recovering sensible heat are compared with energy exchangers with recovery of both sensible and latent heat. For the latter, both adjacent and nonadjacent solutions are considered. A specific net energy savings factor is developed taking into account the energy recovered, but also the pressure drops and the variation on the effectiveness of the fan given the installation of the heat/energy recovery. Heat exchangers are efficient and reliable.Recuperative heat exchangers normally imply no air quality problems, but have severe freezing problems. Regenerative heat exchangers encounter small freezing problems, but do not prevent transfer of odours from extract air to supply air. Regenerative energy exchangers provide an efficient heat and moisture exchange between exhaust and supply air flows, diminishing ice formation and the humidification requirement for indoor air.

When comparing simulations with each other and with observations, it is standard practice to compare temperature anomalies with respect to a reference period. It is not always appreciated that the choice of reference period can affect conclusions, both about the skill of simulations of past climate and about the magnitude of expected future changes in climate. For example, observed global temperatures over the past decade are toward the lower end of the range of the phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) simulations irrespective of what reference period is used, but exactly where they lie in the model distribution varies with the choice of reference period. Additionally, we demonstrate that projections of when particular temperature levels are reached, for example, 2 K above preindustrial, change by up to a decade depending on the choice of reference period. In this article, we discuss some of the key issues that arise when using anomalies relative to a reference period to generate climate projections. We highlight that there is no perfect choice of reference period. When evaluating models against observations, a long reference period should generally be used, but how long depends on the quality of the observations available. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) choice to use a 1986-2005 reference period for future global temperature projections was reasonable, but a case-by-case approach is needed for different purposes and when assessing projections of different climate variables. Finally, we recommend that any studies that involve the use of a reference period should explicitly examine the robustness of the conclusions to alternative choices.","[Hawkins, Ed; Sutton, Rowan] Univ Reading, Dept Meteorol, NCAS Climate, Reading, Berks, England",UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); NERC National Centre for Atmospheric Science; University of Reading,"Hawkins, E (corresponding author), Univ Reading, Dept Meteorol, Reading RG6 6BB, Berks, England.",e.hawkins@reading.ac.uk,"Hawkins, Ed/B-7921-2011","Hawkins, Ed/0000-0001-9477-3677; Sutton, Rowan/0000-0001-8345-8583","NERC [NE/I020792/1, NE/N006054/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/N006054/1, NE/I020792/1, ncas10009] Funding Source: researchfish",NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),,,49,49,49,0,28,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0003-0007,1520-0477,,B AM METEOROL SOC,Bull.

Over the years, the performance in modeling 2-m temperature and 10-m wind speed has improved but errors are still significant. This is in particular the case under clear skies and low wind speed conditions at night as well as during winter in stably stratified conditions over land and ice. In this paper, the authors review these issues and provide an overview of the current understanding and model performance. Results from weather forecast and climate models are used to illustrate the state of the art as well as findings and recommendations from three intercomparison studies held within the Global Energy and Water Exchanges (GEWEX) Atmospheric Boundary Layer Study (GABLS). Within GABLS, the focus has been on the examination of the representation of the stable boundary layer and the diurnal cycle over land in clear-sky conditions. For this purpose, single-column versions of weather and climate models have been compared with observations, research models, and large-eddy simulations. The intercomparison cases are based on observations taken in the Arctic, Kansas, and Cabauw in the Netherlands. From these studies, we find that even for the noncloudy boundary layer important parameterization challenges remain.","[Holtslag, A. A. M.; Steeneveld, G.

The recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Working Group III report emphasized that climate policies can deliver energy security as a co-benefit, in large part through reducing energy imports. Using five state-of-the-art global energy-economy models and eight long-term scenarios, we show that although deep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions would reduce energy imports, the reverse is not true: ambitious policies constraining energy imports would have an insignificant impact on climate change. Restricting imports of all fuels would lower twenty-first-century emissions by only 2-15% against the Baseline scenario as compared with a 70% reduction in a 450 stabilization scenario. Restricting only oil imports would have virtually no impact on emissions. The modelled energy independence targets could be achieved at policy costs comparable to those of existing climate pledges but a fraction of the cost of limiting global warming to 2 degrees C.","[Jewell, Jessica; McCollum, David; Fricko, Oliver; Krey, Volker] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Energy Program, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria; [Vinichenko, Vadim; Cherp, Aleh] Cent European Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, H-1051 Budapest, Hungary; [Bauer, Nico; Aboumahboub, Tino] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Res Domain Sustainable Solut, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany; [Riahi, Keywan] Graz Univ Technol, A-8010 Graz, Austria; [Harmsen, Mathijs; van Vuuren, Detlef P.] Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, NL-3584 CS Utrecht, Netherlands; [Harmsen, Mathijs; van Vuuren, Detlef P.] PBL Netherlands Environm Assessment Agcy, Dept Climate Air & Energy, NL-3720 AH Bilthoven, Netherlands; [Kober, Tom; van der Zwaan, Bob] Energy Res Ctr Netherlands, Policy Studies, NL-1043 NT Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Kober, Tom] Paul Scherrer Inst, Energy Econ Grp, CH-5232 Villigen, Switzerland; [Marangoni, Giacomo; Tavoni, Massimo] Fdn Eni Enrico Mattei, Climate Change & Sustainable Dev Programme, I-20123 Milan, Italy; [Marangoni, Giacomo; Tavoni, Massimo] Ctr Euromediterraneo Cambiamenti Climatici, I-73100 Lecce, Italy; [Marangoni, Giacomo; Tavoni, Massimo] Politecn Milan, Dept Management Econ & Ind Engn, I-20156 Milan, Italy; [van der Zwaan, Bob] Univ Amsterdam, Fac Sci, NL-1098 Amsterdam, Netherlands; [van der Zwaan, Bob] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Adv Int Studies, I-40126 Bologna, Italy; [Cherp, Aleh] Lund Univ, Int Inst Ind Environm Econ, S-22100 Lund, Sweden",International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); Central European University; Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; Graz University of Technology; Utrecht University; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Paul Scherrer Institute; Fondazione Mattei; Centro Euro-Mediterraneo sui Cambiamenti Climatici (CMCC); Polytechnic University of Milan; University of Amsterdam; Johns Hopkins University; Lund University,"Jewell, J (corresponding author), Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Energy Program, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria.",jewell@iiasa.ac.at,"Fricko, Oliver/ABE-5732-2020; Marangoni, Giacomo/AAV-1668-2021; van Vuuren, Detlef P./A-4764-2009; Cherp, Aleh/I-7917-2012; Krey, Volker/ABD-5070-2021; Riahi, Keywan/B-6426-2011","Fricko, Oliver/0000-0002-6835-9883; van Vuuren, Detlef P./0000-0003-0398-2831; Cherp, Aleh/0000-0002-9299-9792; Riahi, Keywan/0000-0001-7193-3498; McCollum, David/0000-0003-1293-0179; Marangoni, Giacomo/0000-0003-3994-380X; Jewell, Jessica/0000-0003-2846-9081; tavoni, massimo/0000-0001-5069-4707; Krey, Volker/0000-0003-0307-3515",,,,,73,38,38,1,19,NATURE PORTFOLIO,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",2058-7546,,,NAT ENERGY,Nat.

Accurate simulation of their optical properties and operational controls for building daylight performance evaluation requires advanced modelling techniques, such as climate-based daylight modelling (CBDM). At the same time, computational efficiency is key to quickly simulate this complex performance over a full year. Over the years, several CBDM techniques were developed to answer these two main challenges, but they were never systematically benchmarked against each other. This paper compares state-of-the-art RADIANCE-based simulation techniques in terms of annual daylight performance metrics required by national guidelines and international green building rating schemes. The comparison is performed on three different shading systems: diffuse Venetian blinds, specular Venetian blinds, and perforated solar screens. Findings show that simulation methods are characterised by significant differences in their implementation and visual rendering, but most annual daylight metrics result in consistent values (within +/- 20%). A notable exception is Annual Sunlight Exposure, which is highly sensitive to the chosen simulation method, with differences of up to 47 percentage points. Additional outcomes from the present work are used to compile a list of generalised recommendations for designers and policy makers. (C) 2019 The Authors.

Especially in these conditions, the uncertainties of such parametrizations are still large. Most of them rely on the Monin-Obukhov similarity theory (MOST), for which universal stability functions (SFs) represent important ingredients. The SFs are nonlinear, if so, a numerical iteration of the MOST equations is required. Moreover, presently available SFs are significantly different at large stability. To simplify the calculations, a non-iterative parametrization of fluxes is derived and corresponding bulk transfer coefficients for momentum and heat for a package of five pairs of state-of-the-art SFs are proposed. For the first time, a parametrization of the related transfer coefficients is derived in a universal framework for all package members. The new parametrizations provide a basis for a cheap systematic study of the impact of surface layer turbulent fluxes in weather prediction and climate models.","[Gryanik, V.

Design/methodology/approach - Results are based on a literature review of information security culture research published between 2000 and 2013 (December). Findings - This paper can conclude that existing research has focused on a broad set of research topics, but with limited depth. It is striking that the effects of different information security cultures have not been part of that focus. Moreover, existing research has used a small repertoire of research methods, a repertoire that is more limited than in information systems research in general. Furthermore, an extensive part of the research is descriptive, philosophical or theoretical - lacking a structured use of empirical data - which means that it is quite immature. Research limitations/implications - Findings call for future research that: addresses the effects of different information security cultures; addresses the identified research topics with greater depth; focuses more on generating theories or testing theories to increase the maturity of this subfield of information security research; and uses a broader set of research methods. It would be particularly interesting to see future studies that use intervening or ethnographic approaches because, to date, these have been completely lacking in existing research. Practical implications - Findings show that existing research is, to a large extent, descriptive, philosophical or theoretical. Hence, it is difficult for practitioners to adopt these research results, such as frameworks for cultivating or assessment tools, which have not been empirically validated. Originality/value - Few state-of-the-art reviews have sought to assess the maturity of existing research on information security culture. Findings on types of research methods used in information security culture research extend beyond the existing knowledge base, which allows for a critical discussion about existing research in this sub-discipline of information security.","[Karlsson, Fredrik] Rebro Univ, CERIS, Dept Informat, Orebro, Sweden; [Astrom, Joachim; Karlsson, Martin] Rebro Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Orebro, Sweden",,"Karlsson, F (corresponding author), Rebro Univ, CERIS, Dept Informat, Orebro, Sweden.",fredrik.karlsson@oru.se,"Karlsson, Fredrik/AAQ-1270-2021",,Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency,Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency,This research has been funded by the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency.,,133,20,20,0,10,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",2056-4961,,,INF COMPUT SECUR,Inf.

Statistical estimates of model response uncertainty, based on observations of recent climate change(10-13), admit climate sensitivities - defined as the equilibrium response of global mean temperature to doubling levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide - substantially greater than 5 K. But such strong responses are not used in ranges for future climate change(14) because they have not been seen in general circulation models. Here we present results from the 'climateprediction.net' experiment, the first multi-thousand-member grand ensemble of simulations using a general circulation model and thereby explicitly resolving regional details(15-21). We find model versions as realistic as other state-of-the-art climate models but with climate sensitivities ranging from less than 2 K to more than 11 K. Models with such extreme sensitivities are critical for the study of the full range of possible responses of the climate system to rising greenhouse gas levels, and for assessing the risks associated with specific targets for stabilizing these levels.","Univ Oxford, Dept Phys, Oxford OX1 3PU, England; Univ Oxford, Comp Lab, Oxford OX1 3QD, England; Hadley Ctr Climate Predict & Res, Met Off, Exeter EX1 3PB, Devon, England; Rutherford Appleton Lab, Didcot OX11 0QX, Oxon, England; Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London WC2A 2AE, England; Open Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, Bucks, England; Univ Reading, Dept Meteorol, Reading RG6 6BB, Berks, England",University of Oxford; University of Oxford; Met Office - UK; Hadley Centre; UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Science & Technology Facilities Council (STFC); STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Open University - UK; University of Reading,"Stainforth, DA (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Dept Phys, Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3PU, England.",d.stainforth1@physics.ox.ac.uk,"Frame, Dave/A-8918-2014; Christensen, Carl M/F-7562-2015; Collins, Matthew/F-8473-2011; Frame, Dave/R-6169-2016; Allen, Myles R/A-5172-2012","Christensen, Carl M/0000-0003-3388-3914; Collins, Matthew/0000-0003-3785-6008; Frame, Dave/0000-0002-0949-3994; Stainforth, David/0000-0001-6476-733X","Natural Environment Research Council [NER/J/S/2002/00737, NER/A/S/2002/00881, NER/T/S/2001/00968] Funding Source: researchfish",Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),,,29,787,803,2,244,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,1476-4687,,NATURE,Nature,27-Jan,2005,7024,,,,403,406,,10.1038/nature03301,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature03301,,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,890XZ,15674288,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000226546200039,View Full Record in Web of Science

There is a strong influence of the ocean mean state on the AMOC weakening: models with a more saline western subpolar gyre have a greater formation of deep water there. This makes the AMOC more susceptible to weakening from an increase in CO2 since weakening ocean heat transports weaken the contrast between ocean and atmospheric temperatures and hence weaken the buoyancy loss. In models with a greater proportion of deep water formation further north (in the Greenland-Iceland-Norwegian basin), deep-water formation can be maintained by shifting further north to where there is a greater ocean-atmosphere temperature contrast. We show that ocean horizontal resolution can have an impact on the mean state, and hence AMOC weakening. In the models examined, those with higher resolutions tend to have a more westerly location of the North Atlantic Current and stronger subpolar gyre. This likely leads to a greater impact of the warm, saline subtropical Atlantic waters on the western subpolar gyre resulting in greater dense water formation there. Although there is some improvement of the higher resolution models over the lower resolution models in terms of the mean state, both still have biases and it is not clear which biases are the most important for influencing the AMOC strength and response to increasing CO2.","[Jackson, L.

A most representative example is hydropower production, i.e., exploitation of water to produce energy. In the Italian Alps hydropower is strictly dependent upon water from snow and ice melt, and both are decreasing in response to global warming. Here, we study the effects of potential climate change scenarios at 2100 upon hydropower production from the Chavonne plant, in Valle d'Aosta region of Italy, a run-of-the-river (ROR) plant taking water from two high altitude glacierized catchments of Val di Cogne, and Valsavarenche. We use Poli-Hydro, a state-of-the-art hydrological model to mimic the hydrological budget of the area, including ice and snow melt share. Projections of the hydrological budget were built until 2100 by means of selected climate change scenarios, under proper downscaling. We used runs of three General Circulation Models (GCMs), EC-Earth, CCSM4, and ECHAM6.0 under three Representative Concentration Pathways RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, and RCP 8.5 from AR5 of IPCC, and of their updated version under four Shared Socio-Economic Pathways SSP1 2.6, SSP2 4.5, SSP3 7.0, and SSP5 8.5 from AR6. We then assessed hydropower production changes against a recent control run CR period (2005-2015). Mean annual flow is estimated at 14.33 m(3)s(-1)during CR, with ice melt contribution ca. 2%, and snow melt contribution ca. 44%. Ice cover in 2005 was estimated as 19.2 km(2), reaching in 2015, 9.93 km(2). Mean hydropower production was estimated at 153.72 GWh during the CR. Temperature would largely increase throughout the century (+0.93 degrees C on average at the half century, +2.45 degrees C at the end of the century). The ice covered area would be largely depleted (ca. -86%, -94% respectively), with reduced contribution of ice melt (0.23%, <0.1%, respectively) and snow melt (ca. 37%, 33%, respectively). Precipitation would show uncertain patterns, and hence incoming discharge at the plant would erratically vary (-29% to +24% half century, -27% to +59% end of century). Hydropower production displays a large dependence upon monthly discharge patterns, with mostly positive variations (+2.90% on average at half century, +6.95% on average at end of century), with its change driven by exceedance of plant's capacity.","[Duratorre, Tommaso; Bombelli, Giovanni Martino; Menduni, Giovanni; Bocchiola, Daniele] Politecn Milan, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Piazza Leonardo da Vinci 32, I-20133 Milan, Italy",Polytechnic University of Milan,"Bocchiola, D (corresponding author), Politecn Milan, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Piazza Leonardo da Vinci 32, I-20133 Milan, Italy.",tommaso.duratorre@mail.polimi.it; giovannimartino.bombelli@polimi.it; giovanni.menduni@polimi.it; daniele.bocchiola@polimi.it,,"Bocchiola, Daniele/0000-0001-8493-0894",,,,,34,8,8,2,12,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,JUL,2020,7,,,,,,2011,10.3390/w12072011,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w12072011,,,20,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,MY2VQ,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000558278700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

To help address this gap, this paper explores the relationship between incomplete decentralized governance, climate change, and urban resilience. It does through the case studies of secondary cities of Cambodia, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam. Secondary cities are of importance because they are the fastest growing cities in the Global South but also because they have weaker capacity to address climate risks. Through these case studies, the paper draws comparisons between the different cases to look at the linkages between decentralization and urban resilience in secondary cities. Overall, it argues that climate governance, due to the retention of power and resources by central bureaucrats along with fragmented governance structures, and misaligned incentive structures which prioritize economic growth over climate protection have undermined resilience building and contributed to the uneven distribution of climate risks in these cities.","[Marks, Danny] Dublin City Univ, Sch Law & Govt, Henry Grattan Bldg,CA 121, Dublin, Ireland; [Pulliat, Gwenn] French Natl Ctr Sci Res CNRS, Res Unit ART Dev, Montpellier, France",Dublin City University; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Marks, D (corresponding author), Dublin City Univ, Sch Law & Govt, Henry Grattan Bldg,CA 121, Dublin, Ireland.",danny.marks@dcu.ie,,"Marks, Danny/0000-0003-0833-880X",Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC); International Development Research Centre (IDRC) of Canada,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)CGIAR); International Development Research Centre (IDRC) of Canada(CGIAR),This work was supported by both the the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC) and the International Development Research Centre (IDRC) of Canada.,,59,1,1,2,2,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1943-815X,1943-8168,,J INTEGR ENVIRON SCI,J.

If substantial amounts of CO2 from natural gas reforming are captured and permanently stored, such hydrogen could be a low-carbon energy carrier. However, recent research raises questions about the effective climate impacts of blue hydrogen from a life cycle perspective. Our analysis sheds light on the relevant issues and provides a balanced perspective on the impacts on climate change associated with blue hydrogen. We show that such impacts may indeed vary over large ranges and depend on only a few key parameters: the methane emission rate of the natural gas supply chain, the CO2 removal rate at the hydrogen production plant, and the global warming metric applied. State-of-the-art reforming with high CO2 capture rates combined with natural gas supply featuring low methane emissions does indeed allow for substantial reduction of greenhouse gas emissions compared to both conventional natural gas reforming and direct combustion of natural gas. Under such conditions, blue hydrogen is compatible with low-carbon economies and exhibits climate change impacts at the upper end of the range of those caused by hydrogen production from renewable-based electricity. However, neither current blue nor green hydrogen production pathways render fully net-zero hydrogen without additional CO2 removal.","[Bauer, Christian; Treyer, Karin] Paul Scherrer Inst, Lab Energy Syst Anal, Villigen, Switzerland; [Antonini, Cristina; Mazzotti, Marco] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Separat Proc Lab, Zurich, Switzerland; [Bergerson, Joule; McCoy, Sean T.] Univ Calgary, Dept Chem & Petr Engn, Calgary, AB, Canada; [Gazzani, Matteo] Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Gencer, Emre] MIT, MIT Energy Initiat, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Gibbins, Jon] Univ Sheffield, Dept Mech Engn, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [McKenna, Russell] Univ Aberdeen, Sch Engn, Aberdeen, Scotland; [Pietzcker, Robert; Ueckerdt, Falko] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Potsdam, Germany; [Ravikumar, Arvind P.] Univ Texas Austin, Hildebrand Dept Petr & Geosyst Engn, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Romano, Matteo C.] Politecn Milan, Energy Dept, Milan, Italy; [Vente, Jaap] TNO, Sustainable Proc Technol, The Hague, Netherlands; [van der Spek, Mijndert] Heriot Watt Univ, Sch Engn & Phys Sci, Inst Mech Proc & Energy Engn, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Paul Scherrer Institute; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; University of Calgary; Utrecht University; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); University of Sheffield; University of Aberdeen; Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; Polytechnic University of Milan; Netherlands Organization Applied Science Research; Heriot Watt University,"van der Spek, M (corresponding author), Heriot Watt Univ, Sch Engn & Phys Sci, Inst Mech Proc & Energy Engn, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland.",M.Van_der_Spek@hw.ac.uk,"Gazzani, Matteo/B-6955-2015; McCoy, Sean Thomas/AAC-9470-2022","Gazzani, Matteo/0000-0002-1352-4562; McCoy, Sean Thomas/0000-0003-0401-893X; Van der Spek, Mijndert/0000-0002-3365-2289; Treyer, Karin/0000-0001-9845-5633; Bauer, Christian/0000-0002-1083-9200; antonini, cristina/0000-0001-7717-308X; McKenna, Russell/0000-0001-6758-482X; Mazzotti, Marco/0000-0002-4948-6705",Kopernikus Project Ariadne - German Federal Ministry of Education and Research [FKZ 03SFK5A]; MIT Energy Initiative CCUS Low Carbon Energy Center; PSI's ESI platform; Canada First Research Excellence Fund,Kopernikus Project Ariadne - German Federal Ministry of Education and Research; MIT Energy Initiative CCUS Low Carbon Energy Center; PSI's ESI platform; Canada First Research Excellence Fund,"Financial support was provided by the Kopernikus Project Ariadne (FKZ 03SFK5A) funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research, the MIT Energy Initiative CCUS Low Carbon Energy Center and PSI's ESI platform.

This analysis allows a comparison between the impact of the long term climate variations associated with insolation changes and the more recent effects of anthropogenic forcing on the region. The PMIP3 multimodel experiments suggest that changes in precipitation over almost all southern South America between MH and pre-industrial (PI) times due to insolation variations are significantly larger than those between PI and the present, which are due to changes in greenhouse gas concentrations. Anthropogenic forcing has been particularly intense over western Patagonia inducing reduction of precipitation in summer, autumn and winter as a consequence of progressively weaker westerly winds over the region, which have moved further poleward, between ca. 35-55A degrees S and have become stronger south of about 50A degrees S. Orbital variations between the MH to the PI period increased insolation over southern South America during summer and autumn inducing warmer conditions in the PI, accentuated by the effect of anthropogenic forcing during the last century. On the other hand, changes in orbital parameters from the MH to the PI period reduced insolation during winter and spring inducing colder conditions, which have been reversed by the anthropogenic forcing.","[Berman, Ana Laura; Silvestri, Gabriel E.] UBA, Ctr Invest Mar & Atmosfera, CONICET, UMI IFAECI,CNRS, Int Guiraldes 2160,Ciudad Univ, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Rojas, Maisa] Univ Chile, Dept Geofis, Blanco Encalada 2002, Santiago, Chile; [Tonello, Marcela S.] UNMdP, CONICET, Lab Paleoecol & Palinol Ecol & Paleoecol Ambiente, Inst Invest Marinas & Costeras IIMyC, JB Justo 2550, Mar Del Plata, Argentina",Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); University of Buenos Aires; Universidad de Chile; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); National University of Mar del Plata,"Silvestri, GE (corresponding author), UBA, Ctr Invest Mar & Atmosfera, CONICET, UMI IFAECI,CNRS, Int Guiraldes 2160,Ciudad Univ, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",alberman@cima.fcen.uba.ar; gabriels@cima.fcen.uba.ar; maisa@dgf.uchile.cl; mtonello@mdp.edu.ar,"Rojas, Maisa/A-7229-2013","Rojas, Maisa/0000-0002-5985-1905; Tonello, Marcela Sandra/0000-0002-4134-3814","FONDECYT [1131055, NC120066]; FONDAP-CONICYT [15110009]; UNMdP EXA [678/14];  [CONICET-PIP 11220120100526CO];  [AGENCIA-MINCYT-PICT-2013-0043]",FONDECYT(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT); FONDAP-CONICYT(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDAP); UNMdP EXA; ; ,"We acknowledge the World Climate Research Program's Working Group on Coupled Modeling, which is responsible for CMIP, and thank the climate modeling groups (listed in Sect. 2) for producing and making available their model output.

Arctic charr is a resilient salmonid species that was traditionally an important part of the sustenance economy in Arctic and Subarctic communities as a source of fresh food throughout the year. Arctic charr populations have declined in recent years, in part due to climate change. These changes in the freshwater ecosystems in turn affect the cultural and economic traditions of freshwater fishing and consumption. This development has consequences for the tourism industry as hunting, fishing and consuming local and traditional food is important in branding tourism destinations. Fisheries are no longer the source of this important ingredient in the Nordic culinary tradition, instead aquaculture production supplies nearly all the Arctic charr consumed. In this paper, we pool the resources of an interdisciplinary team of scholars researching climate change, freshwater ecology, aquaculture and tourism. We integrate knowledge from these fields to discuss likely future scenarios for Arctic charr, their implications for transdisciplinary social ecosystem approaches to sustainable production, marketing and management, particularly how this relates to the growing industry of tourism in the Nordic Arctic and Subarctic region. We pose the questions whether Arctic Charr will be on the menu in 20 years and if so, where will it come from, and what consequences does that have for local food in tourism of the region? Our discussion starts with climate change and the question of how warm it is likely to get in the Nordic Arctic, particularly focusing on Iceland and Norway. To address the implications of the warming of lakes and rivers of the global north for Arctic charr we move on to a discussion of physiological and ecological factors that are important for the distribution of the species. We present the state of the art of Arctic charr aquaculture before articulating the importance of the species for marketing of local and regional food, particularly in the tourism market. Finally, we discuss the need for further elaboration of future scenarios for the interaction of the Arctic charr ecosystem and the economic trade in the species and draw conclusions about sustainable future development.","[Helgadottir, Gudrun] Univ South Eastern Norway, USN Sch Business, Dept Business & IT, Bo, Norway; [Renssen, Hans; Olk, Tom Robin; Oredalen, Tone Joran] Univ South Eastern Norway, Nat Sci & Maritime Sci, Fac Technol, Dept Nat Sci & Environm Hlth, Bo, Norway; [Haraldsdottir, Laufey] Holar Univ, Dept Rural Tourism, Holar, Iceland; [Skulason, Skuli; Thorarensen, Helgi Por] Haar Univ, Dept Aquaculture & Fish Biol, Haar, Iceland; [Thorarensen, Helgi Por] UiT Arctic Univ Norway, Norwegian Coll Fishery Sci, Fac Biosci Fisheries & Econ, Tromso, Norway",UiT The Arctic University of Tromso,"Helgadottir, G (corresponding author), Univ South Eastern Norway, USN Sch Business, Dept Business & IT, Bo, Norway.",gudrun.helgadottir@usn.no,,"Olk, Tom Robin/0000-0003-2234-1474","Arctic Research and Studies Program - Long term cooperation - Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Norway [2016-ARS-79495]; Arctic Research and Studies Program - Long term cooperation - Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Iceland [2016-ARS-79495]; Holar University, Iceland; Arctic University of Norway; University of South-Eastern Norway","Arctic Research and Studies Program - Long term cooperation - Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Norway; Arctic Research and Studies Program - Long term cooperation - Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Iceland; Holar University, Iceland; Arctic University of Norway; University of South-Eastern Norway","This research was supported with a grant from the Arctic Research and Studies Program - Long term cooperation funded by the Ministries for Foreign Affairs of Norway and Iceland.

However, there is less information on the change trends in both climate and land cover in LBB and thus less understanding of the watershed sensitivity and adaptability to climate change. Here we identified the spatial and temporal patterns of changes in climate (from 1979 to 2016), land cover, and vegetation (from 2000 to 2010) in the LBB. During the past 40years, there was a little increase in precipitation while air temperature has increased by 1.4 degrees C. During the past 10years, land cover has changed significantly. Herein grassland, water bodies, permanent snow, and ice decreased by 485.40km(2), 161.55km(2) and 2.83km(2), respectively. However, forest and wetland increased by 111.40km(2) and 202.90km(2), respectively. About 83.67km(2) area of water bodies has been converted into the wetland. Also, there was a significant change in Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the NDVI maximum value was 1 in 2000, decreased to 0.9 in 2010. Evidently, it was in the mountainous areas and in the river basin that the vegetation shifted.

J,"Monney, J",,,,"Monney, Julien",,,Symbolic interactions in island context: the pre-Columbian rock art of Guadeloupe Island and its relationship with the landscape,BULLETIN DE LA SOCIETE PREHISTORIQUE FRANCAISE,,,French,Article,,,,,,Pre-Columbian archaeology; rock art; petroglyph; Guadeloupe; Lesser Antilles; Caribbean Islands; spatial analysis; landscape; social anthropology; territory,CLIMATE,"Located in the heart of the Caribbean, the volcanic island of Guadeloupe, or Basse-Terre, presents the most important concentration of pre-Columbian rock art in the Lesser Antilles. Comprising as many graphic entities as all the Lesser Antilles together, it is sometimes considered to be the only island, which by the number and complexity of its rock art, can stand comparison with Puerto Rico and the Greater Antilles in general. This rock art is attributed to the Ceramic Age societies that lived in the region between approx. 300 BC and 1200 AD. Following extensive field research recently carried out on these open-air rock art sites, a great deal of new data has been acquired. A spatial analysis of these data is proposed here on the basis of quantitative methods in order to address the sociocultural conditions of rock art and sites uses. The physical and symbolic relationships between the pre-Columbian societies and their geographical environment is addressed. The results show that in Guadeloupe there are several distinct topographic contexts in terms of elevation and distance to freshwater resources (spring and/or river): 1: River mouth and/or coastal spring, 2: River, 3: Plateau. They also show that coastal sites (type 1) preferentially occupy the portions of the coastline that are most favorable in terms of rainfall rates, but also the closest to the following islands. At the southern end of the island, the sites complex of Trois-Rivieres and, to a lesser extent, the rock art sites on the east coast, are located along the shoreline closest to Les Saintes and Dominica islands to the south, and to Marie-Galante Island to the east. This portion of the coastline receives the highest amount of rainfall. The river system of the area also proves to be the most dense and stable of Guadeloupe Island. In fact, the recent volcanic rocks in the southern part of Guadeloupe Island in general constitute freshwater reservoirs that ensure great stability of water flows, even in periods of low water levels or drought. A very comparable case is observed at the other end of the island. The only rock art site identified there so far - La Ramee - is less than 5 km away from the nearest point to the next island (Montserrat). It is also located precisely in the coastal area receiving the highest annual rainfall rate in northern Guadeloupe. In terms of rainfall, this area constitutes a small but significant local maximum. Coming from Montserrat, it is the first area of high rainfall encountered when one follows the coastline from the closest point of landing. Thus, when taking into account the highest coastal rainfall rates, stability of water resources and minimum distance to neighboring islands, the sector that emerges first matches with the highest concentration of rock art, namely the southeastern coast of the island. To a lesser extent, the second sector to emerge is the northern end of the island where at least one site is known. A direct correlation between the topographical environment of the rock art and its dimensions and complexity index is also to be noted. This results in a higher proportion of large elaborate figures at river mouths and/or in close proximity to coastal springs, and a higher frequency of small simple figures in the hinterland, be it on plateaus or, more markedly, along rivers. The very high concentration of rock art in Trois-Rivieres - which comprises 92.2% of all the engraved rocks on the island and 85% of the rock art - plays here a major role. However, the same applies to the other rock art sites on the island outside this exceptional concentration. In view of the topographic and morphometric differences existing between the rock art sites, the possibility of different sociocultural contexts and even different times of production and use as well as different motivations must be taken into account. The presence of rock art on the coasts of Guadeloupe Island, and in particular the presence of monumental rock art at its southeastern end, is discussed in terms of seafaring, multi-islands territories and accessibility of freshwater resources for groups passing through to other islands. From this point of view, the density of rock art, the large dimensions and high degree of complexity of the figures observed in the mouth and/or coastal spring sites (type 1) is probably a consequence of the frequentation of these sites by a plurality of human groups taking advantage of the same resource, whether alternately during inter-island journeys or simultaneously during episodic gatherings. The highest proportion of large elaborate figures present on the coasts would then be the graphic expression of a relationship to shared places and to the other groups likely to frequent them as well. Ethnoarchaeological models show in fact that the interface zones between groups are likely to generate an open resurgence of symbolic expressions, especially when resources are scattered in an inhomogeneous and sporadic way over the territory or in the case of aggregation sites. The existence of rock art sites further inland (types 2, 3, 4) raises the question of their articulation with the coastal sites (type 1). In the current state of research, two possibilities are theoretically conceivable. Either the sites on the plateaus were part of the same rock art complex as the coastal sites and had different but complementary uses; all the human groups frequenting the coast having then an equivalent collective or individual access to inland sites (hypothesis A). Or the inland sites constituted independent rock art complexes, distinct from the coastal areas both in terms of uses and users; this may imply a temporal dimension (hypothesis B). In the absence of batey and/or of large rock structures to support the existence of ceremonial centers indicating inter-community uses, the engraved rocks found on the plateaus are compatibles with private practices. Linked with the nearby presence on the plateaus of archaeological remains left by resident groups semi-permanently settled at a distance from the coast, it could then suggest the creation of rock art on the outskirts of the settlements or in garden areas. Nevertheless, the underlying motivations or symbolism associated with such practices (horticultural or other) still remains to be defined.

We use zooarchaeological data on faunal remains (vertebrates and invertebrates) recovered from Here Sorot Entapa rockshelter (HSE) in temporal relationship to climate data from Flores to document prehistoric human responses to regional sea-level, temperature, and associated habitat changes that occurred after the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Human settlement intensity peaked during the colder drier conditions of the Bolling-Allerod period at 14.4-13 ka, and the site was abandoned during a period of unstable sea levels and coastal habitats between 9.4-5 ka. Holocene climate change coincides with increased reefal subsistence, and an increase in crab exploitation over sea urchin use. Rodent abundance increases in the early Holocene, possibly in response to expanding forests during warmer wetter conditions, with a significant increase in the late Holocene as a result of the human introduction of exotic species to the island.","[Kaharudin, Hendri A.

In hot climates, meeting the cooling demand in the sustainable buildings is challenging. To meet this demand in office buildings during summer, the study proposed a holistic configuration of applying passive solar design strategies (PSDSs), and then integrating an active solar cooling technology (ASCT) into the facade. Three hot climates, namely, humid subtropical, hot semi-arid, and hot desert, were investigated using a building energy model. First, four PSDSs, window-to-wall ratio (WWR), glazing type, shading devices, and wall material were sequentially applied to the facade. Then, an absorption chiller driven by a solar thermal collector (STC) was integrated into this passively designed facade. The best tilt angle, area, and dimensions of STC were specified for the main facade orientations. Finally, this study provides design guidelines for integrating ASCT into passively designed facade of office buildings in hot climates. The results reveal that WWR has the highest impact on the cooling demand reduction, whereas the least effect results from the shading devices. The passively designed facade reduces the cooling demand by 43.5%-65.7%. The sloped STC at a tilt angle of 30 is the most efficient option for all orientations except the north where the horizontal STC is considered the best. For these tilt angles, STC area required for meeting the cooling demand ranges from 2.88 m2 to 4.5 m2, corresponding to an STC-to-facade width ratio of 74.1%-84.3%. In the case of the vertical STC, the ASCT is unable to meet the cooling demands.","[Noaman, Dina S.; Moneer, Salma A.; Megahed, Naglaa A.] Port Said Univ, Fac Engn, Architectural Engn & Urban Planning Dept, Port Said, Egypt; [Moneer, Salma A.] Sinai Univ, Fac Engn, Architectural Engn Dept, Kantara branch, Ismailia, Egypt; [El-Ghafour, Sherihan A.] Port Said Univ, Fac Engn, Mech Power Engn Dept, Port Said, Egypt",Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Port Said University; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Sinai University; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Port Said University,"Moneer, SA (corresponding author), Port Said Univ, Fac Engn, Architectural Engn & Urban Planning Dept, Port Said, Egypt.",salma.moneer@eng.psu.edu.eg,"Abdel-Ghafour, Shereehan/AAT-2076-2020; Megahed, Naglaa Ali/L-5089-2019","Megahed, Naglaa Ali/0000-0001-5388-5066",,,,,83,1,1,10,10,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",,2352-7102,,J BUILD ENG,J.

An often-overlooked aspect of agroforestry projects for carbon sequestration is their impact on water resources. It is often unclear to what extent the establishment of forest vegetation would be limited by water availability, whether it would engender competition with other local water uses or induce water scarcity. Here we use global water models to study the hydrologic constraints and impacts of afforestation in tropical biomes. We find that 36% of total suitable and available afforestation areas are in areas where the rain alone can meet just up to the 40% of total plant water requirement. Planting trees will substantially increase water scarcity and possible dispossession (green water grab) especially in dryland regions of Africa and Oceania. Moreover, the combination of tree restoration and irrigation expansion to rainfed agricultural areas is expected to further exacerbate water scarcity, with about half of the global suitable areas for tree restoration experiencing water scarcity at least 7 months per year. Thus, the unavailability of water can overall limit climate change adaptation strategies.This article is part of the theme issue 'Ecological complexity and the biosphere: the next 30 years'.","[Ricciardi, Livia; Galli, Nikolas; Chiarelli, Davide Danilo; Rulli, Maria Cristina] Politecn Milan, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Milan, Italy; [D'Odorico, Paolo] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",Polytechnic University of Milan; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"D'Odorico, P (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",paolododo@berkeley.edu,"D'Odorico, Paolo/A-5836-2008","D'Odorico, Paolo/0000-0002-0007-5833; Rulli, Maria Cristina/0000-0002-9694-4262; Galli, Nikolas/0000-0002-6746-5350",USDA Hatch Multistate project [W4190]; NEXUS NESS project; European Unions Framework Programme for Research and Innovation [2042],USDA Hatch Multistate project; NEXUS NESS project; European Unions Framework Programme for Research and Innovation,"P.D. was funded by the USDA Hatch Multistate project no.W4190 capacity fund.

Precipitation variability encompasses not only extremes like droughts and floods, but also the spectrum of precipitation which populates the times between these extremes. Understanding the changes in precipitation variability alongside changes in mean and extreme precipitation is essential in unraveling the hydrological cycle's response to warming. We use a suite of state-of-the-art climate models, with each model consisting of a single-model initial-condition large ensemble (SMILE), yielding at least 15 individual realizations of equally likely evolutions of future climate state for each climate model. The SMILE framework allows for increased precision in estimating the evolving distribution of precipitation, allowing for forced changes in precipitation variability to be compared across climate models. We show that the scaling rates of precipitation variability, the relation between the rise in global temperature and changes in precipitation variability, are markedly robust across timescales from interannual to decadal. Over mid- and high latitudes, it is very likely that precipitation is increasing across the entire spectrum from means to extremes, as is precipitation variability across all timescales, and seasonally these changes can be amplified. Model or structural uncertainty is a prevailing uncertainty especially over the Tropics and Subtropics. We uncover that model-based estimates of historical interannual precipitation variability are sensitive to the number of ensemble members used, with 'small' initial-condition ensembles (of less than 30 members) systematically underestimating precipitation variability, highlighting the utility of the SMILE framework for the representation of the full precipitation distribution.","[Wood, Raul R.] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Dept Geog, Munich, Germany; [Lehner, Flavio; Pendergrass, Angeline G.] Cornell Univ, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Ithaca, NY USA; [Lehner, Flavio] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, Zurich, Switzerland; [Lehner, Flavio; Pendergrass, Angeline G.] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Boulder, CO USA; [Schlunegger, Sarah] Princeton Univ, Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",University of Munich; Cornell University; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; Princeton University,"Wood, RR (corresponding author), Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Dept Geog, Munich, Germany.",raul.wood@lmu.de,,"Wood, Raul/0000-0003-4172-7719; Lehner, Flavio/0000-0003-4632-9701",Multi-Model Large Ensemble Archive (MMLEA); ClimEx project - Bavarian Ministry for the Environment and Consumer protection; Swiss National Science Foundation [PZ00P2_174128]; Regional and Global Model Analysis (RGMA) component of the Earth and Environmental System Modeling Program of the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Biological & Environmental Research (BER) via NSF [IA 1844590]; National Center for Atmospheric Research - National Science Foundation (NSF) [1947282]; NASA award [NNX17AI75G]; NSF's Southern Ocean Carbon and Climate Observations and Modeling (SOCCOM) Project under the NSF Award [PLR-1425989]; NOAA; NASA,Multi-Model Large Ensemble Archive (MMLEA); ClimEx project - Bavarian Ministry for the Environment and Consumer protection; Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission); Regional and Global Model Analysis (RGMA) component of the Earth and Environmental System Modeling Program of the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Biological & Environmental Research (BER) via NSF; National Center for Atmospheric Research - National Science Foundation (NSF); NASA award; NSF's Southern Ocean Carbon and Climate Observations and Modeling (SOCCOM) Project under the NSF Award; NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)),"We acknowledge US CLIVAR for support of the Multi-Model Large Ensemble Archive (MMLEA).

Its enhanced uncertainty anticipation is shown to induce improved thermal comfort in closed-loop simulations compared to the conventional deterministic MPC (DMPC) and the state-of-the-art SMPCa only accounting for additive uncertainties, at the cost of a maximum relative increase in energy use of 21.6% and 4.2%, respectively. By incorporating the SMPCap strategy in an integrated optimal control and design (IOCD) approach, its additional added value for obtaining a more appropriate, yet robust, heat supply system sizing is illustrated.

This evaluation is a contribution to the estimation of the uncertainty associated to regional climate model (RCM) simulations. The analysis was carried out over the period 1961-99 for three North American watersheds, and it looked at climatological seasonal means, mean (climatological) annual cycles, and interanual variability. The three watersheds - the Mississippi, the St. Lawrence, and the Mackenzie River basins - were selected to cover a large range of climate conditions. An evaluation of simulated water budget components with available observations was also included in the analysis. Results indicated that the response of climatological means and annual cycles of water budget components to land surface parameterizations and lateral boundary conditions varied from basin to basin. Sensitivity to lateral boundary conditions is, in general, smaller than sensitivity to LSS and tends to be stronger for the northern basins (Mackenzie and St. Lawrence). Interannual variability was unaffected by changes in LSS and in driving data. Internal variability triggered by different initial conditions and the nonlinear nature of the climate model did not significantly affect either the 39-yr climatology, the climatological annual cycles, or the interannual variability. A comparison with observations suggests that although the simple Manabe-based LSS may be adequate for simulations of climatological means, skillful simulation of annual cycles require the use of a state-of-the-art LSS.","[Music, Biljana; Caya, Daniel] Univ Quebec Montreal, Consortium Ouranos, Montreal, PQ H3A 1B9, Canada; [Caya, Daniel] Univ Quebec Montreal, Canadian Reg Climate Modelling & Diagnost Network, Montreal, PQ H3A 1B9, Canada",Ouranos Consortium; University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal; University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal,"Music, B (corresponding author), Univ Quebec Montreal, Consortium Ouranos, 550 Sherbrooke St W,19th Floor,West Tower, Montreal, PQ H3A 1B9, Canada.",music.biljana@ouranos.ca,,"Music, Biljana/0000-0002-8760-8996",Canadian Regional Climate Modelling and Diagnostics (CRCMD) Network; Canadian Foundation for Climate and Atmospheric Sciences (CFCAS); Ouranos Consortium on Regional Climatology and Adaptation to Climate Change,Canadian Regional Climate Modelling and Diagnostics (CRCMD) Network; Canadian Foundation for Climate and Atmospheric Sciences (CFCAS); Ouranos Consortium on Regional Climatology and Adaptation to Climate Change,"This research was financially supported by the Canadian Regional Climate Modelling and Diagnostics (CRCMD) Network, funded by the Canadian Foundation for Climate and Atmospheric Sciences (CFCAS) and the Ouranos Consortium on Regional Climatology and Adaptation to Climate Change.

These challenges are more acute across biodiversity hotspots in the Global South. This study disentangles the complex interplay to propose alternative paradigms of governance and policy thinking necessary for sustainable biodiversity conservation. Climate change impacts are exposing critical deficiencies of 'scientific forest management' pursued for over a century. For example, recurrent disasters and ecological shifts are increasingly obfuscating cognitive and physical boundaries between the reserve forest and human habitations; putting additional stress on livelihoods which in turn escalate pressures on the forest commons and fuel further conflicts between conservation governance and local communities. Instead of assisting in adaptation, the existing conservation governance mechanisms are producing further conflicts between humans and non-humans; livelihoods and conservation; disaster management and development. Conducted in the Sundarbans Biosphere Reserve -world's largest mangrove forest ecosystem and a climate change hotspot located along the Bay of Bengal across India and Bangladesh -the study finds an urgent need of rethinking and recalibrating biodiversity conservation in the times of climate change. However, institutional and market-based approaches such as promoting ecotourism or mangrove plantations may have little impact in this regard, the study finds. Instead, integrating cultural ecosystem services and co-producing knowledge will be critical to tackle the entanglements of climate change and its impacts on local lives, livelihoods and biodiversity conservation.","[Ghosh, Aditya] Jindal Global Univ, Jindal Sch Art & Architecture, Sonipat, Haryana, India; [Ghosh, Aditya] Heidelberg Univ, Heidelberg, Germany; [Ghosh, Aditya] Leuphana Univ, Luneburg, Germany; [Sen, Amrita] Indian Inst Technol Kharagpur, Kharagpur, W Bengal, India; [Sen, Amrita] Azim Premji Univ, Bengaluru, India; [Dutta, Kaberi] Heidelberg Univ, Dept Anthropol, South Asia Inst, Heidelberg, Germany; [Ghosh, Priyanka] VIT AP Univ, VIT AP Sch Social Sci & Humanities VISH, Amravati, Vijayawada, India",O.P.

This warmer climate has led to a global mean sea level rise of about 18 cm during the 20th century, and over 6 cm for the first 15 years of the 21st century. Regionally the sea level rise is not uniform due in large part to internal climate variability. To better serve the community, the uncertainties of predicting/projecting regional sea level changes associated with internal climate variability need to be quantified. Previous research on this topic has used single-model large ensembles with perturbed atmospheric initial conditions (ICs). Here we compare uncertainties associated with perturbing ICs in just the atmosphere and just the ocean using a state-of-the-art coupled climate model. We find that by perturbing the oceanic ICs, the uncertainties in regional sea level changes increase compared to those with perturbed atmospheric ICs. Thus, in order for us to better assess the full spectrum of the impacts of such internal climate variability on regional and global sea level rise, approaches that involve perturbing both atmospheric and oceanic initial conditions are necessary.","[Hu, Aixue; Meehl, Gerald A.; Strand, Warren G.] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Climate & Global Dynam Lab, Boulder, CO 80303 USA; [Stammer, Detlef] Univ Hamburg, CEN, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany; [Han, Weiqing] Univ Colorado, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; University of Hamburg; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Hu, AX (corresponding author), Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Climate & Global Dynam Lab, Boulder, CO 80303 USA.",ahu@ucar.edu; meehl@ucar.edu; detlef.stammer@uni-hamburg.de; whan@colorado.edu; strandwg@ucar.edu,"Hu, Aixue/E-1063-2013","Hu, Aixue/0000-0002-1337-287X",Regional and Global Climate Modeling Program (RGCM) of the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Science (BER) [DE-FC02-97ER62402]; National Science Foundation,Regional and Global Climate Modeling Program (RGCM) of the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Science (BER)(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"Authors want to express sincere appreciation for many suggestions from Clara Deser.

Key for this study is that both energy and water balances are resolved and interact through the evaporative term. Historical urbanization of BCR is estimated from changes in impervious surface area using remote sensing imagery and future climate is modelled using data from two members of the European project PRUDENCE. Results show that (1) a change could be detected in the annual series of cumulative surface runoff, high flow and the frequency of flood events when imperviousness exceeds 35%. (2) Climate change has a greater impact on low flows than urbanization. (3) In terms of high flow and annual cumulative runoff, historical urbanization and the precipitation increase scenario have approximately the same increasing trend. However, during summertime when floods happen frequently in the BCR, the average contribution of urbanization is four times greater than that due to the increase in precipitation in terms of the cumulative runoff ratio. (4) The assumed 10% increase in imperviousness in the BCR is able to counteract the increase in evapotranspiration due to warmer climate predictions. (5) When combining the effect of future urbanization (+20% of imperviousness) and precipitation scenario together, the increase in high flow is exacerbated. Copyright.

This paper discusses two analytical approaches to this challenge used to inform funding decisions related to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) applied energy R&D portfolio. The two approaches are distinguished by the constraints under which they were conducted: the need to provide an end-to-end portfolio analysis as input to internal DOE budgeting processes, but with limited time and subject to institutional constraints regarding important issues such as expert judgment. Because of these constraints, neither approach should be viewed as an attempt to push forward the state of the art in portfolio analysis in the abstract. Instead, they are an attempt to use more stylized, heuristic methods that can provide first-order insights in the DOE institutional context. Both approaches make use of advanced technology scenarios implemented in an integrated assessment modeling framework and then apply expert judgment regarding the likelihood of achieving associated R&D and commercialization goals. The approaches differ in the granularity of the scenarios used and in the definition of the benefits of technological advance: in one approach the benefits are defined as the cumulative emission reduction attributable to a particular technology; in the other approach benefits are defined as the cumulative cost reduction. In both approaches a return on investment (ROI) criterion is established based on benefits divided by federal R&D investment. The ROI is then used to build a first-order approximation of an optimal applied energy R&D investment portfolio. Although these methodologies have been used to inform an actual budget request, the results reflect only one input among many used in budget formulation. The results are therefore not representative of an official U.S. government or DOE funding recommendation but should instead be considered illustrative of the way in which methodologies such as these could be applied.

Regional climate change projections based on dynamical downscaling through regional climate models (RCMs) are used to assess drought frequency, intensity, and duration, and the impact propagation from meteorological to agricultural to hydrological systems. The impact on a meteorological drought index (standardized precipitation index, SPI) is first assessed on the basis of daily climate inputs from RCMs driven by three general circulation models (GCMs). Two periods and two emission scenarios, i.e., 1991-2000 and 2091-2100 under B1 and A1Fi for Parallel Climate Model (PCM), 1990-1999 and 2090-2099 under A1B and A1Fi for Community Climate System Model, version 3.0 (CCSM3), 1980-1989 and 2090-2099 under B2 and A2 for Hadley Centre CGCM (HadCM3), are undertaken and dynamically downscaled through the RCMs. The climate projections are fed to a calibrated hydro-agronomic model at the watershed scale in Central Illinois, and agricultural drought indexed by the standardized soil water index (SSWI) and hydrological drought by the standardized runoff index (SRI) and crop yield impacts are assessed. SSWI, in particular with extreme droughts, is more sensitive to climate change than either SPI or SRI. The climate change impact on drought in terms of intensity, frequency, and duration grows from meteorological to agricultural to hydrological drought, especially for CCSM3-RCM. Significant changes of SSWI and SRI are found because of the temperature increase and precipitation decrease during the crop season, as well as the nonlinear hydrological response to precipitation and temperature change.","[Wang, Dingbao; Hejazi, Mohamad; Cai, Ximing; Valocchi, Albert J.] Univ Illinois, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Wang, Dingbao] Univ Cent Florida, Dept Civil Environm & Construct Engn, Orlando, FL 32816 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; State University System of Florida; University of Central Florida,"Wang, DB (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 301 N Mathews Ave, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",xmcai@illinois.edu,"Wang, Dingbao/B-6948-2012","Wang, Dingbao/0000-0003-4822-7485; Valocchi, Albert/0000-0003-3217-1712",U.S. National Science Foundation [CMMI 0825654]; NASA [NNX08AL94G],U.S. National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)),This paper is based on the first author's post-doc research at University of Illinois Urban-Champaign.

The starting claim is that the current knowledge about how much events related to global and local student protests directly influenced the art scene in socialist Croatia and Yugoslavia is relatively modest, that is, that the connection between a certain type of avant-garde artistic practice and particular historical context is based on general assumptions. In order to clarify these ties, the article reflects on the cultural policy that immediately preceded the rebellious year, which was marked by general reform efforts in socialist Croatia and the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in the second half of the 1960s. The social position of young artists became one of the important topics in regard to the reform efforts in the field of culture, as evidenced by the intensity of discussions at the level of the League of Socialist Youth. The text further explains the material and professional working conditions of young artists and the reasons for their dissatisfaction with the cultural and artistic system. Light is shed on events related to student protests at the Academy of Fine Arts in Zagreb in June 1968, which were an immediate occasion for the establishment of the Youth Salon exhibition. The thesis is that the Youth Salon, as a representative type of exhibition organised by the central republican art association (ULUH) and the Central Committee of the League of Socialist Youth, represented a typical parade gesture made by the state, which sought to pacify young people's dissatisfaction with the general situation in the field of art and culture. As such, the Youth Salon experienced severe criticism in the first years of its existence. It also influenced the politicisation of young artists, who began to engage in criticism of the system as a whole. The controversy over the Youth Salon was also the immediate cause of the identity divergence between the young avant-garde artists, within which two art groups were the leading opponents: the so-called 'neoplasticists', gathered around Zagreb's SC Gallery, and artists gathered in the Art Group 'Atelier biafra', who were the initiators and organisers of the Youth Salon in the first years. This antagonism would determine the balance of power on the Croatian art scene in the long run and influence the understanding of the echoes of 1968 in art and culture in general.","[Mance, Ivana] Inst Povijest Umjetnosti, Zagreb, Croatia",Institute of Art History,"Mance, I (corresponding author), Inst Povijest Umjetnosti, Zagreb, Croatia.",imance@ipu.hr,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,0,HRVATSKI INST POVIJEST,ZAGREB,"OPATICKA 10, ZAGREB, 10000, CROATIA",0590-9597,1848-9079,,CAS SUVREM POVIJ,Cas.

The IGCM4's niche and utility lies in its speed and flexibility allied with the complexity of a primitive equation climate model. Moist processes such as clouds, evaporation, atmospheric radiation and soil moisture are simulated in the model, though in a simplified manner compared to state-of-the-art global circulation models (GCMs). IGCM4 is a parallelised model, enabling both very long integrations to be conducted and the effects of higher resolutions to be explored.

Various downscaling techniques and raw general circulation model (GCM) Output are compared to one another over 10 December-January-February (DJF) seasons from 1991/1992 to 2000/2001 and also to a baseline prediction technique that uses only global sea-surface temperature (SST) anomalies as predictors. The various downscaling techniques described in this study include both an empirical technique called model output statistics (MOS) and a dynamical technique where a finer resolution regional climate model (RCM) is nested into the large-scale fields of a coarser GCM. The study addresses the performance of a number Of Simulation systems (no forecast lead-time) of varying complexity. These systems' performance is tested for both homogeneous regions and for 963 stations over South Africa, and compared with each other over the 10-year test period. For the most part, the simulations method outscores the baseline method that uses SST anomalies to simulate rainfall, therefore providing., evidence that current approaches in seasonal forecasting, are outscoring earlier ones. Current operational forecasting approaches involve the use of GCMs, which are considered to be the main tool whereby seasonal Forecasting efforts will improve in the future. Advantages in statistically post-processing Output from GCMs as well its output from RCMs are demonstrated. Evidence is provided that skill should further improve with an increased number of ensemble members. The demonstrated importance of statistical models in operation capacities is a major contribution to the science of seasonal forecasting. Although RCMs are preferable due to physical consistency, statistical models are still providing similar or even better skill and should still be applied.

This type of flood is commonly unpredictable and often appears chaotic because its occurrence depends on multiple, interacting weather, hydrological, ice and morphological parameters. This paper presents the findings of a research project assessing how climate change impacts dynamic river-ice breakup and associated floods along seven rivers of the province of Quebec, Canada. A combination of empirical river-ice breakup models, state-of-the-art hydrological simulations and standardized climate projections was used to estimate the historical (1972-2000) and future (2042-2070) frequencies of dynamic breakup events. Ice jam flood damage reimbursement data were used to predict changes to financial risk associated with dynamic breakup events. Results show that, overall, ice-jam floods will generate more damage in the future, which justifies watershed-based flood adaptation plans that take into account cold regions hydrological processes. The success of the methodology also sets the table for a comparable project that would include more rivers from different regions of Northeastern America.","[Turcotte, Benoit; Morse, Brian; Pelchat, Gabriel] Univ Laval, Dept Civil & Water Engn, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada",Laval University,"Turcotte, B (corresponding author), Univ Laval, Dept Civil & Water Engn, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada.",benoit.turcotte@gci.ulaval.ca; brian.morse@gci.ulaval.ca; gabriel.pelchat.1@ulaval.ca,,,OURANOS,OURANOS,This research was funded by OURANOS (https://www.ouranos.ca/).,,55,10,11,1,10,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,OCT,2020,10,,,,,,2891,10.3390/w12102891,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w12102891,,,19,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,OL6UO,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000585472500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Using these model simulations, we quantify the potential predictability related to the solar cycle and demonstrate that the detectability of the solar influence on surface climate depends on the magnitude of the solar cycle.

A change in the distribution and magnitude of extreme rainfall events (associated with changing variability), such as droughts or flooding, may have a far greater impact on human and natural systems than a changing mean. This issue is of particular importance for environmentally vulnerable regions such as southern Africa. The sub-continent is considered especially vulnerable to and ill-equipped (in terms of adaptation) for extreme events, due to a number of factors including extensive poverty, famine, disease and political instability. Rainfall variability and the identification of rainfall extremes is a function of scale, so high spatial and temporal resolution data are preferred to identify extreme events and accurately predict future variability. The majority of previous climate model verification studies have compared model output with observational data at monthly timescales. In this research, the assessment of ability of a state of the art climate model to simulate climate at daily timescales is carried out using satellite-derived rainfall data from the Microwave Infrared Rainfall Algorithm (MIRA). This dataset covers the period from 1993 to 2002 and the whole of southern Africa at a spatial resolution of 0.1A degrees longitude/latitude. This paper concentrates primarily on the ability of the model to simulate the spatial and temporal patterns of present-day rainfall variability over southern Africa and is not intended to discuss possible future changes in climate as these have been documented elsewhere. Simulations of current climate from the UK Meteorological Office Hadley Centre's climate model, in both regional and global mode, are firstly compared to the MIRA dataset at daily timescales. Secondly, the ability of the model to reproduce daily rainfall extremes is assessed, again by a comparison with extremes from the MIRA dataset. The results suggest that the model reproduces the number and spatial distribution of rainfall extremes with some accuracy, but that mean rainfall and rainfall variability is under-estimated (over-estimated) over wet (dry) regions of southern Africa.","[Williams, C.

To borrow Margaret Atwood's declaration, we are no longer talking about climate change, we are facing everything change including how we practise as artists in various institutional contexts at home and abroad. It is plausible that in our lifetime we will see our venues, galleries, studios, audiences, and other platforms where we create, tour, and present affected. Therefore, we are in a critical time as practitioners to reconsider our capacities and voices, how we untether from our ways of conventionally working within and across institutional structures, and how we can adapt to the challenges ahead. This autobiographical essay reflects on my own pluralities of experiences for leaving Canada and rationale for staying abroad; and how through my practice a decade later, I am considering what returning might mean.

It employs a theoretical framework that reconciles evidence-based practice in health and the phenomenological nature of community arts practice. Selfdetermination theory (SDT) was used to do this with SDT-derived psychometric instruments [arts climate and Basic Psychological Needs Scales (BPNS)]. Self-administered surveys using these instruments as well as a measure of social support were undertaken on two occasions. Two overlapping but distinct samples were defined and analysed cross-sectionally. These were a (pre-) survey at the commencement of rehearsals for the annual performance (n = 103) and a (post-) survey following the performance (n = 70). The most significant change (MSC) technique was used to study the arts-making process and how it contributes to outcomes. Using these mixed-methods approach, impacts on the climate of the arts organizations, participant access to supportive relationships and participant's mental health and well-being were studied. There were positive changes in the BPNS (p = 0.00), as well as its autonomy (p = 0.04) and relatedness (p = 0.00) subscales. Social support increased from 65.3% in the pre-survey to 82.4% in the post-survey (p = 0.03). MSC data indicated that the supportive, collaborative environment provided by the arts organizations was highly valued by participants and was perceived to have mental health benefits. Overall, the study demonstrated the potential health promoting effects of community arts programmes in disadvantaged populations. Its multi-method approach should be further studied in evaluating other community arts programmes.","[Kelaher, Margaret; Dunt, David; Berman, Naomi; Curry, Steve; Joubert, Lindy; Johnson, Victoria] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Kelaher, M (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, 207 Bouverie St Carlton, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",mkelaher@unimelb.edu.au,"Johnson, Victoria/GVU-7127-2022","Berman, Naomi/0000-0002-4122-9683; kelaher, Margaret/0000-0002-9899-858X",,,,,36,9,9,0,17,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0957-4824,1460-2245,,HEALTH PROMOT INT,Health Promot.

Furthermore, general circulation models (GCMs) show future climate change with a reduction in rainfall and increase in temperature. The aim of the current study is to present an application where GCMs and state-of-the-art hydrological modelling system MIKE SHE/MIKE 11 are combined for assessing the response of a Greek lake in terms of its water balance and water level under climate change. Four general circulation models (GCMs; GFDL-CM3, MIROC-ESM-CHEM, MIROC-ESM, IPSL-CM5A-LR) for the extreme climate change scenario of RCP8.5 were used in the basin of Lake Zazari in Greece as a case study. Results showed that, by keeping the irrigated demands (the main water user) unchanged in the future, the lake exhibited a lower water level for all GCMs, fluctuating from -0.70 to -1.8 m for the mean (min) water level and from -0.30 to -1.20 m for the mean (max) water level.

The residential sector accounts for most energy use in the Gaza Strip, necessitating the development of feasible energy-saving techniques. Herein, a simulation-based study has been prepared to examine the integration of some practical passive design strategies into a generic residence. The study aims to optimize thermal performance by minimizing the building's cooling loads. A detailed examination is conducted for the literature on similar research and passive design techniques to investigate a city's state and climate. Three passive parameters, namely, shading devices, natural ventilation, and thermal insulation, were investigated using Climate Consultant and IESve as assessment software. Accordingly, their impacts on the building's indoor temperature and cooling load were evaluated. The findings suggest that the implementation of such passive design parameters can reduce energy consumption by 9.89 kW, representing 59% of the total energy consumption of the building. Such integration in residential buildings could be significant in cities with limited natural resources and would guide architects, designers, engineers towards the potential of passive measures in building design.","[Mushtaha, Emad; Aldawoud, Abdelsalam; Hamad, Rawan; Nemer, Tareq] Univ Sharjah, Coll Engn, Dept Architectural Engn, POB 27272, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates; [Salameh, Tareq] Univ Sharjah, Dept Sustainable & Renewable Energy Engn, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates; [Kharrufa, Sahar] Ajman Univ, Coll Architecture Art & Design, Dept Architecture, Ajman, U Arab Emirates; [Mori, Taro] Hokkaido Univ, Fac Engn, Div Human Environm Syst, Lab Built Environm, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan",University of Sharjah; University of Sharjah; Ajman University; Hokkaido University,"Mushtaha, E (corresponding author), Univ Sharjah, Coll Engn, Dept Architectural Engn, POB 27272, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates.",emushtaha@sharjah.ac.ae,"Mushtaha, Emad/AFF-2680-2022","Salameh, Tareq/0000-0002-0172-6730; Mushtaha, Emad/0000-0002-8860-1817; Hamad, Rawan/0000-0002-1370-2728; Kharrufa, Sahar N/0000-0003-4904-0137; Aldawoud, Abdelsalam/0000-0002-8137-0753",,,,,33,8,8,7,12,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2214-157X,,,CASE STUD THERM ENG,Case Stud.

Climate perception significantly influences the perception and use of urban spaces; however, virtual urban environments are scarcely represented with different climatic aspects. In this paper, we study the role that visual cues (sky aspect, shadows, sun location, and light effects) specifically play in climate perception (season, daytime and temperature) in virtual urban environments. We present and discuss the data we collected from a recent virtual reality experiment in which ten variations of the climatic context in the same urban space were assessed. The results prove the feasibility of suggesting complex climatic perceptions and thermal feelings by processing only sky, shadow and lighting effects. Furthermore, our results highlight the role of subjective interpretation, personal background and current real-world environment in interpretation and understanding of visual cues.

They adopt sectorial or population-level frames of reference and are operationalized by means of aggregating mathematical models, geospatial analytical platforms, and advanced visualization tools. While vulnerability assessments are intended to inform decision making, they often lack process-based mechanisms that enable them to be framed in terms of localized knowledge and perspectives. This is a weakness because occupant attitudes regarding places can spark unyieldingly negative reactions to expert-generated, objectivist vulnerability assessment processes and their outputs. In this paper, I attempt to demonstrate the salience of self and place constructs and explore the implications of their tendency to block serious reflection about the nature of potential vulnerabilities and risk management interventions. If acknowledged and addressed in a manner that is empathetic and context sensitive, it may be possible to channel these perspectives to elevate and deepen dialog about climate change and help to identify and compile circumstantially appropriate menus of adaptation policy interventions.","[Herrick, Charles] NYU, DC Ctr, Washington, DC 20016 USA",New York University,"Herrick, C (corresponding author), NYU, DC Ctr, Washington, DC 20016 USA.",ch133@nyu.edu,,,,,,,68,3,3,2,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,MAR,2021,5,,,,,,2990,10.3390/su13052990,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13052990,,,11,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,QW4II,,"Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000628614800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Under the multiple challenges of changing climatic, ecological and socio-economic conditions, cities need the means to meet these goals. We know cities are and will continue to be points of concentrated and diverse populations, socioeconomic vulnerability, amplified exposure, transformed ecosystems and are responsible for the bulk of the world's greenhouse gas emissions. Yet, much is also unknown and intrinsically uncertain about urban futures: there is a range of potential plausible futures which have differing implications for both potential mitigation and adaptation actions. To better assess these plausible futures, the global change  research community developed a framework including scenarios that are applicable for global and regional policy, entitled the Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs) and scenarios exploring future emissions that will drive climate change, entitled Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). Importantly, this global scale framework does not include specific city-level perspectives or data at the spatial scales necessary to address questions of local relevance. While the SSPs address many of the key population and socioeconomic drivers of climate change, they do not address important concerns that are particularly relevant to cities, such as racial justice, ecosystem change or migration. Nevertheless, city-level impacts will evolve, in part, as a function of the global scale change characterized by the SSPs, and in part based on demographic and social processes already underway. As such, applying a modification of this framework to cities has the potential to help limit local climate impacts, and create a more resilient, equitable city. To address these needs and respond to city and regional stakeholders, we propose a framework for science-based narratives and quantitative projections for cities and metropolitan areas, such as Greater New York City. In this paper, we review a wide-range of existing approaches to generate estimates of future populations and identify their vulnerabilities to climate-change hazards, ranging from subnational population projections or the spatially-explicit allocation of populations linked to SSPs for the US and selected cities, city-specific population forecasting without climate considerations, and participatory approaches to future scenario development and fine-scale, within-city land use change models. By showcasing the strengths and limitations of various approaches and modeling efforts, their spatial and temporal scales, and thematic breadth, we propose a novel framework that leverages state-of-the art quantitative approaches and couples it with stakeholder engagement that can help cities plan equitably under uncertainty.","[Balk, Deborah; Tagtachian, Daniela; Jones, Bryan] CUNY, Inst Demog Res, New York 10017, NY USA; [Balk, Deborah; Jones, Bryan] CUNY, Baruch Coll, Marxe Sch Publ & Int Affairs, New York, NY 10010 USA; [Tagtachian, Daniela] CUNY, Dept Sociol, Grad Ctr, New York, NY USA; [Jiang, Leiwen] Populat Council, New York, NY USA; [Jiang, Leiwen] Asian Demog Res Inst, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Marcotullio, Peter] CUNY, Hunter Coll, Inst Sustainable Cities, Dept Geog & Environm Sci, New York, NY USA; [Cook, Elizabeth M.] Barnard Coll, Dept Environm Sci, New York, NY USA; [Mustafa, Ahmed; McPhearson, Timon] New Sch, Urban Syst Lab, New York, NY USA; [McPhearson, Timon] Cary Inst Ecosyst Studies, Millbrook, NY USA; [McPhearson, Timon] Stockholm Univ, Stockholm Resilience Ctr, Stockholm, Sweden; [McPhearson, Timon] Royal Swedish Acad Sci, Beijer Inst Ecol Econ, Stockholm, Sweden",City University of New York (CUNY) System; City University of New York (CUNY) System; Baruch College (CUNY); City University of New York (CUNY) System; Population Council; City University of New York (CUNY) System; Hunter College (CUNY); The New School; Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies; Stockholm University; Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences; Beijer Institute of Ecological Economics,"Balk, D (corresponding author), CUNY, Inst Demog Res, New York 10017, NY USA.;Balk, D (corresponding author), CUNY, Baruch Coll, Marxe Sch Publ & Int Affairs, New York, NY 10010 USA.",deborah.balk@baruch.cuny.edu,,"Balk, Deborah/0000-0002-9028-7898",City University of New York's Interdisciplinary Research Grant; US National Science Foundation [2828];  [1444755];  [1927167];  [1934933],City University of New York's Interdisciplinary Research Grant; US National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); ; ; ,"This work was made possible by funding from the City University of New York's Interdisciplinary Research Grant (proposal #2828) to DB, BJ, PM, DT, and LJ.

Within the political climate of the time, it was of no benefit to be seen as a front for the Flechtheim Gallery and a proxy for the Jewish art mogul, with regard to being accepted in the Nazi art market. For artists and customers of the gallery, it was rather a disadvantage to be associated with Flechtheim as of 1933. In view of attacks by the Nazi press, the research to date has concluded that Vomel tried to continue with Flechtheim's exhibition programme.

In this paper, a climate model with a state-of-the-art contrail cirrus representation is used for fixed sea surface temperature simulations in order to determine the effective radiative forcing (ERF) from contrail cirrus. ERF is expected to be a good metric for intercomparing the quantitative importance of different contributions to surface temperature and climate impact. Substantial upscaling of aviation density is necessary to ensure statistically significant results from our simulations. The contrail cirrus ERF is found to be less than 50% of the respective instantaneous or stratosphere adjusted radiative forcings, with a best estimate of roughly 35%. The reduction of ERF is much more substantial for contrail cirrus than it is for a CO2 increase when both stratosphere adjusted forcings are of similar magnitude. Analysis of all rapid radiative adjustments contributing to the ERF indicates that the reduction is mainly induced by a compensating effect of natural clouds that provide a negative feedback. Compared to the CO2 reference case, a less positive combined water vapor and lapse rate adjustment also contributes to a more distinct reduction of contrail cirrus ERF, but not as much as the natural cloud adjustment. Based on the experience gained in this paper, respective contrail cirrus simulations with interactive ocean will be performed as the next step toward establishing contrail cirrus efficacy. ERF results of contrail cirrus from other climate models equipped with suitable parameterizations are regarded as highly desirable.","[Bickel, Marius; Ponater, Michael; Bock, Lisa; Burkhardt, Ulrike; Reineke, Svenja] Deutsch Zentrum Luft & Raumfahrt, Inst Phys Atmosphere, Oberpaffenhofen, Germany",Helmholtz Association; German Aerospace Centre (DLR),"Bickel, M (corresponding author), Deutsch Zentrum Luft & Raumfahrt, Inst Phys Atmosphere, Oberpaffenhofen, Germany.",marius.bickel@dlr.de,"Bock, Lisa/B-3132-2016; Ponater, Michael/AAQ-4907-2020","Bock, Lisa/0000-0001-7058-5938; Bickel, Marius/0000-0002-7872-3706; Ponater, Michael/0000-0002-9771-4733",DLR aeronautics board (Ph.D. project Efficacy of Contrail Cirrus''),DLR aeronautics board (Ph.D. project Efficacy of Contrail Cirrus''),"This work received dedicated funding from the DLR aeronautics board (Ph.D. project Efficacy of Contrail Cirrus'').

The model focuses on the process whereby a cultural innovation becomes endemic in a population, predicting that this cannot occur unless population density exceeds a critical threshold. Analysis of the data, using a Bayesian statistical framework, shows that the model has stronger empirical support than a proportional model, where detection is directly proportional to population density, or a null model, where rock art detection ratios and population density are independent. Results for different geographical areas and periods are compatible with the predictions of the model and confirm its superiority with respect to the null model. Re-analysis of the rock art data, using a second set of independent population estimates, again supports the superiority of the model. Although the available data is sparse and the analysis cannot exclude all possible sources of bias, this is evidence that population density above a critical threshold may be a necessary condition for the maintenance of rock art as a stable part of a population's cultural repertoire. Methods similar to those described can be used to test the model for other classes of archaeological artifact and to compare it against other models.","[Walker, Richard; Newton, Taylor Howard; Casalegno, Francesco] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Blue Brain Project, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Eriksson, Anders] Univ Tartu, Inst Genom cGEM, Tartu, Estonia; [Ruiz, Camille] Ateneo Manila Univ, Manila, Philippines",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne; University of Tartu; Ateneo de Manila University,"Walker, R (corresponding author), Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Blue Brain Project, Lausanne, Switzerland.;Eriksson, A (corresponding author), Univ Tartu, Inst Genom cGEM, Tartu, Estonia.",Richard.Walker@epfl.ch; Anders.Eriksson@ut.ee,,"Ruiz, Camille Marie/0000-0002-4443-3313",,,,,41,0,0,0,1,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,17-Mar,2021,3,,,,,,e0247973,10.1371/journal.pone.0247973,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0247973,,,18,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics,QY9GW,33730059,"Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000630345000071,View Full Record in Web of Science

Of particular interest in the Iberian region is the Azores High (AH) system, the southern node of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), an atmospheric dipole closely tied to regional hydroclimate. Hydroclimate-sensitive proxy reconstructions from this region offer some insights into atmospheric dynamics, but large spatiotemporal gaps in these data inhibit a robust evaluation of hydroclimate variability. In this study, we present a continuous, sub-decadally-resolved composite stalagmite carbon isotopic record from three partially overlapping stalagmites from Buraca Gloriosa (BG) cave, western Portugal, situated within the center of the AH, that preserves evidence of regional hydroclimate variability from approximately 800 CE to the present. Chronologies are derived from U/Th dating and annual laminae. Stalagmite carbon isotopic values primarily reflect the amount of effective moisture and reveal generally dry conditions during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA; similar to 850-1250 CE) and Modern Climate/ Industrial Era (1850 CE-present), and wetter conditions during the Little Ice Age (LIA; similar to 1400-1850 CE). Multidecadal to centennial variability in the BG record and state-of-the-art last millennium climate model simulations show considerable coherence with precipitation-sensitive records from Spain and Morocco that, like BG, are strongly influenced by the intensity, size, and location of the AH. Model-proxy synthesis suggests that western Portugal was persistently dry during much of the MCA consistent with other NAO reconstructions; however, even considering age uncertainties, the apparent timing in the transition from a relatively dry MCA to a wetter LIA is spatially variable and confirms the non-stationary behavior of the AH system indicated by model output.","[Thatcher, Diana L.; Wanamaker, A.

Since the assessment was completed, output from another model has been added to the dataset, so the participation is now 17 groups from 12 countries with 24 models. This effort, as well as the subsequent analysis phase, was organized by the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) Climate Variability and Predictability (CLIVAR) Working Group on Coupled Models (WGCM) Climate Simulation Panel, and constitutes the third phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP3). The dataset is called the WCRP CMIP3 multimodel dataset, and represents the largest and most comprehensive international global coupled climate model experiment and multimodel analysis effort ever attempted. As of March 2007, the Program for Climate Model Diagnostics and Intercomparison (PCMDI) has collected, archived, and served roughly 32 TB of model data. With oversight from the panel, the multimodel data were made openly available from PCMDI for analysis and academic applications. Over 171 TB of data had been downloaded among the more than 1000 registered users to date. Over 200 journal articles, based in part on the dataset, have been published 23 as so far. Though initially aimed at the IPCC AR4, this unique and valuable resource will continue to be maintained for at least the next several years. Never before has such` an extensive set of climate model simulations been made available to the international climate science community for study. The ready access to the multimodel dataset opens up these types of model analyses to researchers, including students, who previously could not obtain state-of-the-art climate model output, and thus represents a new era in climate change research. As a direct consequence, these ongoing studies are increasing the body of knowledge regarding our understanding of how the climate system currently works, and how it may change in the future.

Different land-atmosphere coupling metrics are used for assessing the hot-spots of land atmosphere feedback over the Indian subcontinent. The model simulations are performed using regional climate model (RCM)-RegCMv4.0, 4.2 and 4.4.5.10 at different horizontal resolutions. The monthly soil wetness climatology over India is calculated using European Space Agency (ESA) datasets. Maximum soil moisture(SM) is found over the western part of central India during June-September. The results from RCM simulations (RegCMv4.0, 4.2 and 4.4.5.10) indicate more soil wetness, systematically (over-predicted) over North India, Indo-Gangetic plains and central India during June, July, August and September, implying that model soil wetness is driven by precipitation minus evapotranspiration (P-E). The role of aerosols in land-atmosphere interactions along with the impact of mixed convective parameterization schemes over ocean and land on modelling SM and land-atmosphere interactions is also addressed. The spatial and temporal variation of atmospheric and terrestrial coupling indices during ISM regime concludes that May, June, July and August are the prime months of land-atmosphere interactions over central and north-west India reiterating results from previous GLACE (The Global Land-Atmosphere Coupling Experiment) studies. Model simulations also indicate that during the ISM season the terrestrial segment of land-atmosphere coupling (i.e. terrestrial coupling index of soil moisture, SM) from SM to latent heat flux varies around 35-40 W m(-2), while the atmospheric segment of coupling (i.e. atmospheric coupling index of precipitation) from latent heat flux to precipitation modulates around 4-6 mm/day. Aerosols are found to influence land-atmosphere interactions over north-west India by modulating net radiation. More in-situ observations of land surface variables are required for verification of land-atmospheric interactions (along with impact of aerosols) using RCMs.","[Lodh, Abhishek] Indian Inst Technol Delhi, Ctr Atmospher Sci, Hauz Khas, New Delhi 110016, India; [Lodh, Abhishek] Minist Earth Sci, Natl Ctr Medium Range Weather Forecasting, A-50,Sect 62, Noida 201309, India",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Delhi; Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) - India; National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (NCMRWF),"Lodh, A (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol Delhi, Ctr Atmospher Sci, Hauz Khas, New Delhi 110016, India.;Lodh, A (corresponding author), Minist Earth Sci, Natl Ctr Medium Range Weather Forecasting, A-50,Sect 62, Noida 201309, India.",abhishek.lodh@gmail.com,"lodh, abhishek/AGR-2143-2022","Lodh, Abhishek/0000-0002-4951-0226",MHRD (Govt. of India),"MHRD (Govt. of India)(Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD), Government of India)","The authors acknowledge the central cloudcomputing facilities available at the Computer Services Centre and Centre for Atmospheric Sciences, IIT Delhi (AJAY-MERU computing facility) for the RCMsimulations.

This simulation is nested in a CCLM run at resolution of 0.44 degrees, driven with boundary forcing data from the ERA-Interim reanalysis, and covers the period from 1981 to 2010. The simulated temperature and precipitation are evaluated using three selected climate indices for temperature and eight indices for precipitation in five different regions against a new, daily precipitation climatology covering West Africa and against other state of the art climatologies. The obtained results indicate that CCLM is able to reproduce the observed major climate characteristics including the West African Monsoon within the range of comparable regional climate modeling evaluations studies, but substantial uncertainties remain, especially in the Sahel zone. The seasonal mean temperature bias for the rainy season from June to September ranges from -0.8 degrees C to -1.1 degrees C. The CCLM simulations also underestimate the observed precipitation with biases in precipitation reaching -10% in the high-resolution and -20% in the low-resolution model runs. CCLM extends the monsoon precipitation belt too far north, which results in an overestimation of precipitation in the Sahel zone of up to 60%. In the coastal zone, the precipitation is underestimated by up to -90%. These biases in precipitation amounts are associated with errors in the precipitation seasonality. The added value of the higher resolution of the nested run is reflected in a smaller bias in extreme precipitation statistics with respect to the reference data.","[Dieng, Diarra; Smiatek, Gerhard; Heinzeller, Dominikus; Kunstmann, Harald] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res IMK IFU, Garmisch Partenkirchen, Germany; [Dieng, Diarra; Bliefernicht, Jan; Heinzeller, Dominikus; Kunstmann, Harald] Univ Augsburg, Inst Geog, Augsburg, Germany; [Sarr, A.] Agence Natl Aviat Civile & Meteorol, Dakar, Senegal; [Gaye, A.

Thus, one may expect that their rapidly growing datasets could provide crucial insights not only for short-term weather processes/predictions but into ongoing and future climate change processes as well. Though Earth-observing satellites have been around for decades, extracting climatically reliable information from their widely varying datasets faces rather formidable challenges. AIRS/AMSU is a state of the art infrared/microwave sounding system that was launched on the EOS Aqua platform on May 4, 2002, and has been providing operational quality measurements since September 2002. In addition to temperature and atmospheric constituent profiles, outgoing longwave radiation [OLR] and basic cloud parameters are also derived from the AIRS/AMSU observations. However, so far the AIRS products have not been rigorously evaluated/validated on a large scale. Here we present preliminary assessments of climatically important Level3 (monthly and 8-day means, 1 degrees x 1 degrees gridded) AIRS Version 4.0 retrieved products (available to the public through the DAAC at NASA/GSFC) to assess their utility for climate studies. Though the current AIRS climatology covers only similar to 4.5 years, it will hopefully extend much further into the future. First we present consistency checks by evaluating the similar to 4.5-yr long time series of global and tropical means, as well as grid-scale variability and anomalies (relative to the first full years worth of AIRS climate statistics of several climatically important retrieved parameters). Finally, we also present preliminary results regarding interrelationships of some of these geophysical variables, to assess to what extent they are consistent with the known physics of climate variability/change. In particular, we find at least one observed relationship which contradicts current general circulation climate (GCM) model results: the global water vapor climate feedback which is expected to be strongly positive is deduced to be slightly negative (shades of the Lindzen effect?).","[Molnar, Gyula I.; Susskind, Joel] GEST UMBC, Code 613-5, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland Baltimore County,"Molnar, GI (corresponding author), GEST UMBC, Code 613-5, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA.",,,,,,,,7,1,1,0,0,SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING,BELLINGHAM,"1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010 USA",0277-786X,1996-756X,978-0-8194-6687-7,PROC SPIE,,,2007,,,,,,,65651I,10.1117/12.718466,http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.718466,,,12,Optics; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Optics; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,BGO62,,Green Submitted,,,12/21/22,WOS:000249044300050,View Full Record in Web of Science

A state-of-the-art Regional Climate Model (RCM) is subsequently employed to investigate four different 31-year time slices of extreme dry and wet spells, chosen according to changes in the driving data, in order to analyse the spatio-temporal evolution of the moisture variability in two different climatological epochs: Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) and Little Ice Age (LIA). There is a clear regime behavior and bimodality in the westerly Jet phase space throughout the past millennium in ACA. The results indicate that the regime changes during LIA show a moist ACA and a dry East China. During the MCA, the Kazakhstan region shows a stronger response to the westerly jet equatorward shift than during the LIA. The out-of-phase pattern of moisture changes between India and ACA exists during both the LIA and the MCA. However, the pattern is more pronounced during the LIA.","[Fallah, Bijan; Sodoudi, Sahar; Cubasch, Ulrich] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Meteorol, Carl Heinrich Becker Weg 6-10, D-12165 Berlin, Germany",Free University of Berlin,"Fallah, B (corresponding author), Free Univ Berlin, Inst Meteorol, Carl Heinrich Becker Weg 6-10, D-12165 Berlin, Germany.",bijanf@zedat.fu-berlin.de,"fallah, bijan/G-8270-2015; Sodoudi, Sahar/L-7534-2017","fallah, bijan/0000-0003-3302-2030; Sodoudi, Sahar/0000-0003-2571-2904; Cubasch, Ulrich/0000-0001-9628-4666",German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) research project Central Asian Climate Dynamics (CADY) as part of joint research program CAME Central Asia: Monsoon Dynamics and Geo-Ecosystems; DFG research group HIMPAC [FOR 1380]; German Climate Computing Center (DKRZ) through from the BMBF; German Research Foundation; Open-Access Publication Funds of the Freie Universitat Berlin,German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) research project Central Asian Climate Dynamics (CADY) as part of joint research program CAME Central Asia: Monsoon Dynamics and Geo-Ecosystems; DFG research group HIMPAC; German Climate Computing Center (DKRZ) through from the BMBF; German Research Foundation(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Open-Access Publication Funds of the Freie Universitat Berlin,"This research was supported and funded by German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) research project Central Asian Climate Dynamics (CADY) as part of the joint research program CAME Central Asia: Monsoon Dynamics and Geo-Ecosystems and the DFG research group FOR 1380 HIMPAC.

In that era, cities in Indonesia functioned as colonial cities. The city of Manado is one of the coastal cities, written in the Dutch Royal Act of 1814 as the territory of Dutch sovereignty, was amended in 1848, 1872 and 1922. Dutch colonial art and architecture in Indonesia are not only influenced by culture but also the climate. For the purpose of physical comfort in the tropical environments, architects began to use local building materials, since the early 19th century, and the building began to be replaced by a customizing architecture. Descriptive analysis was employed as the method in this study. The result found that the Dutch Colonial Architecture emphasized the physical aspects, the royal style adapted to local conditions, and the local building emphasis on function. The tropical climate of Manado City influences the shape of the building with Dutch colonial architectural style in this area. As climate change is shown by rising temperatures, further observations on the design of colonial architecture will be important.","[Kumurur, V.

This environment allowed to design and build a zero energy concept building (a detached single family house) on the basis of passive heating and cooling technologies, supported, when required, by short time active conditioning. The design process was optimized by extensive energy simulations, resulting in an optimal energy balance and favorable thermal comfort conditions along the year. The building is instrumented with an accurate building automation control system, and a number of sensors for a detailed energy and environmental monitoring.

This paper demonstrates how the visual research methodology, photovoice, was employed to elicit the values and concerns of three different groups about being 'at the water's edge' in times of uncertainty due to climate change. The project was undertaken within the environmental art event Floating Land, which explored the theme of climate change and rising sea levels on coastal and island communities. Photovoice draws out ideas communicated by participants' photos which are negotiated through group discussion and clarified with a caption. The aim of this process is to provide insights into shared values, with the goal of informing broader society and facilitating community change. In this project, each group collaboratively organised selected images into visual narratives which were presented to a wider audience. Through a comparison of the different group perspectives and an examination of the impact of the visual presentations, this paper examines some of the effects of communicating with images in this way. We argue that visual 'stories' formed from groupings of photographs provide persuasive, alternative forms of expressing and understanding shared perspectives of climate change.","[Chandler, Lisa] Univ Sunshine Coast, Reg & Urban Planning, Sunshine Coast, Qld, Australia; [Baldwin, Claudia] Univ Sunshine Coast, Art & Design, Sunshine Coast, Qld, Australia; [Baldwin, Claudia] Univ Gallery, Rochester, NY USA",University of the Sunshine Coast; University of the Sunshine Coast,"Chandler, L (corresponding author), Univ Sunshine Coast, Reg & Urban Planning, Sunshine Coast, Qld, Australia.",,", Claudia and Baldwin/G-6889-2019",", Claudia and Baldwin/0000-0002-0707-6564",,,,,22,1,1,0,0,SOCIAL ALTERNATIVES,MAROOCHYDORE DC,"UNIV SUNSHINE COAST, FAC ARTS & BUSINESS, MAROOCHYDORE DC, QLD 4556, AUSTRALIA",0155-0306,1836-6600,,SOC ALTERN,Soc.

We carried out reviews in ScienceDirect, Web of Science, and Scopus databases with the keywords dendrochronology, dendroclimatology, dendrochronology and climatic variability, dendroclimatology and climatic variability, dendrochronology and trend, and dendroclimatology and trend for each Latin American country. Results show that dendroclimatological research in the last 11 years has increased and has been mainly developed in temperate climate zones (83%) and tropical or subtropical areas (17%), where conifer species have been the most used with over 59% of the studies. However, broadleaf species for dendrochronological studies have also increased in the last decade. Dendroclimatological research in Latin America has provided important advances in the study of climatic variability by defining the response functions of tree-rings to climate and developing climatic reconstructions. Our research identified areas where it is necessary to increase dendroclimatic studies (e.g., dry and tropical forests), in addition to applying new techniques such as isotope analysis, blue intensity, dendrochemistry, among other tree-ring applications.","[David Sanchez-Calderon, Oscar; Mendoza, Manuel E.] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Ctr Invest Geog Ambiental, Antigua Carretera Patzcuaro 8701, Morelia 58190, Michoacan, Mexico; [Carlon-Allende, Teodoro] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, CONACYT Inst Geofis, Unidad Michoacan, Antigua Carretera Patzcuaro 8701, Morelia 58190, Michoacan, Mexico; [Villanueva-Diaz, Jose] Ctr Nacl Invest Disciplinaria Relac Agua Suelo, Inst Nacl Invest Forestales Agr & Pecuarias, Lab Dendrocronol, Km 6-5 Margen Derecha del Canal Sacramento, Gomez Palacio Cp 35140, Mexico",Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico,"Carlon-Allende, T (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, CONACYT Inst Geofis, Unidad Michoacan, Antigua Carretera Patzcuaro 8701, Morelia 58190, Michoacan, Mexico.",ocalderon@pmip.unam.mx; tcarlon@igeofisica.unam.mx; mmendoza@ciga.unam.mx; villanueva.jose@inifap.gob.mx,"Cantú, Manuel E.

In historical buildings over the time the building structure and usage can vary greatly. If a room offers good conditions, it will be used accordingly. The usage criteria are not limited to geometric and visual design features but also include thermal comfort. When determining the use of historical rooms and buildings, it makes sense to combine the results of the construction survey and literature research with a reconstruction of the indoor climate. Constructive adjustments, spatial extensions and social developments lead to a deviation from the originally planned and implemented situation over time. Which parameters have to be known in order to reconstruct the indoor climate of a historic building? This paper uses three examples to describe the requirements and procedure for determining the use of rooms that are no longer in their original state. The reconstructed spaces are an office in a former tobacco factory in Krems (Austria) [1], an art gallery in Yogyakarta (Indonesia) [2] and a traditional residential building is in Jeddah (Saudi Arabia) [3] Dynamic thermal and hygrothermal simulations of building elements show the ability of materials to influence the indoor climate and the interaction between construction and indoor climate. By monitoring or defining the user 's presence and activities in a room the thermal interaction between construction and indoor climate is calculated. The detection of the airflow around and through the building provides important parameters for the assessment of thermal indoor comfort. The results were compared with the use of space as described in the literature or expected from the building survey. The method of reconstructing the indoor climate in historical buildings works. The results provide information for evaluating the original situation. With these findings, the potential inherent in a building can be better exploited for the adaptation of historical buildings to changing user requirements or climatic conditions.","[Stumpf, Wolfgang] Donau Univ Krems, Dept Bldg & Environm, Dr Karl Dorrek Str 30, A-3500 Krems, Austria",Danube University Krems,"Stumpf, W (corresponding author), Donau Univ Krems, Dept Bldg & Environm, Dr Karl Dorrek Str 30, A-3500 Krems, Austria.",wolfgang.stumpf@donau-uni.ac.at,,,"ASEAN-European Academic University Network (ASEA-UNINET); Austrian Federal Ministry of Education, Science and Research; Austrian Agency for International Cooperation in Education and Research (OeAD-GmbH); Austrian Research Promotion Agency FFG, Austria","ASEAN-European Academic University Network (ASEA-UNINET); Austrian Federal Ministry of Education, Science and Research; Austrian Agency for International Cooperation in Education and Research (OeAD-GmbH); Austrian Research Promotion Agency FFG, Austria","Research reported in this publication about Gallery 1 in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, was jointly supported by the ASEAN-European Academic University Network (ASEA-UNINET), the Austrian Federal Ministry of Education, Science and Research and the Austrian Agency for International Cooperation in Education and Research (OeAD-GmbH).

A high-resolution, pan-Baltic application of the Hydrological Predictions for the Environment (HYPE) model was used to make transient simulations of discharge to the Baltic Sea for a mini-ensemble of climate projections representing two high emissions scenarios. The biases in precipitation and temperature adherent to climate models were adjusted using a Distribution Based Scaling (DBS) approach. As well as the climate projection uncertainty, this study considers uncertainties in the bias-correction and hydrological modelling. While the results indicate that the cumulative discharge to the Baltic Sea for 2071 to 2100, as compared to 1971 to 2000, is likely to increase, the uncertainties quantified from the hydrological model and the bias-correction method show that even with a state-of-the-art methodology, the combined uncertainties from the climate model, bias-correction and impact model make it difficult to draw conclusions about the magnitude of change. It is therefore urged that as well as climate model and scenario uncertainty, the uncertainties in the bias-correction methodology and the impact model are also taken into account when conducting climate change impact studies.","[Donnelly, Chantal; Yang, Wei; Dahne, Joel] Swedish Meteorol & Hydrol Inst, S-60176 Norrkoping, Sweden",Swedish Meteorological & Hydrological Institute,"Donnelly, C (corresponding author), Swedish Meteorol & Hydrol Inst, 1 Folkborgsvagen, S-60176 Norrkoping, Sweden.",Chantal.donnelly@gmail.com; wei.yang@smhi.se; joel.dahne@smhi.se,,"Donnelly, Chantal/0000-0002-0086-4453",BONUS program via the ECOSUPPORT project; European Union; Swedish Research Council,BONUS program via the ECOSUPPORT project; European Union(European Commission); Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research CouncilEuropean Commission),"The authors would like to acknowledge funding from the BONUS program via the ECOSUPPORT project, the GEOLAND2 project funded by the European Union's FP7 program, the Hydroimpacts2.0 project funded by the Swedish Research Council Formas and the assistance of Berit Arheimer, Johan Stromqvist, Johan Sodling and Jorgen Rosberg in the preparation of data and model setup, of Phil Graham and Markus Meier for discussions of previous results and Jafet Andersson and anonymous reviewers for their revisions of the manuscript.",,42,27,27,1,35,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

Assessment of the influence of these measures is essential for their implementation on a wider scale. In particular, functionality of the state of the art ventilation system is of large concern as these systems have not been commonly used for their sensitivity towards the extremely cold climate. A detailed monitoring system was installed in the house. It enables the evaluation of the indoor air quality, as well as building's energy performance. The aim of this investigation was to evaluate the performance of the newly constructed house by and compare it with the performance of identical house built in a traditional way by using a computer model. The data obtained from the measurements in the new house were used to verify the model. Significant energy savings and improvements of indoor air quality were found in the new house when compared to the traditional one.

For the patterned SST warming predicted by coupled GCMs, ECTEI can constrain the subtropical marine LCC feedback to -0.41 +/- 0.28% K-1 (90% CI), implying virtually certain positive feedback. ECTEI physically explains the heuristic model for LCC changes based on a linear combination of EIS and SST changes in previous studies in terms of cloud-top entrainment processes.","[Koshiro, Tsuyoshi; Kawai, Hideaki] Japan Meteorol Agcy, Meteorol Res Inst, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050052, Japan; [Noda, Akira T.] Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, Res Inst Global Change, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2360001, Japan",Japan Meteorological Agency; Meteorological Research Institute - Japan; Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science & Technology (JAMSTEC),"Koshiro, T (corresponding author), Japan Meteorol Agcy, Meteorol Res Inst, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050052, Japan.",tkoshiro@mri-jma.go.jp,"Koshiro, Tsuyoshi/AGL-8595-2022","Koshiro, Tsuyoshi/0000-0003-2971-7446","Integrated Research Program for Advancing Climate Models (TOUGOU) from the Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology [JPMXD0717935457, JPMXD0717935561]; Environment Research and Technology Development Fund of the Environmental Restoration and Conservation Agency of Japan [JPMEERF20202003]; Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science KAKENHI [JP18H03363, JP19K03977, JP19H05699]","Integrated Research Program for Advancing Climate Models (TOUGOU) from the Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology; Environment Research and Technology Development Fund of the Environmental Restoration and Conservation Agency of Japan; Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","We thank two anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments.

Deep cores retrieved from ice sheets have helped us recognise how climate has changed over hundreds of thousands of years, and, for many parts of the Earth's surface, an understanding of landforms, drainage patterns and surface geology would be impossible without an understanding of glacial processes. Today, the role of glaciers in the media and in the popular imagination is dominated by their role in science as indicators of environmental change. However, it is barely a hundred and fifty years since the significance of glaciers in this context was first appreciated. Before the middle of the nineteenth century glaciers occupied a different niche in popular perception, ruled by their place in the artistic and cultural domain rather than the scientific. Changing technologies for observing and analysing glacial phenomena have impacted on both scientific and cultural perceptions of glaciers, and our understanding is still constrained by technological limitations. Despite progress in remote sensing and analytical techniques, our reconstructions of past glaciations remain tentative, our understanding of modern glacial processes incomplete and our modelling of their future unreliable. In nineteenth century art, glaciers represented romance, mystery and unassailable majesty. In twenty-first century science their position is perhaps similar, but what art calls 'mystery', science calls 'uncertainty'.","Univ Keele, Sch Earth Sci & Geog, Keele ST5 5BG, Staffs, England",Keele University,"Knight, PG (corresponding author), Univ Keele, Sch Earth Sci & Geog, Keele ST5 5BG, Staffs, England.",p.g.knight@esci.keele.ac.uk,,"Knight, Peter/0000-0003-3259-7190",,,,,13,5,5,0,5,MANEY PUBLISHING,LEEDS,"HUDSON RD, LEEDS LS9 7DL, ENGLAND",0308-0188,,,INTERDISCIPL SCI REV,Interdiscip.

These models demonstrate similar climate fidelity as the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory's previous Climate Model version 2.1 (CM2.1) while incorporating explicit and consistent carbon dynamics. The two models differ exclusively in the physical ocean component; ESM2M uses Modular Ocean Model version 4p1 with vertical pressure layers while ESM2G uses Generalized Ocean Layer Dynamics with a bulk mixed layer and interior isopycnal layers. Differences in the ocean mean state include the thermocline depth being relatively deep in ESM2M and relatively shallow in ESM2G compared to observations. The crucial role of ocean dynamics on climate variability is highlighted in El Nino-Southern Oscillation being overly strong in ESM2M and overly weak in ESM2G relative to observations. Thus, while ESM2G might better represent climate changes relating to total heat content variability given its lack of long-term drift, gyre circulation, and ventilation in the North Pacific, tropical Atlantic, and Indian Oceans, and depth structure in the overturning and abyssal flows, ESM2M might better represent climate changes relating to surface circulation given its superior surface temperature, salinity, and height patterns, tropical Pacific circulation and variability, and Southern Ocean dynamics. The overall assessment is that neither model is fundamentally superior to the other, and that both models achieve sufficient fidelity to allow meaningful climate and earth system modeling applications. This affords the ability to assess the role of ocean configuration on earth system interactions in the context of two state-of-the-art coupled carbon-climate models.","[Dunne, John P.; John, Jasmin G.; Griffies, Stephen M.; Hallberg, Robert W.; Stouffer, Ronald J.; Dunne, Krista A.; Harrison, Matthew J.; Krasting, John P.; Milly, P.

The CGCM consists of the University of California, Los Angeles, Atmospheric GCM (UCLA AGCM) and an ECCO ocean configuration of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology GCM (MITgcm). The forecasts correspond to ensemble seasonal hindcasts for the period 1993-2001. For the forecasts, the ocean component of the CGCM is initialized in either early March or in early June using ocean states provided either by an unconstrained forward ocean integration of the MITgcm (the baseline hindcasts) or by data-constrained ECCO results (the ECCO hindcasts). Forecast skill for both the baseline and the ECCO hindcasts is significantly higher than persistence and compares well with the skill of other state-of-the art CGCM forecast systems. For March initial conditions, the standard errors of sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in ECCO hindcasts (relative to observed anomalies) are up to 1 C smaller than in the baseline hindcasts over the central and eastern equatorial Pacific (150 degrees-120 degrees W). For June initial conditions, the errors of ECCO hindcasts are up to 0.5 degrees C smaller than in the baseline hindcasts. The smaller standard error of the ECCO hindcasts is, in part, due to a more realistic equatorial thermocline structure of the ECCO initial conditions. This study confirms the value of physically consistent ocean-state estimation for the initialization of seasonal climate forecasts.","[Cazes-Boezio, Gabriel] Univ Uruguay, Sch Engn, IMFIA, Inst Fluid Mechan & Environm Engn, Montevideo 11300, Uruguay; [Cazes-Boezio, Gabriel; Mechoso, Carlos R.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Menemenlis, Dimitris] CALTECH, Jet Propuls Lab, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA","Universidad de la Republica, Uruguay; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; California Institute of Technology; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)","Cazes-Boezio, G (corresponding author), Univ Uruguay, Sch Engn, IMFIA, Inst Fluid Mechan & Environm Engn, Julio Herrera & Reissig 565, Montevideo 11300, Uruguay.",agcm@fing.edu.uy,"Menemenlis, Dimitris/G-8091-2017",,,,,,56,15,16,0,6,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0894-8755,1520-0442,,J CLIMATE,J.

It is widely accepted that noise due to internal atmospheric dynamics at the air-sea interface influences predictability. The purpose of this paper is to use the interactive ensemble (IE) coupling strategy to quantify how internal atmospheric noise at the air-sea interface impacts decadal predictability. The IE technique can significantly reduce internal atmospheric noise and has proven useful in assessing seasonal-to-interannual variability and predictability. Here we focus on decadal timescales and apply the nonlinear local Lyapunov exponent method to the Community Climate System Model comparing control simulations with IE simulations. This is the first time the nonlinear local Lyapunov exponent has been applied to the state-of-the-art coupled models. The global patterns of decadal predictability are discussed from the perspective of internal atmospheric noise and ocean dynamics.","[Zhang, Wei; Kirtman, Ben] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, 4600 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA",University of Miami,"Kirtman, B (corresponding author), Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, 4600 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA.",bkirtman@rsmas.miami.edu,,"Zhang, Wei/0000-0001-7179-5697","NSF [AGS1558837, OCE1419569, OCE1559151]; DOE [DE-SC0019433]",NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); DOE(United States Department of Energy (DOE)),"The authors acknowledge support from NSF AGS1558837, OCE1419569, and OCE1559151 and DOE DE-SC0019433.

Effects of climate change will affect the ambient temperature and humidity, which may induce a direct effect on air quality. In light of this, feed forward artificial neural network was employed to simulate the dynamic variations of PM10 and O-3 with relative humidity, temperature, and windspeed data being the inputs under 12 different training algorithms. Based on the results obtained, Bayesian regularization with 12 hidden neurons is the optimized network structure, with mean absolute percentage error in testing dataset of O-3 and PM10 at 51.31% and 36.49%, respectively. The models performed better in O-3 prediction as it is a photochemical reaction where ozone concentration varies according to temperature, the effect of meteorological parameters is significant.

However, examining climate change and society as a historical narrative drawing upon politics, economics, and settlement patterns does not provide a direct link between climate and society. Given that most inhabitants of the premodern world engaged in agriculture and/or pastoralism, examining chronological correlations between climate and foodways, not as a historical narrative but as a longterm socioenvironmental process, has the potential to identify direct societal adaptations to a changing environment. From South Greece there is evidence for drier conditions at the end of the Late Bronze Age. Is the disappearance of writing, art, and many known settlements at the end of the Bronze Age an example of collapse in the face of inability to adapt to climate change? This is a difficult question to answer given the coarse resolution of many of our archaeological and climatic datasets. Settlement faunal records suggest that food production systems became increasingly homogenous in Late Bronze Age Greece, potentially due to an elite control over various production systems that promoted intensification of certain products. However, in the first millennium B.C.E., animal husbandry, specifically, and food production systems, more broadly, became more heterogenous, and a proportional increase in goats in areas with less rainfall was likely an adaptive response to the drier climate. This paper examines the adaptive relationship between foodways and climate and argues for a process driven approach when explaining social responses to ancient climate change.","[Dibble, Flint] Dartmouth Coll, Dept Class, HB 6086,Reed Hall,15 Coll St,Room 207, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Dibble, Flint] Amer Sch Class Studies Athens, Malcolm H Wiener Lab Archaeol Sci, 54 Souidias St, GR-10676 Athens, Greece; [Finne, Martin] Uppsala Univ, Dept Archaeol & Ancient Hist, Box 626, S-75126 Uppsala, Sweden",Dartmouth College; Uppsala University,"Dibble, F (corresponding author), Dartmouth Coll, Dept Class, HB 6086,Reed Hall,15 Coll St,Room 207, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.",wfdibble@gmail.com,,"Dibble, Flint/0000-0001-6693-2888","Swedish Research Council [421-2014-1181, 201902868]; American School of Classical Studies at Athens, Malcolm H.

LocationSouthern and central Sweden, SW and SE Finland. MethodsHolocene regional plant abundances were reconstructed using the REVEALS model on selected fossil pollen records from lakes. The relative importance of climate, fires and human population size on changes in vegetation composition was assessed using variation partitioning. Past climate variable was derived from the LOVECLIM climate model. Fire variable was reconstructed from sedimentary charcoal records. Estimated trend in human population size was based on the temporal distribution of archaeological radiocarbon dates. ResultsClimate explains the highest proportion of variation in vegetation composition during the whole study period in Sweden (10,000-4,000cal yr BP) and in Finland (10,000-1,000cal yr BP), and during the pre-agricultural period. In general, fires explain a relatively low proportion of variation. Human population size has significant effect on vegetation dynamics after the onset of farming and explains the highest variation in vegetation in S Sweden and SW Finland. ConclusionsMesolithic hunter-gatherer populations did not significantly affect vegetation composition in Fennoscandia, and climate was the main driver of changes at that time. Agricultural communities, however, had greater effect on vegetation dynamics, and the role of human population size became a more important factor during the late Holocene. Our results demonstrate that climate can be considered the main driver of long-term vegetation dynamics in Fennoscandia. However, in some regions the influence of human population size on Holocene vegetation changes exceeded that of climate and has a longevity dating to the early Neolithic.","[Kuosmanen, Niina] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Dept Forest Ecol, Fac Forestry & Wood Sci, Prague 6, Czech Republic; [Kuosmanen, Niina; Tallavaara, Miikka; Zhang, Yurui; Seppa, Heikki] Univ Helsinki, Dept Geosci & Geog, Helsinki, Finland; [Marquer, Laurent; Molinari, Chiara] Lund Univ, Dept Phys Geog & Ecosyst Sci, Lund, Sweden; [Marquer, Laurent] Univ Toulouse Jean Jaures, GEODE, UMR CNRS 5602, Toulouse, France; [Zhang, Yurui; Renssen, Hans] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Earth Sci, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Alenius, Teija] Univ Helsinki, Dept Philosophy Hist Culture & Art Studies Archae, Helsinki, Finland; [Edinborough, Kevan] UCL, Inst Archaeol, London, England; [Pesonen, Petro] Natl Board Antiqu, Archaeol Field Serv, Helsinki, Finland; [Reitalu, Triin] Tallinn Univ Technol, Inst Geol, Tallinn, Estonia; [Renssen, Hans] Univ Coll Southeast Norway, Dept Nat Sci & Environm Studies, Telemark, Norway; [Trondman, Anna-Kari] Linnaeus Univ, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, Kalmar, Sweden",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague; University of Helsinki; Lund University; Universite de Toulouse; Universite de Toulouse - Jean Jaures; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; University of Helsinki; University of London; University College London; Tallinn University of Technology; University College of Southeast Norway; Linnaeus University,"Kuosmanen, N (corresponding author), Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Dept Forest Ecol, Fac Forestry & Wood Sci, Prague 6, Czech Republic.",kuosmanen.niina@gmail.com,"Reitalu, Triin/AAH-4302-2020; Edinborough, Kevan/ABE-9343-2021; Molinari, Chiara/N-1036-2016; Alenius, Teija Helena/AAS-1906-2021","Reitalu, Triin/0000-0002-6555-3066; Edinborough, Kevan/0000-0002-7668-0749; Molinari, Chiara/0000-0001-5813-2637; Alenius, Teija Helena/0000-0003-2965-5177; Tallavaara, Miikka/0000-0001-9252-7309; MARQUER, LAURENT/0000-0002-5772-3782; Seppa, Heikki/0000-0003-2494-7955",PEDECO; Czech Science Foundation (GACR); EBOR; Academy of Finland; Division Of Earth Sciences [1440015] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,PEDECO; Czech Science Foundation (GACR)(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic); EBOR; Academy of Finland(Academy of Finland); Division Of Earth Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)),PEDECO; Czech Science Foundation (GACR); EBOR; Academy of Finland,,60,18,18,4,32,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1100-9233,1654-1103,,J VEG SCI,J.

Competing hypotheses relate this cooling, identified as a driver of the global warming hiatus(1,2), to the warming trends in either the Atlantic(3,4) or Indian Ocean(5). However, the mechanisms, the relative importance and the interactions between these teleconnections remain unclear. Using a state-of-the-art climate model, we show that the Atlantic plays a key role in initiating the tropical-wide teleconnection, and the Atlantic-induced anomalies contribute similar to 55-75% of the tropical SST and circulation changes during the satellite era. The Atlantic warming drives easterly wind anomalies over the Indo-western Pacific as Kelvin waves and westerly anomalies over the eastern Pacific as Rossby waves. The wind changes induce an Indo-western Pacific warming through the wind-evaporation-SST effect(6,7), and this warming intensifies the La Nina-type response in the tropical Pacific by enhancing the easterly trade winds and through the Bjerknes ocean dynamical processes(8). The teleconnection develops into a tropical-wide SST dipole pattern. This mechanism, supported by observations and a hierarchy of climate models, reveals that the tropical ocean basins are more tightly connected than previously thought.","[Li, Xichen; Xie, Shang-Ping; Gille, Sarah T.] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Yoo, Changhyun] Ewha Womans Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci & Engn, Seoul 03760, South Korea",University of California System; University of California San Diego; Scripps Institution of Oceanography; Ewha Womans University,"Li, XC; Xie, SP (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",xichenslc@gmail.com; sxie@ucsd.edu,"Gille, Sarah T./B-3171-2012; Xie, Shang-Ping/C-1254-2009","Xie, Shang-Ping/0000-0002-3676-1325; Gille, Sarah/0000-0001-9144-4368; Li, Xichen/0000-0001-6325-6626","Scripps Postdoctoral Fellowship; NSF [AGS 1305719, OCE-1234473]; Korea Meteorological Administration Research and Development Program [KMIPA 2015-6110]; Div Atmospheric & Geospace Sciences [1305719] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",Scripps Postdoctoral Fellowship; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Korea Meteorological Administration Research and Development Program(Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA)); Div Atmospheric & Geospace Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)),"X.L. was supported by the Scripps Postdoctoral Fellowship; S.-P.X. was supported by the NSF grant AGS 1305719; S.T.G. was supported by the NSF grant OCE-1234473.

Here, using ensemble projections from state-of-the-art habitat suitability modelling techniques, we investigated how climate change and associated changes in host availability may affect the persistence of three pairs of closely related Neocrepidodera taxa. Modelled niches and suitability patterns reflected the current distributions of the targeted taxa. Neocrepidodera ligurica occupies a small portion of the broader environmental niche of N. melanostoma, and its narrow geographical range makes this species particularly vulnerable to potential loss of suitable habitats in Western Alps. Neocrepidodera cyanescens cyanescens and N. cyanescens concolor were found to occupy separate niches, but the non-significance of the niche similarity test suggested their divergence being probably due to allopatric processes. Neocrepidodera corpulenta and N. rhaetica showed partially overlapping niches, coherently with their co-occurrence in Western Alps. Most of the targeted taxa were predicted to potentially lose large portions of currently suitable areas in the forthcoming decades. Notwithstanding the candidate host plants did not emerge as most important predictors, except Aconitum lycoctonum for N. cyanescens concolor, a clear reduction of potential insect-plant co-occurrence areas resulted for most future scenarios. Climate was confirmed to noticeably affect the distribution of the targeted taxa, among which N. ligurica, N. cyanescens concolor, N. corpulenta and N. rhaetica may need specific prioritisation measures in the future decades, claiming for further attention on mountainous entomofauna in a warming world.","[Cerasoli, Francesco; D'Alessandro, Paola; Biondi, Maurizio] Univ Aquila, Dept Life Hlth & Environm Sci, Via Vetoio Snc Coppito, I-67100 Laquila, Italy; [Thuiller, Wilfried; Gueguen, Maya; Renaud, Julien] Univ Grenoble Alpes, Univ Savoie Mt Blanc, Lab Ecol Alpine LECA, CNRS, Grenoble, France",University of L'Aquila; UDICE-French Research Universities; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Savoie,"Cerasoli, F (corresponding author), Univ Aquila, Dept Life Hlth & Environm Sci, Via Vetoio Snc Coppito, I-67100 Laquila, Italy.",francesco.cerasoli@univaq.it,"Cerasoli, Francesco/AAK-5504-2021; Thuiller, Wilfried/G-3283-2010","Cerasoli, Francesco/0000-0002-9712-9147; Thuiller, Wilfried/0000-0002-5388-5274; Renaud, Julien/0000-0001-5991-4657; Gueguen, Maya/0000-0002-1045-2997",,,,,84,18,19,2,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1752-458X,1752-4598,,INSECT CONSERV DIVER,Insect.

In this study, we conducted high-resolution urban climate simulations in Beijing and investigated the relationship between their performances and urban canopy parameters (UCPs). The latest version of single-layer (UCM) and multi-layer (BEP) urban canopy models were tested separately. Results show that model performances are insensitive to rainfall events in summer, but change significantly with wind conditions in winter. Inclusion of UCPs has a limited impact on air temperature simulations. In terms of wind speed simulations, consistent overestimations by UCM and BEP are found in both summer and winter. The overestimation by BEP reduces significantly when UCPs are available, especially on windy days in winter. On the other hand, performance of UCM can degrade over urban areas with canopy parameters. Wind speed biases are found to correlate significantly with UCPs. The accuracy of wind speed simulations by UCM and BEP increases with urban fraction and building surface ratio. This indicates poor model performances over low-density urban areas, which requires enhanced aerodynamic parameterizations to better account for UCPs. This study reveals the limitation of current urban climate simulations and provides guidance for future model developments.","[Yu, Miao] Chinese Acad Meteorol Sci, State Key Lab Severe Weather, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Chen, Xuan] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, State Key Lab Numer Modelling Atmospher Sci & Geo, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Chen, Xuan; Yang, Jiachuan] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Miao, Shiguang] China Meteorol Adm, Inst Urban Meteorol, Beijing, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences (CAMS); Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; Hong Kong University of Science & Technology; China Meteorological Administration","Yang, JC (corresponding author), Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",cejcyang@ust.hk,"Jiachuan, Yang/ABE-5045-2020","yang, jiachuan/0000-0002-3890-5628",Hong Kong Research Grants Council [16204220],Hong Kong Research Grants Council(Hong Kong Research Grants Council),"This work was supported by the Hong Kong Research Grants Council funded project 16204220.

It is therefore important that our current state-of-the-art climate models are able to realistically represent these features, in order that we can have confidence in how they are projected to change in a warming climate. Despite the observation that these cyclones are extremely variable in their structure and features, there have, over the years, been numerous attempts to classify or group them. Such classifications can provide insight into the different cloud structures, airflows, and dynamical forcing mechanisms within the different cyclone types. This review collects and details as many classification techniques as possible, and may therefore act as a reference guide to classifications. These classifications offer the opportunity to improve the way extratropical cyclone evaluation in climate models is currently done by giving more insight into the dynamical and physical processes that occur in climate models (rather than just evaluating the mean state over a broad region as is often done). Examples of where these ideas have been used, or could be used, are reviewed. Finally, the potential impacts of future climate changes on extratropical cyclones are detailed. The ways in which the classification techniques could improve our understanding of future changes in extratropical cyclones and their impacts are given.","[Catto, J.

To answer the question for southeastern Australia, where fires were particularly severe, affecting people and ecosystems, we use a physically based index of fire weather, the Fire Weather Index; long-term observations of heat and drought; and 11 large ensembles of state-of-the-art climate models. We find large trends in the Fire Weather Index in the fifth-generation European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Atmospheric Reanalysis (ERA5) since 1979 and a smaller but significant increase by at least 30% in the models. Therefore, we find that climate change has induced a higher weather-induced risk of such an extreme fire season. This trend is mainly driven by the increase of temperature extremes. In agreement with previous analyses we find that heat extremes have become more likely by at least a factor of 2 due to the long-term warming trend. However, current climate models overestimate variability and tend to underestimate the long-term trend in these extremes, so the true change in the like-lihood of extreme heat could be larger, suggesting that the attribution of the increased fire weather risk is a conservative estimate. We do not find an attributable trend in either extreme annual drought or the driest month of the fire season, September-February. The observations, however, show a weak drying trend in the annual mean. For the 2019/20 season more than half of the July-December drought was driven by record excursions of the Indian Ocean Dipole and Southern Annular Mode, factors which are included in the analysis here. The study reveals the complexity of the 2019/20 bushfire event, with some but not all drivers showing an imprint of anthropogenic climate change. Finally, the study concludes with a qualitative review of various vulnerability and expo- sure factors that each play a role, along with the hazard in increasing or decreasing the overall impact of the bushfires.","[van Oldenborgh, Geert Jan; Krikken, Folmer; van Weele, Michiel; Philip, Sjoukje Y.] Royal Netherlands Meteorol Inst KNMI, De Bilt, Netherlands; [Lewis, Sophie] Univ New South Wales, Sch Sci, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Leach, Nicholas J.] Univ Oxford, Dept Phys, Atmospher Ocean & Planetary Phys, Oxford, England; [Lehner, Flavio] Cornell Univ, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Ithaca, NY USA; [Lehner, Flavio] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Climate & Global Dynam Lab, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [Lehner, Flavio] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, Zurich, Switzerland; [Saunders, Kate R.] Delft Univ Technol, Delft Inst Appl Math, Delft, Netherlands; [Haustein, Karsten; Li, Sihan; Otto, Friederike E.

The review is focused first on the climatological features, variability, and trends in the past half century and then on simulations and projections based on global and regional climate models. As the annual mean surface air temperature (SAT) increased throughout China, heat wave intensity and frequency overall increased in the past half century, with a large rate after the 1980s. The daily or yearly minimum SAT increased more significantly than the mean or maximum SAT. The long-term change in precipitation is predominantly characterized by the so-called southern flood and northern drought pattern in eastern China and by the overall increase over Northwest China. The interdecadal variation of monsoon, represented by the monsoon weakening in the end of 1970s, is largely responsible for this change in mean precipitation. Precipitation-related extreme events (e.g., heavy rainfall and intense snowfall) have become more frequent and intense generally over China in the recent years, with large spatial features. Dust weather activity, however, has become less frequent over northern China in the recent years, as result of weakened cold surge activity, reinforced precipitation, and improved vegetation condition. State-of-the-art climate models are capable of reproducing some features of the mean climate and extreme climate events. However, discrepancies among models in simulating and projecting the mean and extreme climate are also demonstrated by many recent studies. Regional models with higher resolutions often perform better than global models. To predict and project climate variations and extremes, many new approaches and schemes based on dynamical models, statistical methods, or their combinations have been developed, resulting in improved skills. With the improvements of climate model capability and resolution as well as our understanding of regional climate variability and extremes, these new approaches and techniques are expected to further improve the prediction and projection on regional climate variability and extremes over China in the future.","[Wang, Hui-Jun] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS","Wang, HJ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.",wanghj@mail.iap.ac.cn,"Huopo, Chen/B-7771-2013; Yang, Song/B-4952-2009; Fan, K/GXH-3734-2022; Fan, Ke/AAJ-2315-2020; Jiang, Dabang/I-2243-2014; Sun, Jianqi/A-7084-2016","Huopo, Chen/0000-0003-0760-8353; Sun, Jianqi/0000-0002-3879-6986",Major State Basic Research Development Program of China (973 Program) [2009CB421406]; Chinese Academy of Sciences [KZCX2-YW-Q1-02]; Special Fund for Public Welfare Industry (Meteorology) [GYHY200906018]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [40821092],Major State Basic Research Development Program of China (973 Program)(National Basic Research Program of China); Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); Special Fund for Public Welfare Industry (Meteorology); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This research was supported by the Major State Basic Research Development Program of China (973 Program) under Grant No. 2009CB421406, the Chinese Academy of Sciences under Grant KZCX2-YW-Q1-02, Special Fund for Public Welfare Industry (Meteorology) (GYHY200906018), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 40821092.",,256,202,234,10,258,E SCHWEIZERBARTSCHE VERLAGSBUCHHANDLUNG,STUTTGART,"NAEGELE U OBERMILLER, SCIENCE PUBLISHERS, JOHANNESSTRASSE 3A, D 70176 STUTTGART, GERMANY",0941-2948,1610-1227,,METEOROL Z,Meteorol.

We first consider the extent to which simulations of twentieth century climate from nine atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs) are able to reproduce observed changes in these indicators. We then evaluate projected future trends in primary climate characteristics and indicators of change, including seasonal temperatures, rainfall and drought, snow cover, soil moisture, streamflow, and changes in biometeorological indicators that depend on threshold or accumulated temperatures such as growing season, frost days, and Spring Indices (SI). Changes in indicators for which temperature-related signals have already been observed (seasonal warming patterns, advances in high-spring streamflow, decreases in snow depth, extended growing seasons, earlier bloom dates) are generally reproduced by past model simulations and are projected to continue in the future. Other indicators for which trends have not yet been observed also show projected future changes consistent with a warmer climate (shrinking snow cover, more frequent droughts, and extended low-flow periods in summer). The magnitude of temperature-driven trends in the future are generally projected to be higher under the Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) mid-high (A2) and higher (A1FI) emissions scenarios than under the lower (B1) scenario. These results provide confidence regarding the direction of many regional climate trends, and highlight the fundamental role of future emissions in determining the potential magnitude of changes we can expect over the coming century.","Texas Tech Univ, Dept Geosci, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA; Univ New Hampshire, Inst Study Eart Oceans & Space, Durham, NH 03824 USA; US Geol Survey, Augusta, GA USA; Princeton Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; Univ Wisconsin, Dept Geog, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA; Boston Univ, Dept Geog & Environm, Boston, MA 02215 USA; Univ Massachusetts, Dept Geosci, Climate Syst Res Ctr, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; Cornell Univ, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, NE Reg Climate Ctr, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; Cornell Univ, Dept Hort, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University; University System Of New Hampshire; University of New Hampshire; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; Princeton University; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Milwaukee; Boston University; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; Cornell University; Cornell University,"Hayhoe, K (corresponding author), Texas Tech Univ, Dept Geosci, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA.",katharine.hayhoe@ttu.edu,"Luo, Lifeng/C-8734-2009; Wake, Cameron/G-8114-2014; Sheffield, Justin/A-6388-2008; Thompson, Renee L/A-9675-2012","Luo, Lifeng/0000-0002-2829-7104; Wake, Cameron/0000-0002-5961-5902; Wood, Eric/0000-0001-7037-9675; Sheffield, Justin/0000-0003-2400-0630; Troy, Tara/0000-0001-5366-0633; Huntington, Thomas/0000-0002-9427-3530",,,,,88,608,620,6,204,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0930-7575,1432-0894,,CLIM DYNAM,Clim.

The utilization of motor vehicles has been expanding day by day due to the intensive raise of the population. Many studies have illustrated that the peak levels of vehicular pollutants contribute to air pollution. On-road motor vehicles such as cars, bikes and trucks are the major source of emissions. The emissions such as chlorofluoro carbons which are introduced into the atmosphere due to different human activities leads to depletion of ozone layer which directly or indirectly effects the climate. Due to these increased emissions the global environment is facing immeasurable changes which can impact the climate as well as the human health. Air quality is one of the leading troubles in our society and there are numerous factors that effect the quality of air and one of them is Vehicular emission. This paper mainly focuses on how vehicular emissions contribute to climate change from a study made through different literature papers. The parameters and the methodologies that influence the environmental change as well as the human health were extracted from the literature survey and are discussed in this paper. The connection between the air quality and the climate change is also mentioned, since the greenhouse gases influences the quality of air and leads to the ozone depletion. Through this study, one can identify the causes of vehicular emissions towards climate change and there by effecting the human health. The main motive of this research is to present a structured analysis of various causes as well as impacts of vehicular pollution on the environment and climate with the help of the available literature. The study concludes that, the reduction of vehicular pollution is not only favourable for cities but also important for improving the global climate change. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

The climate classification is based on seasonal cycles of monthly-mean temperature and precipitation, and it divides Europe and its adjacent land areas into tundra, boreal, temperate, and dry climate types. Projections of future changes in the climatic zones were composed using multimodel mean projections based on simulations performed with 19 global climate models. The projections imply that, depending on the greenhouse gas scenarios, about half or possibly even two-thirds of the study domain will be affected by shifts toward a warmer or drier climate type during this century. The projected changes within the next few decades are chiefly located near regions where shifts in the borders of the zones have already occurred during the period 1950-2006. The questionnaire survey indicated that the information regarding the shifting climatic zones as disseminated by the maps was generally interpreted correctly, with the average percentage of correct answers being 86%.

The failure to represent two major warm sea surface temperature events occurring around 1963 and 1968 largely contributes to this poor skill. The magnitude of these events competes with the largest observed temperature anomalies in the twenty-first century that might be associated with the long-term warming. Understanding the causes of these major warm events is thus of primary concern to improve prediction of North Pacific, North American and Asian climate. The 1963 warm event stemmed from the propagation of a warm ocean heat content anomaly along the Kuroshio-Oyashio extension. The 1968 warm event originated from the upward transfer of a warm water mass centered at 200 m depth. For being associated with long-lived ocean heat content anomalies, we expect those events to be, at least partially, predictable. Biases in ocean mixing processes present in many climate prediction models seem to explain the inability to predict these two major events. Such currently unpredictable warm events, if occurring again in the next decade, would substantially enhance the effect of long-term warming in the region.","[Guemas, V.; Doblas-Reyes, F.

Building energy use currently accounts for over 40% of total primary energy consumption in the U.S. and E.U. Nevertheless, significant energy savings can be achieved in buildings if they are properly designed, constructed and operated. For this reason, building energy efficiency can provide key solutions to energy shortages, carbon emissions and their serious threat to our living environment. This paper offers a brief overview of building energy-consumption situations, relevant energy-saving approaches, and the influence of global climate change. Building energy-consumption situations based on data derived from international energy reports are initially compared between the U.S., China and the E.U. Both similarities and differences are found in aspects of building energy end-uses and final energy fuel-types among these top three building energy consumers. We then introduce the current concept of the zero-energy building (ZEB). State-of-the-art approaches for ZEB technologies are summarized in three categories: passive energy-saving technologies, energy-efficient building service systems and renewable energy production technologies. The feasibility of these technologies is reviewed. In addition, we briefly discuss the influence of global climate change on the evolution of building energy use in the future. We find that climate change significantly impacts building energy performance, particularly in space heating and cooling. Improvements on building envelope and ventilation can play an important role in reducing space heating and cooling consumption levels. We also provide some suggestions for further developing ZEBs.

This review traces the historical contributions of geographical scholarship to the study of climate in two primary areas: statistical, descriptive climatology and research in climate and society. It draws out the specifically geographical nature of climatological work in the 20th century, looking at the role of maps, classifications, and historical statistics in describing and potentially explaining climatic cycles, patterns, and processes. Geographers were keen to demonstrate the broader linkages between climate and the physical environment and humankind, such that applications of climatological expertise were crucial to economic development, imperialism and local scales, particularly the urban scale. This led geographers into insightful interdisciplinary applications, but also rather more awkward themes such as climatic determinism. The review draws out both the positive and negative aspects of geography's contribution to understandings of climate.

Most models perform well in simulating both the global and the Northern Hemispheric mean SAT evolutions of the twentieth century. The inclusion of natural forcings improves the simulation, in particular for the first half of the century. The reproducibility of the SAT averaged over China is lower than that of the global and hemispheric averages, but it is still acceptable. The contribution of natural forcings to the SAT over China in the first half of the century is not as robust as that to the global and hemispheric averages. No model could successfully produce the reconstructed warming over China in the 1920s. The prescribed natural and anthropogenic forcings in the coupled climate models mainly produce the warming trends and the decadal- to interdecadal-scale SAT variations with poor performances at shorter time scales. The prominent warming trend in the last half of the century over China and its acceleration in recent decades are weakly simulated. There are discrepancies between the simulated and observed regional features of the SAT trend over China. Few models could produce the summertime cooling over the middle part of eastern China (27 degrees - 36 degrees N), while two models acceptably produce the meridional gradients of the wintertime warming trends, with north China experiencing larger warming. Limitations of the current state-of-the-art coupled climate models in simulating spatial patterns of the twentieth-century SAT over China cast a shadow upon their capability toward projecting credible geographical distributions of future climate change through Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) scenario simulations.","Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, LASG, State Key Lab Numer Modeling Atmospher Sci & Geop, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS","Zhou, TJ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, LASG, State Key Lab Numer Modeling Atmospher Sci & Geop, POB 9804, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.",zhoutj@lasg.iap.ac.cn,"ZHOU, Tianjun/C-3195-2012","ZHOU, Tianjun/0000-0002-5829-7279",,,,,45,264,407,2,69,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0894-8755,1520-0442,,J CLIMATE,J.

Rapid evolution of physiological traits in response to novel thermal environments has rarely been demonstrated in natural populations. 2. We studied the temperature dependence [thermal performance curves (TPCs)] of larval feeding rate for two populations each of Colias eurytheme and Colias eriphyle in North America that occur over a range of elevations and climates. Using historical data for two of the populations, we assessed changes over time in both air temperatures and TPCs for larval feeding. 3. Populations at lower elevations with longer growing seasons had broader TPCs for larval feeding. In contrast, higher elevation populations with shorter growing seasons had higher optimal and maximal temperatures for feeding. 4. Overall mean air temperatures during the growing season showed little change at the two sites, but the frequency of high air temperatures (> 28 degrees C) has increased markedly at both sites over the past 40 years. This climatic shift was associated with increased rates of larval feeding at higher temperatures (> 28 degrees C) in both populations. 5. These results suggest that recent climate warming has led to physiological shifts in the TPCs for larval feeding in this system, indicating that thermal adaptation can occur rapidly in response to changing thermal conditions.","[Higgins, Jessica K.; MacLean, Heidi J.; Buckley, Lauren B.; Kingsolver, Joel G.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill,"Higgins, JK (corresponding author), Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol, CB 3280, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",jkhiggin@live.unc.edu,"Buckley, Lauren/ABD-6759-2021","Buckley, Lauren/0000-0003-1315-3818","NSF [DEB-1120062, IOS-1120500]; Direct For Biological Sciences [1120062] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Biological Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)),"We thank Heather Dwyer and Art Shapiro for sending C. eurytheme from CA and Kristina Williams for sending C. eriphyle from CO.

The bending angle signal can be related to the predicted changes in the climate over this period in response to increasing greenhouse gas concentrations and is shown to be primarily a combination of three distinct effects: the changing temperature structure of the atmosphere, increased water vapor in the troposphere, and the expansion of the atmosphere due to the warming. Analysis of the predicted trends in the bending angle indicates that the climate change signal in the tropical upper troposphere and lower and middle stratosphere may become distinguishable from natural variability, i.e. detected'', after approximately ten to sixteen years of measurements.

Species are shifting their ranges at an unprecedented rate through human transportation and environmental change. Correlative species distribution models (SDMs) are frequently applied for predicting potential future distributions of range-shifting species, despite these models' assumptions that species are at equilibrium with the environments used to train (fit) the models, and that the training data are representative of conditions to which the models are predicted. Here we explore modelling approaches that aim to minimize extrapolation errors and assess predictions against prior biological knowledge. Our aim was to promote methods appropriate to range-shifting species. 2. We use an invasive species, the cane toad in Australia, as an example, predicting potential distributions under both current and climate change scenarios. We use four SDM methods, and trial weighting schemes and choice of background samples appropriate for species in a state of spread. We also test two methods for including information from a mechanistic model. Throughout, we explore graphical techniques for understanding model behaviour and reliability, including the extent of extrapolation. 3. Predictions varied with modelling method and data treatment, particularly with regard to the use and treatment of absence data. Models that performed similarly under current climatic conditions deviated widely when transferred to a novel climatic scenario. 4. The results highlight problems with using SDMs for extrapolation, and demonstrate the need for methods and tools to understand models and predictions. We have made progress in this direction and have implemented exploratory techniques as new options in the free modelling software, MAXENT. Our results also show that deliberately controlling the fit of models and integrating information from mechanistic models can enhance the reliability of correlative predictions of species in non-equilibrium and novel settings. 5. Implications. The biodiversity of many regions in the world is experiencing novel threats created by species invasions and climate change. Predictions of future species distributions are required for management, but there are acknowledged problems with many current methods, and relatively few advances in techniques for understanding or overcoming these. The methods presented in this manuscript and made accessible in MAXENT provide a forward step.","[Elith, Jane] Univ Melbourne, Sch Bot, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia; [Kearney, Michael] Univ Melbourne, Dept Zool, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia; [Phillips, Steven] AT&T Labs Res, Florham Pk, NJ 07932 USA",University of Melbourne; University of Melbourne; AT&T,"Elith, J (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Sch Bot, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia.",j.elith@unimelb.edu.au,"Kearney, Michael/R-3404-2017; Elith, Jane/F-2022-2015","Kearney, Michael/0000-0002-3349-8744; Elith, Jane/0000-0002-8706-0326","ARC [FT0991640, LP0989537]; Australian Centre of Excellence for Risk Analysis",ARC(Australian Research Council); Australian Centre of Excellence for Risk Analysis,"We were supported by ARC grants FT0991640 (Elith), LP0989537 (Elith and Kearney) and the Australian Centre of Excellence for Risk Analysis (Elith).

Previous modeling attempts have been unable to reproduce major features of Eocene climate indicated by proxy data without substantial modification to the model physics. Here, we present simulations using a state-of-the-art climate model forced by proxy-estimated CO2 levels that capture the extreme surface warmth and reduced latitudinal temperature gradient of the Early Eocene and the warming of the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum. Our simulations exhibit increasing equilibrium climate sensitivity with warming and suggest an Eocene sensitivity of more than 6.6 degrees C, much greater than the present-day value (4.2 degrees C). This higher climate sensitivity is mainly attributable to the shortwave cloud feedback, which is linked primarily to cloud microphysical processes. Our findings highlight the role of small-scale cloud processes in determining large-scale climate changes and suggest a potential increase in climate sensitivity with future warming.","[Zhu, Jiang; Poulsen, Christopher J.] Univ Michigan, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Tierney, Jessica E.] Univ Arizona, Dept Geosci, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Arizona,"Zhu, J (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",jiazhu@umich.edu,"Zhu, Jiang/H-6040-2011; Poulsen, Chris/C-6213-2009","Zhu, Jiang/0000-0002-0908-5130; Poulsen, Chris/0000-0001-5104-4271; Tierney, Jessica/0000-0002-9080-9289",Heising-Simons Foundation [2016-015],Heising-Simons Foundation,This work was supported by Heising-Simons Foundation grant #2016-015 to C.J.P. and J.E.T.,,88,70,74,6,22,AMER ASSOC ADVANCEMENT SCIENCE,WASHINGTON,"1200 NEW YORK AVE, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20005 USA",2375-2548,,,SCI ADV,Sci.

Common model deficiencies include an equatorward bias in the location of the midlatitude westerlies and an overly zonal orientation of the North Atlantic storm track. Orography is known to strongly affect the atmospheric circulation and is notoriously difficult to represent in coarse-resolution climate models. Yet how the representation of orography affects circulation biases in current climate models is not understood. Here we show that the effects of switching off the parameterization of drag from low-level orographic blocking in one climate model resemble the biases of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 ensemble: An overly zonal wintertime North Atlantic storm track and less European blocking events, and an equatorward shift in the Southern Hemispheric jet and increase in the Southern Annular Mode time scale. This suggests that typical circulation biases in coarse-resolution climate models may be alleviated by improved parameterizations of low-level drag.","[Pithan, Felix; Shepherd, Theodore G.; Zappa, Giuseppe] Univ Reading, Dept Meteorol, Reading, Berks, England; [Sandu, Irina] European Ctr Medium Range Weather Forecasts, Reading, Berks, England",University of Reading; European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF),"Pithan, F (corresponding author), Univ Reading, Dept Meteorol, Reading, Berks, England.",felix.pithan@awi.de,"Zappa, Giuseppe/AAX-5150-2021","Zappa, Giuseppe/0000-0003-4306-7451; sandu, irina/0000-0002-1215-3288",European Union's Horizon research and innovation program under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant [654492]; ERC,European Union's Horizon research and innovation program under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant; ERC(European Research Council (ERC)European Commission),We acknowledge ECMWF and the climate modeling groups for producing and making available reanalysis and model data.

Within the IJssel Delta project, a river bypass in the river IJssel, one of the major Dutch rivers, is planned to reduce the risk of flooding in view of expected climate change effects. The challenge for this project was to combine various developments (bypass, urban development, nature, leisure, infrastructure and agriculture) in the area into a single integrated spatial development plan, acceptable to all stakeholders. This included resolving spatial conflicts between separate developments regarding (i) flood protection, (ii) infrastructure and (iii) housing. During the planning process various bypass alternatives were considered to determine the span width of possible solutions.

We find that for stabilizing atmospheric GHG concentrations at 450 ppm CO2-only, postponing a global agreement to 2020 raises global mitigation costs by at least about half and a delay to 2030 renders ambitious climate targets infeasible to achieve. In the standard policy scenario-in which allocation of emission permits is aimed at equal per-capita levels in the year 2050-regions with above average emissions (such as the EU and the US alongside the rest of Annex-I countries) incur lower mitigation costs by taking early action, even if mitigation efforts in the rest of the world experience a delay. However, regions with low per-capita emissions which are net exporters of emission permits (such as India) can possibly benefit from higher future carbon prices resulting from a delay. We illustrate the economic mechanism behind these observations and analyze how (1) lock-in of carbon intensive infrastructure, (2) differences in global carbon prices, and (3) changes in reduction commitments resulting from delayed action influence mitigation costs.","[Jakob, Michael; Luderer, Gunnar; Steckel, Jan] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany; [Tavoni, Massimo] Euromediterranean Ctr Climate Change, Venice, Italy; [Monjon, Stephanie] Ctr Int Rech Environm & Dev, Paris, France",Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; Centro Euro-Mediterraneo sui Cambiamenti Climatici (CMCC); AgroParisTech,"Jakob, M (corresponding author), Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, POB 601203, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany.",jakob@pik-potsdam.de,"Luderer, Gunnar/ABF-2346-2020; Luderer, Gunnar/G-2967-2012","Luderer, Gunnar/0000-0002-9057-6155; Luderer, Gunnar/0000-0002-9057-6155; tavoni, massimo/0000-0001-5069-4707; Steckel, Jan Christoph/0000-0002-5325-9214",Allianz; WWF Europe,Allianz; WWF Europe,"The authors would like to thank the three anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments, which improved this paper substantially.

Antarctica-an emblem of environmental change and advancements in scientific research-serves as one of the main stages for Juan's placement of colorful fabrics and cloth figures that are meant to represent specific natural phenomena connected to climate change. Juan's documentation of these scenes in videos and digital stills quotes the Romantic tradition of the sublime in landscape painting, the artist-traveller, and a heroic notion of scientific fieldwork, which exposes a continued desire for control despite our increasing knowledge of our limitations, as well as two principal means through which we understand climate change: science and the sublime. Furthermore, the pleasing quality of Juan's art, in spite of the crisis to which she alludes, aligns with contemporary trends that favor participation, pleasure and hope.

Especially, macroalgae that are externally reproducing rely on optimal environmental conditions for gamete release and subsequent fertilisation. However, the effect of climate change-forced decrease in salinity on these critical life stages has been largely overlooked. We tested the impact of forecasted hyposaline conditions on a marginal population of the rockweed Fucus vesiculosus growing at 5.8 PSU on the Finnish coast of the Baltic Sea. We incubated individuals with receptacles for at least sevendays at 2.5, 4.1, 5.8, and 7.2 PSU and determined their gamete release and subsequent fertilisation success. We further tested sperm performance at 3.5, 5.0, and 6.1 PSU. Salinity of 2.5 PSU, which is predicted to occur in the region by the end of this century, reduced egg release. In contrast, sperm and antheridia release were not consistently affected by the different salinities, but the size of sperm swells at 3.5 PSU. Because fertilisation success was drastically reduced at 2.5 and 4.1 PSU, we suggest that sperm performance was compromised such that sperm dysfunction hampered fertilisation success. Our results demonstrate that the forecasted hyposalinity negatively affects egg release and sexual reproduction in F. vesiculosus at its northern distribution limit. This macroalga can probably only withstand the future decrease in salinity when populations proliferate via asexual reproduction.","[Rothausler, Eva; Haavisto, Fiia; Jormalainen, Veijo] Univ Turku, Dept Biol, FIN-20014 Turku, Finland; [Uebermuth, Carolin] Univ Bonn, Dept Biol, D-53012 Bonn, Germany",University of Turku; University of Bonn,"Rothausler, E (corresponding author), Univ Turku, Dept Biol, FIN-20014 Turku, Finland.",evanro@utu.fi,,"Uebermuth-Feldhaus, Carolin/0000-0003-3071-2458; Rothausler, Eva/0000-0002-3185-4290; Jormalainen, Veijo/0000-0001-6346-2585","European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development [273623]; Academy of Finland [273623]; BONUS, the EU Joint Baltic Sea Research and Development Programme (Art 185); DAAD RISE worldwide; Finish Cultural Foundation","European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development; Academy of Finland(Academy of Finland); BONUS, the EU Joint Baltic Sea Research and Development Programme (Art 185); DAAD RISE worldwide; Finish Cultural Foundation","This study was funded by BONUS, the EU Joint Baltic Sea Research and Development Programme (Art 185), which is funded jointly by the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development and by the Academy of Finland (Decision #273623) through project BAMBI -Baltic Sea Marine Biodiversity.

The present contribution, prepared in the framework of the MICE (Modelling the Impact of Climate Extremes) Project of the European Union, reviews how climate change may impact on winter tourism in the Alpine region, intense precipitation and flood potential in central Europe, forest damage in Scandinavia and beach holidays in the Mediterranean coast. Impacts are likely to be serious and largely adverse. Due to a lack of adequate information and lack of broadly accepted and reliable mathematical models describing the impact of changes in climate extremes on these activity sectors, it has been found useful to use expert judgement based impact assessment. Accordingly, regional mini-workshops were organized serving as platforms for communication between scientists and stakeholders, vehicles for dissemination of the state-of-the-art of the scientific understanding and for learning stakeholders' view on extreme events, their impacts and the preparedness system. Stakeholders had the opportunity to react to the scientific results and to reflect on their perception of the likely impacts of projected changes in extremes on relevant activity sectors and the potential to adapt and avert adverse consequences. The results reported in this paper present the stakeholders' suggestions for essential information on different extreme event impacts and their needs from science.","[Kundzewicz, Z.

The use of climate forecasts depends on whether state-of-the-art regional climate models can produce dependable monthly, seasonal, and interannual forecasts of relevant climate variables (precipitation, temperature, potential evaporation and runoff) for use in hydrologic studies. Although climate models may be imperfect, the key issue is to determine if the uncertainty in climate model predictions is compatible with the risk levels accepted in water resources management. In this paper, we focus on the predictability of drought at the regional scale in the Ohio River Basin. Historical records of precipitation, surface temperature, streamflow, and PDSI (Palmer drought Severity Index), as well as evapotranspiration estimates obtained from 4-DDA (4-Dimensional Data Analysis) were used to define a hydroclimatology of the region on monthly, seasonal and interannual time-scales. Drought events were subsequently classified not only as a function of drought attributes, but also according to antecedent and concurrent hydrometeorological patterns and time of the year. It was found that the time rate of change of the spatial variability of monthly precipitation was highly correlated with the occurrence of extreme drought with recurrence periods of 7-8 years. These results are subsequently used to formulate a simple multilinear regression drought forecast model for the basin. Independent testing of the model shows that the three month (one season) and six-month (two seasons) lead-time forecasts are highly reliable and provide adequate lead times for effective water resource management.","Penn State Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park,"Brennan, KE (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",,"Barros, Ana/A-3562-2011","Barros, Ana/0000-0003-4606-3106",,,,,4,0,0,1,2,HELSINKI UNIVERSITY TECHNOLOGY,ESPOO 15,"SF-02150 ESPOO 15, FINLAND",,,,,,,1998,,,,,333,342,,,,,,10,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences; Water Resources,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences; Water Resources,BM30R,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000078339600034,View Full Record in Web of Science

Previous studies from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 3 (CMIP3) showed quite large biases in the simulated cloud climatology affecting all GCMs as well as a remarkable degree of variation among the models that represented the state of the art circa 2005. Here the progress that has been made in recent years is measured by comparing mean cloud properties, interannual variability, and the climatological seasonal cycle from the CMIP5 models with satellite observations and with results from comparable CMIP3 experiments. The focus is on three climate-relevant cloud parameters: cloud amount, liquid water path, and cloud radiative forcing. The comparison shows that intermodel differences are still large in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) simulations, and reveals some small improvements of particular cloud properties in some regions in the CMIP5 ensemble over CMIP3. In CMIP5 there is an improved agreement of the modeled interannual variability of liquid water path and of the modeled longwave cloud forcing over mid- and high-latitude oceans with observations. However, the differences in the simulated cloud climatology from CMIP3 and CMIP5 are generally small, and there is very little to no improvement apparent in the tropical and subtropical regions in CMIP5. Comparisons of the results from the coupled CMIP5 models with their atmosphere-only versions run with observed SSTs show remarkably similar biases in the simulated cloud climatologies. This suggests the treatments of subgrid-scale cloud and boundary layer processes are directly implicated in the poor performance of current GCMs in simulating realistic cloud fields.","[Lauer, Axel; Hamilton, Kevin] Univ Hawaii Manoa, IPRC, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Hamilton, Kevin] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Meteorol, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA",University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa,"Lauer, A (corresponding author), Univ Hawaii Manoa, IPRC, SOEST, 1680 East West Rd,POST Bldg 401, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",lauera@hawaii.edu,"Keyes, Dennis/AAZ-9285-2021","Hamilton, Kevin/0000-0002-3560-8097",Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC); NASA [NNX07AG53G]; NOAA [NA09OAR4320075],Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC); NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA),"This research was supported by the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC), by NASA through Grant NNX07AG53G, and by NOAA through Grant NA09OAR4320075, which sponsored research at the International Pacific Research Center.

But who are 'we' in the Anthropocene, how do notions of our shared humanity contend with the cascading global inequalities of place, race, class and gender. Oceania is often said to have contributed the least and suffered the most from climate change. Pacific women, and especially those living on low lying atolls, have been portrayed as the most vulnerable to the disastrous consequences of climate change. This focuses on sea level rise and the toxic mixing, the elemental confusion of salt and fresh water caused by atmospheric changes and global warming. While not negating the gravity of present and future scenarios, how can we move beyond the pervasive fatalism of foreign framings and seemingly opposed cliched evocations of 'resilience'? The moniker of the Pacific Climate Warriors 350.org 'We are not drowning, we are fighting' evokes a contrary trope of resistance and resonates with Oceanic activism in politics and the creative arts.(1) Tracing such a genealogy of resistance might start with a greater respect for Indigenous knowledges and embodied practices in contemporary understandings of 'climate cultures' in Oceania which do not routinely distinguish between natural and human history.(2)","[Jolly, Margaret] Australian Natl Univ, GPO Box 4, Canberra, ACT 2600, Australia",Australian National University,"Jolly, M (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, GPO Box 4, Canberra, ACT 2600, Australia.",margaret.jolly@anu.edu.au,,,"Australian Research Council Discovery grant Engendering Climate Change, Reframing Futures in Oceania [DP180104224]; Australian National University","Australian Research Council Discovery grant Engendering Climate Change, Reframing Futures in Oceania(Australian Research Council); Australian National University(Australian National University)","This research was funded by an Australian Research Council Discovery grant Engendering Climate Change, Reframing Futures in Oceania (DP180104224) and by the Australian National University.",,81,9,9,0,7,"UNIV TECHNOLOGY, SYDNEY-UTS EPRESS",SYDNEY,"BROADWAY, PO BOX 123, SYDNEY, NSW 2007, AUSTRALIA",1837-8692,,,CULT STUD REV,Cult.

Although fumed silica core VIPs have shown superior long-term performance under accelerated aging tests compared to glass fiber core VIPS, these laboratory test results have yet to be verified with long-term field performance data. In 2011, glass fiber core VIPs were installed in a commercial building retrofit project in Yukon, Canada (one of Canada's most northern territories), and have been continuously monitored since. This paper summarizes the thermal performance of the glass fiber core VIPs over the period of 2011-2018 in an extreme cold climate. Findings from this study provided data to validate glass fiber core VIP accelerated aging test results and the aging rate of VIPs in a cold and dry climate was determined.

This study analyzes how atmospheric absorption and surface solar dimming compete in driving the response of regional summertime climate to anthropogenic aerosols, which dominates, and why-issues of particular importance for predicting how East Asian climate will respond to projected changes in absorbing and scattering aerosol emissions in the future. These questions are probed in a state-of-the-art general circulation model using a combination of realistic and novel idealized aerosol perturbations that allow analysis of the relative influence of absorbing aerosols' atmospheric and surface-driven impacts on regional circulation and climate. Results show that even purely absorption-driven dimming decreases EASM precipitation by cooling the land surface, counteracting climatological land-sea contrast and reducing ascending atmospheric motion and onshore winds, despite the associated positive top-of-the-atmosphere regional radiative forcing. Absorption-driven atmospheric heating does partially offset the precipitation and surface evaporation reduction from surface dimming, but the overall response to aerosol absorption more closely resembles the response to its surface dimming than to its atmospheric heating. These findings provide a novel decomposition of absorbing aerosol's impacts on regional climate and demonstrate that the response cannot be expected to follow the sign of absorption's top-of-the-atmosphere or even atmospheric radiative perturbation.","[Persad, Geeta G.] Carnegie Inst Sci, Stanford, CA 20005 USA; [Paynter, David J.; Ming, Yi; Ramaswamy, V.] NOAA, Geophys Fluid Dynam Lab, Princeton, NJ USA",Carnegie Institution for Science; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Persad, GG (corresponding author), Carnegie Inst Sci, Stanford, CA 20005 USA.",gpersad@carnegiescience.edu,"Ramaswamy, Venkatachalam/AAJ-6265-2021; Paynter, David/N-7227-2019; Ming, Yi/F-3023-2012","Ramaswamy, Venkatachalam/0000-0002-1984-6423; Paynter, David/0000-0002-7092-241X; Persad, Geeta/0000-0003-4690-0867",National Science Foundation [DGE-1148900],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),The authors thank Paul Ginoux for feedback on the early stages of this research and Tom Delworth and Isaac Held for helpful comments on the initial manuscript.

We use a state-of-the-art Earth system model and ensembles of tightly constrained simulations to evaluate the effect of the reductions in aviation traffic on contrail radiative forcing and climate in 2020. In the absence of any COVID-19-pandemic-caused reductions, the model simulates a contrail effective radiative forcing (ERF) of 62 +/- 59 mW m(-2) (2 standard deviations). The contrail ERF has complex spatial and seasonal patterns that combine the offsetting effect of shortwave (solar) cooling and longwave (infrared) heating from contrails and contrail cirrus. Cooling is larger in June-August due to the preponderance of aviation in the Northern Hemisphere, while warming occurs throughout the year. The spatial and seasonal forcing variations also map onto surface temperature variations. The net land surface temperature change due to contrails in a normal year is estimated at 0.13 +/- 0.04 K (2 standard deviations), with some regions warming as much as 0.7 K. The effect of COVID-19 reductions in flight traffic decreased contrails. The unique timing of such reductions, which were maximum in Northern Hemisphere spring and summer when the largest contrail cooling occurs, means that cooling due to fewer contrails in boreal spring and fall was offset by warming due to fewer contrails in boreal summer to give no significant annual averaged ERF from contrail changes in 2020. Despite no net significant global ERF, because of the spatial and seasonal timing of contrail ERF, some land regions would have cooled slightly (minimum -0.2 K) but significantly from contrail changes in 2020. The implications for future climate impacts of contrails are discussed.","[Gettelman, Andrew; Chen, Chieh-Chieh; Bardeen, Charles G.] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Climate & Global Dynam & Atmospher Chem Observat, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA",National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA,"Gettelman, A (corresponding author), Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Climate & Global Dynam & Atmospher Chem Observat, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA.",andrew@ucar.edu,"Gettelman, Andrew/AAY-2312-2021","Chen, Chih-Chieh/0000-0002-4819-2510",,,,,23,10,10,4,10,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1680-7316,1680-7324,,ATMOS CHEM PHYS,Atmos.

Here, we present how this is exposed in surface soil moisture, land surface temperature, and vegetation optical depth as derived from the Land Parameter Retrieval Model, using an inter-calibrated, long-term, multi-sensor passive microwave satellite data record (1998-2020). We also investigate how these interannual variations relate to state-of-the-art climate reanalysis data from ERA5-Land. We analysed both the upstream river catchment and the Okavango delta, supported by independent data records of discharge measurements, precipitation, and vegetation dynamics observed by optical satellites. The seasonal vegetation optical depth anomalies have a strong correspondence with the MODIS leaf area index (correlation catchment: 0.74, delta: 0.88). Land surface temperature anomalies derived from passive microwave observations match best with those of ERA5-Land (catchment: 0.88, delta: 0.81) as compared to MODIS nighttime land surface temperature (LST) (catchment: 0.70, delta: 0.65). Although surface soil moisture anomalies from passive microwave observations and ERA5-Land correlate reasonably well (catchment: 0.72, delta: 0.69), an in-depth evaluation over the delta uncovered situations where passive microwave satellites record strong fluctuations, while ERA5-Land does not. This is further analysed using information on inundated area, river discharge, and precipitation. The passive microwave soil moisture signal demonstrates a response to both the inundated area and precipitation. ERA5-Land however, which, by default, does not account for any lateral influx from rivers, only shows a response to the precipitation information that is used as forcing. This also causes the reanalysis model to miss record low land surface temperature values as it underestimates the latent heat flux in certain years. These findings demonstrate the complexity of this hydrological system and suggest that future land surface model generations should also include lateral land surface exchange. Also, our study highlights the importance of maintaining and improving climate data records of soil moisture, vegetation, and land surface temperature from passive microwave observations and other observation systems.","[van der Schalie, Robin; van der Vliet, Mendy; de Jeu, Richard] Planet, Haarlem, Netherlands; [Albergel, Clement] European Space Agcy, ECSAT, Climate Off, Harwell Campus, Didcot, Oxon, England; [Dorigo, Wouter] TU Wien, CLIMERS, Dept Geodesy & Geoinformat, Vienna, Austria; [Wolski, Piotr] Univ Cape Town, Climate Syst Anal Grp, Cape Town, South Africa",European Space Agency; Technische Universitat Wien; University of Cape Town,"van der Schalie, R (corresponding author), Planet, Haarlem, Netherlands.",rvanderschalie@planet.com,"; Dorigo, Wouter/C-7794-2014","Albergel, Clement/0000-0003-1095-2702; Dorigo, Wouter/0000-0001-8054-7572","ESAs Climate Change Initiative for Soil Moisture [4000104814/11/I-NB, 4000112226/14/I-NB]",ESAs Climate Change Initiative for Soil Moisture,This study and the authors were supported by ESA's Climate Change Initiative for Soil Moisture (contract nos. 4000104814/11/I-NB and 4000112226/14/I-NB).,,61,0,0,3,3,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1027-5606,1607-7938,,HYDROL EARTH SYST SC,Hydrol.

The feedback between the terrestrial carbon cycle and climate is partly determined by changes in the turnover time of carbon in land ecosystems, which in turn is an ecosystem property that emerges from the interplay between climate, soil and vegetation type(3-6). Here we present a global, spatially explicit and observation-based assessment of whole-ecosystem carbon turnover times that combines new estimates of vegetation and soil organic carbon stocks and fluxes. We find that the overall mean global carbon turnover time is 23(4)(+7) years (95 per cent confidence interval). Onaverage, carbon resides in the vegetation and soil near the Equator for a shorter time than at latitudes north of 75 degrees north (mean turnover times of 15 and 255 years, respectively). We identify a clear dependence of the turnover time on temperature, as expected from our present understanding of temperature controls on ecosystem dynamics. Surprisingly, our analysis also reveals a similarly strong association between turnover time and precipitation. Moreover, we find that the ecosystem carbon turnover times simulated by state-of-the-art coupled climate/carbon-cycle models vary widely and that numerical simulations, on average, tend to underestimate the global carbon turnover time by 36 per cent. The models show stronger spatial relationships with temperature than do observation-based estimates, but generally do not reproduce the strong relationships with precipitation and predict faster carbon turnover in many semiarid regions. Our findings suggest that future climate/carbon-cycle feedbacks may depend more strongly on changes in the hydrological cycle than is expected at present and is considered in Earth system models.","[Carvalhais, Nuno; Forkel, Matthias; Khomik, Myroslava; Jung, Martin; Migliavacca, Mirco; Thurner, Martin; Weber, Ulrich; Ahrens, Bernhard; Beer, Christian; Reichstein, Markus] Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, D-07745 Jena, Germany; [Carvalhais, Nuno] Univ Nova Lisboa, FCT, DCEA, P-2829516 Caparica, Portugal; [Khomik, Myroslava] McMaster Univ, Sch Geog & Earth Sci, Hamilton, ON L8S 4K1, Canada; [Bellarby, Jessica] Univ Aberdeen, Sch Biol Sci, Inst Biol & Environm Sci, Aberdeen AB24 3UU, Scotland; [Bellarby, Jessica] Univ Lancaster, Lancaster Environm Ctr, Lancaster LA1 4YQ, England; [Migliavacca, Mirco] Univ Milano Bicocca, DISAT, Remote Sensing Environm Dynam Lab, I-20126 Milan, Italy; [Mu, Mingquan; Randerson, James T.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Saatchi, Sassan] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA 91109 USA; [Santoro, Maurizio] Gamma Remote Sensing, CH-3073 Gumlingen, Switzerland; [Beer, Christian] Stockholm Univ, Dept Appl Environm Sci, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Beer, Christian] Stockholm Univ, Bolin Ctr Climate Res, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Cescatti, Alessandro] Commiss European Communities, Joint Res Ctr, Inst Environm & Sustainabil, Climate Risk Management Unit, I-21027 Ispra, Italy",Max Planck Society; Universidade Nova de Lisboa; McMaster University; University of Aberdeen; Lancaster University; University of Milano-Bicocca; University of California System; University of California Irvine; California Institute of Technology; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL); GAMMA Remote Sensing AG; Stockholm University; Stockholm University; European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site,"Carvalhais, N (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, Hans Knoll Str 10, D-07745 Jena, Germany.",nuno.carvalhais@bgc-jena.mpg.de,"Cescatti, Alessandro/ABE-6319-2020; Randerson, James/Y-2550-2019; Ahrens, Bernhard/P-1790-2018; Beer, Christian/D-2296-2013; Saatchi, Sassan/AAQ-2649-2021; Reichstein, Markus/A-7494-2011; Forkel, Matthias/O-5592-2019; Migliavacca, Mirco/J-9986-2019; Thurner, Martin/K-4854-2017","Randerson, James/0000-0001-6559-7387; Beer, Christian/0000-0002-5377-3344; Reichstein, Markus/0000-0001-5736-1112; Forkel, Matthias/0000-0003-0363-9697; Migliavacca, Mirco/0000-0003-3546-8407; Thurner, Martin/0000-0003-2362-5161; Ahrens, Bernhard/0000-0001-7226-6682; Carvalhais, Nuno/0000-0003-0465-1436; Khomik, Myroslava/0000-0002-0377-8833",European Union (FP7) through the project GEOCARBON [283080]; ERC starting grant QUASOM [ERC-2007-StG-208516]; European Union (FP7) through the project CARBONES [242316]; European Union (FP7) through the project EMBRACE [283201]; Div Atmospheric & Geospace Sciences [1048890] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Natural Environment Research Council [ceh010010] Funding Source: researchfish,European Union (FP7) through the project GEOCARBON; ERC starting grant QUASOM; European Union (FP7) through the project CARBONES; European Union (FP7) through the project EMBRACE; Div Atmospheric & Geospace Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"We would like to thank C.

Aspiring to bring together artists under the eco-activist umbrella, the Canary Project relies on an old WWII-inspired frame with a narrow premise of that period's conservation efforts. Within this framework, a range of visual designs question, subvert, and promote continued economic growth and an ontology that more equals better. An analysis of the up-down orientational metaphors underscores a typology of these valuations and reveals one way to assess implications of such artistic efforts. That is, artistic expressions adapt and play with the contingent nature of metaphors, offering elaborations, extensions, and alternatives on basic structural elements and, hence, remark on how we orient ourselves and productively imagine being of/in the world anew.","[Cozen, Brian] Univ Utah, Dept Commun, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA",Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah,"Cozen, B (corresponding author), Language & Commun Bldg,255 South Cent Campus Dr,R, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA.",brian.cozen@utah.edu,,,,,,,43,13,13,1,39,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1752-4032,1752-4040,,ENVIRON COMMUN,Environ.

Traditional agricultural systems were believed to be able to keep those processes in check. Thus low priority was assigned to research programmes and projects on soil erosion and conservation, preference being given to the impact of farm machinery on soil structure and compaction along with the role of organic matter in the soil. In the eighties and early nineties the agricultural practices introduced in sloping land under cultivation in the Mediterranean in previous decades were identified as a major contributor to soil degradation. The unprecedented efforts to increase crop yields and maximize profit, made possible by the technological revolution in agriculture, had triggered in the agricultural ecosystem the onset of soil degradation due to hydrological phenomena that proved detrimental both to soil fertility and to the landscape causing devastating and permanent damage. In addition, it was recognized that research activities were too fragmentary to be able to cope with the demands of implementing sound soil conservation measures. The Mediterranean climate is characterised by hot dry summers and mild wet winters. The region frequently suffers from years of scant rainfall and many areas are afflicted by severe drought. The UK Hadley Centre's global climate model has been run on a monthly basis for the Mediterranean countries to predict the percent variation in rainfall and temperature with respect to mean monthly values. Scenarios developed using the model show that for the wet season (October-March), by the year 2050 rainfall could increase in central and eastern Spain, northern France, northern Italy and the Alps by up to 15%, against a decrease of about 10% to 15% in the southern Mediterranean. For the same period, the temperature in the northern Mediterranean is predicted to increase by 1.25 degrees to 2.25 degrees C, compared to an increase of between 1.5 degrees and 2.5 degrees C in the southern Mediterranean. The projections also show that for the dry season (April to September), by the year 2050 rainfall is likely to decrease over much of the Basin. Decreased precipitation is predicted to be accompanied by a rise in temperature of between 1.5 and 2.75 degrees C in the northern regions and 1.75 degrees and 3.0 degrees C in the southern Mediterranean. Reduced precipitation during the summer has a major impact on irrigation and tourism, which both increase the pressure on water supplies during the dry period. To combat these problems, the European Community (EC), in collaboration with other international organizations, has funded various programmes and projects for mitigating drought and assessing and preventing land degradation and desertification. In this context, the paper describes the main features and characteristics of some of these programmes and projects and proposes new approaches to environmental policies, in order to: assess, forecast and mitigate adverse impacts of drought; better understand soil erosion, land degradation and desertification processes; identify preventive, protective and remedial measures; address quantity and quality of natural resources in an integrated context; support innovation and participatory strategies.

Although the assessment of climate change impacts often depends on the joint variability of multiple variables, commonly used bias correction methodologies treat each variable independently and do not consider the relationship among variables. Independent bias correction can therefore produce non-physical corrections and may fail to capture important multivariate relationships. Here, we introduce a joint bias correction methodology (JBC) and apply it to precipitation (P) and temperature (T) fields from the fifth phase of the Climate Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) model ensemble. This approach is based on a general bivariate distribution of P-T and can be seen as a multivariate extension of the commonly used univariate quantile mapping method. It proceeds by correcting either P or T first and then correcting the other variable conditional upon the first one, both following the concept of the univariate quantile mapping. JBC is shown to not only reduce biases in the mean and variance of P and T similarly to univariate quantile mapping, but also to correct model-simulated biases in P-T correlation fields. JBC, using methods such as the one presented here, thus represents an important step in impacts-based research as it explicitly accounts for inter-variable relationships as part of the bias correction procedure, thereby improving not only the individual distributions of P and T, but critically, their joint distribution.","[Li, Chao; Sinha, Eva; Michalak, Anna M.] Carnegie Inst Sci, Dept Global Ecol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Sinha, Eva; Horton, Daniel E.; Diffenbaugh, Noah S.] Stanford Univ, Dept Environm Earth Syst Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Horton, Daniel E.; Diffenbaugh, Noah S.] Stanford Univ, Woods Inst Environm, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Carnegie Institution for Science; Stanford University; Stanford University,"Li, C (corresponding author), Carnegie Inst Sci, Dept Global Ecol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",lichao@stanford.edu,"Horton, Daniel E./AAH-1472-2020; Diffenbaugh, Noah S/I-5920-2014","Horton, Daniel E./0000-0002-2065-4517; Diffenbaugh, Noah S/0000-0002-8856-4964",National Science Foundation (NSF) [1313897]; Directorate For Engineering [1313897] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Directorate For Engineering(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Engineering (ENG)),"We thank Vijay P.

The three-dimensional chemistry transport OsloCTM2 and a state of the art radiative forcing model are used, based on a coherent dataset of present day Arctic emissions. We find that the net RF of SLCF of shipping in the Arctic region is negative, mainly due to the direct and indirect RF effects of sulphate emissions, while the net RF of SLCF of petroleum extraction is positive, mainly due to the effects of black carbon aerosols in the air and deposited on snow. Strong seasonal variations of the sensitivities to emissions are found. In terms of annual mean values we find that the Arctic sensitivities to SLCF is similar to global average sensitivities.

A key challenge of quantifying BC's radiative effect is predicting the impact of aging process on BC's properties. BC is mainly emitted from the incomplete combustion of fossil fuel and biomass burning. After being emitted, it undergoes complex chemical and physical transformations in the atmosphere, through condensation. coagulation and heterogeneous oxidation, which is referred to as BC aging. During aging, BC is gradually coated by other chemical species, which dramatically affects BC properties and alters the corresponding climate effects. The objective of this review is to discuss the current knowledge of BC aging from both laboratory and field measurements. This review first summarizes the methods used in the laboratory experiments and field observations. Then it reviews the effects of aging process on BC mixing state, which comprises both morphology and chemical composition. On this basis. changes to BC light absorption, hygroscopicity, cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and ice nucleation (IN) activity during the aging process are discussed; these properties are closely related to BC climate effects. Laboratory studies on BC aging are always conducted using single-precursor systems, which do not capture the complex composition of the real atmosphere. In field studies, some state-of-the-art online instruments have been deployed to measure BC properties. However, since the field studies are usually conducted at fixed stations, it is difficult to dynamically track the entire BC aging process. Atmospheric aging process converts BC particles from externally mixed to internally mixed, with other chemical species coated on them. The morphology evolution in the aging process contains three stages: void filling, collapse and subsequent growth. which results in BC morphology changing from the initially chain-like shapes to spherical core-shell structures. The chemical composition of coatings is affected by both emission source and extent of aging, showing an increasing proportion of secondary species during the aging process. BC light absorption is enhanced because of coatings that accumulate during aging. However, the absorption enhancement factors reported in previous studies show large discrepancy because of differences in aging degree, morphology and chemical composition. The particle-to-particle heterogeneity in mixing state can also lead to different enhancement factors for particle populations. Along with the enhancement of light absorption. BC particles hygroscopicity and CCN activity are also enhanced during aging process. However, observational evidence is still lacking. The IN activity of BC is still an open question, and whether aging process enhances or suppresses the IN activity of BC is still debatable. Based on this review of previous studies, we recommend further research on the following topics: (1) Characterize the aging process for BC from different emission sources under realistic combustion conditions. (2) Identify the key factors affecting BC aging in various atmospheric environments. (3) Explore the role of BC particles in regional air pollution. (4) Conduct further studies on the interaction between BC and cloud formation.","[Tan, Tianyi; Guo, Song; Wu, Zhijun; Hu, Min] Peking Univ, Coll Environm Sci & Engn, State Key Joint Lab Environm Simulat & Pollut Con, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [He, Lingyan; Huang, Xiaofeng] Peking Univ, Sch Environm & Energy, Key Lab Urban Habitat Environm Sci & Technol, Shenzhen Grad Sch, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China",Peking University; Peking University; University Town of Shenzhen,"Hu, M (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Coll Environm Sci & Engn, State Key Joint Lab Environm Simulat & Pollut Con, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",minhu@pku.edu.cn,"HU, Min/D-1037-2011; Guo, Song/D-9218-2012","HU, Min/0000-0003-4816-9123; Guo, Song/0000-0002-9661-2313",,,,,104,4,5,16,59,SCIENCE PRESS,EPHRATA,"300 WEST CHESNUT ST, EPHRATA, PA 17522 USA",0023-074X,2095-9419,,CHIN SCI B-CHIN,Chin.

These predictions differ from one another and both differ significantly from the prescribed classification groupings of ecosystem complexes used with a state-of-the-art land surface parameterization submodel, the Biosphere-Atmosphere Transfer Scheme. The highly generalised groupings show relatively little sensitivity to the temperature changes induced by doubling atmospheric CO2 but greater response when precipitation is also modified. All the double-CO2 scenarios predict increased 'desert' areas although these future climatically-induced changes to the global-scale ecology are very much smaller than the extensive disturbances already caused by mankind's land clearance and poor agriculture. Land-use change rendered 13% of the Earth's land surface 'desert' whereas the most pessimistic doubled-CO2 result gives rise to only a 2% increase in 'desert' area.",,,"HENDERSON-SELLERS, A (corresponding author), MACQUARIE UNIV, N RYDE, NSW 2109, AUSTRALIA.",,,,,,,,31,7,7,0,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0042-3106,,,VEGETATIO,Vegetatio,31-Jan,1991,2-Jan,,,,149,166,,10.1007/BF00036054,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00036054,,,18,Plant Sciences; Ecology; Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,FE700,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:A1991FE70000016,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Hackl, A; Mauschitz, G",,,,"Hackl, Albert; Mauschitz, Gerd",,,Role of waste management with regard to climate protection: a case study,WASTE MANAGEMENT & RESEARCH,,,English,Article,,,,,,Kyoto target; Austrian climate strategy; waste management; GHG emissions; wmr 1323-5,,"According to the Kyoto Protocol and the burden-sharing agreement of the European Union, Austria is required to cut greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions during the years 2008 to 2012 in order to achieve an average reduction of 13%, based on the level of emissions for the year 1990. The present contribution gives an overview of the history of GHG emission regulation in Austria and identifies the progress made towards the realization of the national climate strategy to attain the GHG emission targets. The contribution uses Austria as an example of the way in which proper waste management can help to reduce GHG emissions. The GHG inventories show that everything must be done to minimize the carbon input due to waste deposition at landfill sites. The incineration of waste is particularly helpful in reducing GHG emissions. The waste-to-energy by incineration plants and recovery of energy yield an ecologically proper treatment of waste using state-of-the-art techniques of a very high standard. The potential for GHG reduction of conventional waste treatment technologies has been estimated by the authors. A growing number of waste incinerators and intensified co-incineration of waste in Austrian industry will both help to reduce national GHG emissions substantially. By increasing the number and capacity of plants for thermal treatment of waste the contribution of proper waste management to the national target for reduction of GHG emissions will be in the range of 8 to 14%. The GHG inventories also indicate that a potential CO, reduction of about 500 000 t year(-1) is achievable by co-incineration of waste in Austrian industry.","[Hackl, Albert; Mauschitz, Gerd] Vienna Univ Technol, Inst Chem Engn, Dept Mech Proc Engn, A-1060 Vienna, Austria",Technische Universitat Wien,"Mauschitz, G (corresponding author), Vienna Univ Technol, Inst Chem Engn, Dept Mech Proc Engn, Getreidemarkt 9-166, A-1060 Vienna, Austria.",gmausch@mail.zserv.tuwien.ac.at,,,,,,,13,10,11,0,12,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0734-242X,1096-3669,,WASTE MANAGE RES,Waste Manage.

On interannual time scales, highest SST variability occurs in the eastern equatorial region and off the coast of southwestern Africa. The pattern of SST variability resembles the Pacific El Nino, but features notable differences, and has been discussed in the context of various climate modes, that is, reoccurring patterns resulting from particular interactions in the climate system. Here, we attempt to reconcile those different definitions, concluding that almost all of them are essentially describing the same mode that we refer to as the Atlantic Nino. We give an overview of the mechanisms that have been proposed to underlie this mode, and we discuss its interaction with other climate modes within and outside the tropical Atlantic. The impact of Atlantic Nino-related SST variability on rainfall, in particular over the Gulf of Guinea and north eastern South America is also described. An important aspect we highlight is that the Atlantic Nino and its teleconnections are not stationary, but subject to multidecadal modulations. Simulating the Atlantic Nino proves a challenge for state-of-the-art climate models, and this may be partly due to the large mean state biases in the region. Potential reasons for these model biases and implications for seasonal prediction are discussed.

Based on previous findings, we expect emphasizing the positive impact of public transport usage on the local level to have a greater effect on subjects' preferences for public transport than a message that highlights the global consequences. Contrary to these expectations, our results show that the global treatment increases subjects' willingness to pay compared to the local treatment and the baseline. Both treatments increase subjects' willingness to use public transport.

Depending on the model, the top-of-the-atmosphere BB aerosol effect can range from cooling to warming. By relating aerosol absorption relative to extinction and carbonaceous aerosol composition from 12 observational datasets to nine state-of-the-art Earth system models/chemical transport models, we identify varying degrees of over-estimation in BB aerosol absorptivity by these models. Modifications to BB aerosol refractive index, size, and mixing state improve the Community Atmosphere Model version 5 (CAM5) agreement with observations, leading to a global change in BB direct radiative effect of -0.07Wm(-2), and regional changes of -2Wm(-2) (Africa) and -0.5Wm(-2) (South America/Temperate). Our findings suggest that current modeled BB contributes less to warming than previously thought, largely due to treatments of aerosol mixing state.","[Brown, Hunter; Liu, Xiaohong; Pokhrel, Rudra; Murphy, Shane;

This article assesses the extent to which new insights can be derived from recent IPCC reports for the interpretation of Art. 2 para. 1 PA from a legal perspective. To this end, the article analyses the contributions of Working Groups I and III of the sixth assessment report. Methodologically, we compare the findings with previously published IPCC reports, namely the 1.5 degrees C report and the fifth assessment report. A legal interpretation of the Paris Agreement and of core concepts of human rights follows. Several empirical indications show that current global greenhouse gas budget calculations are quite generous. We provide five empirical arguments that clearly point in that direction. These empirical arguments, combined with legal arguments, demonstrate that the budgets must be smaller than those estimated by the IPCC. The legal arguments are based on Art. 2 of the Paris Agreement, as well as on human rights and the precautionary principle. These norms contain an obligation to minimise the risk of significant damage, i.e., to take rapid and drastic climate protection measures. This implies: 1.5 degrees C is the legally binding temperature target; adherence requires a very high probability of achieving the target; temperature overshoot and geoengineering tend to be prohibited, and budget calculations must be based on sceptical factual assumptions. These findings have also been confirmed by recent rulings of supreme courts, such as the ground-breaking climate decision of the German Federal Constitutional Court. The Paris Agreement and human rights underline a legally binding obligation for smaller global greenhouse gas budgets as those estimated in the greenhouse gas budgets of the IPCC-even compared to the 83 percent scenario in the latest assessment.

This article explores the relative impact of global warming across the different regional climates of Europe comparing present and estimated future energy needs of a hypothetical residential house located in 19 cities characterized by different latitude and Koppen-Geiger class. Building performance simulations with EnergyPlus are performed in order to simulate the heating and cooling needs of the building and the associated CO2 emissions in the present and in the future. The progressive increase in average temperatures in 2050 and 2080 leads to a general decrease of thermal energy request for heating and to an increase in the demand for electricity for cooling especially in the southern Europe, where high carbon intensity coefficients cause large CO2 emissions. The resulting vicious circle can be interrupted by increasing the energy efficiency of buildings and properly converting thermoelectric power plants. Results also show that in the future the Mediterranean basin will suffer more than other European areas for phenomena linked to global warming.","[Ciancio, Virgilio; Salata, Ferdinando; Golasi, Iacopo] Univ Rome Sapienza, Dept Astronaut Elect & Energy Engn, Area Fis Tecn, Via Eudossiana 18, I-00184 Rome, Italy; [Falasca, Serena] Univ Urbino, Dept Pure & Appl Sci, I-61029 Urbino, Italy; [Falasca, Serena; Curci, Gabriele] Univ Aquila, Ctr Excellence Telesensing Environm & Model Predi, I-67100 Laquila, Italy; [Curci, Gabriele] Univ Aquila, Dept Phys & Chem Sci, I-67100 Laquila, Italy; [Wilde, Pieter de] Univ Plymouth, Sch Art Design & Architecture, Plymouth, Devon, England",Sapienza University Rome; University of Urbino; University of L'Aquila; University of L'Aquila; University of Plymouth,"Salata, F (corresponding author), Univ Rome Sapienza, Dept Astronaut Elect & Energy Engn, Area Fis Tecn, Via Eudossiana 18, I-00184 Rome, Italy.",virgilio.ciancio@uniroma1.it; fedinando.salata@uniroma1.it; serena.falasca@uniurb.it; gabriele.curci@aquila.infn.it; iacopo.golasi@uniroma1.it; pieter.dewilde@plymouth.ac.uk,"Curci, Gabriele/A-2020-2011; de Wilde, Pieter/T-5829-2017; Salata, Ferdinando/I-4627-2015","Curci, Gabriele/0000-0001-9871-5570; de Wilde, Pieter/0000-0003-3376-9775; Salata, Ferdinando/0000-0001-9740-034X; Falasca, Serena/0000-0002-7365-369X",Sapienza University of Rome,Sapienza University of Rome,"This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.

There are also increasing calls for the arts and humanities to play a greater role in the meaning-making' task around climate change. Philosopher and literary theorist Timothy Morton has created a new approach, one which frames global warming as a hyperobject'. Morton's work demonstrates the value of artistic and philosophical approaches in helping people perceive climate change, as well as understand how it may feel. It opens up a potentially crucial discussion about ontology (the study of Being' and existence) illuminating the difficult emotional and conceptual territory humans must cross. His work is intended to awaken people abruptly but debate exists as to whether Morton's approach is too harsh and disempowering, or whether it is the spur required for humans to adjust cognitively and emotionally to a new climate reality. Morton's frame vividly captures human vulnerability, but his association of vulnerability with shame and humiliation is concerning. Morton's narrative style, brilliantly evocative at times, is at others contentiously obscure. While this engenders what may be a necessary experience of dislocation, it also risks rendering his more valuable ideas impenetrable to many readers.

To these ends, four different methods widely used in the field of metocean engineering are employed to analyze both buoy data (Rete Ondametrica Nazionale, RON) and wave data obtained by means of dynamical hindcasting techniques such as the forecast/hindcast operational model chain in use at the University of Genoa (www.dicca.unige.it/meteocean). Return levels are estimated by the Goda method, the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) and the Generalized Pareto Distribution-Poisson point process models and the Equivalent Triangular Storm (ETS) algorithm. All models follow the Peak-Over-Threshold (POT) approach which require an optimal threshold implementation, save for the GEV analysis, which is applied to model significant wave height maxima pertaining to time-blocks. The models exhibit different performance characteristics, presented here and treated in depth. In general, noteworthy versatility characterizes the GPD-Poisson model, which often recovers Goda results, while the GEV and ETS models exhibit limitations in assessment of a variety of wave fields, greatly diversified in a semi-closed basin such as the Mediterranean Sea. Long-term estimates have been provided by means of the most appropriate model selected, thus offering a complete overview of wave climate in the Mediterranean basin based on wave hindcast data.

To this end, we adopted state-of-the-art speech processing technologies and conducted trials in real-life teaching environments. Although much attention has been devoted to speech processing for numerous applications, few researchers have attempted to apply speech processing for analyzing activities in classrooms. To address this shortcoming, we developed speech processing algorithms that detect speakers and social behavior from audio recordings in classrooms. Specifically, we aim to infer the climate in the classroom from non-verbal speech cues. We extract non-verbal speech cues and low-level audio features from speech segments and train classifiers based on those cues. We were able to distinguish between positive and negative CLASS climate scores with 70-80% accuracy (estimated by leave-one-out crossvalidation).

Recognized as a turning point in world history, their sudden defeat triggered the reconfiguration of strategic alliances and geopolitical power not only in the Middle East, but also across much of Eurasia. Despite decades of research, scholars have not yet reached consensus over the causes of the Mongol reverse. Here, we revisit previous arguments in light of climate and environmental changes in the aftermath of one the largest volcanic forcings in the past 2500 years, the Samalas eruption similar to 1257 CE. Regional tree ring-based climate reconstructions and state-of-the-art Earth System Model simulations reveal cooler and wetter conditions from spring 1258 to autumn 1259 CE for the eastern Mediterranean/Arabian region. We therefore hypothesize that the post-Samalas climate anomaly and associated environmental variability affected an estimated 120,000 Mongol soldiers and up to half a million of their horses during the conquest. More specifically, we argue that colder and wetter climates in 1258 and 1259 CE, while complicating and slowing the campaign in certain areas, such as the mountainous regions in the Caucasus and Anatolia, also facilitated the assault on Syria between January and March 1260. A return to warmer and dryer conditions in the summer of 1260 CE, however, likely reduced the regional carrying capacity and may therefore have forced a mass withdrawal of the Mongols from the region that contributed to the Mamluks' victory. In pointing to a distinct environmental dependency of the Mongols, we offer a new explanation of their defeat at 'Ayn which effectively halted the further expansion of the largest ever land-based empire.","[Di Cosmo, Nicola] Inst Adv Study, Sch Hist Studies, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA; [Wagner, Sebastian] Helmholtz Zentrum Hereon, Inst Coastal Syst, D-21502 Geesthacht, Germany; [Buntgen, Ulf] Univ Cambridge, Dept Geog, Cambridge CB2 3EN, England",Institute for Advanced Study - USA; University of Cambridge,"Di Cosmo, N (corresponding author), Inst Adv Study, Sch Hist Studies, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA.",ndc@ias.edu; ulf.buentgen@geog.cam.ac.uk,,"Wagner, Sebastian/0000-0001-5603-3897",SustES -Adaptation strategies for sustainable ecosystem services and food security under adverse environmental conditions [CZ.0 2.1.01/0.0/0.0/16_019/0000797]; ERC project MONOSTAR [AdG 882727],SustES -Adaptation strategies for sustainable ecosystem services and food security under adverse environmental conditions; ERC project MONOSTAR,"We thank Professor Reuven Amitai (Hebrew University, Jerusalem) for his kind comments.

An ecological calendar is a way of keeping track of seasonal changes in a habitat. Many communities use and have used such calendars to coordinate their subsistence activities based on these seasonal events. Using interpretive and design planning processes, educators developed an exhibition in the Gardens' welcome center to help the visiting public understand what ecological calendars are, how they are used by communities most impacted by climate change, and their great potential for use by people around the world to adapt to increasing uncertainty associated with changes such as the increase in extreme weather events. To further help the public understand ecological calendars, two artists were invited to create art installations as part of the whole exhibition based on the research and knowledge from participating communities. Finally, project team members worked with educators to develop an environmental education activity that could be used at the Gardens and in primary and secondary schools to educate students about the value of ecological calendars and how to create them. The team was invited to submit a summary of their exhibition development process to this journal, as part of this special issue and to describe the process they took to communicate the ecological calendar research to a public audience. The process, which included an interdisciplinary team of scientists, Indigenous community members, artists, and educators' emphasized co-creation and the benefits of including multiple voices and viewpoints. It also describes interpretation-a purposeful approach to communication that facilitates meaning and understanding-and offers an example of how this discipline can be used by the scientific community to help convey their work to public audiences. Plain Language Summary This article describes the process educators at Cornell Botanic Gardens undertook to interpret the Ecological Calendar research project for public audiences. Interpretation is a communication process that reveals meanings and relationships through direct experience with objects, artifacts, sites, and landscapes. Using interpretive and design planning processes, educators developed an exhibition to help the visiting public understand what ecological calendars are, how they are used by communities most impacted by climate change, and their potential for use by people around the world to adapt to increasing uncertainty associated with climate change. The exhibition included a photographic narrative; glass case exhibits comprised of objects, photos, and narratives; and displays of ecological calendars. To further public understanding of the ecological calendars, two artists were invited to create art installations to provide a different interpretive perspective. Finally, research team members worked with educators to develop an education activity that could be used at the Gardens and in primary and secondary schools to educate students about the value of ecological calendars, how to create and use them. An evaluation of the exhibition showed that respondents understood what ecological calendars are, why communities were participating in the research project and the benefits of developing ecological calendars.","[Skelly, Sonja M.; Fiorello, Sarah; Potter, Jay; Hull, Siobhan] Cornell Univ, Cornell Bot Gardens, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA; [Skelly, Sonja M.] Cornell Univ, Sch Integrat Plant Sci, Hort Sect, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA; [Sun, Werner] Cornell Univ, Wilson Synchrotron Lab, Ithaca, NY USA",Cornell University; Cornell University; Cornell University,"Skelly, SM (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Cornell Bot Gardens, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA.;Skelly, SM (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Sch Integrat Plant Sci, Hort Sect, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA.",sms92@cornell.edu,,"Fiorello, Sarah/0000-0002-2846-1728; Hull, Siobhan/0000-0002-5037-8971; Sun, Werner/0000-0003-0649-5086",Rita Allen Foundation [NS-2111-02233],Rita Allen Foundation,"We thank the ECCAP team of Karim-Aly S.

Results indicate that predictive skills are highly model dependent: the Fourth Generation Canadian Coupled Global Climate Model (CanCM4), Centre National de Recherches Meteorologiques Coupled Global Climate Model, version 5 (CNRM-CM5), and Max Planck Institute Earth System Model, low resolution (MPI-ESM-LR) models show improved skill in the decadal hindcasts, while the Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate, version 5 (MIROC5) is skillful in both the decadal and historical experiments.

These models have evolved from yield tables to models that simulate ecological and physiological processes. Because several approaches exist for modelling forest growth, understanding their strengths and weaknesses is complex. Here, we present a review of forest growth modelling and focus on the most common types of models: growth and yield, succession, process-based, and hybrid. These models might or might not include stochastic components. Worldwide there is a trend towards building hybrid models, because they are best suited to represent the effect of climate change on tree growth. However, empirical evidence has not shown major differences in predictions between hybrid and simpler growth models. Finally, we emphasize that none type of growth model is demonstrably better than others and that each is used to answer a great variety of research and management questions.","[Salas, Christian] Univ La Frontera, Dept Ciencias Forestales, Lab Biometria, Temuco, Chile; [Gregoire, Timothy G.] Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Craven, Dylan J.] Halle Jena Leipzig, German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res, Deutsch Pl 5e, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Craven, Dylan J.] Univ Leipzig, Inst Biol, Johannisallee 21, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Gilabert, Horacio] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Ecosistemas & Medio Ambiente, Alameda 340, Santiago, Chile",Universidad de La Frontera; Yale University; Leipzig University; Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile,"Salas, C (corresponding author), Univ La Frontera, Dept Ciencias Forestales, Lab Biometria, Temuco, Chile.",christian.salas@ufrontera.cl,"Salas-Eljatib, Christian/I-3588-2013; Craven, Dylan/K-2717-2012","Salas-Eljatib, Christian/0000-0002-8468-0829; Craven, Dylan/0000-0003-3940-833X",,,,,54,6,10,2,42,"UNIV AUSTRAL CHILE, FAC CIENCIAS FORESTALES",VALDIVIA,"CASILLA 567, VALDIVIA, 00000, CHILE",0717-9200,,,BOSQUE,Bosque,,2016,1,,,,3,12,,10.4067/S0717-92002016000100001,http://dx.doi.org/10.4067/S0717-92002016000100001,,,10,Ecology; Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,DJ0XV,,"Green Submitted, Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000373928600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This, in conjunction with the lack of a regionally consistent, quality-controlled surface temperature dataset increases the scientific value of using SST to characterize the regional climate and its trends. This study determines the magnitudes of the long-term SST trends in the Wider Caribbean (WC) and the Antilles. We overcome the presence of discontinuity points in the SST time series using the change point statistical technique. Annual mean SST trends combining the subperiods 1906-1969 and 1972-2005 are 1.32 +/- 0.41 degrees C per century for the Antilles and 1.08 +/- 0.32 degrees C per century for the WC. For the same regions during the subperiod 1972-2005, the corresponding trends are 1.41 +/- 0.68 degrees C per century and 1.18 +/- 0.49 degrees C per century, illustrating the warming intensification during the last four decades. A significant correlation is found between the SSTs in the Caribbean and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) index, suggesting a potential link between Caribbean SSTs and the mechanisms governing the Atlantic basin-wide SSTs. Finally, the capabilities of two state-of-the-art coupled climate models, the Norwegian Earth System Model (NorESM1-M) and the Bergen Climate Model (BCM), to simulate SST in the Caribbean were tested. Both models produce an adequate simulation of the annual mean SST anomalies and SST seasonal cycle for the WC and the Antilles. The simulated annual and monthly mean SSTs are colder in the two models compared to the observations, a common feature among the majority of general circulation models participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5. However, despite these minor deficiencies both BCM and NorESM1-M are considered adequate for conducting SST simulations relevant for future climate change research in the Caribbean.","[Carlos Antuna-Marrero, Juan] Meteorol Inst Cuba, Atmospher Opt Grp Camaguey, Marti 263, Camaguey 70100, Cuba; [Helge Ottera, Odd; Mesquita, Michel D.

While previous studies have attributed this cold bias to local factors such as the elevation difference, coarse resolution, and excessive snow cover, this investigation addresses the potential contributions of the systematic bias of tropical sea surface temperature (SST) to the TP cold bias. Experiments with the NCAR Community Atmosphere Model demonstrate that tropical SST bias results in an apparent cold bias over the TP, especially in boreal winter, and explains about 40% of the deviation in multi-model mean SAT over the TP relative to station observations. Forced by the tropical SST bias, heat flux exhibits an anomalous divergence over the plateau, causing a cooling center in the mid- and lower-troposphere over the TP. This atmospheric cooling in turn leads to a reduction of the downward longwave radiative fluxes reaching the surface, less energy supply, and thus a cold bias over the TP.","[Hu, Xiaoming; Lu, Mengmeng; Yang, Song] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Atmospher Sci, Zhuhai, Peoples R China; [Hu, Xiaoming; Yang, Song] Southern Marine Sci & Engn Guangdong Lab Zhuhai, Zhuhai, Peoples R China; [Li, Zhenning] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Climate Change & Nat Disas, Zhuhai, Peoples R China; [Cai, Ming] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Div Environm & Sustainabil, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Lu, Mengmeng] Florida State Univ, Dept Earth Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Wu, Yuting] Chinese Acad Meteorol Sci, Inst Climate Syst, State Key Lab Severe Weather, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wu, Yuting; Hu, Xiaoming; Yang, Song] Peking Univ, Chongqing Res Inst Big Data, Chongqing, Peoples R China",Sun Yat Sen University; Southern Marine Science & Engineering Guangdong Laboratory; Sun Yat Sen University; Hong Kong University of Science & Technology; State University System of Florida; Florida State University; Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences (CAMS); Chinese Academy of Sciences; Peking University,"Hu, XM; Yang, S (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Atmospher Sci, Zhuhai, Peoples R China.;Hu, XM; Yang, S (corresponding author), Southern Marine Sci & Engn Guangdong Lab Zhuhai, Zhuhai, Peoples R China.;Hu, XM; Yang, S (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Chongqing Res Inst Big Data, Chongqing, Peoples R China.",huxm6@mail.sysu.edu.cn; yangsong3@mail.sysu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [42088101, 42075028]; Guangdong Major Project of Basic and Applied Basic Research [2020B0301030004]; Guangdong Province Key Laboratory for Climate Change and Natural Disaster Studies [2020B1212060025]; Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center for Climate Change",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Guangdong Major Project of Basic and Applied Basic Research; Guangdong Province Key Laboratory for Climate Change and Natural Disaster Studies; Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center for Climate Change,"We would thank Prof. Yi Deng of the Georgia Institute of Technology and Prof. Ziqian Wang of the Sun Yat-sen University for several helpful discussions.

After digesting three articles, students create original artwork (visual art, collage, podcast, play) which they present to their peers. The project makes valuable cross-disciplinary connections to popular sustainability courses and is articulated vertically in the German curriculum, starting in general education and moving upward to each level within the German major. It also connects with an initiative in climate-focused pedagogy in the sustainability community that is active on campus and nationally. German students share their art and the stories behind the art, contributing insights and expertise from the German-speaking world to undergraduates who cannot access these stories themselves in German. In the general education curriculum, the project provides evidence of global learning.

The climate component of CLIMBER-X consists of a 2.5-D semi-empirical statistical- dynamical atmosphere model, a 3-D frictional-geostrophic ocean model, a dynamic-thermodynamic sea ice model and a land surface model. All the model components are discretized on a regular lat-long grid with a horizontal resolution of 5 degrees x 5 degrees. The model has a throughput of similar to 10 000 simulation years per day on a single node with 16 CPUs on a high-performance computer and is designed to simulate the evolution of the Earth system on temporal scales ranging from decades to > 100 000 years. A comprehensive evaluation of the model performance for the present day and the historical period shows that CLIMBER-X is capable of realistically reproducing many observed climate characteristics, with results that generally lie within the range of state-of-the-art general circulation models. The analysis of model performance is complemented by a thorough assessment of climate feedbacks and model sensitivities to changes in external forcings and boundary conditions. Limitations and applicability of the model are critically discussed. CLIMBER-X also includes a detailed representation of the global carbon cycle and is coupled to an ice sheet model, which will be described in separate papers. CLIMBER-X is available as open-source code and is expected to be a useful tool for studying past climate changes and for the investigation of the long-term future evolution of the climate.","[Willeit, Matteo; Ganopolski, Andrey; Robinson, Alexander] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Earth Syst Anal, Potsdam, Germany; [Robinson, Alexander] Univ Complutense Madrid, Fac Phys, Dept Earth Sci & Astrophys, Madrid, Spain; [Robinson, Alexander] UCM, CSIC, Inst Geosciencias, Madrid, Spain; [Robinson, Alexander] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Climate & Global Dynam Lab, Boulder, CO 80305 USA; [Edwards, Neil R.] Open Univ, Environm Earth & Ecosyst, Walton Hall, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, Bucks, England",Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; Complutense University of Madrid; Complutense University of Madrid; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; Open University - UK,"Willeit, M (corresponding author), Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Earth Syst Anal, Potsdam, Germany.",willeit@pik-potsdam.de,"Willeit, Matteo/GWQ-9457-2022","Willeit, Matteo/0000-0003-3998-6404",Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung [PalMod]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [GA 1202/2-1]; Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion [RYC-2016-20587]; Open Access Fund of the Leibniz Association,"Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion(Ministry of Science and Innovation, Spain (MICINN)Instituto de Salud Carlos IIISpanish Government); Open Access Fund of the Leibniz Association","This research has been supported by the Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung (grant no.

J,"Fox, P",,,,"Fox, Paul",,,"Confronting postwar shame: Trauma, heroism and the war art of Otto Dix",OXFORD ART JOURNAL,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"This article explores the terms on which Otto Dix intervened in discourse about the memory and meaning of the First World War in Weimar Germany. Specifically, it deals with how Dix exploited the taboo on trauma that constrained the manner in which the war was addressed in the public sphere. It analyses how Dix's work problematised the debate on the meaning of the war by affirming the virtues of heroic endurance, while simultaneously pointing to the legacy of trauma that was its inheritance. The argument points to the myth of the war that emerged in the 1930s, grounding the war's meaning in the values of mud, blood and futility. It is suggested that the myth has unduly influenced art-historical approaches to Dix's art. Instead, this analysis engages with contemporary concerns about the status of veterans in Weimar culture. It aligns German literary memoirs - particularly Junger's Storm of Steel - with Dix's art, because close analysis suggests that the typical narrative structure of war memoirs is also to be discerned in Dix's work. It is argued that Dix deliberately and repeatedly trod the boundaries of a politicised social taboo by addressing trauma in the context of typical front-line experience. It is argued that although, in an increasingly reactionary political climate, Dix's work came to be interpreted as a deliberate affront to the heroic memory of the German army, Dix continued to argue for an inclusive approach to the memory of the Great War - one that grounded its meaning in both heroism and its psychological consequences.","UCL, London, England",University of London; University College London,"Fox, P (corresponding author), UCL, London, England.",,,,,,,,51,14,14,0,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6540,,,OXFORD ART J,Oxf.

The model includes an interactive sea-ice and land component. SPEEDO is a global earth system model of intermediate complexity. It has a horizontal resolution of T30 (triangular truncation at wave number 30) and 8 vertical layers in the atmosphere, and a horizontal resolution of 2 degrees and 20 levels in the ocean. The parameterisations in SPEEDO are developed in such a way that it is a fast model suitable for large ensembles or long runs (of O(10(4)) years) on a typical current workstation. The model has no flux correction. We compare the mean state and inter-annual variability of the model with observational fields of the atmosphere and ocean. In particular the atmospheric circulation, the mid-latitude patterns of variability and teleconnections from the tropics are well simulated. To show the capabilities of the model, we performed a long control run and an ensemble experiment with enhanced greenhouse gases. The long control run shows that the model is stable. CO2 doubling and future climate change scenario experiments show a climate sensitivity of 1.84 K W-1 m(2), which is within the range of state-of-the-art climate models. The spatial response patterns are comparable to state-of-the-art, higher resolution models. However, for very high greenhouse gas concentrations the parameterisations are not valid. We conclude that the model is suitable for past, current and future climate simulations and for exploring wide parameter ranges and mechanisms of variability. However, as with any model, users should be careful when using the model beyond the range of physical realism of the parameterisations and model setup.","[Severijns, C.

We used the 33-item PMCSQ-2 alongside the Spanish validation form to assess the motivational climate, the CD-RISC to assess resilience and one of the five dimensions of self-concept from the AF-5 to measure self-concept of the judokas. Results: There was negative correlation between task-involved climate and ego-involved climate at semi-professional and amateur performance levels. The task involved climate perceived by individuals performing at different levels how a stronger correlation at semi-professional level (-0.63) followed by amateur level (-0.42). The relationship between ego-involved climate and physical self-concept was particularly prominent at the professional performance level in relation to the other levels.

Conclusions: The findings of this study have practical implications especially for the role of the psychologist in sport that may benefit the athletes they work with by targeting approaches to the physical self-concept of the judo athletes.","[Zurita-Ortega, Felix; Castro-Sanchez, Manuel] Univ Granada, Area Corporal Univ Granada, Granada, Spain; [Muros-Molina, Jose-Joaquin] Univ Nottingham, Sch Med, Nottingham, England; [Rodriguez-Fernandez, Sonia] Univ Granada, Dept Metodos Invest, Granada, Spain; [Zafra-Santos, Edson-Orlando] Univ Santo Tomas, Dept Fisiol, Santiago, Chile; [Knox, Emily] Univ Loughborough, Sch Sport Exercise & Hlth Sci, Loughborough, Leics, England",University of Granada; University of Nottingham; University of Granada; Universidad Santo Tomas; Loughborough University,"Castro-Sanchez, M (corresponding author), Univ Granada, Area Corporal Univ Granada, Granada, Spain.;Castro-Sanchez, M (corresponding author), Univ Granada, Fac Ciencias Educ, Campus Univ Cartuja, E-18071 Granada, Spain.",manue87@correo.ugr.es,"Ortega, Felix Zurita/I-9017-2017; Knox, Emily/Q-4558-2018; Muros, José/Q-9540-2019","Ortega, Felix Zurita/0000-0002-1189-894X; Knox, Emily/0000-0001-8155-9428; Muros, José/0000-0001-7573-0399",,,,,70,13,13,3,31,"INT SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION, INC",MELVILLE,"150 BROADHOLLOW RD, STE 114, MELVILLE, NY 11747 USA",1643-8698,,,ARCH BUDO,Arch.

In this work the three-dimensional distribution of specific humidity in state-of-the-art climate models is compared to measurements from the AIRS satellite system. We find the majority of models have a pattern of drier than observed conditions (by 10-25%) in the tropics below 800 hPa, but 25-100% too moist conditions between 300 and 600 hPa, especially in the extra-tropics. Analysis of the accuracy and sampling biases of the AIRS measurements suggests that these differences are due to systematic model errors, which might affect the model-estimated range of climate warming anticipated over the next century.","Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, Div Climate Res, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA 91109 USA; Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, Program Climat Model Diag & Intercomparison, Livermore, CA 94550 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego; Scripps Institution of Oceanography; California Institute of Technology; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL); United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory,"Pierce, DW (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, Div Climate Res, Mail Stop 0224, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",dpierce@ucsd.edu,"Gleckler, Peter/H-4762-2012","Gleckler, Peter/0000-0003-2816-6224",,,,,20,49,49,1,5,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",0094-8276,1944-8007,,GEOPHYS RES LETT,Geophys.

Location Continental China. Methods Using the dynamic land ecosystem model (DLEM) in conjunction with 10-km-resolution gridded historical data sets (tropospheric O-3 concentrations, climate variability/change, and other environmental factors such as land-cover/land-use change (LCLUC), increasing CO2 and nitrogen deposition), we conducted nine simulation experiments to: (1) investigate the temporo-spatial patterns of NPP and NCE in China's forest ecosystems from 1961-2005; and (2) quantify the effects of tropospheric O-3 pollution alone or in combination with climate variability and other environmental stresses on forests' NPP and NCE. Results China's forests acted as a carbon sink during 1961-2005 as a result of the combined effects of O-3, climate, CO2, nitrogen deposition and LCLUC. However, simulated results indicated that elevated O-3 caused a 7.7% decrease in national carbon storage, with O-3-induced reductions in NCE (Pg C year-1) ranging from 0.4-43.1% among different forest types. Sensitivity experiments showed that climate change was the dominant factor in controlling changes in temporo-spatial patterns of annual NPP. The combined negative effects of O-3 pollution and climate change on NPP and NCE could be largely offset by the positive fertilization effects of nitrogen deposition and CO2. Main conclusions In the future, tropospheric O-3 should be taken into account in order to fully understand the variations of carbon sequestration capacity of forests and assess the vulnerability of forest ecosystems to climate change and air pollution. Reducing air pollution in China is likely to increase the resilience of forests to climate change. This paper offers the first estimate of how prevention of air pollution can help to increase forest productivity and carbon sequestration in China's forested ecosystems.","[Ren, Wei; Tian, Hanqin; Tao, Bo; Lu, Chaoqun; Liu, Mingliang; Chen, Guangsheng; Xu, Xiaofeng] Auburn Univ, Sch Forestry & Wildlife Sci, Ecosyst Dynam & Global Ecol Lab, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Ren, Wei; Tian, Hanqin; Tao, Bo; Chappelka, Art; Lu, Chaoqun; Liu, Mingliang; Chen, Guangsheng; Xu, Xiaofeng] Auburn Univ, Int Ctr Climate & Global Change Res, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Sun, Ge] US Forest Serv, USDA, So Res Stn, Eastern Forest Environm Threat Assessment Ctr, Raleigh, NC 27606 USA",Auburn University System; Auburn University; Auburn University System; Auburn University; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service,"Tian, HQ (corresponding author), Auburn Univ, Sch Forestry & Wildlife Sci, Ecosyst Dynam & Global Ecol Lab, 602 Duncan Dr, Auburn, AL 36849 USA.",tianhan@auburn.edu,"Chen, Guangsheng/AAC-4462-2022; Tian, Hanqin/A-6484-2012; Lu, Chaoqun/D-6694-2018; Liu, Mingliang/B-1361-2009; Lu, Chaoqun/A-6497-2012; Sun, Ge/ABF-6673-2020; Ren, Wei/I-4048-2014; Xu, Xiaofeng/B-2391-2008; Lu, Chaoqun/HCH-9102-2022; Ren, Wei/G-8317-2016; TAO, BO/I-4166-2014; Xu, Xiaofeng/Y-3672-2019","Tian, Hanqin/0000-0002-1806-4091; Lu, Chaoqun/0000-0002-1526-0513; Liu, Mingliang/0000-0002-1963-5933; Ren, Wei/0000-0002-4840-4835; Xu, Xiaofeng/0000-0002-6553-6514; Lu, Chaoqun/0000-0002-1526-0513; Xu, Xiaofeng/0000-0002-6553-6514","NASA [NNG04GM39C, NNX08AL73G_S01]; Chinese Academy of Science",NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); Chinese Academy of Science(Chinese Academy of Sciences),"This study has been supported by NASA IDS Program (NNG04GM39C), NASA LCLUC Program (NNX08AL73G_S01) and the Chinese Academy of Science.

This paper argues that governance scholars can learn much from organisation theory, more specifically regarding the conceptualisation of change and intervention strategies. We reconceptualise the divide between transformational change and incremental change by questioning the feasibility of changes that are concurrently in-depth, large scale, and quick; and the assumption that incremental change is necessarily slow and can only result in superficial changes. To go beyond this dichotomy, we introduce the conceptualisation of continuous transformational change. Resulting intervention strategies include (1) providing basic conditions for enabling small in-depth wins; (2) amplifying small wins through sensemaking, coupling, and integrating; and (3) unblocking stagnations by confronting social and cognitive fixations with counterintuitive interventions. These interventions necessitate a modest leadership. Governing transformational change thus requires transformation of the governance systems themselves.","[Termeer, Catrien J. A.

Thus, capturing fuel and fire dynamics is critical for projecting Earth system processes in warmer and drier future. Recent advances in fire regime modeling have linked land surface models with fire behavior models. Such models often rely on fine surface fuels to drive fire behavior and effects, and while many models can simulate processes that control how these fuels change through time (i.e., fine fuel accumulation), fuel loading estimates remain highly uncertain, largely due to uncertainties in the algorithms controlling decomposition. Uncertainties are often amplified in climate change forecasts when initial conditions and feedbacks are not well represented. The goal of this review is to highlight fine fuel decomposition as a key uncertainty in model systems. We review the current understanding of mechanisms controlling decomposition, describe how they are incorporated into models, and evaluate the uncertainties associated with different approaches. We also use three state-of-the-art land surface fire regime models to demonstrate the sensitivity of decomposition and subsequent wildfire projections to both parameter and model structure uncertainty and show that sensitivity can increase substantially under future climate warming. Given that many of the governing decomposition equations are based on individual case studies from a single location, and because key parameters are often hard coded, critical uncertainties are currently ignored. It is essential to be transparent about these uncertainties as the domain of land surface models is expanded to include the evaluation of future wildfire regimes.","[Hanan, Erin J.; Ren, Jianning] Univ Nevada, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Sci, Reno, NV 89557 USA; [Kennedy, Maureen C.] Univ Washington Tacoma, Sch Interdisciplinary Arts & Sci, Sci & Math, Tacoma, WA USA; [Johnson, Morris C.] US Forest Serv, USDA, Pacific Northwest Res Stn, Seattle, WA USA; [Smith, Alistair M.

To avoid production losses and make use of emerging potentials, adaptations in agricultural management will inevitably be required. Adaptation responses can broadly be distinguished into (1) short-term incremental responses that farmers often choose autonomously in response to observed changes and based on local knowledge and experiences, and (2) long-term transformative responses that require strategic planning, and which are usually implemented at a larger spatial scale. Models can be used to support decision making at both response levels; thereby, different features of models prove more or less valuable depending on the type of adaptation response. This paper presents a systematic literature review on the state-of-the-art in modelling for adaptation planning in agricultural production systems, investigating the question of which model types can be distinguished and how these types differ in the way they support decision making in agricultural adaptation planning. Five types of models are distinguished: (1) empirical crop models; (2) regional suitability models; (3) biophysical models; (4) meta-models; and (5) decision models. The potential and limitations of these model types for providing decision-support to short-and long-term adaptation planning are discussed. The risk of maladaptation-adaptation that implies negative consequences either in the long term or in a wider context-is identified as a key challenge of adaptation planning that needs more attention. Maladaptation is not only a risk of decision making in the face of incomplete knowledge of future climate impacts on the agricultural production system; but it can also be a threat if the connectedness of the agroecosystem is not sufficiently acknowledged when management adaptations are implemented. Future research supporting climate change adaptation efforts should thus be based on integrated assessments of risk and vulnerabilities (considering climate variability and uncertainty). To secure adaptation success in the long term, frameworks for monitoring management adaptations and their consequences should be institutionalised.","[Holzkamper, Annelie] Agroscope, Climate & Air Pollut Grp, Agroecol & Environm Dept, Reckenholzstr 191, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland; [Holzkamper, Annelie] Univ Bern, Oeschger Ctr Climate Change Res, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Research Station Agroscope; University of Bern,"Holzkamper, A (corresponding author), Agroscope, Climate & Air Pollut Grp, Agroecol & Environm Dept, Reckenholzstr 191, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland.;Holzkamper, A (corresponding author), Univ Bern, Oeschger Ctr Climate Change Res, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland.",annelie.holzkaemper@agroscope.admin.ch,,,,,,,76,21,21,1,17,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2077-0472,,AGRICULTURE-BASEL,Agriculture-Basel,OCT,2017,10,,,,,,86,10.3390/agriculture7100086,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture7100086,,,15,Agronomy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,FT9SW,,"gold, Green Published",,,12/21/22,WOS:000423492800008,View Full Record in Web of Science

If these advanced gas production technologies were to be deployed globally, the energy market could see a large influx of economically competitive unconventional gas resources(2). The climate implications of such abundant natural gas have been hotly debated. Some researchers have observed that abundant natural gas substituting for coal could reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions(3-6). Others have reported that the non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions associated with shale gas production make its lifecycle emissions higher than those of coal(7,8). Assessment of the full impact of abundant gas on climate change requires an integrated approach to the global energyeconomyclimate systems, but the literature has been limited in either its geographic scope(9,10) or its coverage of greenhouse gases(2). Here we show that market-driven increases in global supplies of unconventional natural gas do not discernibly reduce the trajectory of greenhouse gas emissions or climate forcing. Our results, based on simulations from five state-of-the-art integrated assessment models(11) of energyeconomyclimate systems independently forced by an abundant gas scenario, project large additional natural gas consumption of up to +170 per cent by 2050. The impact on CO2 emissions, however, is found to be much smaller (from -2 per cent to +11 per cent), and a majority of the models reported a small increase in climate forcing (from -0.3 per cent to +7 per cent) associated with the increased use of abundant gas. Our results show that although market penetration of globally abundant gas may substantially change the future energy system, it is not necessarily an effective substitute for climate change mitigation policy(9,10).","[McJeon, Haewon; Edmonds, Jae; Clarke, Leon] Pacific NW Natl Lab, JGCRI, College Pk, MD 20740 USA; [Bauer, Nico; Hilaire, Jerome] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany; [Fisher, Brian; Mi, Raymond] BAEconomics, Kingston, ACT 2604, Australia; [Flannery, Brian P.] Resources Future Inc, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Krey, Volker; Riahi, Keywan; Rogner, Holger] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria; [Marangoni, Giacomo; Tavoni, Massimo] Ctr Euromediterraneo Cambiamenti Climat, I-20156 Milan, Italy; [Marangoni, Giacomo; Tavoni, Massimo] Politecn Milan, I-20156 Milan, Italy",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Pacific Northwest National Laboratory; Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; Resources for the Future; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); Polytechnic University of Milan,"McJeon, H (corresponding author), Pacific NW Natl Lab, JGCRI, 5825 Univ Res Court,Suite 3500, College Pk, MD 20740 USA.",haewon.mcjeon@pnnl.gov,"Krey, Volker/ABD-5070-2021; Riahi, Keywan/B-6426-2011; Marangoni, Giacomo/AAV-1668-2021","Riahi, Keywan/0000-0001-7193-3498; Marangoni, Giacomo/0000-0003-3994-380X; Flannery, Brian/0000-0002-3318-8068; Krey, Volker/0000-0003-0307-3515; McJeon, Haewon/0000-0003-0348-5704; tavoni, massimo/0000-0001-5069-4707; Hilaire, Jerome/0000-0002-9879-6339","BAEconomics; Global Technology Strategy Project; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research; Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research; Italian Ministry of Environment, Land and Sea under the GEMINA project","BAEconomics; Global Technology Strategy Project; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR)); Italian Ministry of Environment, Land and Sea under the GEMINA project(Ministry of Environment (ME), Republic of Korea)","B.F. and R.M. and their development of BAEGEM were supported by BAEconomics with assistance for special applications to the resource sector from Rio Tinto (Australia).

Work on the principles of place making attracts less attention and is more ambiguous, with environmental architecture and green infrastructure principles apparently at variance with conventional principles of urban design. The requirements of environmental and social sustainability seem to be pulling in opposite directions. The paper discusses promising lines of work, concluding that tried-and-tested urban design typologies may have a new lease of life in addressing climate change mitigation and adaptation.","[Hebbert, Michael] Univ Manchester, Sch Environm & Dev, Town Planning, Arthur Lewis Bldg, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England",University of Manchester,"Hebbert, M (corresponding author), Univ Manchester, Sch Environm & Dev, Town Planning, Arthur Lewis Bldg, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",michael.hebbert@manchester.ac.uk,"Hebbert, Michael/B-7549-2013","Hebbert, Michael/0000-0003-1348-0595",,,,,48,8,8,0,1,LIVERPOOL UNIV PRESS,LIVERPOOL,"4 CAMBRIDGE ST, LIVERPOOL L69 7ZU, ENGLAND",0041-0020,1478-341X,,TOWN PLAN REV,Town Plan.

An analysis and prediction of thermal-comfort using DesignBuilder, based on the state-of-the-art building performance simulation software Energy-Plus, is carried out in an air-conditioned multi-storeyed building in the city of Rockhampton in Central Queensland, Australia. Rockhampton is located in a hot humid-region; therefore, indoor thermal-comfort is strongly affected by the outdoor climate. This study evaluates the actual thermal conditions of the Information Technology Division (ITD) building at Central Queensland University during winter and summer seasons and identifies the thermal comfort level of the occupants using low-energy cooling technologies namely, chilled ceiling (CC), economiser usages and pre-cooling. The Fanger comfort-model, Pierce two-node model and KSU two-node model were used to predict thermal performance of the building. A sophisticated building-analysis tool was integrated with the thermal comfort models for determining appropriate cooling-technologies for the occupants to be thermally comfortable while achieving sufficient energy savings. This study compares the predicted mean-vote (PMV) index on a seven-point thermal-sensation scale, calculated using the effective temperature and relative humidity for those cooling techniques. Simulated results show that systems using a chilled ceiling offer the best thermal comfort for the occupants during summer and winter in subtropical climates. The validity of the simulation results was checked with measured values of temperature and humidity for typical days in both summer and winter. The predicted results show a reasonable agreement with the measured data. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Chowdhury, Ashfaque Ahmed; Rasul, M. G.; Khan, M. M.

Two state-of-the-art global climate models (GCMs) are dynamically downscaled using a regional climate model (RCM) interactively coupled to a one-dimensional lake model, and then a hydrologic routing model is forced with time series of perturbed NBS. The dynamical downscaling and coupling with a lake model to represent the Great Lakes create added value beyond the parent GCM in terms of simulated seasonal cycles of temperature, precipitation, and surface fluxes. However, limitations related to this rudimentary treatment of the Great Lakes result in warm summer biases in lake temperatures, excessive ice cover, and an abnormally early peak in lake evaporation. While the downscaling of both GCMs led to consistent projections of increases in annual air temperature, precipitation, and all NBS components (overlake precipitation, basinwide runoff, and lake evaporation), the resulting projected water level trends are opposite in sign. Clearly, it is not sufficient to correctly simulate the signs of the projected change in each NBS component; one must also account for their relative magnitudes. The potential risk of more frequent episodes of lake levels below the low water datum, a critical shipping threshold, is explored.","[Notaro, Michael; Bennington, Val] Univ Wisconsin, Nelson Inst Ctr Climat Res, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Lofgren, Brent] NOAA, Great Lakes Environm Res Lab, Ann Arbor, MI 48105 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Notaro, M (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Nelson Inst Ctr Climat Res, 1225 West Dayton St, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",mnotaro@wisc.edu,,"Lofgren, Brent/0000-0003-2189-0914",NOAA Climate Change Data and Detection; NOAA/GLERL; Michigan Department of Natural Resources (from Environmental Protection Agency); National Science Foundation,NOAA Climate Change Data and Detection; NOAA/GLERL(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); Michigan Department of Natural Resources (from Environmental Protection Agency); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This study was funded by NOAA Climate Change Data and Detection, NOAA/GLERL, and Michigan Department of Natural Resources (from Environmental Protection Agency funding).

The incorporation of water resources modeling into integrated assessment models (IAMs) to study climate-hydrology processes, related water impacts and adaptation options is thus an area of interest, yet it poses a number of methodological challenges. In particular, models of economic activity, climate, water availability and use, and adaptation are developed at differing temporal and spatial scales and with different goals. This makes their integration highly complex and computationally demanding. In this review we highlight a set of modeling challenges in water resource systems, describe the state of the art of approaches to integrating water resources modeling with IAMs and economic modeling, and identify constraints and opportunities moving forward in the development of water resources modeling within the JAM frameworks.

This work examines near-surface-pressure tides in climate models that contributed to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC); it compares them with tides both from observations and from the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM), which extends from the earth's surface to the thermosphere. Surprising consistency is found among observations and all model simulations, despite variation of the altitudes of model upper boundaries from 32 to 76 km in the IPCC models and at 135 km for WACCM. These results are consistent with previous suggestions that placing a model's upper boundary at low altitude leads to partly compensating errors such as reducing the forcing of the tides by ozone heating, but also introducing spurious waves at the upper boundary, which propagate to the surface.","[Covey, Curt] Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, Program Climate Model Diag & Intercomparison, Livermore, CA USA; [Dai, Aiguo; Marsh, Dan] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [Lindzen, Richard S.] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Covey, C (corresponding author), LLNL Mail Code L-103,7000 East Ave, Livermore, CA 94550 USA.",covey1@llnl.gov,"Marsh, Daniel/A-8406-2008; Dai, Aiguo/D-3487-2009; Dai, Aiguo/Y-2443-2019","Marsh, Daniel/0000-0001-6699-494X; ","Office of Science, U.S. Department of Energy, by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory [DE-AC52-07NA27344]; National Science Foundation","Office of Science, U.S. Department of Energy, by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF))","We are grateful to many colleagues for comments on preliminary accounts of these results, in particular to E.

Here, we focus on the weighted supermodel - the supermodel's time derivative is a weighted superposition of the time derivatives of the imperfect models, referred to as weighted supermodeling. A crucial step is to train the weights of the supermodel on the basis of historical observations. Here, we apply two different training methods to a supermodel of up to four different versions of the global atmosphere-ocean-land model SPEEDO. The standard version is regarded as truth. The first training method is based on an idea called cross pollination in time (CPT), where models exchange states during the training. The second method is a synchronization-based learning rule, originally developed for parameter estimation. We demonstrate that both training methods yield climate simulations and weather predictions of superior quality as compared to the individual model versions. Supermodel predictions also outperform predictions based on the commonly used multi-model ensemble (MME) mean. Furthermore, we find evidence that negative weights can improve predictions in cases where model errors do not cancel (for instance, all models are warm with respect to the truth). In principle, the proposed training schemes are applicable to state-of-the-art models and historical observations. A prime advantage of the proposed training schemes is that in the present context relatively short training periods suffice to find good solutions. Additional work needs to be done to assess the limitations due to incomplete and noisy data, to combine models that are structurally different (different resolution and state representation, for instance) and to evaluate cases for which the truth falls outside of the model class.","[Schevenhoven, Francine; Carrassi, Alberto; Keenlyside, Noel] Univ Bergen, Inst Geophys, Bergen, Norway; [Schevenhoven, Francine; Carrassi, Alberto; Keenlyside, Noel] Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, Bergen, Norway; [Selten, Frank] Royal Netherlands Meteorol Inst, De Bilt, Netherlands; [Carrassi, Alberto] Nansen Environm & Remote Sensing Ctr, Bergen, Norway; [Carrassi, Alberto] Univ Utrecht, Math Inst, Utrecht, Netherlands",University of Bergen; Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research; Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute; Nansen Environmental & Remote Sensing Center (NERSC); Utrecht University,"Schevenhoven, F (corresponding author), Univ Bergen, Inst Geophys, Bergen, Norway.;Schevenhoven, F (corresponding author), Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, Bergen, Norway.",francine.schevenhoven@uib.no,"Keenlyside, Noel S/E-8303-2013","Keenlyside, Noel S/0000-0002-8708-6868; Carrassi, Alberto/0000-0003-0722-5600",H2020 European Research Council [STERCP (648982)],H2020 European Research Council,This research has been supported by the H2020 European Research Council (grant no.

Taking Chenzhou as the research object, eight urban spatial form elements and land cover elements are calculated respectively through ArcGIS, Skyhelios and ENVI software.

Afterwards, the land surface temperature (LST) of different local climate zones in the four seasons from 2017 to 2018 is further analyzed using one-way ANOVA F-test and Student's t-test. The results suggest that: (1) by adding localized LCZ classes and applying the semi-automatic algorithm on the Arc-GIS platform, the final overall accuracy reaches 69.54%, with a kappa value of 0.67, (2) the compact middle-rise buildings (LCZ-2') and open low-rise buildings (LCZ-6) heavily contribute to the high LST of the downtown area, while the large low-rise buildings (LCZ-8) cause the high LST regions in the eastern part of the town, (3) obvious land surface temperature differences can be detected in four seasons among different LCZ classes, with high LST in summer and autumn.

Yet, the impact of anthropogenic warming on household air conditioning is largely unaccounted for in the operation and planning of energy grids. Here, by leveraging the state-of-the-art in machine learning and climate model projections, we find substantial increases in future residential air conditioning demand across the U.S.-up to 8% with a range of 5%-8.5% (13% with a range of 11%-15%) after anthropogenic warming of 1.5 degrees C (2.0 degrees C) in global mean temperature. To offset this climate-induced demand, an increase in the efficiency of air conditioners by as much as 8% (+/- 4.5%) compared to current levels is needed; without this daunting technological effort, we estimate that some states will face supply inadequacies of up to 75 million household-days (i.e., nearly half a month per average current household) without air conditioning in a 2.0 degrees C warmer world. In the absence of effective climate mitigation and technological adaptation strategies, the U.S. will face substantial increases in air conditioning demand and, in the event of supply inadequacies, there is increased risk of leaving millions without access to space cooling during extreme temperatures. Plain Language Summary Climate change is leading to increased temperatures around the world. As temperatures rise, the demand for air conditioning increases accordingly, as people strive to keep cool. While the general pattern of projected changes is intuitive (i.e., higher temperatures lead to increased air conditioning use), the specific changes that will be experienced by households is not well understood. Here, we utilize a machine learning model to project changes to household-level air conditioning demand over the contiguous United States. Our results show significant increases to air conditioning demand in projected warming world of 1.5 and 2.0 degrees C levels above pre-industrial ones. In particular, households are projected to experience 8% more air conditioning after surpassing the 1.5 degrees C threshold and up to 13% more after the 2.0 degrees C threshold, when compared to the baseline (2005-2019). We then discuss the implications of these projected changes on possible increase in air conditioner efficiency that would effectively counteract climate-induced increases. In the event that these climate-induced changes are not accounted for, we find that, in some states, the average household could face up to 14 days without air conditioning in a given summer in the 2.0 degrees C warmer world. This will disproportionately impact marginalized communities that are especially vulnerable to heat-related disasters and subsequent health impacts.","[Obringer, Renee] Univ Maryland, Natl Socioenvironm Synth Ctr, Annapolis, MD 21401 USA; [Obringer, Renee; Maia-Silva, Debora] Purdue Univ, Environm & Ecol Engn, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Nateghi, Roshanak] Purdue Univ, Sch Ind Engn, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Nateghi, Roshanak] Purdue Univ, Purdue Climate Change Res Ctr, W Lafayette, IN USA; [Nateghi, Roshanak] Purdue Univ, Purdue Ctr Environm, W Lafayette, IN USA; [Mukherjee, Sayanti] State Univ NY, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Buffalo, NY USA; [Cr, Vineeth] Cequence Secur Inc, Sunnyvale, CA USA; [McRoberts, Douglas Brent] Ohio State Univ, Dept Geog, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Kumar, Rohini] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Computat Hydrosyst, Leipzig, Germany",Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Buffalo; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ),"Obringer, R (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Natl Socioenvironm Synth Ctr, Annapolis, MD 21401 USA.;Obringer, R (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, Environm & Ecol Engn, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.;Kumar, R (corresponding author), UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Computat Hydrosyst, Leipzig, Germany.",obringer@umd.edu; rohini.kumar@ufz.de,"Kumar, Rohini/B-2299-2013","Kumar, Rohini/0000-0002-4396-2037; Maia-Silva, Debora/0000-0003-0117-200X","NSF [DBI-1639145, 1826161, 1832688]; National Socio-Environmental Synthesis Center (SESYNC) from the NSF grant [DBI-1639145]; Graduate School at Purdue University; Bilsland Dissertation Fellowship; Purdue University Center for the Environment; Purdue Climate Change Research Center; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) [01LS1201A]; Projekt DEAL",NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); National Socio-Environmental Synthesis Center (SESYNC) from the NSF grant; Graduate School at Purdue University; Bilsland Dissertation Fellowship; Purdue University Center for the Environment; Purdue Climate Change Research Center; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); Projekt DEAL,"The authors would like to acknowledge support from NSF grants #1826161 & #1832688, as well as the National Socio-Environmental Synthesis Center (SESYNC) under funding received from the NSF grant #DBI-1639145.

The change in local population size in the centre of the distribution of beech has a small effect on the genetic diversity of beech, which is projected to maintain its current population size or to increase in population size. Thus, an adaptive response of functional traits of small populations at the leading and trailing edges of the distribution is possible based on genetic diversity available in the local population, even within a period of 2-3 generations. We conclude that the adaptive responses of key functional traits should not be ignored in climate change impact assessment on beech. Adaptation to the local environment may lead to genetic and phenotypic structured populations over the species area already in few generations, depending on the forest management system applied. We recommend taking local differentiation into account in a future generation of process-based species area models. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

However, efficient techniques for featuring conifer phenology are still lacking. In fact, characterizing conifer phenological variations have long been an issue, because conifers tend to show hard-to-discern changes in terms of no matter color or crown morphology for different seasons. To address this conventional conifer issue, this study attempted the state-of-the-art remote sensing technology of mobile terrestrial light detection and ranging (LiDAR) (also termed as mobile terrestrial laser scanning, MLS) to reflect the seasonal-scale phenological variations of conifers, specifically in a case of Scots pines (Pinus sylvestris) growing under the Mediterranean climate in Perth, Australia. The MLS-collected data shows that for the conifers growing under different temperature and precipitation conditions, lasers, in a statistical sense, behave with different penetrations into their crowns. In light of this phenomenon, a new seasonal-scale conifer phenological indicator (CsPI) was proposed, i.e. the ratio between the average of the horizontal penetration distances for the entire laser points backscattered from a crown and its diameter calculated along with the horizontal direction of laser incidence. The performance of the newly-proposed CsPI was assessed by the means of meta-analysis, i.e. comparing the CsPI-indicated conifer response to seasonal climate changes in Perth with the derived rule of stem radial growth rates at different seasons in Mesic, Spain, both in the Mediterranean climate scenarios. The correlations with positive results showed that the proposed schematic plan of applying MLS and the developed phenological indicator both are validated, and this study has opened a new way for reflecting the seasonal-scale phenological variations of conifers.

They can affect regional climate and strongly influence the dispersion and distribution of marine species. Using state-of-the-art climate models from the latest and previous Climate Model Intercomparison Projects, we evaluate upper ocean circulation and examine future projections, focusing on subtropical and low-latitude WBCs. Despite their coarse resolution, climate models successfully reproduce most large-scale circulation features with ensemble mean transports typically within the range of observational uncertainty, although there is often a large spread across the models and some currents are systematically too strong or weak. Despite considerable differences in model structure, resolution and parameterisations, many currents show highly consistent projected changes across the models. For example, the East Australian Current, Brazil Current and Agulhas Current extensions are projected to intensify, while the Gulf Stream, Indonesian Throughflow and Agulhas Current are projected to weaken. Intermodel differences in most future circulation changes can be explained in part by projected changes in the large-scale surface winds. In moving to the latest model generation, despite structural model advancements, we find little systematic improvement in the simulation of ocean transports nor major differences in the projected changes.","[Sen Gupta, Alex; Stellema, Annette; Taschetto, Andrea S.] Univ New South Wales, Climate Change Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Sen Gupta, Alex; Stellema, Annette; Taschetto, Andrea S.] Univ New South Wales, Australian Res Council Ctr Excellence Climate Ext, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Sen Gupta, Alex; Stellema, Annette; Verges, Adriana] Univ New South Wales, Ctr Marine Sci & Innovat, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Pontes, Gabriel M.] Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Oceanog, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Verges, Adriana] UNSW Australia, Ctr Marine Sci & Innovat, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Verges, Adriana] UNSW Australia, Evolut & Ecol Res Ctr, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Rossi, Vincent] Univ Toulon & Var, Aix Marseille Univ, Mediterranean Inst Oceanog, CNRS,UM 110,UMR 7294,IRD, F-13288 Marseille, France",University of New South Wales Sydney; University of New South Wales Sydney; University of New South Wales Sydney; Universidade de Sao Paulo; University of New South Wales Sydney; University of New South Wales Sydney; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Earth Sciences & Astronomy (INSU); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); UDICE-French Research Universities; Aix-Marseille Universite; Universite de Toulon,"Sen Gupta, A (corresponding author), Univ New South Wales, Climate Change Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW, Australia.;Sen Gupta, A (corresponding author), Univ New South Wales, Australian Res Council Ctr Excellence Climate Ext, Sydney, NSW, Australia.;Sen Gupta, A (corresponding author), Univ New South Wales, Ctr Marine Sci & Innovat, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",a.sengupta@unsw.edu.au,"Gupta, Alexander R Sen/B-7995-2011; Rossi, Vincent/AAL-9090-2021; Pontes, Gabriel M./ABG-2851-2021; Verges, Adriana/B-8288-2013; Pontes, Gabriel/Q-2389-2016","Gupta, Alexander R Sen/0000-0001-5226-871X; Rossi, Vincent/0000-0001-7291-0415; Verges, Adriana/0000-0002-3507-1234; Stellema, Annette/0000-0001-8370-2662; Taschetto, Andrea/0000-0001-6020-1603; Pontes, Gabriel/0000-0003-4397-4238","SEAMoBB project (Solutions for sEmi-Automated Monitoring of Benthic Biodiversity) - European ERA-Net Mar-TERA; international OFC project (Ocean Front CHANGE) - Belmont Forum; ANR [ANR-17-MART-0001-02, ANR-20-BFOC-0006-04]",SEAMoBB project (Solutions for sEmi-Automated Monitoring of Benthic Biodiversity) - European ERA-Net Mar-TERA; international OFC project (Ocean Front CHANGE) - Belmont Forum; ANR(French National Research Agency (ANR)),"V.R. acknowledge funding support from (i) the SEAMoBB project (Solutions for sEmi-Automated Monitoring of Benthic Biodiversity), funded by European ERA-Net Mar-TERA (id. 145) and managed by ANR (grant no.

There is a positive trend in monthly time series SSTs, with a maximum value of about 0.7 degrees C/decade for the western side of the Gulf. This high trend of SST is associated with significant coral reef bleaching and it coincides with major climate/ocean interactions. Most of the Arabian countries along the Gulf have coastal developments at low-land areas of high vulnerability to sea level rise.

Climate extremes such as droughts, heat waves, or heavy precipitation events can cause substantial changes in terrestrial C fluxes. On the other hand, extreme changes in C fluxes are often, but not always, driven by extreme climate conditions. Here we present an analysis of how extremes in temperature and precipitation, and extreme changes in terrestrial C fluxes are related to each other in 10 state-of-the-art terrestrial carbon models, all driven by the same climate forcing. We use model outputs from the North American Carbon Program Multi-scale Synthesis and Terrestrial Model Intercomparison Project (MsTMIP). A global-scale analysis shows that both droughts and heat waves translate into anomalous net releases of CO2 from the land surface via different mechanisms: Droughts largely decrease gross primary production (GPP) and to a lower extent total respiration (TR), while heat waves slightly decrease GPP but increase TR. Cold and wet periods have a smaller opposite effect. Analyzing extremes in C fluxes reveals that extreme changes in GPP and TR are often caused by strong shifts in water availability, but for extremes in TR shifts in temperature are also important. Extremes in net CO2 exchange are equally strongly driven by deviations in temperature and precipitation. Models mostly agree on the sign of the C flux response to climate extremes, but model spread is large. In tropical forests, C cycle extremes are driven by water availability, whereas in boreal forests temperature plays a more important role. Models are particularly uncertain about the C flux response to extreme heat in boreal forests.","[Zscheischler, Jakob; Mahecha, Miguel D.; Reichstein, Markus] Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, D-07745 Jena, Germany;

Mortality estimates for the year 2000 from the World Health Organization (WHO) indicate, however, that a dozen other risk factors contribute more to global mortality and global burden of disease. Moreover, the state-of-the-art British-sponsored fast track assessments (FTAs) of the global impacts of climate change show that through 2085-2100, climate change would contribute less to human health and environmental threats than other risk factors. Climate change is, therefore, unlikely to be the 21(st) century's most important environmental problem. Combining the FTA results with WHO's mortality estimates indicates that halting climate change would reduce cumulative mortality from hunger, malaria, and coastal flooding, by 4-10 percent in 2085 while the Kyoto Protocol would lower it by 0.4-1 percent. FTA results also show that reducing climate change will increase populations-at-risk from water stress and, possibly, threats to biodiversity. But adaptive measures focused specifically on reducing vulnerability to climate sensitive threats would reduce cumulative mortality by 50-75 percent at a fraction of the Kyoto Protocol's cost without adding to risks from water stress or to biodiversity. Such focused adaptation would, moreover, reduce major hurdles to the developing world's sustainable economic development, lack of which is the major reason for its vulnerability to climate change (and any other form of adversity). Thus, focused adaptation can combat climate change and advance global well-being, particularly of the world's most vulnerable populations, more effectively than aggressive GHG reductions. Alternatively, these benefits and more - reductions in poverty, and infant and maternal mortality by 50-75%; increased access to safe water and sanitation; and universal literacy - can be obtained by broadly advancing sustainable economic development through policies, institutions and measures (such as those that would meet the UN Millennium Development Goals) at a cost approximating that of the Kyoto Protocol. However, in order to deal with climate change beyond the 20852100 timeframe, the paper also recommends expanding research and development of mitigation options, reducing barriers to implementing such options, and active science and monitoring programs to provide early warning of any dangerous climate change impacts.","US Dept Interior, Off Policy Anal, Washington, DC 20240 USA",United States Department of the Interior,"Goklany, IM (corresponding author), US Dept Interior, Off Policy Anal, Washington, DC 20240 USA.",,,,,,,,48,5,5,0,21,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0958-305X,2048-4070,,ENERG ENVIRON-UK,Energy Environ.,JUL,2009,3,,,,279,302,,10.1260/095830509788066439,http://dx.doi.org/10.1260/095830509788066439,,,24,Environmental Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,V16ZJ,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000207907200002,View Full Record in Web of Science

There is a wide range of hydrology models using lumped conceptual approaches all the way to more physically based distributed algorithms. Most of these models come with a steep learning curve before they can be used efficiently by the end user, and they can be tricky to calibrate appropriately. Only a small number of hydrology models can be considered easy to set up and use, and even fewer provide their source code for easy modification to be tailored to individual needs. These drawbacks make it difficult to use these models in educational applications. The goal of this paper is to introduce a very simple, yet efficient, lumped-conceptual hydrological model designed to address the above problems. The MATLAB-based HMETS hydrological model is simple and can be easily and quickly set up on a new watershed, including automatic calibration using state of the art optimization algorithms. Despite its simplicity, the model has proved to perform well against two other lumped-conceptual hydrological models over 320 watersheds. HMETS obtained a median Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency of 0.72 in validation, compared to 0.64 for MOHYSE (similar structure) and 0.77 for HSAMI (more complex structure). The model's source code is freely available and includes an optional simplified user interface. A climate change impacts simulation tool using the constant scaling downscaling method is also incorporated to the interface. HMETS has been tested in the Construction Engineering Final-Year Project for a group of 60 undergraduate students.","[Martel, Jean-Luc; Brissette, Francois; Poulin, Annie] Ecole Technol Super, 1100 Notre Dame West St, Montreal, PQ H3C 1K3, Canada; [Demeester, Kenjy] Ecole Polytech Montreal, 2900 Blvd Edouard Monpetit, Montreal, PQ H3T 1J4, Canada; [Arsenault, Richard] Rio Tinto, Quebec Power Operat, 1954 Davis St, Jonquiere, PQ G7S 3B6, Canada",University of Quebec; Ecole de Technologie Superieure - Canada; Universite de Montreal; Polytechnique Montreal; Rio Tinto,"Martel, JL (corresponding author), Ecole Technol Super, 1100 Notre Dame West St, Montreal, PQ H3C 1K3, Canada.",jean-luc.martel.1@ens.etsmtl.ca; kenjy.demeester@polymtl.ca; francois.brissette@etsmtl.ca; annie.poulin@etsmtl.ca; richard.arsenault@riotinto.com,,"Arsenault, Richard/0000-0003-2834-2750; Martel, Jean-Luc/0000-0001-7142-6875",,,,,23,42,43,3,13,TEMPUS PUBLICATIONS,"DURRUS, BANTRY","IJEE , ROSSMORE,, DURRUS, BANTRY, COUNTY CORK 00000, IRELAND",0949-149X,,,INT J ENG EDUC,Int.

Variability of the stratospheric vortex is examined using a state-of-the-art climate model and a suite of specifically developed vortex diagnostics. The model has a fully coupled ocean and a fully resolved stratosphere. Analysis of the standard stratospheric zonal mean wind diagnostic shows no significant increase over the twenty-first century in the number of major sudden stratospheric warmings (SSWs) from its historical value of 0.7 events per decade, although the monthly distribution of SSWs does vary, with events becoming more evenly dispersed throughout the winter. However, further analyses using geometric-based vortex diagnostics show that the vortex mean state becomes weaker, and the vortex centroid is climatologically more equatorward by up to 2.5 degrees, especially during early winter. The results using these diagnostics not only characterize the vortex structure and evolution but also emphasize the need for vortex-centric diagnostics over zonally averaged measures. Finally, vortex variability is subdivided into wave-1 (displaced) and -2 (split) components, and it is implied that vortex displacement events increase in frequency under climate change, whereas little change is observed in splitting events.","[Mitchell, Daniel M.; Osprey, Scott M.; Gray, Lesley J.] Univ Oxford, Natl Ctr Atmospher Sci, Oxford OX1 3PU, England; [Butchart, Neal; Hardiman, Steven C.] Met Off Hadley Ctr, Exeter, Devon, England; [Ciarlton-Perez, Andrew J.] Univ Reading, Dept Meteorol, Reading, Berks, England",UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); NERC National Centre for Atmospheric Science; University of Oxford; Met Office - UK; Hadley Centre; University of Reading,"Mitchell, DM (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Natl Ctr Atmospher Sci, Oxford OX1 3PU, England.",mitchell@atm.ox.ac.uk,"Osprey, Scott/GQI-3483-2022; Charlton-Perez, Andrew/F-4079-2010; Osprey, Scott/S-7908-2019; Osprey, Scott/P-6621-2016; Hardiman, Steven/HDO-0165-2022; Mitchell, Dann M/U-6509-2018","Osprey, Scott/0000-0002-8751-1211; Charlton-Perez, Andrew/0000-0001-8179-6220; Osprey, Scott/0000-0002-8751-1211; Osprey, Scott/0000-0002-8751-1211; Mitchell, Dann M/0000-0002-0117-3486; Watson, Peter/0000-0001-5173-9903; Gray, Lesley/0000-0002-7803-9277",UK Natural Environmental Research Council (NERC); NERC National Centre for Atmospheric Science (NCAS); Joint DECC/Defra Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme [GA01101]; European Commission's 7th Framework Programme COMBINE project [226520]; NERC student grant; Natural Environment Research Council [ncas10009] Funding Source: researchfish,UK Natural Environmental Research Council (NERC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); NERC National Centre for Atmospheric Science (NCAS); Joint DECC/Defra Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme; European Commission's 7th Framework Programme COMBINE project; NERC student grant; Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),We thank the two anonymous reviews for insightful comments.

Notably, our observational analysis suggests that for the 1981-2008 period, the tropical Indo-Pacific drivers, namely, the canonical El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), ENSO Modoki, and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). are significantly associated with the observed Kharif rice production (KRP) of various rice-growing Indian states. In this paper, using the available hindcasts, we evaluate whether these state-of-the-art retrospective forecasts capture the relationship of the KRP of multiple states with the local rainfall as well as the tropical Indo-Pacific drivers, namely, the canonical ENSO, ENSO Modoki, and the IOD. Using techniques of anomaly correlation, partial correlation, and pattern correlation, we surmise that the IITM-CFS successfully simulate the observed association of the tropical Indo-Pacific drivers with the local rainfall of many states during the summer monsoon. Significantly, the observed relationship of the local KRP with various climate drivers is predicted well for several Indian states such as United Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Odisha, and Bihar.

The anti-correlation measuring scheme and frequency filtering allowed very low levels of physical damage to the wardrobe to be detected in spite of the high background noise typical of the museum environment. The total AE energy recorded during two years of monitoring corresponded to a fractured area of 12 mm(2) or a total crack propagation of 1.2 mm for two10-mm-thick panels. Although the total damage recorded was minute, correlation between the events of fracturing and falls in indoor relative humidity (RH) in winter due to insufficient humidification was evident. The risk of damage, expressed in terms of crack propagation, was quantified as a function of the magnitude of the RH falls of the duration compatible with the response time of the object. The data allow acceptable RH falls to be identified if a conservation professional or a curator selects a 'tolerable' yearly propagation of the fracture, in other words the progress of damage considered insignificant.","[Strojecki, Marcin; Lukomski, Michal; Krzemien, Leszek; Bratasz, Lukasz] Polish Acad Sci, Jerzy Haber Inst Catalysis & Surface Chem, PL-30239 Krakow, Poland; [Lukomski, Michal; Sobczyk, Joanna; Bratasz, Lukasz] Natl Museum Krakow, Krakow, Poland",Polish Academy of Sciences; Jerzy Haber Institute of Catalysis & Surface Chemistry,"Lukomski, M (corresponding author), Polish Acad Sci, Jerzy Haber Inst Catalysis & Surface Chem, Ul Niezapominajek 8, PL-30239 Krakow, Poland.",nclukoms@cyf-kr.edu.pl,"Strojecki, Marcin/M-9470-2019; Strojecki, Marcin/I-9543-2019","Strojecki, Marcin/0000-0001-6411-1306; Krzemien, Leszek/0000-0001-8845-0476; Bratasz, Lukasz/0000-0002-5277-2606; Lukomski, Michal/0000-0001-7942-9026","Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education [IE0601, N N105 278536]","Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education(Ministry of Science and Higher Education, Poland)","The research was supported by a grant from the Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education supporting activities of COST Action IE0601, 'Wood science for conservation of cultural heritage'.

The high use of fossil fuels and biomasses results in measurable air pollution, even in the mountain areas. Hydropower planning and implementation, in the face of the changing climate, is therefore paramount important. We focus here on Nepal, and particularly on the Dudh Koshi river basin, with a population of ca. 170,000 people, within an area with large potential for hydropower production. Our main objectives are to (i) preliminarily design a local hydropower grid based on a distributed run of riverRORscheme, and (ii) verify the resilience of the grid against modified hydrology under perspective climate change, until the end of the century. To do so, we set up and tune thePoli-Hydrosemi-distributed glacio-hydrological model, mimicking the complex hydrology of the area. We then modify a state of the art algorithm to develop and exploit a heuristic, resource-demand based model, calledPoli-ROR. We usePoli-RORto assess the (optimal) distribution of a number ofRORhydropower stations along the river network, and the structure of the local mini-grids. We then use downscaled outputs from three general circulation models GCMs (RCPs 2.6, 4.5, 8.5) from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC AR5, to assess the performance of the system under future modified hydrological conditions. We find that our proposed method is efficient in shapingRORsystems, with the target of the largest possible coverage (93%), and of the least price (0.068 euro kWh(-1)on average). We demonstrate also that under the projected hydrological regimes until 2100, worse conditions than now may occur, especially for plants with small drainage areas. Days with energy shortage may reach up ton(f)= 38 per year on average (againstn(f)= 24 now), while the maximum daily energy deficit may reach as high ase(def%)= 40% (againste(def%)= 20% now). We demonstrate that our originally proposed method forRORgrid design may represent a major contribution towards the proper development of distributed hydropower production in the area. Our results may contribute to improve energy supply, and living conditions within the Dudh Koshi river. It is likely that our approach may be applied in Nepal generally. Impending climate change may require adaptation in time, including the use of other sources which are as clean as possible, to limit pollution. OurPoli-RORmethod for grid optimization may be of use for water managers, and scientists with an interest in the design of optimal hydropower schemes in topographically complex catchments.","[Bocchiola, Daniele; Manara, Mattia] Politecn Milan, Dept Civil & Environm Engn DICA, Vinci 32, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Bocchiola, Daniele] EVK2CNR Comm Italy, S Bernardino 145, I-24122 Bergamo, Italy; [Mereu, Riccardo] Politecn Milan, Dept Energy Engn DENG, Campus Bovisa,Lambruschini 4a, I-20156 Milan, Italy",Polytechnic University of Milan; Polytechnic University of Milan,"Bocchiola, D (corresponding author), Politecn Milan, Dept Civil & Environm Engn DICA, Vinci 32, I-20133 Milan, Italy.;Bocchiola, D (corresponding author), EVK2CNR Comm Italy, S Bernardino 145, I-24122 Bergamo, Italy.",daniele.bocchiola@polimi.it; mattiamanar@gmail.com; riccardo.mereu@polimi.it,,"Mereu, Riccardo/0000-0003-0544-595X; Bocchiola, Daniele/0000-0001-8493-0894",,,,,82,4,4,3,6,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,SEP,2020,9,,,,,,2625,10.3390/w12092625,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w12092625,,,29,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,OE7BO,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,12/21/22,WOS:000580681900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The model sensitivity to soil moisture and vegetation cover has been studied. Soil moisture has been found to be relatively high in the model during the investigation period and has been reduced by different degree to investigate the resulting changes in dust emissions. Two different vegetation datasets have been tested as model input: the climatological vegetation cover data of COSMO-ART (ECOCLIMAP) and the SPOT5 remote sensing vegetation cover data for the time of the event. By varying soil moisture, vegetation cover and by restricting the potential emission area, a set of eleven simulations was generated. Vegetation cover during the event was about 24% lower on average compared to the climatological mean. Thus, dust emissions modeled with SPOTS vegetation exceeded that modeled with climatological data by a factor of about 5. The modeled dust concentrations were compared with in-situ measurements of aerosol concentration. The temporal evolutions of simulations and observations have significant correlations (0.42-0.85) especially in rural backgrounds. The lower correlations at urban sites are attributed to anthropogenic PM10 sources, which are not included in the model. However, a verification of the magnitude of modeled dust concentrations is not possible due to the uncertainty in soil moisture and emission area. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Firstly, it analyzed the land cover changes in Chang-zhu-tan from 2000 to 2017 by exploring the distribution of LCZ types. Secondly, mean LST of LCZs were obtained to evaluate the SUHII layout. Thirdly, it deals with critical LCZs in SUHII and seeks to understand how to approach mitigation strategies for Chang-zhu-tan. The results showed that, firstly, the land cover LCZs of the suburban areas adjacent to the three cities were most likely to be replaced with built-up LCZs from 2000 to 2017. Secondly, SUHII varies among different LCZs. LCZ-10 contributed to the strongest SUHII (around 5-6 degrees C) in 2000 and 2005, while LCZ-5 had the highest SUHII (around 6-7 degrees C) from 2011 to 2017, which tended to occur around the urban centers. By contrast, LCZ-A-D and LCZ-G contribute to cool areas (around 0-2 degrees C) throughout the study period.The findings help better understand the relationship between SUHII and LCZs and provide a more scientific basis for urban environmental planning.","[Zheng, Bohong] Cent South Univ, Architecture & Art Dept, Changsha, Peoples R China; [Chen, Yaping] Hunan Univ Technol & Business, Design & Art Dept, Changsha, Peoples R China; [Hu, Yinze] Hunan Lugu Architectural Technol Co Ltd, Changsha, Peoples R China",Central South University; Hunan University of Technology & Business,"Chen, YP (corresponding author), Hunan Univ Technol & Business, Design & Art Dept, Changsha, Peoples R China.",yaping152@sina.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [51608535]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of Central South University [502221805],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of Central South University,This study is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51608535) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of Central South University (No. 502221805).,,45,1,1,13,20,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-0955,,,URBAN CLIM,Urban CLim.,MAY,2022,,,,,,,101153,10.1016/j.uclim.2022.101153,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.uclim.2022.101153,,,18,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,0Y5XO,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000790464200003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Growth was not impaired by the projected consequences of climate change but genotypes varied in their responses, suggesting existence of genetic variation in phenotypic plasticity. Climate change further prevented receptacle formation, implying that Fucus fail to reproduce sexually. Photosynthesis was not affected by climate change but varied among populations. Our results show that Fucus populations photosynthesized, grew, and survived well under the projected climate change but their sexual reproduction ceased.

In G1, the radiative forcing from an instantaneous quadrupling of the CO2 concentration, starting from the preindustrial level, is balanced by a reduction of the solar constant. Model responses to the two counteracting forcings in G1 are compared to the preindustrial climate in terms of global means and regional patterns and their robustness. While the global mean surface air temperature in G1 remains almost unchanged compared to the control simulation, the meridional temperature gradient is reduced in all models. Another robust response is the global reduction of precipitation with strong effects in particular over North and South America and northern Eurasia. In comparison to the climate response to a quadrupling of CO2 alone, the temperature responses are small in experiment G1.

We present a meta-analysis of new simulations of the full evolution of gas and aerosol species and other existing experiments with variations of the same model. The comparison highlights the importance of several physical processes in determining radiative forcing, especially the effect of climate change on stratosphere- troposphere exchange, heterogeneous sulfate-nitrate-dust chemistry, and changes in methane oxidation and natural emissions. However, the impact of these fairly uncertain physical effects is substantially less than the difference between alternative emission scenarios for all short- lived species. The net global mean annual average direct radiative forcing from the short-lived species is.02 W/m(2) or less in our projections, as substantial positive ozone forcing is largely offset by negative aerosol direct forcing. Since aerosol reductions also lead to a reduced indirect effect, the global mean surface temperature warms by similar to 0.07 degrees C by 2030 and similar to 0.13 degrees C by 2050, adding 19% and 17%, respectively, to the warming induced by long-lived greenhouse gases. Regional direct forcings are large, up to 3.8 W/m(2). The ensemble-mean climate response shows little regional correlation with the spatial pattern of the forcing, however, suggesting that oceanic and atmospheric mixing generally overwhelms the effect of even large localized forcings.

MLP is part of the multiple specular reflection conveyors. They allow daylight to be transported and distributed in dark rooms far from traditional openings while limiting heat transmission. It involves collecting, concentrating, and diffusing sunlight using a dome placed on the roof. It is then conveyed through a highly reflective tube and diffused into a building's room using a diffuser. Previous work (Malet-Damour et al., 2017, 2016) has shown that it was necessary to identify and study the climate in which the light pipe will be installed. A state-of-the-art of experimental and numerical results was conducted over the period from1990 to 2019. It revealed that the behavior of the light pipe depends strongly on the indoor (area to be illuminated) and outdoor (meteorology) environment. This paper presents the experimental observations of studies conducted from 2013 to 2015 on Mirrored Light-Pipe in Reunion Island. The climate in which the experiment was undertaken is presented with a focus on illuminance. In 2019, this study is the only one analyzing the performance of the light pipe in extreme situations of extreme sunlight conditions (maximum global illuminance of around 200 Klux). Experimental results based on various scenarios quantified the impact of the reflection coefficient of the area to be illuminated, the presence of an anticyclonic dome, the type of sky or the ideal position of a sub-dome deflector. The results are very encouraging.","[Malet-Damour, Bruno; Bigot, Dimitri; Guichard, Stephane; Boyer, Harry] Univ La Reunion, Phys & Math Engn Lab Energy Environm & Bldg PIMEN, 117 Rue Gen Ailleret, F-97430 Le Tampon, France",University of La Reunion,"Malet-Damour, B (corresponding author), Univ La Reunion, Phys & Math Engn Lab Energy Environm & Bldg PIMEN, 117 Rue Gen Ailleret, F-97430 Le Tampon, France.",bruno.malet-damour@univ-reunion.fr,,"Malet-Damour, Bruno/0000-0001-8216-265X",,,,,51,7,7,2,17,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0038-092X,,,SOL ENERGY,Sol.

In particular, it reviews the numerical schemes and physical parameterizations that make up an ocean climate model and how these schemes are pieced together for use in a state-of-the-art climate model. Features of the model described here include the following: (1) tripolar grid to resolve the Arctic Ocean without polar filtering, (2) partial bottom step representation of topography to better represent topographically influenced advective and wave processes, (3) more accurate equation of state, (4) three-dimensional flux limited tracer advection to reduce overshoots and undershoots, (5) incorporation of regional climatological variability in shortwave penetration, (6) neutral physics parameterization for representation of the pathways of tracer transport, (7) staggered time stepping for tracer conservation and numerical efficiency, (8) anisotropic horizontal viscosities for representation of equatorial currents, (9) parameterization of exchange with marginal seas, (10) incorporation of a free surface that accomodates a dynamic ice model and wave propagation, (11) transport of water across the ocean free surface to eliminate unphysical virtual tracer flux methods, (12) parameterization of tidal mixing on continental shelves. We also present preliminary analyses of two particularly important sensitivities isolated during the development process, namely the details of how parameterized subgridscale eddies transport momentum and tracers.","[Griffies, S.

In this method, the reliability of a model ensemble is evaluated from the point of view of whether the observations can be regarded as being sampled from the ensemble. Our analysis reveals that, in the MMEs, the climate variables we investigated are broadly reliable on the global scale, with a tendency towards overdispersion. On the other hand, in the SMEs, the reliability differs depending on the ensemble and variable field considered. In general, the mean state and historical trend of surface air temperature, and mean state of precipitation are reliable in the SMEs. However, variables such as sea level pressure or top-of-atmosphere clear-sky shortwave radiation do not cover a sufficiently wide range in some. It is not possible to assess whether this is a fundamental feature of SMEs generated with particular model, or a consequence of the algorithm used to select and perturb the values of the parameters. As under-dispersion is a potentially more serious issue when using ensembles to make projections, we recommend the application of rank histograms to assess reliability when designing and running perturbed physics SMEs.","[Yokohata, Tokuta] Natl Inst Environm Studies, Ctr Global Environm Res, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Annan, James D.; Hargreaves, Julia C.] Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, Res Inst Global Change, Kanazawa Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan; [Collins, Matthew] Univ Exeter, Coll Engn Math & Phys Sci, Exeter EX4 4QF, Devon, England; [Jackson, Charles S.; Tobis, Michael] Univ Texas Austin, Inst Geophys, Austin, TX 78758 USA; [Webb, Mark J.] Met Off Hadley Ctr, Exeter EX1 3PB, Devon, England",National Institute for Environmental Studies - Japan; Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science & Technology (JAMSTEC); University of Exeter; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; Met Office - UK; Hadley Centre,"Yokohata, T (corresponding author), Natl Inst Environm Studies, Ctr Global Environm Res, 16-2 Onogawa, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.",yokohata@nies.go.jp,"Yokohata, Tokuta/N-4540-2019; Jackson, Charles/AAE-1420-2019; Collins, Matthew/F-8473-2011; Jackson, Charles S/A-2202-2009","Yokohata, Tokuta/0000-0001-7346-7988; Jackson, Charles/0000-0002-2870-4494; Collins, Matthew/0000-0003-3785-6008; Jackson, Charles S/0000-0002-2870-4494; Hargreaves, Julia/0000-0002-4217-5023","Innovative Program of Climate Change Projection for twenty-first Century by MEXT, Japan; MoE, Japan [S-5]","Innovative Program of Climate Change Projection for twenty-first Century by MEXT, Japan; MoE, Japan","TY, JDA, and JCH were supported by Innovative Program of Climate Change Projection for twenty-first Century by MEXT, Japan.

Eight years of daily precipitation from each model's twentieth-century climate simulation are analyzed and compared with daily satellite-retrieved precipitation. Space-time spectral analysis is used to obtain the variance and phase speed of dominant convectively coupled equatorial waves, including the MJO, Kelvin, equatorial Rossby (ER), mixed Rossby-gravity (MRG), and eastward inertio-gravity (EIG) and westward inertio-gravity (WIG) waves. The variance and propagation of the MJO, defined as the eastward wavenumbers 1-6, 30-70-day mode, are examined in detail. The results show that current state-of-the-art GCMs still have significant problems and display a wide range of skill in simulating the tropical intraseasonal variability. The total intraseasonal (2-128 day) variance of precipitation is too weak in most of the models. About half of the models have signals of convectively coupled equatorial waves, with Kelvin and MRG-EIG waves especially prominent. However, the variances are generally too weak for all wave modes except the EIG wave, and the phase speeds are generally too fast, being scaled to excessively deep equivalent depths. An interesting result is that this scaling is consistent within a given model across modes, in that both the symmetric and antisymmetric modes scale similarly to a certain equivalent depth. Excessively deep equivalent depths suggest that these models may not have a large enough reduction in their effective static stability by diabatic heating. The MJO variance approaches the observed value in only 2 of the 14 models, but is less than half of the observed value in the other 12 models. The ratio between the eastward MJO variance and the variance of its westward counterpart is too small in most of the models, which is consistent with the lack of highly coherent eastward propagation of the MJO in many models. Moreover, the MJO variance in 13 of the 14 models does not come from a pronounced spectral peak, but usually comes from part of an over-reddened spectrum, which in turn is associated with too strong persistence of equatorial precipitation. The two models that arguably do best at simulating the MJO are the only ones having convective closures/triggers linked in some way to moisture convergence.","NOAA, CIRES Climate Diagnost Ctr, Boulder, CO 80305 USA; NOAA, Aeron Lab, Boulder, CO 80305 USA; Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Miami, FL 33149 USA; Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, PCMDI, Livermore, CA USA; SUNY Stony Brook, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; Bur Meteorol Res Ctr, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Global Modeling & Assimilat Of, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; NASA, Goddard Inst Space Studies, New York, NY 10025 USA; NOAA, Geophys Fluid Dynam Lab, Princeton, NJ USA; Natl Inst Environm Studies, Ibaraki, Japan; CNRM, Meteo France, Toulouse, France; Univ Paris, Lab Meteorol Dynam, F-75252 Paris, France; Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; Max Planck Inst Meteorol, Hamburg, Germany; Canadian Ctr Climate Modelling & Anal, Victoria, BC, Canada",National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Miami; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook; Bureau of Meteorology - Australia; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Institute for Environmental Studies - Japan; UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Universite Paris Cite; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; Max Planck Society; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling & Analysis (CCCma),"Lin, JL (corresponding author), NOAA, CIRES Climate Diagnost Ctr, 325 Broadway,R-CDC1, Boulder, CO 80305 USA.",jialin.lin@noaa.gov,"Emori, Seita/D-1950-2012; Mapes, Brian/A-5647-2010; Sperber, Kenneth R/H-2333-2012; Wheeler, Matthew C/C-9038-2011; Rasch, Philip J/F-7978-2018; Del Genio, Anthony/D-4663-2012","Sperber, Kenneth R/0000-0001-8585-9786; Wheeler, Matthew C/0000-0002-9769-1973; Rasch, Philip J/0000-0002-5125-2174; Del Genio, Anthony/0000-0001-7450-1359",,,,,107,622,632,2,80,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0894-8755,1520-0442,,J CLIMATE,J.

The experiments are initialized in either November or January of each year and integrated for up to 10 years, providing a good opportunity for filling the gap between seasonal and decadal climate predictions. The long-lead multimodel ensemble (MME) prediction is evaluated for 1981-2007 in terms of the anomaly correlation coefficient (ACC) and mean-squared skill score (MSSS), which combines ACC and conditional bias, with respect to observations and reanalysis data, paying particular attention to the seasonal dependency of the global-mean and equatorial Pacific TAS predictions. The MME shows statistically significant ACCs and MSSSs for the annual global-mean TAS for up to two years, mainly because of long-term global warming trends. When the long-term trends are removed, the prediction skill is reduced. The prediction skills are generally lower in boreal winters than in other seasons regardless of lead times. This lack of winter prediction skill is attributed to the failure of capturing the long-term trend and interannual variability of TAS over high-latitude continents in the Northern Hemisphere. In contrast to global-mean TAS, regional TAS over the equatorial Pacific is predicted well in winter. This is mainly due to a successful prediction of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). In most models, the wintertime ENSO index is reasonably well predicted for at least one year in advance. The sensitivity of the prediction skill to the initialized month and method is also discussed.","[Choi, Jung; Son, Seok-Woo] Seoul Natl Univ, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, 1 Gwanak Ro, Seoul 151742, South Korea; [Ham, Yoo-Geun] Chonnam Natl Univ, Dept Oceanog, Gwangju, South Korea; [Lee, June-Yi] Pusan Natl Univ, Div Earth Environm Syst, Dept Atmospher Sci, Busan, South Korea; [Kim, Hye-Mi] SUNY Stony Brook, Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA",Seoul National University (SNU); Chonnam National University; Pusan National University; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook,"Son, SW (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, 1 Gwanak Ro, Seoul 151742, South Korea.",seokwooson@snu.ac.kr,"Son, Seok-Woo/A-8797-2013; Lee, June-Yi/D-5752-2012; Lee, June-Yi/AAT-3407-2021; Choi, Jung/N-9973-2013","Lee, June-Yi/0000-0002-3986-9753; Lee, June-Yi/0000-0002-3986-9753; Kim, Hye-Mi/0000-0003-4713-4658",Korea Meteorological Administration Research and Development Program [KMIPA 2015-2100],Korea Meteorological Administration Research and Development Program(Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA)),"The authors sincerely thank the reviewers for their thoughtful reviews.

These links are extensive, influencing a range of climate processes such as hurricane activity(2) and African Sahel(3-5) and Amazonian(5) droughts. The variability is distinct from historical global-mean temperature changes and is commonly attributed to natural ocean oscillations(6-10). A number of studies have provided evidence that aerosols can influence long-term changes in sea surface temperatures(11,12), but climate models have so far failed to reproduce these interactions(6,9) and the role of aerosols in decadal variability remains unclear. Here we use a state-of-the-art Earth system climate model to show that aerosol emissions and periods of volcanic activity explain 76 per cent of the simulated multidecadal variance in detrended 1860-2005 North Atlantic sea surface temperatures. After 1950, simulated variability is within observational estimates; our estimates for 1910-1940 capture twice the warming of previous generation models but do not explain the entire observed trend. Other processes, such as ocean circulation, may also have contributed to variability in the early twentieth century. Mechanistically, we find that inclusion of aerosol-cloud microphysical effects, which were included in few previous multimodel ensembles, dominates the magnitude (80 per cent) and the spatial pattern of the total surface aerosol forcing in the North Atlantic. Our findings suggest that anthropogenic aerosol emissions influenced a range of societally important historical climate events such as peaks in hurricane activity and Sahel drought. Decadal-scale model predictions of regional Atlantic climate will probably be improved by incorporating aerosol-cloud microphysical interactions and estimates of future concentrations of aerosols, emissions of which are directly addressable by policy actions.","[Booth, Ben B.

The climate-forcing fields are obtained from the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme project ice2sea, in which three regional climate models are used to dynamically downscale two scenarios (A1 B and E1) from two general circulation models (ECHAM5 and HadCM3). To assess the sensitivity of the projections to the model initial state, four initialization methods are applied. In these experiments, the simulated contribution to sea-level rise by 2100 ranges from an equivalent of 0.2 to 6.8 cm. The largest uncertainties arise from different formulations of the regional climate models (0.8-3.9 cm) and applied scenarios (0.65-1.9 cm), but an important source of uncertainty is the initialization method (0.1-0.8 cm). These model simulations do not account for the recently observed acceleration of ice streams and consequent thinning rates, the changing ice discharge that may result from the spatial and temporal variability of ocean forcing, or the feedback occurring between ice-sheet elevation changes and climate forcing. Thus the results should be considered the lower limit of Greenland ice sheet contributions to sea-level rise, until such processes have been integrated into large-scale ice-sheet models.","[Adalgeirsdottir, G.; Boberg, F.; Mottram, R.; Christensen, J.

In this study, we evaluate precipitation forecasts from five operational climate models with a potential to drive hydrological forecasts: European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), UK Met Office (UK-Met), Meteo France, Deutscher Wetterdienst, and Centro Euro-Mediterraneo sui Cambiamenti Climatici. The Multi-Source Weighted-Ensemble Precipitation is used as a reference data set to evaluate the model skill. The performance of individual models is evaluated on daily, weekly, monthly, seasonal, and climatological periods, and for selected target months, lead-times and drought events, and compared to unweighted and skill-weighted multi-model ensemble mean forecast. For all models, the lead 1-month forecast can replicate the climatological mean, monthly mean, and monthly anomaly precipitation, although much of this skill originates from the first week of the forecast. The skill drops rapidly for lead 2-month and longer and is highest in drier regions and seasons. The forecast skill of monthly meteorological drought events at lead 1-month is modest. All models represent the monthly variation in the length of wet and dry spell days at lead 1-month, but the skill is weak for heavy and very heavy precipitation days. ECMWF is found to be the most skillful model, followed by the UK-Met, although the multi-model weighted average provides the highest performance compared to individual models and the un-weighted multi-model mean.","[Gebrechorkos, S.

Investment decisions for such systems are frequently based on state-of-the-art impact assessments using a specified climate change scenario in order to identify a singular optimal adaptive strategy. In a non-stationary world, however, it is risky and/or uneconomic to plan for just one climate change scenario as an average or best estimate, as is done with the use of the Predict-Then-Adapt method. We argue that responsible adaptation requires an alternative method that effectively allows for the lack of knowledge about future climate change by adopting a managed/adaptive strategy. The managed/adaptive strategy confers the ability, derived from built-in flexibility, to adjust to future uncertainties as they unfold. This will restrict the effect of erroneous decisions and help avoid maladaptation. Real In Options (RIO) analysis can facilitate the development of an optimal managed/adaptive strategy to climate change. Here, we show the economic benefits of adopting a managed/adaptive strategy and building in flexibility, using RIO analysis applied for the first time to urban drainage infrastructure.","[Gersonius, Berry; Ashley, Richard; Pathirana, Assela; Zevenbergen, Chris] UNESCO IHE Inst Water Educ, NL-2611 AX Delft, Netherlands; [Ashley, Richard] Univ Sheffield, Pennine Water Grp, Dept Civil & Struct Engn, Sheffield S1 3JD, S Yorkshire, England",IHE Delft Institute for Water Education; University of Sheffield,"Gersonius, B (corresponding author), UNESCO IHE Inst Water Educ, Westvest 7, NL-2611 AX Delft, Netherlands.",b.gersonius@unesco-ihe.org,"Gersonius, Berry/C-7724-2009; Pathirana, Assela/B-5189-2011","Gersonius, Berry/0000-0002-2681-9474; Pathirana, Assela/0000-0003-0907-1764",EPSRC [EP/I029346/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/I029346/1] Funding Source: researchfish,EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),,,36,138,142,4,130,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

The elicitation sought to examine the range of opinions within the climatic research community about the physical processes that determine the current strength of the AMOC, its future evolution in a changing climate and the consequences of potential AMOC changes. Experts assign different relative importance to physical processes which determine the present-day strength of the AMOC as well as to forcing factors which determine its future evolution under climate change. Many processes and factors deemed important are assessed as poorly known and insufficiently represented in state-of-the-art climate models. All experts anticipate a weakening of the AMOC under scenarios of increase of greenhouse gas concentrations. Two experts expect a permanent collapse of the AMOC as the most likely response under a 4xCO(2) scenario. Assuming a global mean temperature increase in the year 2100 of 4 K, eight experts assess the probability of triggering an AMOC collapse as significantly different from zero, three of them as larger than 40%. Elicited consequences of AMOC reduction include strong changes in temperature, precipitation distribution and sea level in the North Atlantic area. It is expected that an appropriately designed research program, with emphasis on long-term observations and coupled climate modeling, would contribute to substantially reduce uncertainty about the future evolution of the AMOC.","Univ Victoria, Sch Earth & Ocean Sci, Victoria, BC V8W 3P6, Canada; Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Potsdam, Germany; Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Engn & Publ Policy, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; Univ Calgary, Dept Chem & Petr Engn, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada",University of Victoria; Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; Carnegie Mellon University; University of Calgary,"Zickfeld, K (corresponding author), Univ Victoria, Sch Earth & Ocean Sci, POB 3055 STN CSC, Victoria, BC V8W 3P6, Canada.",zickfeld@ocean.seos.uvic.ca,"Rahmstorf, Stefan/A-8465-2010; Levermann, Anders/G-4666-2011; Keith, David W/E-9777-2010","Rahmstorf, Stefan/0000-0001-6786-7723; Levermann, Anders/0000-0003-4432-4704; Keith, David W/0000-0002-8224-3780; Kuhlbrodt, Till/0000-0003-2328-6729",,,,,49,82,83,1,51,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

Climate changes due to global warming add considerable complexity to dealing with flooding, since increases in average temperature alter the patterns and intensity of precipitation. Thus, adverse events arising from natural hazards have tended to become even more frequent and their impacts more severe. Consequently, urban centers face a huge challenge and statistics already show the urgent need for all levels of government to review the adequacy of their plans for anticipating and combating extreme events. Therefore, this paper undertakes a systematic review of the literature, using well-founded and established search strategies, in order to determine the state-of-the-art as presented in 52 peer-reviewed articles strategically selected from two main sources of scientific data. Cross-matching important research metrics from these papers has enabled two axes of discussion to be detailed in this article: a bibliometric analysis and a content analysis. Among many findings, those that stand out are the lack of a formal methodology for climate modeling and the use and sharing of GIS tools, these being key-factors for developing new ways of visualizing risk. Finally, some guidelines for decision-making are put forward in order to share insights and to provide DMs, scholars, experts, stakeholders, and other professionals with an overall background of managerial aspects when engaging on applying flood risk management in urban areas.","[Leal da Silva, Lucas Borges; Alencar, Marcelo Hazin] Univ Fed Pernambuco UFPE, Res Grp Risk Assessment & Modelling Environm Asse, Cx Postal 7462, BR-50630970 Recife, PE, Brazil; [de Almeida, Adiel Teixeira] Univ Fed Pernambuco UFPE, Ctr Decis Syst & Informat Dev CDSID, Cx Postal 7462, BR-50630970 Recife, PE, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Pernambuco; Universidade Federal de Pernambuco,"Alencar, MH (corresponding author), Univ Fed Pernambuco UFPE, Res Grp Risk Assessment & Modelling Environm Asse, Cx Postal 7462, BR-50630970 Recife, PE, Brazil.",borgesleal.lucas@gmail.com; marcelohazin@gmail.com; almeida@cdsid.org.br,"Silva, Lucas/AAR-6103-2020; de Almeida, Adiel Teixeira/G-9541-2012; Alencar, Marcelo/G-9670-2012","Silva, Lucas/0000-0001-7599-2364; de Almeida, Adiel Teixeira/0000-0002-2757-1968; Alencar, Marcelo/0000-0002-2054-7885",National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq); Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES) [001],National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)),This study was partially supported by the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) and by the Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES) - Finance Code 001.,,84,15,15,18,41,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-4209,,,INT J DISAST RISK RE,Int.

Five years on, this systematic review reflects on the state of the art by evaluating 165 publications (2016-2020) about cultural heritage and climate change. We find the field continues to grow, and remains rich in disciplinary and methodological diversity, but predominantly represents research in and about Europe. The number of publications about integrating cultural heritage into adaptation and mitigation are increasing but remain relatively few compared to those about physical impacts on individual buildings or sites. The impact of climate change on intangible heritage has rarely been the sole focus of recent research. Although researchers are increasingly situating their research in a wider context of opportunities and barriers, vague timescales, and unspecific references to changes in the natural environment are additional limitations.

A robust assessment of future fire danger projections is undertaken by disentangling the climate change signal from the uncertainty derived from the multi-model ensemble, unveiling a positive signal of fire danger potential over large areas of the Mediterranean. The increase in the fire danger signal is accentuated towards the latest part of the transient period, thus pointing to an elevated fire potential in the region with time. The fire-climate links under present and future conditions are further discussed building upon observed climate data and burned area records along a representative climatic gradient within the study region.","[Bedia, J.; Gutierrez, J.

Unclear conceptualization and the absence of comparable metrics are challenges that hinder the assessment of progress toward policy goals. This study draws on a policy mix approach to analyze adaptation efforts at the subnational level. It examines the complex pathways by which rural households in Northeast Brazil build resilience capacities and deal with drought with policy support. Particular emphasis is placed on the implementation of policy mixes composed of climate-related and broader development instruments as well as on the coordination of these instruments in the mix. The resilience of households benefiting from different instrument mixes is examined, and the results show a trend toward an intermediary value for our composite resilience metric highlighting the adoption of coping rather than transformative adaptive strategies. However, changing these trends toward enhanced resilience pathways depends on the improved implementation of the policy mixes and on political factors that include administrative issues, but also coordination and negotiation among policy actors.","[Milhorance, Carolina; Le Coq, Jean-Francois; Sabourin, Eric] Ctr Agr Res & Dev, ArtDev Res Unit CIRAD Art Dev, Montpellier, France; [Milhorance, Carolina; Sabourin, Eric; Mesquita, Patricia; Nogueira, Daniela] Univ Brasilia, Ctr Sustainable Dev UnB CDS, Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Le Coq, Jean-Francois; Andrieu, Nadine] CIRAD Innovat, Ctr Agr Res & Dev, Innovat Res Unit, Capesterre, Guadeloupe, France; [Le Coq, Jean-Francois; Sabourin, Eric] Int Ctr Trop Agr Alliance Biodivers CIAT, Cali, Colombia; [Andrieu, Nadine] Montpellier Univ Excellence Muse, Montpellier, France; [Cavalcante, Louise] Wageningen Univ & Res Ctr, Publ Adm & Policy Grp WUR, Wageningen, Netherlands",Universite de Montpellier; Universidade de Brasilia; Universite de Montpellier; Wageningen University & Research,"Milhorance, C (corresponding author), Ctr Int Dev & Agr Res CIRAD, UMR Art Dev, Dept Environm & Soc, Bur 309,TA C-11373 Rue Jean Francois Breton, F-34398 Montpellier 5, France.",carolina.milhorance@cirad.fr,,"Cabral, Louise/0000-0002-8773-540X; SABOURIN, Eric/0000-0002-1171-2535; Le Coq, Jean-Francois/0000-0003-1084-1973; Milhorance, Carolina/0000-0002-3290-8596",Association Nationale de la Recherche et de la Technologie [ARTIMIX] [ANR-16-IDEX-0006]; Association Nationale de la Recherche et de la Technologie [TYPOCLIM] [ANR-16-IDEX-0006]; Brazil's CNPq/Capes/FAPDF [16-2014],Association Nationale de la Recherche et de la Technologie [ARTIMIX]; Association Nationale de la Recherche et de la Technologie [TYPOCLIM]; Brazil's CNPq/Capes/FAPDF,This work was supported by the Association Nationale de la Recherche et de la Technologie [ARTIMIX N degrees ANR-17-CE030005]; Association Nationale de la Recherche et de la Technologie [TYPOCLIM ANR-16-IDEX-0006]; Brazil's CNPq/Capes/FAPDF [INCT no 16-2014 ODISSEIA].,,66,3,3,4,8,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1473-5903,1747-762X,,INT J AGR SUSTAIN,Int.

We distinguish between the impact of climate on society by time-scale in long-term, conjunctural or medium-term, and short-term impacts. Moreover, a simplified climate-society interaction model developed by Daniel Kramer is presented, as well as the concept of the Little Ice Age-type Impact (LIATIMP) by Christian Pfister and the vulnerability concept regarding climatic variability and extreme weather events.

This paper investigates the reasons for this high skill by assessing the contributions from the initial conditions, greenhouse gases, solar activity, and volcanic aerosols. The comparison between the SST correlation skill in uninitialized historical simulations and hindcasts initialized from estimates of the observed climate state shows that the high Indian Ocean skill is largely explained by the varying radiative forcings, the latter finding being supported by a set of additional sensitivity experiments. The long-term warming trend is the primary contributor to the high skill, though not the only one. Volcanic aerosols bring additional skill in this region as shown by the comparison between initialized hindcasts taking into account or not the effect of volcanic stratospheric aerosols and by the drop in skill when filtering out their effect in hindcasts that take them into account. Indeed, the Indian Ocean is shown to be the region where the ratio of the internally generated over the externally forced variability is the lowest, where the amplitude of the internal variability has been estimated by removing the effect of long-term warming trend and volcanic aerosols by a multiple least squares linear regression on observed SSTs.","[Guemas, Virginie; Garcia-Serrano, J.; Doblas-Reyes, F.

Although climate change is a long-term global trend, individuals personally experience it as weather from moment to moment. This study assesses how New York State adults' overall perceptions of their personal experiences with the effects of climate change and extreme weather (surveyed in early 2014) are related to recent weather conditions. This research is unique in that it examines multiple types of weather: temperature and precipitation, over 1 day or 1 week, quantified both as relative and nonrelative measures. Respondents' perceptions that they had personally experienced climate change or extreme weather significantly increased with warmer relative (percentage of normal) minimum temperatures on the day of the study. Maximum temperatures and total precipitation levels were not significant predictors of perceptions of personal experience, either on the day of the study or over the preceding week. Experiential processing had a smaller effect on perceptions than motivated reasoning, the influence of preexisting ideas. Respondents who believed that climate change was happening agreed more that they had personally experienced it or extreme weather, and this effect increased for individuals who thought that climate change was anthropogenic, as opposed to naturally caused. Of the sociodemographic factors assessed here, political party, gender, and region were significant predictors, while age and education were not.","[Fownes, Jennifer R.; Allred, Shorna B.] Cornell Univ, Dept Nat Resources, Ctr Conservat Social Sci, Fernow Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Cornell University,"Fownes, JR (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Dept Nat Resources, Ctr Conservat Social Sci, Fernow Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",jf443@cornell.edu,,,"National Institute of Food and Agriculture, U.S. Department of Agriculture; Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future; Cornell Institute for Climate Smart Solutions; Cornell Survey Research Institute","National Institute of Food and Agriculture, U.S. Department of Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future; Cornell Institute for Climate Smart Solutions; Cornell Survey Research Institute","This material is based upon work that was funded by Federal Capacity (Hatch) Funds from the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future.

Here the contributions of these properties to the spread of the temperature responses of an ensemble of coupled Atmosphere-ocean General Circulation Models (AOGCM) of the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) are evaluated within the framework of a state-of-the-art EBM. These partial contributions are quantified (in equilibrium and transient conditions) using the analysis of variance method. The radiative properties, particularly the strength of the radiative feedback to the global equilibrium surface warming, appear to constitute the most primary source of the spread.

At the national level, Canada has no enforceable standards for sate drinking water and no comprehensive water-monitoring program to provide detailed, timely reporting on the state of water resources. To provide Canada's first national assessment of lake health, the NSERC Canadian Lake Pulse Network was launched in 2016 as an academic-government research partnership. LakePulse uses traditional approaches for limnological monitoring as well as state-of-the-art methods in the fields of genornics, emerging contaminants, greenhouse gases, invasive pathogens, paleolimnology, spatial modelling, statistical analysis, and remote sensing. A coordinated sampling program of about 680 lakes together with historical archives and a geomatics analysis of over 80,000 lake watersheds are used to examine the extent to which lakes are being altered now and in the future, and how this impacts aquatic ecosystem services of societal importance.

While the underlying processes are fairly well-understood, it is unclear how their interactions might impact the overall stability of the Earth's climate system. As of yet, this cannot be fully analysed with state-of-the-art Earth system models due to computational constraints as well as some missing and uncertain process representations of certain tipping elements. Here, we explicitly study the effects of known physical interactions among the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets, the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and the Amazon rainforest using a conceptual network approach. We analyse the risk of domino effects being triggered by each of the individual tipping elements under global warming in equilibrium experiments. In these experiments, we propagate the uncertainties in critical temperature thresholds, interaction strengths and interaction structure via large ensembles of simulations in a Monte Carlo approach. Overall, we find that the interactions tend to destabilise the network of tipping elements. Furthermore, our analysis reveals the qualitative role of each of the four tipping elements within the network, showing that the polar ice sheets on Greenland and West Antarctica are oftentimes the initiators of tipping cascades, while the AMOC acts as a mediator transmitting cascades. This indicates that the ice sheets, which are already at risk of transgressing their temperature thresholds within the Paris range of 1.5 to 2 degrees C, are of particular importance for the stability of the climate system as a whole.","[Wunderling, Nico; Donges, Jonathan F.; Kurths, Jurgen; Winkelmann, Ricarda] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res PIK, Earth Syst Anal & Complex Sci, Leibniz Assoc, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany; [Wunderling, Nico; Winkelmann, Ricarda] Univ Potsdam, Inst Phys & Astron, D-14476 Potsdam, Germany; [Wunderling, Nico] Humboldt Univ, Dept Phys, D-12489 Berlin, Germany; [Donges, Jonathan F.] Stockholm Univ, Stockholm Resilience Ctr, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Kurths, Jurgen] Lobachevsky Univ Nizhny Novgorod, Inst Informat Technol Math & Mech, Nizhnii Novgorod 603950, Russia",Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; University of Potsdam; Humboldt University of Berlin; Stockholm University; Lobachevsky State University of Nizhni Novgorod,"Wunderling, N; Winkelmann, R (corresponding author), Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res PIK, Earth Syst Anal & Complex Sci, Leibniz Assoc, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany.;Wunderling, N; Winkelmann, R (corresponding author), Univ Potsdam, Inst Phys & Astron, D-14476 Potsdam, Germany.;Wunderling, N (corresponding author), Humboldt Univ, Dept Phys, D-12489 Berlin, Germany.",nico.wunderling@pik-potsdam.de; ricarda.winkelmann@pik-potsdam.de,"Donges, Jonathan F./HCI-2311-2022","Wunderling, Nico/0000-0002-3566-323X; Donges, Jonathan/0000-0001-5233-7703",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [IRTG 1740/TRP 2015/50122-0]; Studienstiftung des Deutschen Volkes; European Re-search Council [ERA 743080]; Horizon 2020 [TiPACCs 820575]; Earth League; Stordalen Foundation; Russian Ministry of Science and Education [075-15-2020-808]; Leibniz Association DominoES project,"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Studienstiftung des Deutschen Volkes; European Re-search Council(European Research Council (ERC)European Commission); Horizon 2020; Earth League; Stordalen Foundation; Russian Ministry of Science and Education(Ministry of Education and Science, Russian Federation); Leibniz Association DominoES project","This research has been supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (grant no.

Among the 26 codes that participated in the comparison were very detailed (line-by-line), narrow-band (high-spectral resolution), as well as highly parameterized (low-spectral resolution) models. A considerable spread was detected in the response of these models to a set of well-defined atmospheric profiles. Substantial discrepancies exist among models even for the simplest case of pure water vapor absorption with standard deviation ranging from 1% to 3% for the downward fluxes at the surface and from 6% to 11% for the total atmospheric absorption. The divergences in downward surface flux increase to nearly 4% when all absorbers and the molecular scattering are considered. In cloudy conditions the divergences range from 4% to 10%, depending on the cloud optical thickness. Another major uncertainity that has been identified is the spectral averaging of the scattering properties which can result in very significant errors for low spectral resolution codes. Since these errors appear to be systematic, they may induce unrealistic feedback mechanisms in numerical climate models. The amplitude of the differences between models is in many cases larger than the accuracy required for the achievements of several objectives of the World Climate Research Program. While reference solutions for the absorption and scattering in atmospheres can be obtained based on the state-of-the-art spectroscopic knowledge and rigorous computational techniques, the absolute tests of the validity of the radiation algorithms would be comprehensive field experiments in which the radiative and all relevant atmospheric parameters are measured to a high degree of accuracy.","PRINCETON UNIV, NOAA, GEOPHYS FLUID DYNAM LAB, PRINCETON, NJ 08542 USA",National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Princeton University,"FOUQUART, Y (corresponding author), LAB OPT ATMOSPHER, F-59655 VILLENEUVE DASCQ, FRANCE.",,"Ramaswamy, Venkatachalam/AAJ-6265-2021","Ramaswamy, Venkatachalam/0000-0002-1984-6423",,,,,42,164,173,0,9,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",2169-897X,,,J GEOPHYS RES-ATMOS,J.

One reason is the problem of downscaling climate predictions to the temporal and spatial scale of pest life cycles. In the present study, we have closed that gap by impact modelling on hourly scale and downscaling on spatial scale, by adapting a stochastic weather generator (WG) for pest modelling. Thereby, the codling moth, Cydia pomonella, serves as a relevant model species for a key pest with multiple generations per year that, already under the present climate, requires intensive efforts to control. Stochastic weather generation, followed by a re-sampling approach, provided hourly synthetic weather data for 10 meteorological sites in Switzerland under future climate conditions (2045-2074). Synthetic weather was analysed by a phenology model implemented in the forecasting system SOPRA. The results showed significant shifts to earlier dates in codling moth phenological events in Swiss apple orchards, increased magnitude of the 2nd generation, less overlap between stages, and a bigger risk for an additional 3rd generation. Shifts in phenology and magnitude of later generations require adaptations of plant protection regimes to maintain their sustainability, as we illustrate in the present paper, specifically for the strategies in codling moth control. In general, however, methodologies may easily be adapted in further pest and disease combinations and cropping systems.","[Samietz, J.; Stoeckli, S.; Hoehn, H.] Agroscope Changins Wadenswil, Res Stn, ACW, Wadenswil, Switzerland; [Hirschi, M.; Spirig, C.; Rotach, M.] Fed Off Meteorol & Climatol, MeteoSwiss, Zurich, Switzerland; [Calanca, P.] Agroscope Reckenholz Tanikon Res Stn, ART, Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Research Station Agroscope; Swiss Federal Research Station Agroscope; Swiss Federal Research Station for Agroecology & Agriculture,"Samietz, J (corresponding author), Agroscope Changins Wadenswil, Res Stn, ACW, Wadenswil, Switzerland.",,"Rotach, Mathias/E-9938-2018; Hirschi, Martin/ABF-1564-2020","Rotach, Mathias/0000-0003-2283-309X; Hirschi, Martin/0000-0001-9154-756X; Calanca, Pierluigi/0000-0003-3113-2885",,,,,20,3,3,0,10,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-94-62610-58-3,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,,,,,35,42,,,,,,8,Plant Sciences; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Plant Sciences; Agriculture,BD1HE,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000358012400003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Discussions of time and environment are often interdisciplinary, necessitating a wide-ranging use of methods and approaches. However, to date there has been practically no direct engagement with the scientific field of phenology, the study of life-cycle timing across species, including plants, animals and insects. In this article, we outline how phenology can offer novel inroads to thinking through temporal relations across species and environments. We suggest that greater engagement with this field will enable scholars working across the humanities and social sciences to incorporate detailed studies of environmental timings which shed light on individual species, as well as wide-ranging species interactions. Following an overview of phenological research from both western scientific and indigenous knowledge perspectives, we report on a scoping exercise looking at where phenology has appeared in environmental humanities literature to date. We then offer an illustration that puts phenological perspectives into conversation with plant studies in order to indicate some of the useful affordances phenological perspectives offer, namely those of comprehending time as co-constructed across species and as flexible and responsive to environmental changes. We conclude by offering a number of further potential connections and suggestions for future research, including calling for more exploration of how environmental humanities approaches might produce critical contributions to phenology in their turn.","[Bastian, Michelle; Hawitt, Rowan Bayliss] Univ Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland",University of Edinburgh,"Bastian, M (corresponding author), Univ Edinburgh, Edinburgh Coll Art, Minto House,20-22 Chambers St, Edinburgh EH1 1JZ, Midlothian, Scotland.",michelle.bastian@ed.ac.uk,,"Bastian, Michelle/0000-0002-0043-7582",Independent Social Research Foundation,Independent Social Research Foundation,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the Independent Social Research Foundation,",,199,0,0,5,5,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",2514-8486,2514-8494,,ENVIRON PLAN E-NAT,Environ.

Here, we analyze sensitivities (change in model outputs per unit change in inputs) and uncertainties (changes in model outputs scaled to uncertainty in inputs) of vegetation dynamics under climate change, projected by a state-of-the-art dynamic vegetation model (LPJ-GUESS v4.0) across European forests (the species Picea abies, Fagus sylvatica and Pinus sylvestris), considering uncertainties of both model parameters and environmental drivers. We find that projected forest carbon fluxes are most sensitive to photosynthesis-, water-, and mortality-related parameters, while predictive uncertainties are dominantly induced by environmental drivers and parameters related to water and mortality. The importance of environmental drivers for predictive uncertainty increases with increasing temperature. Moreover, most of the interactions of model inputs (environmental drivers and parameters) are between environmental drivers themselves or between parameters and environmental drivers. In conclusion, our study highlights the importance of environmental drivers not only as contributors to predictive uncertainty in their own right but also as modifiers of sensitivities and thus uncertainties in other ecosystem processes. Reducing uncertainty in mortality-related processes and accounting for environmental influence on processes should therefore be a focus in further model development.","[Oberpriller, Johannes; Hartig, Florian] Univ Regensburg, Theoret Ecol Lab, Univ Str 31, Regensburg, Germany; [Herschlein, Christine; Anthoni, Peter; Arneth, Almut] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Dept Atmospher Environm Res IMK IFU, Kreuzeckbahnstr 19, Garmisch Partenkirchen, Germany; [Krause, Andreas; Rammig, Anja] Tech Univ Munich, Sch Life Sci, Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; [Lindeskog, Mats; Olin, Stefan] Lund Univ, Dept Phys Geog & Ecosyst Sci, Lund, Sweden",University of Regensburg; Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; Technical University of Munich; Lund University,"Oberpriller, J (corresponding author), Univ Regensburg, Theoret Ecol Lab, Univ Str 31, Regensburg, Germany.",johannes.oberpriller@ur.de,"Krause, Andreas/E-9665-2018","Krause, Andreas/0000-0003-3345-2989; Oberpriller, Johannes/0000-0001-6007-0041","Bayerisches Staatsministerium fur Wissenschaft, Forschung und Kunst (Bavarian Climate Research Network)","Bayerisches Staatsministerium fur Wissenschaft, Forschung und Kunst (Bavarian Climate Research Network)","This research has been supported by the Bayerisches Staatsministerium fur Wissenschaft, Forschung und Kunst (Bavarian Climate Research Network).",,124,1,1,7,7,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1991-959X,1991-9603,,GEOSCI MODEL DEV,Geosci.

The argument rests on the observation that mitigation is a public good while adaptation is a private one. We show that the more one teases out the public good nature of mitigation, the lower will be the incentives to invest in the private good adaptation while it increases a policy maker's incentives to invest in the public good mitigation. Conclusively, private adaptation yields a significant loss to global welfare.

Although parameterizations of vertical mixing furnished by internal tides have been built into state-of-the-art coupled global climate models (CGCMs), efforts in parameterizing wind-driven vertical mixing in CGCMs are still limited. In this study, we apply a modified finescale parameterization (MFP) to an eddy-resolving Community Earth System Model (CESM) to represent the wind's contribution to vertical mixing in the stratified ocean interior. The spatial pattern of the MFP-parameterized wind-driven vertical mixing in the thermocline agrees with the observation derived from the finestructure measurements of Argo floats, reproducing the enhanced values in the Kuroshio, Gulf Stream extensions, and the Southern Ocean where the winds inject great amount of energy into the internal wave field. The MFP also captures the observed seasonal variation of wind-driven vertical mixing in the thermocline of these regions that exhibits enhancement and weakening in winter and summer, respectively. Application of the MFP to a non-eddy-resolving CESM fails to reproduce the observed wind-driven vertical mixing. Specifically, the magnitude of parameterized wind-driven vertical mixing in the thermocline of Kuroshio, Gulf Stream extensions, and the Southern Ocean is systemically smaller than those in the observation and eddy-resolving CESM; so is the case for the amplitude of seasonal cycle. The results highlight the benefit of eddy-resolving CESM compared to its standard-resolution counterpart in parameterizing the wind-driven vertical mixing and provide insight into developing parameterizations for wind-driven vertical mixing in eddy-resolving CGCMs.","[Yuan, Man; Song, Zhuo; Li, Zhuoran; Jing, Zhao; Sun, Bingrong; Wang, Hong; Wu, Lixin] Ocean Univ China, Frontiers Sci Ctr Deep Ocean Multispheres & Earth, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Yuan, Man; Song, Zhuo; Li, Zhuoran; Jing, Zhao; Sun, Bingrong; Wang, Hong; Wu, Lixin] Ocean Univ China, Key Lab Phys Oceanog, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Yuan, Man; Song, Zhuo; Li, Zhuoran; Jing, Zhao; Sun, Bingrong; Wang, Hong; Zhou, Shenghui; Wu, Lixin] Pilot Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol Qingdao, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Jing, Zhao; Chang, Ping; Wang, Hong] Texas A&M Univ, Int Lab High Resolut Earth Syst Predict, College Stn, TX USA; [Chang, Ping] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Oceanog, College Stn, TX USA; [Chang, Ping] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, College Stn, TX USA; [Liu, Xin] Qilu Univ Technol, Shandong Acad Sci, Jinan, Peoples R China",Ocean University of China; Ocean University of China; Qingdao National Laboratory for Marine Science & Technology; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Qilu University of Technology,"Song, Z (corresponding author), Ocean Univ China, Frontiers Sci Ctr Deep Ocean Multispheres & Earth, Qingdao, Peoples R China.;Song, Z (corresponding author), Ocean Univ China, Key Lab Phys Oceanog, Qingdao, Peoples R China.",songzhuo@ouc.edu.cn,,"Song, Zhuo/0000-0001-5679-7766","National Science Foundation of China [41822601, 42006014, 41776006]; Taishan Scholar Funds [tsqn201909052]; Pilot National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology, Texas AM University; U.S. National Center for Atmospheric Research","National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Taishan Scholar Funds; Pilot National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology, Texas AM University; U.S. National Center for Atmospheric Research","The authors are grateful to the editor, Stephen Griffies, the anonymous associate editor, and two anonymous reviewers for their efforts to improve the quality and clarity of the manuscript.

The model simulations are directly compared to observations and reanalysis data to evaluate the climatological features and variability of the AWP within each individual model. Results reveal that a select number of models-namely the GISS-E2-R, CSIRO-Mk3.6, and MPI-ESM-LR-are successful at resolving an appropriately sized AWP with some reasonable climatological features. However, these three models exhibit an erroneously broad seasonal peak of the AWP, and its variability is significantly underestimated. Furthermore, all of the CMIP5 models exhibit a significant cold bias across the tropical Atlantic basin, which hinders their ability to accurately resolve the AWP.","[Kozar, Michael E.; Misra, Vasubandhu] Florida State Univ, COAPS, Dept Earth Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA",State University System of Florida; Florida State University,"Kozar, ME (corresponding author), Florida State Univ, COAPS, Dept Earth Ocean & Atmospher Sci, 2035 E Paul Dirac Dr,200 RM Johnson Bldg, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.",mkozar@coaps.fsu.edu,,,"NOAA [NA12OAR4310078, NA10OAR4310215, NA11OAR4310110]; USGS [06HQGR0125]; USDA [027865]",NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); USGS(United States Geological Survey); USDA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)),"We acknowledge the World Climate Research Programme's Working Group on Coupled Modelling, which is responsible for CMIP5, and thank the climate modeling groups listed in Table 1 for producing and making available their model output.

Typically, ecocritical readings of Biblical apocalypse rely on a definition of the genre focused on eschatological themes related to species annihilation precipitated by the judgement of the world and the end of time. In this article, we offer an alternative engagement with Biblical apocalypse by drawing on Christopher Rowland and Jolyon Pruszinski's argument that apocalypse is not necessarily concerned with temporality. Our case study is The Book of Enoch. We compare natural history in Enoch to Jean-Luc Marion's phenomenological analysis of Biblical apocalypse as a way of seeing the world that worries human assumptions about the nature of things and thereby instigates an anamorphosis of perception. Following Timothy Morton's adaptation of Marion's idea of anamorphosis as an example of the ecological art of attention, we show how apocalypse achieves anamorphic attention by encouraging the cultivation of specific modes of perception-principally, openness and receptivity-that are also critical to political theology. In turn, this analysis of anamorphic attention will inform our rethinking of the relationship between environmentalism and apocalyptic themes in climate fiction today, with special reference to Megan Hunter's The End We Start From.","[Kotva, Simone] Univ Oslo, Fac Theol, Blindernveien 9 Domus Theol, N-0371 Oslo, Norway; [Mebius, Eva-Charlotta] Univ London, Dept Hist, Royal Holloway, Egham TW20 0BL, Surrey, England",University of Oslo; University of London; Royal Holloway University London,"Kotva, S (corresponding author), Univ Oslo, Fac Theol, Blindernveien 9 Domus Theol, N-0371 Oslo, Norway.",simone.kotva@teologi.uio.no; eva-charlotta.mebius.13@alumni.ucl.ac.uk,,,University of Oslo research project ECODISTURB,University of Oslo research project ECODISTURB,S.K. received funding from the University of Oslo research project ECODISTURB.,,60,1,1,0,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2077-1444,,RELIGIONS,Religions,AUG,2021,8,,,,,,620,10.3390/rel12080620,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rel12080620,,,15,Religion,Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;HCI),Religion,UH4EM,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000689886400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study discusses the predictability of the western North Pacific subtropical High variability in the National Centers for Environmental Prediction Climate Forecast System (NCEP CFS). The interannual variability of the Northeast Asian summer monsoon is highly correlated with one of the western North Pacific subtropical Highs.

Here, we present the first simulation with the Community Earth System Model (CESM), which includes an interactive carbon cycle, that covers the last millennium. The simulation is continued to the end of the twenty-first century. Besides state-of-the-art forcing reconstructions, we apply a modified reconstruction of total solar irradiance to shed light on the issue of forcing uncertainty in the context of the last millennium. Nevertheless, we find that structural uncertainties between different models can still dominate over forcing uncertainty for quantities such as hemispheric temperatures or the land and ocean carbon cycle response. Compared to other model simulations, we find forced decadal-scale variability to occur mainly after volcanic eruptions, while during other periods internal variability masks potentially forced signals and calls for larger ensembles in paleoclimate modeling studies. At the same time, we were not able to attribute millennial temperature trends to orbital forcing, as has been suggested recently. The climate-carbon-cycle sensitivity in CESM during the last millennium is estimated to be between 1.0 and 2.1 ppm degrees C-1. However, the dependence of this sensitivity on the exact time period and scale illustrates the prevailing challenge of deriving robust constraints on this quantity from paleoclimate proxies. In particular, the response of the land carbon cycle to volcanic forcing shows fundamental differences between different models. In CESM the tropical land dictates the response to volcanoes, with a distinct behavior for large and moderate eruptions. Under anthropogenic emissions, global land and ocean carbon uptake rates emerge from the envelope of interannual natural variability by about year 1947 and 1877, respectively, as simulated for the last millennium.","[Lehner, F.; Joos, F.; Raible, C.

The atmospheric component was at 0.25 degrees grid spacing, and ocean component at 0.1 degrees. One hundred years of present-day simulation were completed. Major results were that annual mean sea surface temperature (SST) in the equatorial Pacific and El-Nino Southern Oscillation variability were well simulated compared to standard resolution models. Tropical and southern Atlantic SST also had much reduced bias compared to previous versions of the model. In addition, the high resolution of the model enabled small-scale features of the climate system to be represented, such as air-sea interaction over ocean frontal zones, mesoscale systems generated by the Rockies, and Tropical Cyclones. Associated single component runs and standard resolution coupled runs are used to help attribute the strengths and weaknesses of the fully coupled run. The high-resolution run employed 23,404 cores, costing 250 thousand processor-hours per simulated year and made about two simulated years per day on the NCAR-Wyoming supercomputer Yellowstone.","[Small, R.

We use a systematic review approach to identify a global data set of 301 reported adaptation responses (remaining, adaptive, and transformative) of small-scale fishers to climate change and analyse their spatial agreement with estimated geographical location of global coastal hotspot areas for specific climate change hazards associated to those responses (long-term trends in sea surface temperature, cumulative intensity of marine heatwaves, frequency of tropical storms, and intensity of associated storm surges). Only 37% of responses were found in climate change hotspots. Despite this, our results evidence that fishers are responding more passively in areas with lower exposure levels to abrupt climatic events. The relative proportion of adaptive and transformative responses increase with climate change hazard exposure. Small-scale fishers exhibit more active adaptive and transformative responses in areas with higher exposure levels to climate change hazards, according to a global systematic review approach of social-ecological systems.","[Ilosvay, Xochitl Edua Elias; Ojea, Elena] Univ Vigo, Ctr Invest Marina, Future Oceans Lab, Vigo, Spain; [Molinos, Jorge Garcia] Hokkaido Univ, Art Res Ctr, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan",Universidade de Vigo; CIM UVIGO; Hokkaido University,"Ilosvay, XEE (corresponding author), Univ Vigo, Ctr Invest Marina, Future Oceans Lab, Vigo, Spain.",xochitl.ilosvay@uvigo.es,"Garcia Molinos, Jorge/C-9252-2015","Garcia Molinos, Jorge/0000-0001-7516-1835",Japanese Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI [19H04322]; European Research Council through the project CLOCK (Climate Adaptation to Shifting Stocks; ERC Starting Grant; EU Horizon 2020) [8679812]; Universidade de Vigo,"Japanese Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); European Research Council through the project CLOCK (Climate Adaptation to Shifting Stocks; ERC Starting Grant; EU Horizon 2020); Universidade de Vigo","J.G.M. is supported by a Japanese Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI Grant Number 19H04322.

Specifically, this technique achieves effective visualization of vector-based earth science data through an automated data processing pipeline which integrates novel strategies including random seeding, finer-granularity parallelization and real-time rendering. The random seeding strategy allows for a vivid visual effect and an interactive framerate regardless of the spatial resolution in the raw dataset. The visualization algorithm is designed to be naturally parallelizable by partitioning the rendering tasks of unsteady vector field into multiple subtasks such that high-performance rendering can be realized. The platform is capable of taking either irregular or regular gridded data as input, and through the proposed data (re)projection pipeline, an automatic transformation of spatially enabled scientific data from the original data projection to the 3D globe-based virtual space is achieved. A series of experiments was conducted to identify the best configuration of rendering parameters to achieve the optimal rendering performance and visual effect. The results demonstrated the scalability and capability of the proposed PolarGlobe system to visualize big and unsteady vector flow data across different spatial and temporal scales. PolarGlobe implements former Vice President Al Gore's vision of a digital earth that enables scientists and citizens across the world to interactively study our planet. We expect the methods and techniques presented in this work to contribute significantly to both the scientific visualization and climate science communities.","[Wang, Sizhe; Li, Wenwen] Arizona State Univ, Sch Geog Sci & Urban Planning, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Wang, Sizhe] Arizona State Univ, Sch Comp Informat & Decis Syst Engn, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Li, WW (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Sch Geog Sci & Urban Planning, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",wenwen@asu.edu,,,"National Science Foundation [BCS1455349, PLR -1504432]",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),This project is supported by the National Science Foundation (BCS1455349 and PLR -1504432).,,42,3,3,0,7,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0198-9715,1873-7587,,COMPUT ENVIRON URBAN,Comput.

Marine ecosystem forecasting is rapidly advancing as a field, yet tools produced for fisheries to date focus primarily on predicting species distributions. The next generation of marine ecosystem forecasting products could be enhanced by also incorporating predictions of biological characteristics of fish caught, such as body condition and epidemiological status, thereby expanding the utility of these methods beyond predicting distribution alone. Improving the biological dimensions of marine ecosystem forecasting could allow for optimization of efficiencies in wild-capture fisheries by minimizing discarding and waste and maximizing the value of landed fish. These advancements are of direct benefit to industry and management, address several of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals pertaining to fisheries sustainability and have the potential to support the maintenance of global food and micronutrient security under rapidly changing environmental conditions. Here, we describe the current state of the art in marine ecosystem forecasting; review the physical-biological linkages that underlie variability in the body condition of commercially valuable fish and shellfish with particular reference to marine climate change; and outline key considerations for the next generation of marine ecosystem forecasting tools for wild-capture fisheries.","[Bolin, Jessica A.; Schoeman, David S.; Cummins, Scott F.; Scales, Kylie L.] USC Australia, Sch Sci Technol & Engn, Sippy Downs, Qld, Australia; [Bolin, Jessica A.; Evans, Karen J.] CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Schoeman, David S.] Nelson Mandela Univ, Ctr African Conservat Ecol, Port Elizabeth, South Africa; [Cummins, Scott F.] USC Australia, Genecol Res Ctr, Sippy Downs, Qld, Australia",Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Nelson Mandela University,"Bolin, JA (corresponding author), USC Australia, Sch Sci Technol & Engn, Sippy Downs, Qld, Australia.",jessica.anne.bolin@gmail.com,"Bolin, Jessica/AAR-4993-2021; Bolin, Jessica/GQZ-7263-2022; Scales, Kylie/L-9318-2018","Schoeman, David/0000-0003-1258-0885; Bolin, Jessica/0000-0002-9868-7511; Scales, Kylie/0000-0003-0843-0956",Advance Queensland - Queensland Department of Innovation and Tourist Industry Development [AQIRF222-2019RD2],Advance Queensland - Queensland Department of Innovation and Tourist Industry Development,"Advance Queensland - Queensland Department of Innovation and Tourist Industry Development, Grant/Award Number: AQIRF222-2019RD2",,181,4,4,2,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1467-2960,1467-2979,,FISH FISH,Fish.

The climate forecasts drive a dynamical malaria model for all of Africa, and the predictions are evaluated using reanalysis data. The regions and months for which climate is responsible for significant interannual malaria transmission variability are first identified. In addition to epidemic-prone zones these also include hyperendemic regions subject to high variability during specific months of the year, often associated with the monsoon onset. In many of these areas, temperature anomalies are predictable from 1 to 2 months ahead, and reliable precipitation forecasts are available in eastern and southern Africa 1 month ahead. The inherent lag between the rainy seasons and malaria transmission results in potential predictability in malaria transmission 3-4 months in advance, extending the early warning available from environmental monitoring by 1-2 months, although the realizable forecast skill will be less than this because of an imperfect malaria model. A preliminary examination of the forecasts for the highlands of Uganda and Kenya shows that the system is able to predict the years during the last two decades in which documented highland outbreaks occurred, in particular the major event of 1998, but that the timing of outbreaks was often imprecise and inconsistent across lead times. In addition to country-level evaluation with district health data, issues that need addressing to integrate such a climate-based prediction system into health-decision processes are briefly discussed.","[Tompkins, Adrian M.] Abdus Salam Int Ctr Theoret Phys, Trieste, Italy; [Di Giuseppe, Francesca] European Ctr Medium Range Weather Forecasts, Reading RG2 9AX, Berks, England",Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP); European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF),"Tompkins, AM (corresponding author), Abdus Salaam Int Ctr Theoret Phys, Earth Syst Phys, Str Costiera 11, I-34151 Trieste, TS, Italy.",tompkins@ictp.it,"Tompkins, Adrian/N-6472-2013","Tompkins, Adrian/0000-0003-0975-6691; Di Giuseppe, Francesca/0000-0001-9829-0429","European Commission [243964, 266327]",European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre),"This research was supported by the European Commission's Seventh Framework Research Programme under Quantifying Weather and Climate Impacts on Health in Developing Countries (QWeCI; Grant Agreement 243964) and HEALTHY FUTURES (266327).

Despite significant advances, most state-of-the-art radiative coolers show broadband infrared emission with low spectral selectivity, which limits their cooling temperatures, especially in hot humid regions. Here, an all-inorganic narrowband emitter comprising a solution-derived SiOxNy layer sandwiched between a reflective substrate and a self-assembly monolayer of SiO2 microspheres is reported. It shows a high and diffusive solar reflectance (96.4%) and strong infrared-selective emittance (94.6%) with superior spectral selectivity (1.46). Remarkable subambient cooling of up to 5 degrees C in autumn and 2.5 degrees C in summer are achieved under high humidity without any solar shading or convection cover at noontime in a subtropical coastal city, Hong Kong. Owing to the all-inorganic hydrophobic structure, the emitter shows outstanding resistance to ultraviolet and water in long-term durability tests. The scalable-solution-based fabrication renders this stable high-performance emitter promising for large-scale deployment in various climates.","[Lin, Chongjia; Li, Yang; Kwon, Ye Seul; Huang, Jingyuan; Zheng, Jiongzhi; Liu, Gongze; Huang, Baoling] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Mech & Aerosp Engn, Clear Water Bay, Hong Kong 999077, Peoples R China; [Chi, Cheng] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Engn Mech, Minist Educ, Key Lab Thermal Sci & Power Engn, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Wu, Zuoxu] Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Sci, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China; [Tso, Chi Yan] City Univ Hong Kong, Sch Energy & Environm, Hong Kong 999077, Peoples R China; [Chao, Christopher Y.

However, CSA technological innovation diffusion is subject to socio-economic barriers. The success of innovations is partly dependent on the business models that are used to diffuse them. Within the context of innovations for CSA, the role that innovation providers' business models play in the successful adoption and diffusion has received limited attention. In this paper we identify critical issues for business models for CSA technological innovations (BMfCSATI). Our results indicate that current BMfCSATIs are not optimised for diffusing CSA technological innovations. Critical business model elements include the value proposition, channels, customer relationships, key resources, key partners, and cost structure. We find a disparity between the views of CSA technological innovation providers and potential users.

A total of 510,000 time series from year 1856 to 2095 were generated by sampling the natural internal variability in precipitation. The time evolutions of internal variability in the whole time period were estimated from the combination of past and future experiments with preindustrial control experiments. A large ensemble size enabled an estimation of the probability density function of the tipping year at each grid point, providing precise information on the uncertainty of the projection. The tipping year of average precipitation emerges earlier in high latitudes than in lower latitudes. In some regions in lower latitudes and mid-latitudes, the tipping year of intense precipitation emerges faster than that of average precipitation. The tipping years of average and intense precipitation are earlier for higher anthropogenic forcing scenarios than for lower scenarios. The global average of the tipping year for intense precipitation might be attributed to the enhancement of the thermodynamic effect (moisture) rather than the dynamic effect (vertical motion).","[Kusunoki, Shoji] Meteorol Res Inst, Dept Atmosphere Ocean & Earth Syst Modeling Res, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Kusunoki, Shoji] Kansai Univ, Fac Societal Safety Sci, Takatsuki, Osaka, Japan; [Ose, Tomoaki; Hosaka, Masahiro] Meteorol Res Inst, Dept Climate & Environm Res, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan",Meteorological Research Institute - Japan; Kansai University; Meteorological Research Institute - Japan,"Kusunoki, S (corresponding author), Meteorol Res Inst, Dept Atmosphere Ocean & Earth Syst Modeling Res, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.;Kusunoki, S (corresponding author), Kansai Univ, Fac Societal Safety Sci, Takatsuki, Osaka, Japan.",skusunok@mri-jma.go.jp,,,"Environment Research and Technology Development Fund of the Ministry of the Environment, Japan [2-1503]; Ministry of Education, culture, sports, science and Technology (MEXT), Japan; Office of Science, U.S. Department of Energy","Environment Research and Technology Development Fund of the Ministry of the Environment, Japan(Ministry of the Environment, Japan); Ministry of Education, culture, sports, science and Technology (MEXT), Japan(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); Office of Science, U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE))","This study was supported by the Environment Research and Technology Development Fund (2-1503) of the Ministry of the Environment, Japan.

Objective observationally-based estimates have so far failed to improve on this upper bound, with many estimates even suggesting a significant probability of climate sensitivity exceeding 6 degrees C. In this paper, we show how it is possible to greatly reduce this uncertainty by using Bayes' Theorem to combine several independent lines of evidence. Based on some conservative assumptions regarding the value of independent estimates, we conclude that climate sensitivity is very unlikely(<5% probability) to exceed 4.5 degrees C. We cannot assign a significant probability to climate sensitivity exceeding 6 degrees C without making what appear to be wholly unrealistic exaggerations about the uncertainties involved.

In particular, we compare the performance of the GCM-driven control runs (20C3M scenario) with the ERA40-driven ones (perfect boundary conditions) in a common period (1961-2000). Large deviations between the results indicate a large uncertainty/bias for the particular RCM-GCM combinations and, hence, a small confidence for the corresponding transient simulations due to the potential nonlinear amplification of biases. Specifically, we found large biases for some RCM-GCM combinations attributable to RCM in-house problems with the particular GCM coupling. These biases are shown to distort the corresponding climate change signal, or delta, in the last decades of the 21st century, considering the A1B scenario. Moreover, we analyze how to best combine the available RCMs to obtain more reliable projections.","[Turco, Marco] CMCC Euromediterranean Ctr Climate Change, Impacts Soil & Coasts Div, I-81043 Capua, CE, Italy; [Sanna, Antonella] CMCC Euromediterranean Ctr Climate Change, I-40127 Bologna, Italy; [Herrera, Sixto] Univ Cantabria, Dept Appl Math & Comp Sci, Grp Meteorol, E-39005 Santander, Spain; [Llasat, Maria-Carmen] Univ Barcelona, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain; [Manuel Gutierrez, Jose] CSIC UC, Inst Fis Cantabria IFCA, Grp Meteorol, Santander 39005, Spain",Centro Euro-Mediterraneo sui Cambiamenti Climatici (CMCC); Centro Euro-Mediterraneo sui Cambiamenti Climatici (CMCC); Universidad de Cantabria; University of Barcelona; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); Universidad de Cantabria; CSIC - Instituto de Fisica de Cantabria (IFCA),"Turco, M (corresponding author), CMCC Euromediterranean Ctr Climate Change, Impacts Soil & Coasts Div, Via Maiorise Snc, I-81043 Capua, CE, Italy.",marco.turco@cmcc.it,"Botija, Maria Carmen Llasat/L-6104-2014; Gutiérrez, José M./C-5754-2009; sanna, antonella/AAK-2890-2021; García, Sixto Herrera/A-2573-2015; Llasat, Maria Carmen/AAB-7873-2020; Turco, Marco/B-5814-2011; Gutiérrez, José/GSJ-1846-2022","Botija, Maria Carmen Llasat/0000-0001-8720-4193; García, Sixto Herrera/0000-0002-5384-179X; Llasat, Maria Carmen/0000-0001-8720-4193; Turco, Marco/0000-0001-8589-7459; Gutierrez, Jose Manuel/0000-0002-2766-6297; SANNA, Antonella/0000-0002-4950-0853","esTcena project, from Plan Nacional de I+D+i [Exp. 200800050084078]; EXTREM-BLES project, from Plan Nacional de I+D+i [CGL2010-21869]; European Commission [GOCE-CT-2003-505539]","esTcena project, from Plan Nacional de I+D+i; EXTREM-BLES project, from Plan Nacional de I+D+i; European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre)","This work was supported by esTcena (Exp. 200800050084078) and EXTREM-BLES (CGL2010-21869) projects, from Plan Nacional de I+D+i 2008-2011.

However decentralization pushes clinical responsibility downwards to health facilities run by lower cadre staff. Whether the organizational culture in health facilities affects the outcomes despite the use of clinical guidelines has not been explored. This study aimed to demonstrate the relationship between organizational culture and early mortality and those lost to follow up (LTFU) among patients enrolled for HIV care.& para;& para;Methods and materials & para;& para;A stratified sample of 31 health facilities in Nairobi County offering ART services were surveyed. Data of patients enrolled on ART and LTFU for the 12 months ending 30th June 2013 were abstracted. Mortality and LTFU were determined and used to rank health facilities. In the facilities with the lowest and highest mortality and LTFU key informant interviews were conducted using a tool adapted from team climate assessment measurement questionnaire and competing value framework tool to assess organizational culture. The strength of association between early mortality, LTFU and organizational culture was tested.& para;& para;Results & para;& para;Half (51.8%) of the 5,808 patients enrolled into care in 31 health facilities over the 12-month study period were started on ART. Of these 48 (1.6% 95% CI 0.8%-2.4%) died within three months of starting treatment, while a further 125 (4.2% 95% CI 2.1%-6.6%) were LTFU giving an attrition rate of 5.7% (95% CI 3.3%-8.6%). Tuberculosis was the most common comorbidity associated with high early mortality and high LTFU. Organizational culture, specifically an adhocratic type was found to be associated with low early mortality and low LTFU of patients enrolled for HIV care (P = 0.034).& para;& para;Conclusion & para;& para;The use of ART clinical guidelines in a decentralized health systems are not sufficient to achieve required service delivery outcomes. The attrition rate above would mean 85,000 Kenyans missing care based on current HIV disease burden figures. Deliberate efforts to improve individual health facility leadership and inculcate an adhocratic culture may lower mortality and morbidity associated with initiating ART.","[Ayah, Richard] Univ Nairobi, KNH, Coll Hlth Sci, Sch Publ Hlth, Nairobi, Kenya",University of Nairobi,"Ayah, R (corresponding author), Univ Nairobi, KNH, Coll Hlth Sci, Sch Publ Hlth, Nairobi, Kenya.",ayah@uonbi.ac.ke,,,MEPI/PRIME-K award from the US National Institutes Of Health [NIH-R24TW008889],MEPI/PRIME-K award from the US National Institutes Of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA),The project described was supported by *MEPI/PRIME-K award number NIH-R24TW008889* from the US National Institutes Of Health.

After this first step, this benthic group was largely neglected until the end of the 20th century when ecological studies began. We here provide a brief review of present knowledge of the meiofauna found on Brazilian sandy beaches to provide information for ReBentos (Coastal Benthic Habitats Monitoring Network). Our methodology consisted of a bibliographic survey undertaken using different datasets (Web of ScienceTM, SCOPUS, Google Scholar and Lattes Plataform). For the survey, we considered only those studies published till early 2015. Our analysis showed that the number of meiofauna studies has increased over the last two decades, though they are mainly still concentrated on the Southeast of Brazil. These studies aim to explain the distribution pattern of the meiofauna of the intertidal region of sandy beaches. Based on the results, we presented a discussion of three main topics, i.e., (a) current knowledge of Brazilian sandy beach meiofauna, (b) sampling strategies for monitoring of the meiofauna, and (c) use of the meiofauna as a tool to assess climate change. We trust that this brief review will be useful as a starting point for the delineation of further climate change investigations into sandy beach meiofauna.","[Maria, Tatiana Fabricio] Univ Fed Estado Rio de Janeiro, Dept Ecol & Recursos Marinhos, Av Pasteur 458, BR-22290240 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil; [Wandeness, Adriane Pereira; Esteves, Andre Morgado] Univ Fed Pernambuco, Ctr Ciencias Biol, Dept Zool, Av Prof Moraes Rego S-N,Cidade Univ, BR-50670920 Recife, PE, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Estado do Rio de Janeiro; Universidade Federal de Pernambuco,"Maria, TF (corresponding author), Univ Fed Estado Rio de Janeiro, Dept Ecol & Recursos Marinhos, Av Pasteur 458, BR-22290240 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.",tatiana_fabricio@yahoo.com.br,"ESTEVES, ANDRE M/B-8113-2009; Maria, Tatiana/AAW-4483-2020","ESTEVES, ANDRE M/0000-0003-0921-2731; WANDENESS, ADRIANE/0000-0003-3193-5784",Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico - CNPq [CNPq 312143/2013-3],Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico - CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)),The authors are grateful to the REBENTOS network that has dedicated special attention to the meiofauna group and especially to Dr Cecilia Amaral who invited us to participate in the sandy beach working group (GT).

This essay argues that Hogarths accomplishment was more thoroughgoing and intellectually rigorous than previously recognized, and that combined with the Analysis of Beauty (1753), it established a new agenda for ambitious art production. Through its manipulation of a domestic visual vocabulary, The March to Finchley transformed status consciousness into an inclusive artistic category and oppositional political rhetoric into a positive national identity. Comic history, as this new genre was called, offered a stable, yet flexible foundation for the emergence of a distinctively British school of art. That this school never came to fruition was largely because of a shift in Britains political climate, and in particular, a rise in popular imperial enthusiasm brought about by the Seven Years War.",,,,,,,,,,,59,3,3,1,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0141-6790,1467-8365,,ART HIST,Art Hist.,FEB,2004,1,,,,95,128,,10.1111/j.0141-6790.2004.02701004.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0141-6790.2004.02701004.x,,,34,Art,Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;HCI),Art,775LR,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000189042600004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Projecting crop yield changes under climate change requires future climate scenarios as input to crop yield models. It is widely accepted that downscaling of climate data is required to bridge the gap between large-scale global climate models (GCMs) and climate change impact models, such as crop growth models. Regional climate models (RCMs) are often used to dynamically downscale GCM simulations to smaller regional scales, while statistical methods, such as regression-based transfer functions and stochastic weather generators, are also widely employed to develop future climate scenarios for this purpose. The methods used in developing future climate scenarios often contribute to uncertainties in the projected impacts of climate change, in addition to those associated with GCMs and forcing scenarios. We employed climate scenarios from the state-of-the-art RCMs in the North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program (NARCCAP), along with climate scenarios generated by a stochastic weather generator based on climate change simulations performed by their driving GCMs, to drive the CERES-Wheat model in DSSAT to project changes in spring wheat yield on the Canadian Prairies. The future time horizon of 2041-2070 and the baseline period of 1971-2000 were considered. The projected changes showed an average increase ranging from 26 to 37 % of the baseline yield when the effects of the elevated CO2 concentration were simulated, but only up to 15 % if the elevated CO2 effect was excluded. In addition to their potential use in climate change impact assessment, the results also demonstrated that the simulated crop yield changes were fairly consistent whether future climate scenarios were derived from RCMs or they were generated by a stochastic weather generator based on the simulated climate change from the GCMs that were used to drive the RCMs, in this case, when they were compared for regional averages.","[Qian, Budong; De Jong, Reinder; Huffman, Ted] Agr & Agri Food Canada, Eastern Cereal & Oilseed Res Ctr, Sci & Technol Branch, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Wang, Hong] Agr & Agri Food Canada, Semiarid Prairie Agr Res Ctr, Swift Current, SK, Canada; [Yang, Jingyi] Agr & Agri Food Canada, Greenhouse & Proc Crops Res Ctr, Harrow, ON, Canada",Agriculture & Agri Food Canada; Agriculture & Agri Food Canada; Agriculture & Agri Food Canada,"Qian, BD (corresponding author), Agr & Agri Food Canada, Eastern Cereal & Oilseed Res Ctr, Sci & Technol Branch, Ottawa, ON, Canada.",Budong.Qian@agr.gc.ca,"KUMAR, ARVIND/D-7733-2016","KUMAR, ARVIND/0000-0001-8818-6222; Qian, Budong/0000-0001-5413-3114",Sustainable Agriculture Environmental Systems (SAGES) Initiative - Government of Canada; National Science Foundation (NSF); U.S. Department of Energy (DoE); National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA); U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Office of Research and Development (EPA),Sustainable Agriculture Environmental Systems (SAGES) Initiative - Government of Canada; National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)National Research Foundation of Korea); U.S. Department of Energy (DoE)(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Office of Research and Development (EPA)(United States Environmental Protection Agency),"This study was partially supported by The Sustainable Agriculture Environmental Systems (SAGES) Initiative financed by the Government of Canada and the provincial and territorial governments.

In contrast, state-of-the-art coupled climate models generally project enhanced warming in the eastern equatorial Pacific, Walker circulation weakening, and Southern Ocean warming. Here we investigate the ability of 16 climate model large ensembles to reproduce observed sea-surface temperature and sea-level pressure trends over 1979-2020 through a combination of externally forced climate change and internal variability. We find large-scale differences between observed and modeled trends that are very unlikely (<5% probability) to occur due to internal variability as represented in models. Disparate trends in the ratio of Indo-Pacific Warm Pool to tropical-mean warming, which shows little multi-decadal variability in models, hint that model biases in the response to historical forcing constitute part of the discrepancy.","[Wills, Robert C.

While her salon gathered together the most distinguished Nahdah elite, her epistolary art consolidated an enormous network that included intellectuals from all over the Arab world, Europe, and North and South America.

The purpose of the study is to assess the ability of the higher resolution CRCM to downscale the hydrological cycle of the nesting GCM. A second 1-month experiment, in which the CRCM was nested within analyzed fields of a global data assimilation system, was also performed to examine the sensitivity of the basin moisture budget to atmospheric lateral boundary forcing. We have found that the CRCM can produce realistic lee cyclogenesis, preferentially in the Liard sub-basin, along with associated circulation and precipitation patterns, as well as an improved rainshadow in the lee of the Rocky Mountains compared to the GCM. While these features do quantitatively affect the monthly average climate statistics, the basin scale moisture budgets of the models were remarkably similar though some of this agreement is due to compensating errors in the GCM. Both models produced excessive precipitation compared to a recent climatology for the region, the cause of which is traced to lateral boundary forcing. A second experiment, identical to the first except that the CRCM was forced with analyzed fields at the lateral boundaries, produced a qualitatively different basin moisture budget, including a much more realistic precipitation field Errors in the moisture budget of the first experiment appear to be associated with the poor representation of the Aleutian Low in the GCM, and do not appear to be strongly connected to (local) surface processes within the models. This suggests that art effective strategy for modelling the hydrological cycle of the the Mackenzie Basin on the fast climate timescale - a major requirement of the Mackenzie GEWEX Study - will involve nesting the CRCM within analyzed (or re-analyzed) atmospheric fields.","Atmospher Environm Serv, Climate Proc & Earth Observat Div, Toronto, ON M3H 5T4, Canada; Univ Quebec, Dept Sci Terre, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada",Environment & Climate Change Canada; Meteorological Service of Canada; University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal,"MacKay, MD (corresponding author), Atmospher Environm Serv, Climate Proc & Earth Observat Div, 4905 Dufferin St, Toronto, ON M3H 5T4, Canada.",,,,,,,,31,18,18,0,1,CMOS-SCMO,OTTAWA,"BOX 3211, STATION D, OTTAWA, ON K1P 6H7, CANADA",0705-5900,1480-9214,,ATMOS OCEAN,Atmos.-Ocean,SEP,1998,3,,,,179,211,,10.1080/07055900.1998.9649611,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07055900.1998.9649611,,,33,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences; Oceanography,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences; Oceanography,134TC,,Bronze,,,12/21/22,WOS:000076758400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Dynamics and functional mechanisms of elevational treelines are reasonably well understood, while explanations for tree species-specific upper elevational distribution limits below the treeline still remain unclear. In this study, we used a state-of-the-art dendroecological approach to reconstruct long-term changes of species-specific upper elevational distribution limits of different plant functional type (i.e., light-demanding deciduous coniferous larch at treeline, shade-tolerant evergreen coniferous fir and shade-intolerant deciduous broad-leaved birch below treeline) along elevational gradients in the Qinling Mountains of north-central China. Over the past three centuries, all the upper species limits shifted upslope as a response to climate warming. However, the warming-induced upslope migrations showed substantial differences, displaying the maximum upward shift of larch with an average elevation of 24.7 m during the past century, while only a slight advance of the non-treeline tree species. The disparity in elevational advance of upper species limits might be attributable to the presence of interspecific competition, showing that the non-treeline tree species experienced intermediate interspecific competition while the treeline tree species experienced no interspecific competition.Thus, our findings suggested that in addition to climate warming, biotic interaction may contribute much to shaping the species-specific upper limit dynamics. This study not only enhanced mechanistic understanding of long-term species-specific upper elevational distribution limit changes, but also highlighted the jointly effects of rising temperatures and species interactions on subalpine vegetation dynamics.

This research focuses on the cause of the outbreak, asserting that climate played a large role in the proliferation of theAedes albopictusmosquitoes, which transmitted the disease, and led to the dengue outbreak in early 2018. A stage-structured model was run using observed temperature and rainfall data to simulate the life cycle and abundance of theAe. albopictusmosquito. Further, the model was forced with bias-corrected subseasonal forecasts to determine if the event could have been forecast up to 4 weeks in advance. With unseasonably warm temperatures remaining above 25 degrees C, along with large tropical-cyclone-related rainfall events accumulating 10-15 mm per event, the modeledAe. albopictusmosquito abundance did not decrease during the second half of 2017, contrary to the normal behavior, likely contributing to the large dengue outbreak in early 2018. Although subseasonal forecasts of rainfall for the December-January period in Reunion are skillful up to 4 weeks in advance, the outbreak could only have been forecast 2 weeks in advance, which along with seasonal forecast information could have provided enough time to enhance preparedness measures. Our research demonstrates the potential of using state-of-the-art subseasonal climate forecasts to produce actionable subseasonal dengue predictions.

The trickster is deployed as a metaphorical device to provide insights into how the first DCA's candidates, their supervisors, and the university's leadership make sense of their own experiences within and about the practice-led research program under a neoliberal climate. Tricksters' cross boundaries between critical and imaginary spaces; yet they also create boundaries, by extending collective knowledge into the unknown. This process is entirely consistent with the critical and creative work required by doctoral candidates to produce innovative research. Narrative inquiry is applied in accordance with the artist-trickster's subjective agency within practice-led doctoral study. The article charts the DCA's emerging identity as a doctoral qualification equal to the traditional PhD but different from it, during its implementation in 2016 to the first successful completion in 2019.

The extent to which climate variability determined grain price variations remains contested, and claims of solar cycle influences on prices are disputed. We thoroughly reassess these questions, within a framework of comprehensive statistical analysis, by employing an unprecedentedly large grain price data set together with state-of-the-art palaeoclimate reconstructions and long meteorological series. A highly significant negative grain price-temperature relationship (i.e. colder = high prices and vice versa) is found across Europe. This association increases at larger spatial and temporal scales and reaches a correlation of -0.41 considering the European grain price average and previous year June-August temperatures at annual resolution, and of -0.63 at decadal timescales. This strong relationship is of episodic rather than periodic (cyclic) nature. Only weak and spatially inconsistent signals of hydroclimate (precipitation and drought), and no meaningful association with solar variations, are detected in the grain prices. The significant and persistent temperature effects on grain prices imply that this now rapidly changing climate element has been a more important factor in European economic history, even in southern Europe, than commonly acknowledged.","[Ljungqvist, Fredrik Charpentier] Stockholm Univ, Dept Hist, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Ljungqvist, Fredrik Charpentier] Stockholm Univ, Bolin Ctr Climate Res, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Ljungqvist, Fredrik Charpentier] Swedish Coll Adv Study, Thunbergsvagen 2, S-75238 Uppsala, Sweden; [Thejll, Peter; Christiansen, Bo] Danish Meteorol Inst, Lyngbyvej 100, DK-2100 Copenhagen O, Denmark; [Seim, Andrea] Albert Ludwig Univ Freiburg, Inst Forest Sci, Chair Forest Growth & Dendroecol, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany; [Seim, Andrea] Univ Innsbruck, Dept Bot, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; [Hartl, Claudia; Esper, Jan] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Dept Geog, D-55128 Mainz, Germany",Stockholm University; Stockholm University; Swedish Collegium for Advanced Study (SCAS); Danish Meteorological Institute DMI; University of Freiburg; University of Innsbruck; Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz,"Ljungqvist, FC (corresponding author), Stockholm Univ, Dept Hist, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.;Ljungqvist, FC (corresponding author), Stockholm Univ, Bolin Ctr Climate Res, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.;Ljungqvist, FC (corresponding author), Swedish Coll Adv Study, Thunbergsvagen 2, S-75238 Uppsala, Sweden.",fredrik.c.l@historia.su.se,"Esper, Jan/O-3127-2018; Charpentier Ljungqvist, Fredrik/I-5770-2012","Esper, Jan/0000-0003-3919-014X; Charpentier Ljungqvist, Fredrik/0000-0003-0220-3947",Stockholm University,Stockholm University,Open access funding provided by Stockholm University.,,162,4,4,1,8,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1863-2505,1863-2513,,CLIOMETRICA,Cliometrica,JAN,2022,1,,,,29,77,,10.1007/s11698-021-00224-7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11698-021-00224-7,,21-Mar,49,Economics; History; History Of Social Sciences,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;HCI),Business & Economics; History; Social Sciences - Other Topics,YC8UX,,"Green Published, hybrid",,,12/21/22,WOS:000626817600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

A number of studies have presented the notion of the 'echo chamber' to model and explain information flows across an array of social settings, finding disproportionate connections among ideologically similar political communicators. This paper builds on these findings to provide a more formal operationalization of the components of echo chambers. We then empirically test their utility using survey data collected from the community of political elites engaged in the contentious issue of climate politics in the United States. Our survey period coincides with the most active and contentious period in the history of US climate policy, when legislation regulating carbon dioxide emissions had passed through the House of Representatives and was being considered in the Senate. We use exponential random graph (ERG) modelling to demonstrate that both the homogeneity of information (the echo) and multi-path information transmission (the chamber) play significant roles in policy communication. We demonstrate that the intersection of these components creates echo chambers in the climate policy network. These results lead to some important conclusions about climate politics, as well as the relationship between science communication and policymaking at the elite level more generally.","[Jasny, Lorien] Natl Socioenvironm Synth Ctr, Annapolis, MD 21401 USA; [Jasny, Lorien] Univ Exeter, Q Step Ctr, Exeter EX4 4SB, Devon, England; [Waggle, Joseph; Fisher, Dana R.] Univ Maryland, Dept Sociol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",University of Exeter; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Fisher, DR (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Dept Sociol, 2112 Art Sociol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",drfisher@umd.edu,,"Jasny, Lorien/0000-0002-9014-4838; Fisher, Dana R/0000-0002-4273-4294; McCartney Waggle, Joseph/0000-0002-5035-1760",US National Science Foundation [BCS-0826892]; National Socio Environmental Synthesis Center (SESYNC) [DBI 1052875],US National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); National Socio Environmental Synthesis Center (SESYNC)(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)),"This research was supported by the US National Science Foundation (BCS-0826892) and the National Socio Environmental Synthesis Center (SESYNC) (DBI 1052875).

The regulatory functions read to essential comfort parameters such as air-layering in the passenger compartment, temperature and airflow rate at the discharge nozzles, angular influences and the intensity of solar irradiation. Such state-of-the-art systems function on the basis of a mechanically pressure-regulated compressor or the reheat process, whereby post-evaporator temperature is maintained at a level only slightly above the freezing point. This method results in a constant dehumidification level of the fresh air intake. Despite the above technology, conditions may occur during regulated climate-control system operation that lead to fogging-up, even in the safety-relevant area of the windscreen. Energy optimization will play an essential role in future climate-control systems. Regulated compressors will be used for regulation of cooling output by means of an electrical actuator. Due to the higher evaporator temperatures with this method, dehumidification levels may be lower, thus increasing the tendency of the windows to fog up. The fogging-up problem can be addressed by altering air distribution, air throughput and air temperature. in terms of safety, operating status must be set so as to maintain a safety margin below the fogging limit. This margin factor is calculated as the difference between dewpoint temperature and pane surface temperature. Approaches based on continuous humidity control are superior to a control function with switched levels. The values on which control is based are supplied by a combination sensor for interior temperature and humidity and a temperature sensor based on infrared emission, allowing for integral, contactless temperature measurement at the pane surface.

Findings indicate that BGI effectively controls urban runoff and mitigates urban heat, with the literature being slightly more focused on stormwater management than urban heat island mitigation. Among BGI, the studies on blue- and blue-green roofs focused on one benefit at a time (i.e. thermal or hydrologic performance) and did not consider promoting multiple benefits simultaneously. Two-thirds of the selected studies were performed on a large urban scale, with computer modelling and sensor monitoring being the predominant assessment methods. Compared with typical Green Infrastructure (GI), and from a design perspective, many crucial questions on BGI performance, particularly on smaller urban scales, remain unanswered. Future research will have to continue to explore the performance of BGI, considering the identified gaps.","[Almaaitah, Tamer; Joksimovic, Darko] Ryerson Univ, Dept Civil Engn, 350 Victoria St, Toronto, ON M5B 2K3, Canada; [Appleby, Madison; Rosenblat, Howard] Univ Toronto, John H Daniels Fac Architecture, 1 Spadina Crescent, Toronto, ON M5S 2J5, Canada; [Drake, Jennifer] Univ Toronto, Dept Civil & Mineral Engn, 35 St George St, Toronto, ON M55 1A4, Canada",Toronto Metropolitan University; University of Toronto; University of Toronto,"Almaaitah, T (corresponding author), Ryerson Univ, Dept Civil Engn, 350 Victoria St, Toronto, ON M5B 2K3, Canada.",tamer.almaaitah@ryerson.ca,,"Almaaitah, Tamer/0000-0001-7051-8743; Appleby, Madison/0000-0002-6871-5796; Joksimovic, Darko/0000-0001-7977-0566",,,,,77,9,9,26,59,IWA PUBLISHING,LONDON,"REPUBLIC-EXPORT BLDG, UNITS 1 04 & 1 05, 1 CLOVE CRESCENT, LONDON, ENGLAND",,2617-4782,,BLUE-GREEN SYST,Blue-Green Syst.,JAN,2021,1,,,,223,248,,10.2166/bgs.2021.016,http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/bgs.2021.016,,,26,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,YP7UV,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000748827500010,View Full Record in Web of Science

This work aims to thoroughly analyze the representation of the WAM system in two state-of-the-art, high-resolution (similar to 25 km) regional climate models (RCMs) in order to highlight the causes of models' biases through a process-oriented evaluation approach. Model results generally feature a north (Sahel) - south (Guinea Coast) dipole-like rainfall bias, although, sometimes, positive or negative rainfall biases are evident almost over the whole of West Africa. Our analysis shows that biases in the sea- and land-surface temperature on the one hand, and biases in the sea-level and land-surface pressure, on the other hand, lead to biases in the simulated temperature and pressure contrasts between the west African landmass and the eastern Atlantic ocean. As a consequence, biases appear in the modeled monsoon flow strength, which, in turn, lead to errors in the amount of advected moisture in the interior of the continent via southwesterlies and the West African westerly jet (WAWJ) on the one hand, and the extent of deepening of the monsoon flux inland on the other hand. In addition, the African easterly jet (AEJ) is underestimated, inducing an underestimation of the African easterly waves (AEWs) activity and a weakening of the cyclonic convective circulation resulting from the AEWs' troughs, leading to a decrease in the southwesterly flow feeding mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) embedded within the AEJ. The modeled equatorward or northward shifting of the AEJ is likewise found to contribute to the models' wet or dry biases over the Sahel. Finally, there is no consistency between models and reanalyses on the one hand, and between RCM experiments on the other hand, in the way, the simulated atmospheric instability/stability modulates the convection, especially over the Sahel.","[Tamoffo, Alain T.; Amekudzi, Leonard K.] Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Phys Dept, Meteorol & Climate Sci Unit, Kumasi, Ghana; [Tamoffo, Alain T.] Univ Yaounde I, Lab Environm Modelling & Atmospher Phys LEMAP, Phys Dept, Yaounde, Cameroon; [Dosio, Alessandro] European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr JRC, Ispra, Italy; [Tamoffo, Alain T.; Weber, Torsten] Helmholtz Zentrum Hereon, Climate Serv Ctr Germany GERICS, Fischertwiete 1, D-20095 Hamburg, Germany",Kwame Nkrumah University Science & Technology; University of Yaounde I; European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site,"Tamoffo, AT (corresponding author), Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Phys Dept, Meteorol & Climate Sci Unit, Kumasi, Ghana.;Tamoffo, AT (corresponding author), Univ Yaounde I, Lab Environm Modelling & Atmospher Phys LEMAP, Phys Dept, Yaounde, Cameroon.;Tamoffo, AT (corresponding author), Helmholtz Zentrum Hereon, Climate Serv Ctr Germany GERICS, Fischertwiete 1, D-20095 Hamburg, Germany.",alaintamoffotchio@gmail.com,"Dosio, Alessandro/U-9093-2017","Dosio, Alessandro/0000-0002-6365-9473; Amekudzi, Leonard Kofitse/0000-0002-2186-3425","DAAD; Federal Ministry of Education and Research [57556650, 91795180]",DAAD(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)); Federal Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"The research of this article was supported by DAAD within the framework of the ClimapAfrica programme with funds of the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (funding ID: 57556650 and Per.

However, their coupled behaviour has only recently been examined in any detail, and has yielded a very wide range of outcomes. For example, coupled climate-carbon cycle models that represent land-use change simulate total land carbon stores at 2100 that vary by as much as 600 Pg C, given the same emissions scenario. This large uncertainty is associated with differences in how key processes are simulated in different models, and illustrates the necessity of determining which models are most realistic using rigorous methods of model evaluation. Here we assess the state-of-the-art in evaluation of ESMs, with a particular emphasis on the simulation of the carbon cycle and associated biospheric processes. We examine some of the new advances and remaining uncertainties relating to (i) modern and palaeodata and (ii) metrics for evaluation. We note that the practice of averaging results from many models is unreliable and no substitute for proper evaluation of individual models. We discuss a range of strategies, such as the inclusion of pre-calibration, combined process- and system-level evaluation, and the use of emergent constraints, that can contribute to the development of more robust evaluation schemes. An increasingly data-rich environment offers more opportunities for model evaluation, but also presents a challenge. Improved knowledge of data uncertainties is still necessary to move the field of ESM evaluation away from a beauty contest towards the development of useful constraints on model outcomes.","[Foley, A.

First, the impact of the visualizations, based on scientific environmental modeling and presented in three different presentation formats, verbal/visual presentation, posters and a virtual globe, was evaluated with regard to immediate impacts during the process. Second, the long-term impacts on decision-making and actual outcomes were evaluated in a retrospective evaluation 22 months after the end of the initial planning process. Two results are highlighted: according to the quantitative pre-/post-questionnaires, the visualizations contributed to increased awareness and understanding. Most importantly, the retrospective evaluation indicated that the process informed policy, operational and built changes in Kimberley, in which the landscape visualizations played a role. The post interviews with key decision-makers showed that they remembered most of the visualizations and some decision-makers were further using them, particularly the posters. The virtual globe seemed to be not a sustainable display format suitable for formal decision-making processes such as council meetings though. That may change with the further mainstreaming of visualization technologies or mobile devices. Until then, we recommend using display formats that can be re-used following a specific planning event such as an Open House, to ensure on-going support for effective decision-making over the longer-term.

Several recent studies using the 'aridity index' (the ratio of potential evaporation to precipitation), have concluded that aridity will increase with CO2 because of increasing temperature. However, the 'aridity index' is-counterintuitively-not a direct measure of aridity per se (when defined as above) and there is widespread evidence that contradicts the 'warmer is more arid' interpretation. We provide here an assessment of multi-model changes in a broad set of aridity metrics over a large range of atmospheric CO2 concentrations ranging from conditions at the last glacial maximum to 4xCO(2), using an ensemble of simulations from state-of-the-art Earth system models. Most measures of aridity do not show increasing aridity on global scales under conditions of increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations and related global warming, although we note some varying responses depending on the considered variables. The response is, furthermore, more nuanced at regional scales, but in the majority of regions aridity does not increase with CO2 in the majority of metrics. Our results emphasize that it is not the climate models that project overwhelming increases of aridity with increasing CO2, but rather a secondary, offline, impact model-the 'aridity index'-that uses climate model output as input.","[Greve, Peter; Seneviratne, Sonia I.] ETH, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, Zurich, Switzerland; [Greve, Peter] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Laxenburg, Austria; [Roderick, Michael L.] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Earth Sci, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Roderick, Michael L.] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Biol, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Roderick, Michael L.] Australian Res Council Ctr Excellence Climate Sys, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); Australian National University; Australian National University,"Greve, P (corresponding author), ETH, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, Zurich, Switzerland.;Greve, P (corresponding author), Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Laxenburg, Austria.",greve@iiasa.ac.at,"Roderick, Michael/C-9621-2009; Greve, Peter/AAD-4377-2019; Greve, Peter/K-5311-2015; Seneviratne, Sonia I./G-8761-2011","Roderick, Michael/0000-0002-3630-7739; Greve, Peter/0000-0002-9454-0125; Greve, Peter/0000-0002-9454-0125; Seneviratne, Sonia I./0000-0001-9528-2917",,,,,33,36,37,1,18,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1748-9326,,,ENVIRON RES LETT,Environ.

For many developing countries and remote communities, meeting electricity demand is a challenge due to a power generation shortage and load variability that is highly driven by weather uncertainty. Electric utilities' practical planning solutions are to disable electricity access from new residential regions, supply at least 10% of the non-electrified regions, or follow a rotating feeder curtailment such that the new regions are electrified for a few hours daily. This study proposes an alternative framework to plan electricity access more efficiently in developing countries.

With multilateral approaches continuing to fail, states could possibly resort to unilateral regulation that limits emissions within their territory or bans the use and production of particular products. To the extent this affects foreign investors, the question arises whether investment treaties chill or even obstruct such unilateral action because it violates investment law concepts, such as indirect expropriation or fair and equitable treatment. This note therefore assesses the interaction between international investment law and unilateralism that endeavors to mitigate the effects of climate change.

G. Ballard's first four novels, The Wind From Nowhere (1962), The Drowned World (1962), The Drought (1965), and The Crystal World (1966) that centers on their portrayal of environmental transformation. Drawing on revised conceptualizations of the second law of thermodynamics and recent materialist scholarship, I illustrate how Ballard invokes material transformations that are ambivalently coded as terminal stasis and morphogenesis. In anticipations of the paradigm of the Anthropocene and ecocritical approaches to global climate change, Ballard's novels re-embed the human in an ecology of inhuman forces and modes of self-organization that radically challenge entrenched ontological divisions and systemic boundaries. Particular attention is paid to the ways in which emergent structures, such as hurricanes and crystals identify his landscapes as dissipative systems far from equilibrium and rife with potential for the spontaneous generation of form. This resonance with scientific frameworks reveals itself in poetic registers that parallelize metaphors of life and death, and hinge on an estrangement of not only landscape, but also temporality, thus literalizing what it might mean to understand the human as a geological subject in the age of the Anthropocene.","[Ingwersen, Moritz] Univ Konstanz, Dept Literature Art & Media Studies, D-78457 Constance, Germany",University of Konstanz,"Ingwersen, M (corresponding author), Univ Konstanz, Dept Literature Art & Media Studies, D-78457 Constance, Germany.",moritz.ingwersen@gmail.com,,"Ingwersen, Moritz/0000-0002-2612-5456",,,,,61,0,0,0,0,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-0787,,HUMANITIES-BASEL,Humanities-Basel,MAR,2019,1,,,,,,52,10.3390/h8010052,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/h8010052,,,16,"Humanities, Multidisciplinary",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Arts & Humanities - Other Topics,VK3QA,,"Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000682985500052,View Full Record in Web of Science

After a period of gradually increasing openness of a few private collections of Old Masters, the Moltke Gallery opened in 1804 as the first fully accessible collection of this kind. Though this happened almost by coincidence, as Count Moltke had simply found himself unable to dispose of his father's collection and decided to put it on show, his initiative soon found ideological backing in a period of wartime nationalism. In this climate, the exhibiting of private art collections was increasingly represented as an act of patriotism and charity. The foremost representative of this movement was the idealist collector Hans West, whose own gallery ultimately came to play an integral part in the formation of a public art gallery in Denmark.","Statens Museum Kunst, DK-1307 Copenhagen, Denmark",,"Svenningsen, J (corresponding author), Statens Museum Kunst, Solvgade 48-50, DK-1307 Copenhagen, Denmark.",jesper.svenningsen@smk.dk,,"Svenningsen, Jesper/0000-0001-8823-8758",Novo Nordisk Fonden [NNF12OC1015815] Funding Source: researchfish,Novo Nordisk Fonden(Novo Nordisk Foundation),,,51,2,2,0,0,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0954-6650,1477-8564,,J HIST COLLECT,J.

However, efforts to better theorize the drivers of integration beyond listing explanatory factors remain weak. Viewing integration as a process of policy change for dealing with complex problems, this study argues that policy integration analysis can benefit from an advocacy coalition approach (ACF) to address this theoretical gap. It illustrates the analytical framework by empirically investigating the drivers of policy (dis)integration in Brazil's subnational water policy introduced in the 2010s. The level of conflict between coalitions, adjustment of policy beliefs, coordination within and across coalitions, and existence of venues for interaction and policy-oriented learning were presented as factors that can foster or hinder the integration of public policies. Moreover, the study discusses the potential to acknowledge in ACF the mechanisms for coordinating policy actors and instruments, which would facilitate the analysis of the policy processes of cooperation. It also demonstrates that recent droughts in Northeast Brazil have been increasingly related to the local impacts of climate change, contributing to reframing water management as a cross-sectoral climate and water governance issue. The analysis was based on a literature review, semi-structured interviews, and social network analysis.","[Milhorance, Carolina; Le Coq, Jean-Francois; Sabourin, Eric] Ctr Agr Res & Dev CIRAD UMR ART Dev, Montpellier, France; [Sabourin, Eric] Univ Brasilia CDS UnB, Ctr Sustainable Dev, Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Le Coq, Jean-Francois; Sabourin, Eric] Montpellier Univ Excellence MUSE, Montpellier, France; [Le Coq, Jean-Francois] Int Ctr Trop Agr Alliance Biodivers CIAT, Cali, Colombia",Universite de Montpellier; Universite de Montpellier,"Milhorance, C (corresponding author), Ctr Agr Res & Dev CIRAD UMR ART Dev, Montpellier, France.",carolina.milhorance@cirad.fr; jf.lecoq@cgiar.org; eric.sabourin@cirad.fr,,"Milhorance, Carolina/0000-0002-3290-8596; Le Coq, Jean-Francois/0000-0003-1084-1973; SABOURIN, Eric/0000-0002-1171-2535","Association Nationale de la Recherche et de la Technologie [ANR-16-IDEX-0006, ANR-17-CE03-0005]; Brazil's CNPq/Capes/FAPDF [16-2014]",Association Nationale de la Recherche et de la Technologie(French National Research Agency (ANR)); Brazil's CNPq/Capes/FAPDF,This work was supported by the Association Nationale de la Recherche et de la Technologie [ARTIMIX N degrees ANR-17-CE03-0005]; Association Nationale de la Recherche et de la Technologie [TYPOCLIM ANR-16-IDEX-0006]; Brazil's CNPq/Capes/FAPDF [INCT no 16-2014 ODISSEIA].,,57,3,3,7,25,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-2687,1573-0891,,POLICY SCI,Policy Sci.,SEP,2021,3,,SI,,557,578,,10.1007/s11077-021-09422-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11077-021-09422-6,,21-May,22,"Public Administration; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Public Administration; Social Sciences - Other Topics,UD4LC,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000650517400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Simple strategies of downscaling suffer from serious deficiencies when applied to mountainous areas so more sophisticated techniques are needed.

As the total replacement of fossil fuel energy is not expected to take place immediately in the near future, the International Energy Agency has repeatedly declared carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) as a key technology for mitigating climate change. However, CCS lacks the scale required for substantial reduction in carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel power generation. Even though CCS is one of the key technologies for mitigating climate change, why has this technology not had an international breakthrough? To shed light on this question, this paper employs a simple model of energy generation, scrutinizes the economic drivers of CCS based on the analytical results, and discusses the possible obstacles that can prevent a widespread rollout of the technology. This is followed by a state-of-the-art in literature pertaining to the economics of CCS, and a discussion that points to a dichotomy between the economic theory and reality. The study concludes with some policy suggestions and directions for future research.","[Durmaz, Tunc] Yildiz Tech Univ, Dept Econ, Davutpasa Campus, TR-34210 Istanbul, Turkey",Yildiz Technical University,"Durmaz, T (corresponding author), Yildiz Tech Univ, Dept Econ, Davutpasa Campus, TR-34210 Istanbul, Turkey.",tdurmaz@yildiz.edu.tr,"Durmaz, Tunc/A-6260-2018","Durmaz, Tunc/0000-0001-5693-3350",Center for Sustainable Energy Studies (CenSES),Center for Sustainable Energy Studies (CenSES),"This paper has been greatly inspired by the trial lecture that I had delivered prior to my PhD defense at the Norwegian School of Economics on November 25, 2015.

Instead, over the past twenty years-beginning with the works of William Cline and William Nordhaus-economists claiming to specialise in the field of climate economics have seen the economist as saviour, assumed global climatic change between 1970 and 2000 (at least) must have had anthropogenic causation, and come forward with over-ambitious ideas and techniques. Ignoring the implications of the tragedy of the commons, which in principle excludes key issues from resolution in the market place and places them uncertainly in the political and negotiating arena, they have all too often proceeded to try to value costs and benefits, make an integrated assessment of them all, pluck long-term discount rates out of the air, place scientific and economic uncertainty aside, and make challengeable assumptions about distribution between generations and nations. Economists would be better advised to be more modest in what they seek to achieve, and recall the long tradition within economics of recognising the unknowable. Their techniques may be better applied in assessing the respective costs and benefits of taxes or regulation, and in exposing the internal contradictions of many claims for renewable energy and the assumption that technological innovation will continue to meet human needs and aspirations. They should recall the remark of England's King Charles II: Things impossible do excuse themselves in not being done. With world population continuing to grow, many resources under pressure, and widespread evidence of sub-optimal decision-making, climate economics should return to the art of the possible.","[Jefferson, Michael] London Metropolitan Business Sch, Int Business & Sustainabil Ctr, London, England",London Metropolitan University,,,,,,,,,55,1,1,0,1,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"PO BOX 128 FARRER RD, SINGAPORE 9128, SINGAPORE",,,978-981-4531-77-1,SCI CULT-NUCL STRAT,,,2013,,,,,141,159,,,,,,19,"Multidisciplinary Sciences; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BA6DO,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000337104400013,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, due to the nature of the procedures to obtain observations and the statistical techniques employed to extrapolate this information onto reference gridded databases, they contain important uncertainties which may compromise the evaluation process. This paper examines to what extent the evaluation and ranking of an ensemble of regional climate models, according to their ability to reproduce the observed climatologies, is sensitive to the choice of the reference observational data set. Results show that even in areas covered by dense monitoring networks such as Spain, uncertainties in the observations are comparable to the uncertainties within state-of-the-art Regional Climate Models, at least when they are driven by nominally perfect boundary conditions like reanalysis. These findings point out that model evaluation should take into account the observational uncertainties. In particular, weighting models according to how well they perform with respect to a unique observation dataset, without acknowledging uncertainties in the observational dataset, might reduce the quality of the weighted ensemble average.

HUANG; AEROSOL,"Air pollution is understudied in sub-Saharan Africa, resulting in a gap in the scientific understanding of emissions, atmospheric processes, and impacts of air pollutants in this region. The Rwanda Climate Observatory, a joint partnership between MIT and the government of Rwanda, has been measuring ambient concentrations of key long-lived greenhouse gases and the short-lived climate-forcing pollutants CO2, CO, CH4, black carbon (BC), and O-3 with state-of-the-art instruments on the summit of Mt. Mugogo (1.586 degrees S, 29.566 degrees E; 2590 m above sea level) since May 2015. Rwanda is a small, mountainous, and densely populated country in equatorial East Africa, currently undergoing rapid development but still at less than 20 % urbanization. Black carbon concentrations during Rwanda's two dry seasons (December-January-February, DJF, and June-July- August, JJA), which coincide with the two regional biomass burning seasons, are higher at Mt. Mugogo than in major European cities with daily values (24 h) during the dry season of around 5 mu g M-3 (daily average concentrations ranging from less than 0.1 to over 17 mu g m(-3) for the entire measurement period). BC baseline concentrations during biomass burning seasons are loosely correlated with fire radiative power data for the region acquired with a MODIS satellite instrument. The position and meteorology of Rwanda is such that the emissions transported from both the northern and southern African biomass burning seasons affect BC, CO, and O-3 concentrations in Rwanda. Spectral aerosol absorption measured with a dual-spot Aethalometer varies seasonally due to changes in types of fuel burned and the direction of pollution transport to the site. Ozone concentrations peaked during Rwanda's dry seasons (daily measured maximum of 70 ppbv). The understanding and quantification of the percent contributions of regional and local (beyond large-scale biomass) emissions is essential to guide policy in the region. During the rainy seasons, local emitting activities (e.g., cooking, transportation, trash burning) remain steady, regional biomass burning is low, and transport distances are shorter as rainout of pollution occurs regularly. Thus, local pollution at Mugogo can be estimated during this time period and was found to account for up to 35 % of annual average BC measured. Our measurements indicate that air pollution is a current and growing problem in equatorial East Africa.","[DeWitt, H.

The pattern of activity or inactivity during college tends to persist into adulthood. A critical need exists for examination of strategies to engage college-age students in physical activity habits. One way to do this is through physical activity courses offered in colleges. This study examines the relationship between perceptions of a caring psychological climate and group connectedness, enjoyment, and attitudes toward classmates and the instructor in group physical activity courses. Material and methods: Participants were 174 students (107 males and 67 females; Mage = 21.71) enrolled in exercise, martial arts, and sports courses at a large university in the Mountain West. Results: Perceptions of a caring climate were significantly related to enhanced feelings of group connectedness, heightened enjoyment, and more positive attitudes toward classmates and instructor. Discussion: These findings suggest that a strategy to foster engagement in physical activity courses on campus is to train instructors to value, support, and welcome students.","[Newland, Aubrey] Calif State Univ Chico, Chico, CA 95929 USA; [Newton, Maria; Podlog, Leslie; Hall, Morgan] Univ Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [Stark, Andrea] Univ Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",California State University System; California State University Chico; Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Newland, A (corresponding author), Calif State Univ Chico, Dept Kinesiol, 400 West First St, Chico, CA 95926 USA.",anewland1@csuchico.edu,,,,,,,51,4,4,3,16,SCIENDO,WARSAW,"BOGUMILA ZUGA 32A, WARSAW, MAZOVIA, POLAND",0043-9630,2080-2234,,BIOMED HUM KINET,Biomed.

Drawing on my personal experience within the radical climate movement(s), this paper looks to develop on the commitments of militant research, contribute to the development of militant ethnography as a research approach and consider the subsequent implications for thinking through the activist/academic problematic. Elaborating on the epistemological distinction between 'truth relaying' and 'knowledge production', it is contended that militant research is an orientation and process synonymous with the disavowal of positivist knowledge and the construction of situated partisan knowledge(s). Rather than the (social) science of transmitting truth, research thus becomes the art of producing tools you can fight with. From this perspective, the activist/academic problematic is not a 'neutral' problem but a product of a certain way of knowing associated with the academy. The paper concludes that our concern should not be to navigate between (and thus reiterate) the fields of 'activism' and 'academy', but to surpass the problematic altogether. We are tasked not with reproducing the university in its current form, but reimagining it as a machine for the production of other worlds.","Univ Liverpool, Sch Earth & Environm, Liverpool L69 3BX, Merseyside, England",University of Liverpool,"Russell, B (corresponding author), Univ Liverpool, Sch Earth & Environm, Liverpool L69 3BX, Merseyside, England.",b.t.russell@liverpool.ac.uk,,"Russell, Bertie/0000-0001-8307-6219",,,,,46,47,47,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-0894,1475-4762,,AREA,Area,SEP,2015,3,,,,222,229,,10.1111/area.12086,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/area.12086,,,8,Geography,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Geography,CP0YV,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000359603900002,View Full Record in Web of Science

They have developed various mechanisms enabling them to cope with fluctuating environmental conditions during their life span, and to survive to current climate change. Epigenetics has recently emerged as a powerful set of mechanisms regulating various developmental processes, plant growth and responses to environmental variations. Such epigenetic mechanisms, which may remain stable along tree life or across generations, constitute a source of rapid phenotypic variations potentially improving adaptation of the plants in situations in which naturally occurring mutations are very rare. In this review, we summarize recent advances in forest tree epigenomics. We first draw the particularities of trees and the available (epi) genomics resources and strategies. Then, we discuss the potential contributions of epigenetics to cope with global climate change and regulate various developmental processes, such as developmental transitions during the annual cycle, phenotypic plasticity in response to environmental variations and stress memory, as well as local adaptation. Finally, we propose some challenges for forest management and highlighted the need to take epigenetics into account in forest tree breeding strategies.","[Sow, Mamadou Dia; Fichot, Regis; Maury, Stephane] Univ Orleans, INRA, Lab Biol Ligneux & Grandes Cultures, EA 1207,USC 1328, Orleans, France; [Allona, Isabel; Conde, Daniel] Univ Politecn Madrid UPM, Inst Nacl Invest & Tecnol Agr Alimentaria INIA, Ctr Biotecnol & Genom Plantas, Madrid, Spain; [Ambroise, Christophe] Univ Evry Val dEssonne, CNRS, Lab Math & Modelisat Evry, UMR 8071, Evry, France; [Gribkova, Svetlana] Univ Paris Diderot, CNRS, LPMA, UMR 8001, Paris, France; [Jorge, Veronique; Paques, Luc; Sanchez-Rodriguez, Leopoldo; Segura, Vincent] INRA ONF, BioForA, Biol Integree Valorisat Divers Arbres & Foret, UMR 0588, Orleans, France; [Plomion, Christophe] Univ Bordeaux, INRA, BIOGECO, Cestas, France; [Salse, Jerome] Univ Clermont Auvergne, INRA, GDEC, UMR 1095, Clermont Ferrand, France; [Tost, Jorg] CNRGH CEA, LEE, Evry, France",INRAE; Universite de Orleans; Instituto Nacional Investigacion Tecnologia Agraria Alimentaria (INIA); Universidad Politecnica de Madrid; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Mathematical Sciences (INSMI); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Cite; INRAE; INRAE; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite de Bordeaux; INRAE; Universite Clermont Auvergne (UCA),"Maury, S (corresponding author), Univ Orleans, INRA, Lab Biol Ligneux & Grandes Cultures, EA 1207,USC 1328, Orleans, France.",stephane.maury@univ-orleans.fr,"Jorge, Véronique/V-4165-2019; Sow, Mamadou/AFP-6476-2022; Fichot, Régis/A-3654-2015; Tost, Joerg/H-7129-2019; Segura, Vincent/B-4656-2013; Allona, Isabel/J-5972-2014","Jorge, Véronique/0000-0002-5016-3006; Sow, Mamadou/0000-0002-2815-4939; Fichot, Régis/0000-0001-5527-4103; Tost, Joerg/0000-0002-2683-0817; Segura, Vincent/0000-0003-1860-2256; Maury, Stephane/0000-0003-0481-0847; Allona, Isabel/0000-0002-7012-2850; CONDE RODRIGUEZ, DANIEL/0000-0001-8362-4190",,,,,247,29,30,4,39,ACADEMIC PRESS LTD-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,LONDON,"24-28 OVAL ROAD, LONDON NW1 7DX, ENGLAND",0065-2296,,978-0-12-815403-8,ADV BOT RES,Adv.

However, the extent that agricultural management adaptation can counterbalance negative climate-change impacts and achieve sustainable agricultural production remains poorly quantified. Such quantification is especially important for the Indus basin, as irrigated agriculture is essential for its food security and will be highly affected by increasing temperatures and changing water availability. Our study quantified these effects for several climatechange mitigation scenarios and agricultural management-adaptation strategies using the state-of-the-art VICWOFOST hydrology-crop model. Our results show that by the 2030s, management adaptation through improved nutrient availability and constrained irrigation will be sufficient to achieve sustainable and increased agricultural production. However, by the 2080s agricultural productivity will strongly depend on worldwide climate-change mitigation efforts. Especially under limited climate-change mitigation, management adaptation will be insufficient to compensate the severe production losses due to heat stress. Our study clearly indicates the limits to management adaptation in the Indus basin, and only further adaptation or strong worldwide climate-change mitigation will secure the Indus' food productivity.","[Droppers, B.; Supit, I; Ludwig, F.] Wageningen Univ, Water Syst & Global Change Grp, POB 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; [Leemans, R.] Wageningen Univ, Environm Syst Anal Grp, POB 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; [van Vliet, M.

Here using the NASA Goddard Earth Observing System Model, Version 5 (GEOS-5) with aerosol tracers and a state-of-the-art snow darkening module (GOddard SnoW Impurity Module: GOSWIM) for the land surface, we examine the role of SDE on climate in the boreal spring snowmelt season. SDE is found to produce significant surface warming (over 15Wm(-2)) over broad areas in midlatitudes, with dust being the most important contributor to the warming in central Asia and the western Himalayas and with BC having larger impact in the Europe, eastern Himalayas, East Asia, and North America. The contribution of OC to the warming is generally low but still significant mainly over southeastern Siberia, northeastern East Asia, and western Canada (similar to 19% of the total solar visible absorption by these snow impurities). The simulations suggest that SDE strengthens the boreal spring water cycle in East Asia through water recycling and moisture advection from the ocean and contributes to the maintenance of dry conditions in parts of a region spanning Europe to central Asia, partially through feedback on the model's background climatology. Overall, our study suggests that the existence of SDE in the Earth system associated with dust, BC, and OC contributes significantly to enhanced surface warming over continents in northern hemisphere midlatitudes during boreal spring, raising the surface skin temperature by approximately 3-6K near the snowline.","[Yasunari, Teppei J.] Univ Space Res Assoc, Goddard Earth Sci Technol & Res, Columbia, MD 21046 USA; [Yasunari, Teppei J.; Koster, Randal D.; Lau, William K.

Changes in the high-frequency variability of temperature exert additional pressures, yet the effect of greenhouse forcing thereon has not been fully assessed or identified in observational data. Here, we show that the intramonthly variability of daily surface temperature changes with distinct global patterns as greenhouse gas concentrations rise. In both reanalyses of historical observations and state-of-the-art projections, variability increases at low to mid latitudes and decreases at northern mid to high latitudes with enhanced greenhouse forcing. These latitudinally polarized daily variability changes are identified from internal climate variability using a recently developed signal-tonoise-maximizing pattern-filtering technique. Analysis of a multimodel ensemble from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 shows that these changes are attributable to enhanced greenhouse forcing. By the end of the century under a businessas-usual emissions scenario, daily temperature variability would continue to increase by up to a further 100% at low latitudes and decrease by 40% at northern high latitudes. Alternative scenarios demonstrate that these changes would be limited by mitigation of greenhouse gases. Moreover, global changes in daily variability exhibit strong covariation with warming across climate models, suggesting that the equilibrium climate sensitivity will also play a role in determining the extent of future variability changes. This global response of the high-frequency climate system to enhanced greenhouse forcing is likely to have strong and unequal effects on societies, economies, and ecosystems if mitigation and protection measures are not taken.","[Kotz, Maximilian; Wenz, Leonie; Levermann, Anders] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Res Dept Complex Sci, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany; [Kotz, Maximilian; Levermann, Anders] Potsdam Univ, Inst Phys, D-14469 Potsdam, Germany; [Wenz, Leonie] Mercator Res Inst Global Commons & Climate Change, D-10829 Berlin, Germany; [Wenz, Leonie] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Levermann, Anders] Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, New York, NY 10027 USA",Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; University of Potsdam; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Columbia University,"Levermann, A (corresponding author), Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Res Dept Complex Sci, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany.;Levermann, A (corresponding author), Potsdam Univ, Inst Phys, D-14469 Potsdam, Germany.;Levermann, A (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, New York, NY 10027 USA.",Anders.levermann@pik-potsdam.de,"Levermann, Anders/G-4666-2011","Levermann, Anders/0000-0003-4432-4704; Kotz, Maximilian/0000-0003-2564-5043; Wenz, Leonie/0000-0002-8500-1568",Volkswagen Foundation,Volkswagen Foundation(Volkswagen),"This work was supported by the Volkswagen Foundation.

Here we report on coupled climate simulations with a state-of-the-art global ocean biogeochemical model for DMS distribution and fluxes using present-day and future atmospheric CO2 concentrations. We find changes in zonal averaged DMS flux to the atmosphere of over 150% in the Southern Ocean. This is due to concurrent sea ice changes and ocean ecosystem composition shifts caused by changes in temperature, mixing, nutrient, and light regimes. The largest changes occur in a region already sensitive to climate change, so any resultant local CLAW/Gaia feedback of DMS on clouds, and thus radiative forcing, will be particularly important. A comparison of these results to prior studies shows that increasing model complexity is associated with reduced DMS emissions at the equator and increased emissions at high latitudes.

In this article, we present a Black Sea reanalysis covering the whole satellite altimetry era. In the scope of the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service, the Black Sea reanalysis system is produced using an advanced variational data assimilation method to combine the best available observations with a state-of-the-art ocean general circulation model. The hydrodynamical model is based on Nucleus for European Modeling of the Ocean, implemented for the Black Sea domain with a horizontal resolution of 1/27 degrees x 1/36 degrees, and 31 unevenly distributed vertical levels. The model is forced by the ECMWF ERA5 atmospheric reanalysis and climatological precipitation, whereas the sea surface temperature is relaxed to daily objective analysis fields. The model is online coupled to OceanVar, a 3D-Var ocean data assimilation scheme, to assimilate sea level anomaly along-track observations and in situ vertical profiles of temperature and salinity. Temperature fields present a continuous warming in the layer between 25 and 150 m, where the Black Sea Cold Intermediate Layer resides. This is an important signal of the Black Sea response to climate change. Sea surface temperature shows a basin-wide positive bias and the root mean square difference can reach 0.75 degrees C along the Turkish coast in summer. The overall surface dynamic topography is well reproduced as well as the reanalysis can represent the main Black Sea circulation such as the Rim Current and the quasi-permanent anticyclonic Sevastopol and Batumi eddies. The system produces very accurate estimates of temperature, salinity and sea level which makes it suitable for understanding the Black Sea physical state in the last decades. Nevertheless, in order to improve the quality of the Black Sea reanalysis, new developments in ocean modeling and data assimilation are still important, and sustaining the Black Sea ocean observing system is crucial.","[Lima, Leonardo; Aydogdu, Ali; Masina, Simona; Escudier, Romain; Cipollone, Andrea; Clementi, Emanuela] Ctr Euromediterraneo Cambiamenti Climat, Ocean Modeling & Data Assimilat Div, Lecce, Italy; [Ciliberti, Stefania Angela; Azevedo, Diana; Causio, Salvatore; Lecci, Rita; Jansen, Eric; Creti, Sergio; Stefanizzi, Laura; Palermo, Francesco; Coppini, Giovanni] Ctr Euromediterraneo Cambiamenti Climat, Ocean Predict & Applicat Div, Lecce, Italy; [Peneva, Elisaveta] Sofia Univ St Kliment Ohridski, Dept Meteorol & Geophys, Fac Phys, Sofia, Bulgaria; [Ilicak, Mehmet] Istanbul Tech Univ, Eurasia Inst Earth Sci, Istanbul, Turkey",Centro Euro-Mediterraneo sui Cambiamenti Climatici (CMCC); Centro Euro-Mediterraneo sui Cambiamenti Climatici (CMCC); University of Sofia; Istanbul Technical University,"Lima, L (corresponding author), Ctr Euromediterraneo Cambiamenti Climat, Ocean Modeling & Data Assimilat Div, Lecce, Italy.",leonardo.lima@cmcc.it,"Jansen, Eric/AGV-8889-2022; Lima, Leonardo Nascimento/ADP-2074-2022; Clementi, Emanuela/AAB-4952-2022; Aydoğdu, Ali/AAZ-3891-2020","Jansen, Eric/0000-0002-8689-7685; Lima, Leonardo Nascimento/0000-0003-3208-5857; Clementi, Emanuela/0000-0002-5752-1849; Aydoğdu, Ali/0000-0002-1557-7502",,,,,66,5,5,1,2,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-7745,,FRONT MAR SCI,Front.

Simulations were conducted with a dedicated newly developed model, the Oensingen Grassland Model. It was calibrated using measurements taken in a recently established permanent sward in Central Switzerland, and run to simulate SOC dynamics over 2001-2100 under various climate change scenarios assuming different elements of IPCC A2 emission scenarios. We found that: (1) management intensity dominates SOC until approximately 20 years after grassland establishment. Differences in SOC between climate scenarios become significant after 20 years and climate effects dominate SOC dynamics from approximately 50 years after establishment. (2) Carbon supplied through manure contributes about 60% to measured organic C increase in fertilized grassland. (3) Soil C accumulates particularly in the top 10 cm of the soil until 5 years after establishment. In the long-term, C accumulation takes place in the top 15 cm of the soil profile, while C content decreases below this depth. The transitional depth between gains and losses of C mainly depends on the vertical distribution of root senescence and root biomass. We discuss the importance of previous land use on carbon sequestration potentials that are much lower at the Oensingen site under ley-arable rotation with much higher SOC stocks than most soils under arable crops. We further discuss the importance of biomass senescence rates, because C balance estimations indicate that these may differ considerably between the two management systems.","[De Bruijn, A. M.

Climate change involves shifts in both mean and variability of climate parameters, and experimental results and simulations have shown that both mean and variability can have the same-order effects on crop growth and yield. It is therefore important for impact models to be able to capture the effects of both these aspects. The aim of the present study was to test the ability of statistical crop models to predict the effects of changes in mean and variability of temperature and precipitation on grain yield of maize. Climate variables were aggregated over different time intervals to explore effects of temporal aggregation of predictor variables. To examine the predictive capabilities of statistical crop models beyond the ranges of observed data, we applied the 'perfect model' approach using the process-based crop model CropSyst. Statistical crop models were then fitted based on different sample sizes to explore minimum data requirements for predicting the effects of different synthetic climate scenarios. The analysis revealed that statistical crop models are generally able to quantify the effects of changes in mean and variability of temperature and precipitation with reasonable accuracy, provided that a minimum of 10 to 20 samples per predictor are available for fitting. Also, we can conclude that with total sample sizes of < 300 observations, disaggregation of predictor variables increases the risk of model over-fitting. Disaggregation of predictor variables had small beneficial effects, particularly for predicting impacts of changes in climate variability, only with large sample sizes (> 300 ob servations).","[Holzkaemper, A.; Calanca, P.; Fuhrer, J.] Air Pollut & Climate Grp, Agroscope Res Stn Reckenholz Tanikon ART, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Research Station Agroscope,"Holzkamper, A (corresponding author), Air Pollut & Climate Grp, Agroscope Res Stn Reckenholz Tanikon ART, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland.",annelie.holzkaemper@art.admin.ch,,,,,,,42,25,25,2,33,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0936-577X,1616-1572,,CLIM RES,Clim.

This article looks beyond the content of such images in order to examine the infrastructures that underpin them. Paying attention to two key infrastructures in particular-the Cold War faith in prediction and the extraordinary explosion of scenario planning in the years that followed-the article explores the ways in which speculation was transformed into a tightly defined field of expertise straddling military, policy, and corporate worlds. No longer the preserve of prophets or mystics, the speculative infrastructures incubated within organizations such as the RAND corporation were underwritten by cybernetics, game theory, and systems analysis, all of which helped give prediction a veneer of scientific credibility. And yet, as the planning tools of the postwar era lost their predictive edge, new techniques came to exert influence in a world dominated by the uncertainties of looming environmental catastrophe. The future was no longer thought to emerge from the present in a linear fashion but unfold along a series of branch points that allowed decision makers to navigate through a landscape of uncertainty. Tracing the genealogy of forms of prediction and scenario planning from the mid-twentieth century to the present day, this article places futurological tools in the context of an expanded field of speculative practices that include works of art. Projects by the likes of Stephen Willats, Experiments in Art and Technology, the Harrisons, and others not only generate alternative images of the future but also rework the infrastructures by which such images are conceptualized and produced.","[Reeves-Evison, Theo] Birmingham Sch Art, Birmingham, W Midlands, England",,"Reeves-Evison, T (corresponding author), Birmingham Sch Art, Birmingham, W Midlands, England.",,,,Leverhulme Trust,Leverhulme Trust(Leverhulme Trust),"Early iterations of this paper were presented at various events in 2019 organized by David Sergeant, Jorinde Seijdel, and Renata Tyszczuk.

We study the effect of phase change materials (PCM) as a light thermal mass, on the cooling load of a typical office building with HVAC system and night purge ventilation in hot-arid climate. In this paper the proper conditions to start night ventilation and the ventilation rate by fans is determined. Additionally, the effect of melting point temperature of the PCMs on the cooling load of the building is investigated. PCMs with proper melting temperature were applied to various building elements, and to the whole model. It was revealed that, application of PCMs will significantly contribute in reducing the cooling load, except for the floor on the ground, which resulted in an increase of the load.

Climate change as well as low-frequency climate variability and human intervention in river basins violate the assumption of stationarity, which is claimed to be dead by some researchers. Detailed climate models and long hydrological records are needed to predict the future conditions in a changing world. It must be remembered, however, that all hydrological systems include a stationary element, at least in the form of a random component. A stationary model is sometimes preferable to a nonstationary one when the evolution in time of hydrological processes cannot be predicted reliably. It is attempted to generate synthetic nonstationary time series of future climates by means of a global climate model, which are then used in water resources optimization under uncertainty. The estimation of extremes (floods and low flows) is more important but also much more difficult. The statistical significance of a trend can be detected by means of statistical tests such as the nonparametric Mann-Kendall test, which must be modified when there is serial correlation, possibly by prewhitening. Long-term persistence in hydrological processes also affects the results of the test. Some authors criticized the use of significance levels in statistical tests and recommended using confidence intervals around the estimated effect size. The power of a test depends on the chosen level of significance, sample size and the accuracy of prediction of trends. In some cases, it is more important to increase the power so that errors of estimation that may lead to damages due to inadequate protection are prevented. Frequency analysis of nonstationary processes can be made by fitting a trend to the parameters of the probability distribution. Annual maxima or peaks-over-threshold series can be analyzed incorporating a trend component to the parameters. Design concepts such as return period and hydrological risk should be redefined in a changing world. Design life level is another concept that can be used in a nonstationary context. In management decisions of water structures, a risk-based approach should be used where errors that result in under-preparedness are considered as well as those resulting in over-preparedness. In a changing world, decision making in water resources management requires long-term projections of hydrological time series that include trend due to anthropogenic intervention and climate change.","[Bayazit, Mehmetcik] Istanbul Tech Univ, Istanbul, Turkey",Istanbul Technical University,"Bayazit, M (corresponding author), Istanbul Tech Univ, Istanbul, Turkey.",mehmetcikb@gmail.com,,,,,,,55,96,99,4,15,SPRINGER INT PUBL AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7491,2198-7505,,ENVIRON PROCESS,Environ.

This article analyses the objectives, planned actions and performance indicators related to CC and RE, defined by national and local stakeholders in: (1) the national Rural Development Programme (RDP) 2014-2020 in Poland and (2) in the bottom-up Local Development Strategies (LDS) financed from RDP and using a Community-Led Local Development approach. The content analysis method was used. We found that the strategy documents considered, created in the years 2014-2015, paid relatively little attention to local actions related to CC and RE. Some educational activities related to adaptation and mitigation of CC were planned in 66% of LDS, while investment support for RE was planned only in 9% of the LDS. Traditional goals such as supporting local businesses and farmers, local cultural heritage and the development of human and social capital were seen as more important. The results of the analysis suggest a relatively low level of interest from rural-policy actors in Poland in implementing the climate-friendly objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy. This article contributes to understanding why Poland failed to meet the European 2020 RE development goals. These issues are discussed in the context of national and continental climate policy and problems of transformation to post-carbon society.","[Furmankiewicz, Marek; Kazak, Jan K.] Wroclaw Univ Environm & Life Sci, Inst Spatial Management, Grunwaldzka 55, PL-50357 Wroclaw, Poland; [Hewitt, Richard J.] James Hutton Inst, Informat & Computat Sci Grp, Craigiebuckler, Aberdeen AB15 8QH, Scotland; [Hewitt, Richard J.] Observ Cultura Terr OCT, Calle Duque Fernan Nunez 2,1, Madrid 28012, Spain; [Hewitt, Richard J.] Univ Complutense Madrid UCM, Fac Geog & Hist, Transport Infrastruct & Terr Res Grp t GIS, Geog Dept, C Prof Aranguren,S-N, Madrid 28040, Spain",Institute of Spatial Management & Housing; Wroclaw University of Environmental & Life Sciences; James Hutton Institute; Complutense University of Madrid,"Furmankiewicz, M (corresponding author), Wroclaw Univ Environm & Life Sci, Inst Spatial Management, Grunwaldzka 55, PL-50357 Wroclaw, Poland.",marek.furmankiewicz@upwr.edu.pl,"Furmankiewicz, Marek/F-2186-2011","Furmankiewicz, Marek/0000-0001-9715-1056","National Science Centre, Poland [2019/33/B/HS4/00176 (OPUS 17)]; Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation, and Universities (TERRYER) [CS02017-84986]; European Union under Programme [H2020-EU.1.3.2,]; MSCA-IF-2019; INTRANCES Project [886050]","National Science Centre, Poland(National Science Centre, Poland); Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation, and Universities (TERRYER); European Union under Programme; MSCA-IF-2019; INTRANCES Project","This research was co-financed within the framework of the project No. 2019/33/B/HS4/00176 (OPUS 17) by the National Science Centre, Poland and under the Leading Research Groups support project from the subsidy increased for the period 2020-2025 in the amount of 2% of the subsidy referred to Art. 387 (3) of the Law of July 20, 2018 on Higher Education and Science, obtained in 2019.

Using Kimball's (1995) notion of the oratorical and philosophical traditions of liberal education, this article first identifies the critical importance of balancing breadth and depth in the curriculum before honing in on breadth as being in particular danger in the current climate. After analyzing the major threats to breadth in American higher education, the article looks overseas to find a new case for the value of breadth in the curriculum. It focuses on Hong Kong's university system, where a large-scale, multiyear project is underway to graft a fourth year of general education onto a threeyear model of discipline-or profession-specific training. The resulting contrast between American institutions discarding curricular breadth while foreign universities rediscover it is telling.

However, existing datasets are currently fragmented, incomplete, and partial in their coverage. This study presents results from a more comprehensive, granular, and descriptive attempt to compile a dataset of global funding patterns on energy and climate research. To do so, it identified 114,201 potential projects funded by 154 research councils across 17 countries and the European Commission from 1990 to 2020 (with projected funding up until 2026). A smaller sample of 1000 illustrative projects were examined in greater detail. It finds that there are difficulties with accessible and available public data, including an inaccuracy of data on published websites or inadequate tracking and updating of project details. Research on energy and climate change is supported by a surprisingly broad base of inquiry, including research from the social sciences and economics but also the arts and humanities, engineering and technology, life sciences and medicine, and natural and physical sciences. Climate change adaptation research is the most funded general area, followed by climate mitigation via energy systems, transportation and mobility, geo/climate engineering, and industrial decarbonization. Funding has been allocated unevenly in favor of some specific technologies, e.g. resilience and adaption, energy efficiency, and electric vehicles. Publicly funded research benefits a very particular set of disciplines, e.g. communication studies, economics, computer science, and chemical engineering. Moreover, the funded projects reveal a striking diversity of methods, including literature reviews, surveys and original data collection, the development of intellectual property, case studies, qualitative research and energy modeling.","[Sovacool, Benjamin K.; Daniels, Chux; AbdulRafiu, Abbas] Univ Sussex Business Sch, Sci Policy Res Unit, Falmer, England",,"Sovacool, BK (corresponding author), Univ Sussex Business Sch, Sci Policy Res Unit, Falmer, England.",benjaminso@hih.au.dk,,"Abbas, AbdulRafiu/0000-0003-2682-0616; Daniels, Chux/0000-0002-5179-4176","Industrial Decarbonisation Research and Innovation Centre (IDRIC) in the United Kingdom - UKRI; EPSRC [EP/V027050/1]; Petroleum Technology Development Fund (PTDF), Nigeria [POSS7924897311]","Industrial Decarbonisation Research and Innovation Centre (IDRIC) in the United Kingdom - UKRI; EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Petroleum Technology Development Fund (PTDF), Nigeria","The authors thank and acknowledge support for this paper from the Industrial Decarbonisation Research and Innovation Centre (IDRIC) in the United Kingdom, funded by the UKRI and EPSRC via Grant Number EP/V027050/1 and the Petroleum Technology Development Fund (PTDF), Nigeria via award POSS7924897311.

First, we reflect on our rationale and approach, describing the importance of deeper communication, such as through the arts, to the policy process; more enduring decisions are possible by engaging and obtaining perspectives through more than just a utilitarian lens.

The four climate models (HCCPR-CM2, HCCPR-CM3, MPI-ECHAM4, and DOE-PCM3) all predicted transient climate response to changing greenhouse gas concentrations, and incorporated modern land surface parameterizations. Model-predicted monthly average precipitation and temperature changes were downscaled to the river basin level using model increments (transient minus control) to adjust for GCM bias. The variable infiltration capacity (VIC) macroscale hydrological model (MHM) was used to calculate the corresponding changes in hydrologic fluxes (especially streamflow and evapotranspiration) and moisture storages. Hydrologic model simulations were performed for decades centered on 2025 and 2045. In addition, a sensitivity study was performed in which temperature and precipitation were increased independently by 2 degreesC and 10%, respectively, during each of four seasons. All GCMs predict a warming for all nine basins, with the greatest warming predicted to occur during the winter months in the highest latitudes. Precipitation generally increases, but the monthly precipitation signal varies more between the models than does temperature. The largest changes in the hydrological cycle are predicted for the snow-dominated basins of mid to higher latitudes. This results in part from the greater amount of warming predicted for these regions, but more importantly, because of the important role of snow in the water balance. Because the snow pack integrates the effects of climate change over a period of months, the largest changes occur in early to mid spring when snow melt occurs. The climate change responses are somewhat different for the coldest snow dominated basins than for those with more transitional snow regimes. In the coldest basins, the response to warming is an increase of the spring streamflow peak, whereas for the transitional basins spring runoff decreases. Instead, the transitional basins have large increases in winter streamflows. The hydrological response of most tropical and mid-latitude basins to the warmer and somewhat wetter conditions predicted by the GCMs is a reduction in annual streamflow, although again, considerable disagreement exists among the different GCMs. In contrast, for the high-latitude basins increases in annual flow volume are predicted in most cases.","Univ Washington, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Nijssen, B (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Box 352700, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",nijssen@u.washington.edu; tempgd@hydro.washington.edu; hamleaf@u.washington.edu; dennisl@u.washington.edu,"lettenmaier, dennis p/F-8780-2011; Nijssen, Bart/B-1013-2012","lettenmaier, dennis p/0000-0003-3317-1327; Nijssen, Bart/0000-0002-4062-0322",,,,,70,438,450,7,242,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

Feature stacking is the most commonly used method of data fusion but does not consider the heterogeneity of multimodal optical images and OSM data, which becomes its main drawback. The proposed framework processes two data sources separately and then combines them at the model level through two fusion models (the landuse fusion model and building fusion model) that aim to fuse optical images with landuse and buildings layers of OSM data, respectively. In addition, a new approach to detecting building incompleteness of OSM data is proposed. The proposed framework was trained and tested using the data from the 2017 IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest and further validated on one additional test (AT) set containing test samples that are manually labeled in Munich and New York. The experimental results have indicated that compared with the feature stacking-based baseline framework, the proposed framework is effective in fusing optical images with OSM data for the classification of LCZs with high generalization capability on a large scale. The classification accuracy of the proposed framework outperforms the baseline framework by more than 6% and 2% while testing on the test set of 2017 IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest and the AT set, respectively. In addition, the proposed framework is less sensitive to spectral diversities of optical satellite images and thus achieves more stable classification performance than the state-of-the-art frameworks.","[Zhang, Guichen] Wuhan Univ, Sch Remote Sensing & Informat Engn, Wuhan 430079, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Guichen; Zhu, Xiao Xiang] Tech Univ Munich, Signal Proc Earth Observat SiPEO, D-80333 Munich, Germany; [Zhang, Guichen; Zhu, Xiao Xiang] German Aerosp Ctr DLR, Remote Sensing Technol Inst IMF, D-82234 Wessling, Germany; [Ghamisi, Pedram] HZDR, Helmholtz Inst Freiberg Resource Technol HIF, D-09599 Freiberg, Germany",Wuhan University; Technical University of Munich; Helmholtz Association; German Aerospace Centre (DLR); Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf (HZDR),"Zhu, XX (corresponding author), German Aerosp Ctr DLR, Remote Sensing Technol Inst IMF, D-82234 Wessling, Germany.",guichen.Zhang@dlr.de; p.ghamisi@gmail.com; xiaoxiang.zhu@dlr.de,"Ghamisi, Pedram/ABD-5419-2021; Zhu, Xiao Xiang/ABE-7138-2020","Zhu, Xiao Xiang/0000-0001-5530-3613; Zhang, Guichen/0000-0002-0617-6459",European Research Council (ERC) through the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme (So2Sat) [ERC-2016-StG-714087]; Helmholtz Association [VH-NG-1018]; Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities,European Research Council (ERC) through the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme (So2Sat)(European Research Council (ERC)); Helmholtz Association(Helmholtz Association); Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities,"This work was supported in part by the European Research Council (ERC) through the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme (So2Sat) under Grant ERC-2016-StG-714087, in part by the Helmholtz Association through the Framework of the Young Investigators Group SiPEO under Grant VH-NG-1018, and in part by the Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities through the Framework of Junges Kolleg.",,44,17,18,3,18,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",0196-2892,1558-0644,,IEEE T GEOSCI REMOTE,IEEE Trans.

An early shift of the flowering season is consistent with Kyoto's warming climate and could have serious repercussions for the local economy. It is therefore crucial to assess how human activity impacts flowering dates and alters the likelihood of extremely early flowering. To make this assessment, our study combines a risk-based attribution methodology with a phenological model that estimates full flowering dates from daily temperature data. We employ 14 state-of-the-art climate models that provide ensembles of simulations with and without the effect of anthropogenic forcings, and, using the simulated temperatures at Kyoto, we obtain representations of the cherry flowering season under different climatic conditions. An observationally-based correction is also applied to the simulated temperatures to introduce the effect of urban warming. We find a significant anthropogenic shift in the mean flowering season of over a week, about half of which is due to urban warming. By the end of the century and under medium emissions, the early shift is estimated to further increase by almost a week. Extremely early flowering dates, as in 2021, would be rare without human influence, but are now estimated to be 15 times more likely, and are expected to occur at least once a century. Such events are projected to occur every few years by 2100 when they would no longer be considered extreme.","[Christidis, Nikolaos; Stott, Peter A.] Met Off Hadley Ctr, FitzRoy Rd, Exeter EX1 3PB, Devon, England; [Aono, Yasuyuki] Osaka Metropolitan Univ, Grad Sch Agr Sci, Sakai, Osaka 5998531, Japan",Met Office - UK; Hadley Centre; Osaka Metropolitan University,"Christidis, N (corresponding author), Met Off Hadley Ctr, FitzRoy Rd, Exeter EX1 3PB, Devon, England.",nikos.christidis@metoffice.gov.uk,,"Aono, Yasuyuki/0000-0002-6950-4341",Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme - BEIS; Defra; Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF),"Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme - BEIS; Defra(Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA)); Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF)","NC and PAS were supported by the Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme funded by BEIS and Defra.

We used state-of-the-art global climate models (CSIRO-Mk3.6, GISS-E2-R) and earth system models (CanESM2, HadGEM2-ES) and representative concentration pathways (RCPs) 8.5 and 4.5 that represent a range in possible future concentrations of atmospheric CO2. Our analysis focuses on average February and August SSTs from the period 2071-2100 as the low and high temperatures of these months generally define the thermal habitat of a species. SSTs will increase in most, but not all, waters of the LMEs, and seasonality will increase in all LMEs. The difference in SSTs from the Gulf of Mexico to the Scotian Shelf may be reduced but differences will increase from the Scotian Shelf north. Although past SST changes have been greatest on the Newfoundland-Labrador Shelf, ensemble average projections indicate that the greatest future change will occur on the Scotian Shelf. The variation in future SSTs is greater among models than between RCPs, suggesting that impact studies limited to a single model may be biased.","[Khan, Amina H.; Chmura, Gail L.] McGill Univ, Dept Geog, Montreal, PQ H3A 0B9, Canada; [Levac, Elisabeth] Bishops Univ, Dept Environm Studies & Geog, Sherbrooke, PQ J1M 1Z7, Canada; [Khan, Amina H.; Levac, Elisabeth; Chmura, Gail L.] Global Environm & Climate Change Ctr, Montreal, PQ H3A 0B9, Canada",McGill University; Bishops University,"Chmura, GL (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Dept Geog, 805 Sherbrooke St W, Montreal, PQ H3A 0B9, Canada.",gail.chmura@mcgill.ca,,"Chmura, Gail/0000-0001-7163-3903",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Quebec's Global Environmental and Climate Change Centre,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR); Quebec's Global Environmental and Climate Change Centre,"We appreciate the comments of I.

This has led to the northward expansion of agricultural areas at the expense of natural savanna, leading to widespread land use -land cover change (LULCC). Because there is strong evidence of significant surface-atmosphere coupling in this region, one of the main goals of the West African Monsoon Modeling and Evaluation project phase II is to provide basic understanding of LULCC on the regional climate, and to evaluate the sensitivity of the seasonal variability of the West African Monsoon to LULCC. The prescribed LULCC is based on the changes from 1950 through 1990, representing a maximum feasible degradation scenario in the past half century. It is applied to 5 state of the art global climate models (GCMs) over a 6-year simulation period. Multiple GCMs are used because the magnitude of the impact of LULCC depends on model-dependent coupling strength between the surface and the overlying atmosphere, the magnitude of the surface biophysical changes, and how the key processes linking the surface with the atmosphere are parameterized within a particular model framework. Land cover maps and surface parameters may vary widely among models; therefore a special effort was made to impose consistent biogeophysical responses of surface parameters to LULCC using a simple experimental setup. The prescribed LULCC corresponds to degraded vegetation conditions, which mainly cause increases in the Bowen ratio and decreases in the surface net radiation, and result in a significant reduction in surface evaporation (upwards of 1 mm day(-1) over a large part of the Sahel). This, in turn, mainly leads to less moisture convergence and precipitation over the LULCC zone. The overall impact is a rainfall reduction with every model, which ranges across models from 4 to 25 % averaged over the Sahel, and a southward shift of the rainfall peak in three of the five models which evokes a precipitation dipole pattern which is consistent with the observed pattern for dry climate anomalies over this region. The African Easterly Jet shifts equator-ward, although the strength of this change varies considerably among the models. In most of the models, the main factor causing diabatic cooling of the upper troposphere and enhanced subsidence over the region of LULCC is the reduction of convective heating rates linked to reduced latent heat flux and moisture flux convergence. In broad agreement with previous studies, the impact of degradation on the regional climate is found to vary among the different models, however, the signal is stronger and more consistent between the models here than in previous inter-comparison projects. This is likely related to our emphasis on prioritizing a consistent impact of LULCC on the surface biophysical properties.","[Boone, Aaron Anthony] Meteo France CNRS, CNRM UMR 3589, Toulouse, France; [Xue, Yongkang; Schiro, Kathleen; Song, Guoqiong; Li, S.; Mechoso, Carlos R.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Wang, Guiling] Univ Connecticut, Storrs, CT USA; [Comer, Ruth E.] Hadley Ctr, Met Off, Exeter, Devon, England; [Hagos, Samson] Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Richland, WA USA; [Mahanama, Sarith] SSAI, Lanham, MD USA; [Mahanama, Sarith] NASA Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Global Modeling & Assimilat Off, Greenbelt, MD USA; [De Sales, Fernando] San Diego State Univ, San Diego, CA 92182 USA",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Earth Sciences & Astronomy (INSU); Meteo France; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of Connecticut; Met Office - UK; Hadley Centre; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Pacific Northwest National Laboratory; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; California State University System; San Diego State University,"Boone, AA (corresponding author), Meteo France CNRS, CNRM UMR 3589, Toulouse, France.",aaron.a.boone@gmail.com,"Comer, Ruth E./AAS-5205-2020; De Sales, Fernando/J-7959-2019; xue, yongkang/M-6756-2018","xue, yongkang/0000-0002-6169-9631","AMMA; Based on French initiative; European Community's Sixth Framework Research Programme; UK Department for International Development (DFID); U.S. NSF [AGS-1115506, AGS-1419526]",AMMA; Based on French initiative; European Community's Sixth Framework Research Programme; UK Department for International Development (DFID); U.S. NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This study was supported by the French component of AMMA.

One possibility for alleviating this shortcoming is to increase the integration timestep. We propose and test several methods which may prove useful. One procedure is an expansion of the model dependent variables in a Taylor series. Application of this method to simple models indicates acceptable increases in timestep by a factor of five. A multi-level approach which is less complex to apply gives comparable results and is more successful when high accuracy is desired. To bypass the limiting constraint of the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition on gravity waves, an approach is suggested in which the prediction model is represented in its normal modes and the high frequency modes are balanced while the low frequency modes are predicted. Experiments with this procedure are described and in combination with the multi-level integration technique show substantial increases in integration timestep for acceptable integration results, both on the forecast and climate scale. Experiments are now underway applying this process to the NCAR/CCM3, a state-of-the-art model.","Univ Maryland, Dept Meteorol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Baer, F (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Dept Meteorol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",,"Zhang, Banglin/GLN-6919-2022","Zhang, Banglin/0000-0001-7836-8102",,,,,19,4,4,0,0,SPRINGER-VERLAG WIEN,VIENNA,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 VIENNA, AUSTRIA",0177-7971,,,METEOROL ATMOS PHYS,Meteorol.

The atmospheric component is a two-dimensional (zonally averaged) statistical-dynamical model based on the Goddard Institute for Space Study's atmospheric general circulation model (GCM). In contrast with energy-balance models used in some climate models of intermediate complexity, this model includes full representation of the hydrological and momentum cycles. It also has parameterizations of the main physical processes, including a sophisticated radiation code. The ocean component is a coarse resolution ocean GCM with simplified global geometry based on the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory modular ocean model. Because of the simplified geometry the resolution in the western boundary layers can be readily increased compared to conventional coarse resolution models, without increasing the model's computational requirements in a significant way. The ocean model's efficiency is also greatly increased by using a moderate degree of asynchronous coupling between the oceanic momentum and tracer fields. We demonstrate that this still allows an accurate simulation of transient behavior, including the seasonal cycle. A 100 years simulation with the model requires less than 8 hours on a state-of the art workstation. The main novelty of the model is therefore a combination of computational efficiency, statistical-dynamical atmosphere and 3D ocean. Long-term present-day climate simulations are carried out using the coupled model with and without flux adjustments, and with either the Gent-McWilliams (GM) parametrization scheme or horizontal diffusion (HD) in the ocean. Deep ocean temperatures systematically decrease in the runs without flux adjustment. We demonstrate that the mismatch between heat transports in the uncoupled states of two models is the main cause for the systematic drift. In addition, changes in the circulation and sea-ice formation also contribute to the drift. Flux adjustments in the freshwater fluxes are shown to have a stabilizing effect on the thermohaline circulation in the model, whereas the adjustments in the heat fluxes tend to weaken the global conveyor. To evaluate the model's response to transient external forcing global warming simulations are also carried out with the flux-adjusted version of the coupled model. The coupled model reproduces reasonably well the behavior of more sophisticated coupled GCMs for both current climate and for the global warming scenarios.","Univ Washington, Dept Atmospher Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; MIT, Ctr Global Change Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; Univ Washington, Joint Inst Study Atmosphere & Oceans, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Kamenkovich, IV (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Dept Atmospher Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",,"Kamenkovich, Igor/AAG-3451-2019",,,,,,56,27,27,0,5,SPRINGER-VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0930-7575,,,CLIM DYNAM,Clim.

In the calibration process, we focus on especially white-capping and wind input parameters and recently developed formulations. Thus, for the Black Sea basin the best setting and model with the best configuration for the source terms in the wind-wave modelling is obtained. The results of the wave hindcast were also validated against satellite data to assess the spatial variability of wave model quality. From the simulation results, the seasonal and spatial variability of the mean annual significant wave height and wave energy period is obtained and discussed.","[Akpinar, Adem; Bingolbali, Bilal] Uludag Univ, Dept Civil Engn, TR-16059 Bursa, Turkey; [Van Vledder, Gerbrant Ph.] VanVledder Consulting, Olst, Netherlands",Uludag University,"Akpinar, A (corresponding author), Uludag Univ, Dept Civil Engn, TR-16059 Bursa, Turkey.",ademakpinar@hotmail.com; gerbrant@vanvledderconsulting.com; arda_bilal_49@hotmail.com,"Bingölbali, Bilal/AAB-4152-2020; akpinar, adem/ABE-8817-2020; akpınar, adem/AAC-6763-2019","akpınar, adem/0000-0002-9042-6851",NATO Science for Stability Program,NATO Science for Stability Program,"The authors would like to thank the NCEP CFS team for providing wind data and NOAA (General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans, GEBCO) for the providing the bathymetry data of the Black Sea.

Here we show that improved representation of Atlantic Cold Tongue (ACT) development is essential for a more realistic seasonal evolution of the WAM, which is due to a further inland migration of the precipitation maximum. The observed marked relationship between ACT development and Sahel rainfall onset only can be reproduced by a climate model, the Kiel Climate Model (KCM), when sufficiently high resolution in its atmospheric component is employed, enabling enhanced equatorial Atlantic interannual sea surface temperature variability in the ACT region relative to versions with coarser atmospheric resolution. The ACT/Sahel rainfall relationship in the model critically depends on the correct seasonal phase-locking of the interannual variability rather than on its magnitude.

The instrumental record tends to be too short to develop sample statistics to study interdecadal climate variability, and Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, Phase 5 (CMIP5) climate models tend to disagree about which locations most strongly influence global mean interdecadal temperature variability. Here we use a new paleoclimate data assimilation product, the Last Millennium Reanalysis (LMR), to examine where local variability is associated with global mean temperature variability at interdecadal timescales. The LMR framework uses an ensemble Kalman filter data assimilation approach to combine the latest paleoclimate data and state-of-the-art model data to generate annually resolved field reconstructions of surface temperature, which allow us to explore the timing and dynamics of preinstrumental climate variability in new ways. The LMR consistently shows that the middle- to high-latitude north Pacific and the high-latitude North Atlantic tend to lead global temperature variability on interdecadal timescales.

Following its stress on human rights and ethical principles, the HDR does not unsettle the market driven solutions to climate change that dominate the global policy arena. Different policy instruments and a fuller institutionalization of its human rights concerns is required, in organizations, processes, methodologies and knowledge networks that could move the ideas forward and continually press for their use.

However, adverse remote effects resulting from atmospheric teleconnections could offset such regional benefits. We use state-of-the-art Earth-system model simulations to evaluate the global impacts of Sahara solar farms. Our results indicate a redistribution of precipitation causing Amazon droughts and forest degradation, and global surface temperature rise and sea-ice loss, particularly over the Arctic due to increased polarward heat transport, and northward expansion of deciduous forests in the Northern Hemisphere. We also identify reduced El Nino-Southern Oscillation and Atlantic Nino variability and enhanced tropical cyclone activity. Comparison to proxy inferences for a wetter and greener Sahara similar to 6,000 years ago appears to substantiate these results. Understanding these responses within the Earth system provides insights into the site selection concerning any massive deployment of solar energy in the world's deserts. Plain Language Summary Solar energy can contribute to the attainment of global climate mitigation goals by reducing reliance on fossil fuel energy. It is proposed that massive solar farms in the Sahara desert (e.g., 20% coverage) can produce energy enough for the world's consumption, and at the same time more rainfall and the recovery of vegetation in the desert. However, by employing an advanced Earth-system model (coupled atmosphere, ocean, sea-ice, terrestrial ecosystem), we show the unintended remote effects of Sahara solar farms on global climate and vegetation cover through shifted atmospheric circulation. These effects include global temperature rise, particularly over the Arctic; the redistribution of precipitation (most notably droughts and forest degradation in the Amazon) and northward shift of the Intertropical Convergence Zone; the northward expansion of deciduous forests in the Northern Hemisphere; and the weakened El Nino-Southern Oscillation and Atlantic Nino variability and enhanced tropical cyclone activity. All these remote effects are in line with the global impacts of the Sahara land-cover transition similar to 6,000 years ago when Sahara desert was wetter and greener. The improved understanding of the forcing mechanisms of massive Sahara solar farms can be helpful for the future site selection of large-scale desert solar energy facilities. Key Points . A set of state-of-the-art Earth-system model simulations are used to study the impacts of large-scale (20% coverage or more) Sahara solar farms These hypothetical solar farms increase local rainfall and vegetation cover through positive atmosphere-land(albedo)-vegetation feedbacks Conveyed by atmospheric teleconnections, the Sahara solar farms can induce remote responses in global climate and vegetation cover","[Lu, Zhengyao; Miller, Paul A.; Smith, Benjamin] Lund Univ, Dept Phys Geog & Ecosyst Sci, Lund, Sweden; [Zhang, Qiong; Zhang, Qiang; Berntell, Ellen] Stockholm Univ, Dept Phys Geog, Stockholm, Sweden; [Zhang, Qiong; Zhang, Qiang; Berntell, Ellen] Stockholm Univ, Bolin Ctr Climate Res, Stockholm, Sweden; [Miller, Paul A.] Lund Univ, Ctr Environm & Climate Res, Lund, Sweden; [Smith, Benjamin] Univ Western Sydney, Hawkesbury Inst Environm, Penrith, NSW, Australia",Lund University; Stockholm University; Lund University; Western Sydney University,"Lu, ZY (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Dept Phys Geog & Ecosyst Sci, Lund, Sweden.",zhengyao.lu@nateko.lu.se,"Smith, Benjamin/I-1212-2016","Smith, Benjamin/0000-0002-6987-5337; Miller, Paul/0000-0003-1105-2132; Berntell, Ellen/0000-0002-2409-4035",Swedish Research Council (VR) [2017-04232]; FORMAS mobility [2020-02267],Swedish Research Council (VR)(Swedish Research Council); FORMAS mobility,"The authors greatly appreciate constructive comments from two anonymous reviewers.

Existing energy-and climate-economic modeling approaches that are informing policy and decision makers in shaping the future net-zero emissions society are increasingly seen with skepticism regarding their ability to forecast the long-term evolution of highly complex, nonlinear social-ecological systems. We present a structured review of state-of-the-art modeling approaches, focusing on their ability and limitations to develop and assess pathways towards a low-carbon society. We find that existing methodological approaches have some fundamental deficiencies that limit their potential to understand the subtleties of long-term low-carbon transformation processes. We suggest that a useful methodological framework has to move beyond current state of the art techniques and has to simultaneously fulfill the following requirements: (1) representation of an inherent dynamic analysis, describing and investigating explicitly the path between different states of system variables, (2) specification of details in the energy cascade, in particular the central role of functionalities and services that are provided by the interaction of energy flows and corresponding stock variables, (3) reliance on a clear distinction between structures of the sociotechnical energy system and socioeconomic mechanisms to develop it and (4) ability to evaluate pathways along societal criteria. To that end we propose the development of a versatile multi-purpose integrated modeling framework, building on the specific strengths of the various modeling approaches available while at the same time omitting their weaknesses. This paper identifies respective strengths and weaknesses to guide such development.","[Schinko, Thomas; Bachner, Gabriel; Schleicher, Stefan P.; Steininger, Karl W.] Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Wegener Ctr Climate & Global Change, Graz, Austria; [Schinko, Thomas] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Laxenburg, Austria; [Steininger, Karl W.] Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Dept Econ, Graz, Austria",University of Graz; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); University of Graz,"Schinko, T (corresponding author), Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Wegener Ctr Climate & Global Change, Graz, Austria.;Schinko, T (corresponding author), Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Laxenburg, Austria.",thomas.schinko@uni-graz.at,"Bachner, Gabriel/N-7536-2019; Steininger, Karl/O-6971-2016","Bachner, Gabriel/0000-0003-2025-0747; Steininger, Karl/0000-0003-3850-9315",Austrian Climate and Energy Fund; project ClimTrans 2050 within the Austrian Climate Research Programme (ACRP),Austrian Climate and Energy Fund; project ClimTrans 2050 within the Austrian Climate Research Programme (ACRP),"This research was supported by the Austrian Climate and Energy Fund, project ClimTrans 2050 within the Austrian Climate Research Programme (ACRP).

This study provides a range of probabilistic estimates of the TCS that combine these two sources of uncertainty for various underlying assumptions about the nature of the uncertainty. The authors also provide estimates of how quickly the uncertainty in the TCS may be expected to diminish in the future as additional observations become available. These estimates are made using a nonlinear Kalman filter coupled to a stochastic, global energy balance model, using the filter and observations to constrain the model parameters. This study verifies that model and filter are able to emulate the evolution of a comprehensive, state-of-the-art atmosphere ocean general circulation model and to accurately predict the TCS of the model, and then apply the methodology to observed temperature and forcing records of the twentieth century. For uncertainty assumptions best supported by global surface temperature data up to the present time, this paper finds a most likely present-day estimate of the transient climate sensitivity to be 1.6 K, with 90% confidence the response will fall between 1.3 and 2.6 K, and it is estimated that this interval may be 45% smaller by the year 2030. The authors calculate that emissions levels equivalent to forcing of less than 475 ppmv CO2 concentration are needed to ensure that the transient temperature response will not exceed 2 K with 95% confidence. This is an assessment for the short-to-medium term and not a recommendation for long-term stabilization forcing; the equilibrium temperature response to this level of CO2 may be much greater. The flat temperature trend of the last decade has a detectable but small influence on TCS. This study describes how the results vary if different uncertainty assumptions are made and shows they are robust to variations in the initial prior probability assumptions.","[Vallis, Geoffrey K.] Princeton Univ, AOS Program, GFDL, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Princeton University,"Vallis, GK (corresponding author), Princeton Univ, AOS Program, GFDL, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",gkv@princeton.edu,"Rowley, Clarence/F-9068-2013","Rowley, Clarence/0000-0002-9099-5739",DOE [DE-SC0005189]; FAA,DOE(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); FAA,"We thank Jonathan Gregory for providing the forcing used in Gregory and Forster (2008) in digital form, and Isaac Held and Mike Winton for many conversations on this matter.

This is the most sophisticated model ever applied to Snowball initiation. A comparison with a pre-industrial control climate shows that the change of surface boundary conditions from present-day to Marinoan, including a shift of continents to low latitudes, induces a global-mean cooling of 4.6 K. Two thirds of this cooling can be attributed to increased planetary albedo, the remaining one third to a weaker greenhouse effect. The Marinoan Snowball Earth bifurcation point for pre-industrial atmospheric carbon dioxide is between 95.5 and 96% of the present-day total solar irradiance (TSI), whereas a previous study with the same model found that it was between 91 and 94% for present-day surface boundary conditions. A Snowball Earth for TSI set to its Marinoan value (94% of the present-day TSI) is prevented by doubling carbon dioxide with respect to its pre-industrial level. A zero-dimensional energy balance model is used to predict the Snowball Earth bifurcation point from only the equilibrium global-mean ocean potential temperature for present-day TSI. We do not find stable states with sea-ice cover above 55%, and land conditions are such that glaciers could not grow with sea-ice cover of 55%. Therefore, none of our simulations qualifies as a slushball solution. While uncertainties in important processes and parameters such as clouds and sea-ice albedo suggest that the Snowball Earth bifurcation point differs between climate models, our results contradict previous findings that Snowball Earth initiation would require much stronger forcings.","[Voigt, A.; Marotzke, J.] Max Planck Inst Meteorol, Hamburg, Germany; [Voigt, A.] Int Max Planck Res Sch Earth Syst Modelling, Hamburg, Germany; [Abbot, D.

The recent rise of social media as the new public address system, makes it an ideal source of information to assess public discussions and responses in real time. We mine c.1.7 m posts from 55 climate related subreddits on social media platform Reddit since its inception. Using USE, a state-of-the-art sentence encoder, and K-means clustering algorithm, we develop a machine learning based approach to identify, store, process and classify the posts automatically, and at a scale. In the broad and multifaceted theme of climate change, our approach narrows down the focus to 10 critical underlying themes comprising the public discussions on social media over time. Furthermore, we employ a full order partial correlation analysis to assess the relationship between the different identified themes. We show that in line with Paris Agreement, while the climate science community has been successful in influencing the discussions on both the causes and effects of climate change, the public administration has failed to appropriately communicate the causes of climate change and has been able to influence only the discussions on the effects of it. Hence, our study shows a clear gap in the public communication by the administration, wherein counter-intuitively less emphasis has been given on the drivers of climate change. This information can be particularly beneficial to policymakers and climate activists in decision making as they try to close the gap between public and academia.","[Kaushal, Akshay] HSBC Global Banking & Markets, HSBC Global Res, Bangalore, Karnataka, India; [Acharjee, Animesh] Univ Birmingham, Inst Canc & Genom Sci, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England; [Mandal, Anandadeep] Univ Birmingham, Birmingham Business Sch, Dept Finance, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England",University of Birmingham; University of Birmingham,"Acharjee, A (corresponding author), Univ Birmingham, Inst Canc & Genom Sci, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England.",a.acharjee@bham.ac.uk,"Acharjee, Animesh/AAC-7637-2019","Acharjee, Animesh/0000-0003-2735-7010; Mandal, Anandadeep/0000-0002-1018-8719; Kaushal, Akshay/0000-0002-0826-8998",,,,,140,0,0,3,3,NATURE PORTFOLIO,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",2045-2322,,,SCI REP-UK,Sci Rep,8-Nov,2022,1,,,,,,19033,10.1038/s41598-022-22034-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-22034-1,,,24,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,6A1RC,36347895,"Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000880437400014,View Full Record in Web of Science

Analyses of past climate states are now regarded as integral to the evaluation of climate models, and have become part of the toolkit used to assess the likely realism of future projections. Palaeoclimate assessment has demonstrated that changes in large-scale features of climate that are governed by the energy and water balance show consistent responses to changes in forcing in different climate states, and these consistent responses are reproduced by climate models. However, state-of-the-art models are still largely unable to reproduce observed changes in climate at a regional scale reliably. While palaeoclimate analyses of state-of-the-art climate models suggest an urgent need for model improvement, much work is also needed on extending and improving palaeoclimate reconstructions and quantifying and reducing both numerical and interpretative uncertainties.

Both traditional, state-of-the-art and possible materials and solutions beyond these have been investigated. Examples of these may be mineral wool, expanded polystyrene, extruded polystyrene, polyurethane, vacuum insulation panels, gas insulation panels, aerogels, and future possibilities like vacuum insulation materials, nano insulation materials and dynamic insulation materials. Various properties, requirements and possibilities have been compared and studied. Among these are thermal conductivity, perforation vulnerability, building site adaptability and cuttability, mechanical strength, fire protection, fume emission during fire, robustness, climate ageing durability, resistance towards freezing/thawing cycles, water resistance, costs and environmental impact. Currently, there exist no single insulation material or solution capable of fulfilling all the requirements with respect to the most crucial properties. That is, for the buildings of today and the near future, several insulation materials and solutions are used and will have to be used depending on the exact circumstances and specifications. As of today, new materials and solutions like e.g. vacuum insulation panels are emerging, but only slowly introduced in the building sector partly due to their short track record. Therefore it will be of major importance to know the limitations and possibilities of all the insulation materials and solutions, i.e. their advantages and disadvantages. In this respect new conceptual thermal building insulation materials are also discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The authors therefore examined managers' preferences for different communication media across two different generations, as well as their perceptions of the communication climate and their overall satisfaction with their organizations' communication. Design/methodology/approach The authors tested an interaction model comprising ease of use of communication medium, communication climate and communication satisfaction, on 822 Indian managers belonging to two different generations. In doing so, they used a survey to investigate managers' preferences for different media, their perceptions of the communication climate within their organizations and their overall satisfaction with the communication that takes place. The authors drew on studies on media richness theory, on communication climate and on inter-generational differences. Findings The findings show that while communication satisfaction in general was low across both generations, Generation Y employees recorded the lowest levels of satisfaction. In addition, a manager's generational category does not moderate the relationship between media use and communication satisfaction, but it does moderate the relationship between communication climate and communication satisfaction. In terms of the ease of use associated with different types of media, the differences between the generations were largely stereotyped, although moderate media (VC, chat, voicemail) were preferred over rich media (face-to-face meetings) or lean media (fax, memos and emails), by all managers. Practical implications - Senior management in India must shed their bureaucratic mind-set to promote openness in the communication choices that are considered acceptable, leading to more effective decision-making and problem solving. Mobile phones, chats, wikis, podcasts, video-conferencing and email should be officially embedded into the organizational communication culture to facilitate state-of-the-art knowledge management practices. More multi-generational teams and mentorship programmes need to be implemented to make a wider variety of media acceptable to all managers, which will in turn improve communication satisfaction. Originality/value This study is original in that it unpacks the influence of media use and communication satisfaction across Gen X and Gen Y, who will be moving into more senior positions in India in the next decade. In doing so, it provides a snapshot of organizational communication in an important emerging economy and provides recommendations as to how organizational communication may be made more effective in the future. Organizations in India and elsewhere can improve their organizational communication by enhancing transparency and by making a wider variety of media accessible, and therefore acceptable, to different generations of managers.","[Mehra, Payal] Indian Inst Management, Dept Commun, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Nickerson, Catherine] Zayed Univ, Coll Business, Dubai, U Arab Emirates",Indian Institute of Management (IIM System); Indian Institute of Management Lucknow; Zayed University,"Nickerson, C (corresponding author), Zayed Univ, Coll Business, Dubai, U Arab Emirates.",catherine.nickerson@zu.ac.ae,,,,,,,64,2,2,3,27,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1934-8835,1758-8561,,INT J ORGAN ANAL,Int.

Addition of 114 Pmol of alkalinity to the surface ocean stabilizes atmospheric CO2 concentration to RCP4.5 levels under RCP8.5 emissions. This scenario removes 940 GtC from the atmosphere and mitigates 1.5 K of global warming within this century. The climate adjusts to the lower CO2 concentration preventing the loss of sea ice and high sea level rise. Seawater pH and the carbonate saturation state (O) rise substantially above levels of the current decade. Pronounced differences in regional sensitivities to AOA are projected, with the Arctic Ocean and tropical oceans emerging as hot spots for biogeochemical changes induced by AOA. Thus, the CO2 mitigation potential of AOA comes at a price of an unprecedented ocean biogeochemistry perturbation with unknown ecological consequences.","[Gonzalez, Miriam Ferrer; Ilyina, Tatiana] Max Planck Inst Meteorol, Hamburg, Germany; [Gonzalez, Miriam Ferrer] Int Max Planck Res Sch Earth Syst Modeling, Hamburg, Germany",Max Planck Society; Max Planck Society,"Gonzalez, MF (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Meteorol, Hamburg, Germany.;Gonzalez, MF (corresponding author), Int Max Planck Res Sch Earth Syst Modeling, Hamburg, Germany.",miriam.ferrer-gonzalez@mpimet.mpg.de,"Ilyina, Tatiana/ABE-9164-2020","Ilyina, Tatiana/0000-0002-3475-4842","German Science Foundation (DFG) within the Priority Program Climate Engineering: Risks, Challenges, Opportunities [SPP 1689]; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)","German Science Foundation (DFG) within the Priority Program Climate Engineering: Risks, Challenges, Opportunities(German Research Foundation (DFG)); German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF))","This research was supported by the German Science Foundation (DFG) within the Priority Program Climate Engineering: Risks, Challenges, Opportunities (SPP 1689).

For EBM, regular ecosystem-wide assessments of changes in environmental or ecological status are essential components, as well as assessments of the effects of management measures. Assessments are typically carried out using indicators. A major challenge for the usage of indicators in EBM is trophic interactions as these may influence indicator responses. Trophic interactions can also shape trade-offs between management targets, because they modify and mediate the effects of pressures on ecosystems. Characterization of such interactions is in turn a challenge when testing the usability of indicators. Climate variability and climate change may also impact indicators directly, as well as indirectly through trophic interactions. Together, these effects may alter interpretation of indicators in assessments and evaluation of management measures. We developed indicator networks - statistical models of coupled indicators - to identify links representing trophic interactions between proposed food-web indicators, under multiple anthropogenic pressures and climate variables, using two basins in the Baltic Sea as a case study. We used the networks to simulate future indicator responses under different fishing, eutrophication and climate change scenarios. Responsiveness to fishing and eutrophication differed between indicators and across basins. Almost all indicators were highly dependent on climatic conditions, and differences in indicator trajectories > 10% were found only in comparisons of future climates. In some cases, effects of nutrient load and climate scenarios counteracted each other, altering how management measures manifested in the indicators. Incorporating climate change, or other regionally non-manageable drivers, is thus necessary for an accurate interpretation of indicators and thereby of EBM measure effects. Quantification of linkages between indicators across trophic levels is similarly a prerequisite for tracking effects propagating through the food web, and, consequently, for indicator interpretation. Developing meaningful indicators under climate change calls for iterative indicator validations, accounting for natural processes such as trophic interactions and for trade-offs between management objectives, to enable learning as well as setting target levels or thresholds triggering actions in an adaptive manner. Such flexible strategies make a set of indicators operational over the long-term and facilitate success of EBM.","[Kadin, Martina; Blenckner, Thorsten; Otto, Saskia A.] Stockholm Univ, Stockholm Resilience Ctr, Stockholm, Sweden; [Casini, Michele] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Inst Marine Res, Dept Aquat Resources, Lysekil, Sweden; [Gardmark, Anna; Torres, Maria Angeles] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Aquat Resources, Oregrund, Sweden; [Otto, Saskia A.] Univ Hamburg, Inst Marine Ecosyst & Fishery Sci, Ctr Earth Syst Res & Sustainabil, Hamburg, Germany; [Kadin, Martina] Swedish Museum Nat Hist, Stockholm, Sweden; [Torres, Maria Angeles] Ctr Oceanog Cadiz, Inst Espanol Oceanog, Cadiz, Spain",Stockholm University; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; University of Hamburg; Swedish Museum of Natural History; Spanish Institute of Oceanography,"Kadin, M (corresponding author), Stockholm Univ, Stockholm Resilience Ctr, Stockholm, Sweden.;Kadin, M (corresponding author), Swedish Museum Nat Hist, Stockholm, Sweden.",martina.kadin@nrm.se,"Gårdmark, Anna/AAC-3909-2021","Blenckner, Thorsten/0000-0002-6991-7680; Kadin, Martina/0000-0002-4706-7267; Casini, Michele/0000-0003-4910-5236",Swedish Environmental Protection Agency [20704801]; Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management [1862-16]; BONUS INSPIRE project - BONUS (Art 185) - EU; BONUS INSPIRE project - BONUS (Art 185) - Swedish Research Council FORMAS; Swedish Research Council FORMAS [217-2013-1315]; BONUS BLUEWEBS project - BONUS (Art 185),Swedish Environmental Protection Agency; Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management; BONUS INSPIRE project - BONUS (Art 185) - EU; BONUS INSPIRE project - BONUS (Art 185) - Swedish Research Council FORMAS(Swedish Research Council Formas); Swedish Research Council FORMAS(Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council Formas); BONUS BLUEWEBS project - BONUS (Art 185),"This study is a contribution to the project 'Ecosystem-based approach for developing and testing pelagic food-web indicators' financially supported by the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency (Grant No. 20704801).

The need became political practice at the Conference of the Parties in 2015, where the participants decided to limit global warming to not more than +2.0 degrees C compared to pre-industrial times and to rather aim for a limit of +1.5 degrees C global warming. Nevertheless, a clear picture of what European climate would look like under +1.5 degrees C, +2.0 degrees C and +3.0 degrees C global warming level (GWL) is still missing. In this study, we will fill this gap by assessing selected climate indices related to temperature and precipitation extremes, based on state of the art regional climate information for Europe taken from the European branch of the World Climate Research Program Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (EURO-CORDEX) ensemble. To assess the impact of these indices under climate change, we investigate the spatial extent of the area of the climate change signal in relation to the affected population. This allows us to demonstrate which climate extremes could be avoided when global warming is kept well below +2.0 degrees C or even +1.5 degrees C compared to higher GWLs. The European north-south gradient of tropical nights and hot days is projected to be intensified with an increasing global warming level. For precipitation-related indices, an overall increase in precipitation extremes is simulated, especially under +3.0 degrees C GWL, for mid-and northern Europe, whereas an increase in dry days is projected for many regions in southern Europe. The benefit of staying below +1.5 degrees C GWL compared to +2.0 degrees C GWL is the avoidance of an additional increase in tropical nights and hot days parallel to an increase in dry days in parts of southern Europe as well as an increase in heavy precipitation in parts of Scandinavia. Compared to +3.0 degrees C GWL, the benefit of staying at +1.5 degrees C GWL is to avoid a substantial increase (i.e., an increase of more than five dry days and ten tropical nights) in dry days and tropical nights in southern European regions, while, in several European regions and especially in northern Europe, a substantial increase (i.e., more than two heavy precipitation days) in heavy precipitation days could be avoided. This study shows that a statistically significant change in the investigated climate indices can be avoided under +1.5 degrees C GWL compared to the investigated higher GWLs +2.0 degrees C and +3.0 degrees C for the majority of the population in almost all regions. Future studies will investigate compound events where the severity of single extreme events is intensified.","[Teichmann, Claas; Buelow, Katharina; Otto, Juliane; Pfeifer, Susanne; Rechid, Diana; Sieck, Kevin; Jacob, Daniela] Helmholtz Zentrum Geesthacht, Climate Serv Ctr Germany GERICS, Fischertwiete 1, D-20095 Hamburg, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Zentrum Geesthacht - Zentrum fur Material- und Kustenforschung,"Teichmann, C (corresponding author), Helmholtz Zentrum Geesthacht, Climate Serv Ctr Germany GERICS, Fischertwiete 1, D-20095 Hamburg, Germany.",claas.teichmann@hzg.de; katharina.buelow@hzg.de; juliane.otto@hzg.de; susanne.pfeifer@hzg.de; diana.rechid@hzg.de; kevin.sieck@hzg.de; daniela.jacob@hzg.de,"Sieck, Kevin/N-7953-2017; Sieck, Kevin/W-4849-2019; Teichmann, Claas/J-1149-2014","Sieck, Kevin/0000-0003-4536-7335; Sieck, Kevin/0000-0003-4536-7335; Teichmann, Claas/0000-0003-2478-7074",,,,,29,19,19,1,7,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2073-4433,,,ATMOSPHERE-BASEL,Atmosphere,APR,2018,4,,,,,,115,10.3390/atmos9040115,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos9040115,,,19,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,GJ3GB,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000435178000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This model has numerous complexities that allow it to represent some of the most important nonlinearities associated with stratospheric SO2 injection, including aerosol microphysical growth and stratospheric chemistry. The studies described herein represent the steps toward and first attempt in a state-of-the-art climate model to use solar geoengineering to meet multiple simultaneous objectives via SO2 injection at multiple locations. First, a set of simulations was carried out to better understand the response of the model to variations in latitude, altitude, and amount of sulfur dioxide injections. Subsequently, in a century-long simulation, a feedback algorithm was employed to meet specific objectives and manage uncertainty, wherein the injection amount at each location was adjusted every model year. Most of the analyses contained in this special issue focus on surface climate and stratospheric changes in the simulations. In addition, 20 ensemble members of the feedback simulation have been carried out and provided to the community (the Geoengineering Large Ensemble) to expand the scope of analyses to low signal-to-noise ratio fields, including regional effects, impacts assessment, and extreme events. The demonstration provided by these simulations is a step toward understanding the space of achievable climate objectives via solar geoengineering or, phrased differently, determining what solar geoengineering can do and what it cannot do.","[Kravitz, Ben] Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Atmospher Sci & Global Change Div, Richland, WA 99352 USA; [MacMartin, Douglas G.] Cornell Univ, Sibley Sch Mech & Aerosp Engn, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Tilmes, Simone; Mills, Michael J.; Lamarque, Jean-Francois] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Atmospher Chem Observat & Modeling Grp, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [Tilmes, Simone; Richter, Jadwiga H.; Tribbia, Joseph; Large, William] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Climate & Global Dynam Grp, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Pacific Northwest National Laboratory; Cornell University; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA,"Kravitz, B (corresponding author), Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Atmospher Sci & Global Change Div, Richland, WA 99352 USA.",ben.kravitz@pnnl.gov,"Lamarque, Jean-Francois/L-2313-2014; Kravitz, Ben/P-7925-2014; MacMartin, Douglas/AAB-5314-2020; MacMartin, Douglas/A-6333-2016; Mills, Michael/B-5068-2010","Lamarque, Jean-Francois/0000-0002-4225-5074; Kravitz, Ben/0000-0001-6318-1150; MacMartin, Douglas/0000-0003-1987-9417; Tilmes, Simone/0000-0002-6557-3569; Mills, Michael/0000-0002-8054-1346",Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA); Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future at Cornell University; U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC05-76RL01830]; National Science Foundation,Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)(United States Department of DefenseDefense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)); Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future at Cornell University; U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This research was developed with funding from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA).

Detection of subtle indicators from a background of natural variability require measurements over a time-base of decades. This places severe demands on the instrumentation used-requiring measurements of sufficient, accuracy and sensitivity that can allow reliable judgements to be made decades apart. The SI and network of National Metrology Institutes was developed to address such requirements. However, ensuring SI traceability of sufficient accuracy can be established and maintained to instruments orbiting the Earth presents a significant new challenge to the metrology community. This paper highlights some key measurands and applications driving the uncertainty demand of the climate community in the solar reflective domain, e.g., Solar irradiances and Earth reflectances/radiances. It discusses how meeting these uncertainties facilitate significant improvement in the forecasting abilities of climate models. After discussing the current state-of-the-art it describes a new satellite mission, called TRUTHS, which enables, for the first time, high accuracy SI traceability to be established in-orbit. The direct-use of a primary standard and replication of the terrestrial traceability chain, extends the SI into space in effect realising a metrology laboratory in space.","Natl Phys Lab, Teddington TW11 0LW, Middx, England",National Physical Laboratory - UK,"Fox, N (corresponding author), Natl Phys Lab, Hampton Rd, Teddington TW11 0LW, Middx, England.",,"Fox, Nigel/ACL-1124-2022",,,,,,79,0,0,1,8,IOS PRESS,AMSTERDAM,"NIEUWE HEMWEG 6B, 1013 BG AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0074-784X,,978-1-61499-326-1; 978-1-61499-325-4,P INT SCH PHYS,,,2013,,,,,147,192,,10.3254/978-1-61499-326-1-147,http://dx.doi.org/10.3254/978-1-61499-326-1-147,,,46,"Physics, Multidisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Physics,BC1JI,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000350147200008,View Full Record in Web of Science

We analyze tropical lower-stratospheric water vapor in 21st century simulations from 12 state-of-the-art chemistry-climate models (CCMs), using a linear regression model to determine the factors driving the trends and variability. Within CCMs, warming of the troposphere primarily drives the long-term trend in stratospheric humidity. This is partially offset in most CCMs by an increase in the strength of the Brewer-Dobson circulation, which tends to cool the tropical tropopause layer (TTL). We also apply the regression model to individual decades from the 21st century CCM runs and compare them to a regression of a decade of observations. Many of the CCMs, but not all, compare well with these observations, lending credibility to their predictions. One notable deficiency is that most CCMs underestimate the impact of the quasi-biennial oscillation on lower-stratospheric water vapor. Our analysis provides a new and potentially superior way to evaluate model trends in lower-stratospheric humidity.","[Smalley, Kevin M.; Dessler, Andrew E.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, College Stn, TX USA; [Bekki, Slimane; Marchand, Marion] IPSL, LATMOS, Paris, France; [Deushi, Makoto] Meteorol Res Inst, 1-1 Nagamine, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050052, Japan; [Morgenstern, Olaf; Zeng, Guang] Natl Inst Water & Atmospher Res NIWA, Wellington, New Zealand; [Plummer, David A.] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Canadian Ctr Climate Modelling & Anal, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Shibata, Kiyotaka] Kochi Univ Technol, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Kami, Japan; [Yamashita, Yousuke] NIES, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Yamashita, Yousuke] Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol JAMSTEC, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Universite Paris Cite; Universite Paris Saclay; Meteorological Research Institute - Japan; National Institute of Water & Atmospheric Research (NIWA) - New Zealand; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling & Analysis (CCCma); Kochi University Technology; National Institute for Environmental Studies - Japan; Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science & Technology (JAMSTEC),"Dessler, AE (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, College Stn, TX USA.",adessler@tamu.edu,"Smalley, Kevin/N-7220-2019; bekki, slimane/J-7221-2015; Yamashita, Yousuke/AAB-4754-2019; Dessler, Andrew E/G-8852-2012","Smalley, Kevin/0000-0002-0575-7286; bekki, slimane/0000-0002-5538-0800; Yamashita, Yousuke/0000-0002-6813-4668; Dessler, Andrew E/0000-0003-3939-4820; Zeng, Guang/0000-0002-9356-5021; Plummer, David/0000-0001-8087-3976; Deushi, Makoto/0000-0002-0373-3918; Morgenstern, Olaf/0000-0002-9967-9740","NASA [NNX14AF15G]; New Zealand Royal Society Marsden Fund [12-NIW-006]; NZ Government's Strategic Science Investment Fund (SSIF) through the NIWA programme CACV; NeSI's collaborator institutions; Ministry of Business, Innovation & Employment's Research Infrastructure program; Environment Research and Technology Development Fund, Ministry of Environment, Japan [2-1303]; NEC-SX9/A(ECO) computers at CGER, NIES; European Project StratoClim (7th Framework Programme) [603557]; SOLSPEC grant from the Centre d'Etude Spatiale (CNES)","NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); New Zealand Royal Society Marsden Fund(Royal Society of New ZealandMarsden Fund (NZ)); NZ Government's Strategic Science Investment Fund (SSIF) through the NIWA programme CACV; NeSI's collaborator institutions; Ministry of Business, Innovation & Employment's Research Infrastructure program; Environment Research and Technology Development Fund, Ministry of Environment, Japan; NEC-SX9/A(ECO) computers at CGER, NIES; European Project StratoClim (7th Framework Programme); SOLSPEC grant from the Centre d'Etude Spatiale (CNES)","This work was supported by NASA grant NNX14AF15G to Texas A&M University.

In such an ice-free high-latitude ocean the annual-mean SST would be much higher and the seasonal cycle would be dramatically reduced - making potential implications for equable climates manifest. The constraints that atmospheric heat transport, ocean heat transport, and CO2 concentration place on this mechanism are established. These ideas are investigated using the NCAR column model, which has state-of-the-art atmospheric physics parameterizations, high vertical resolution, a full seasonal cycle, a thermodynamic sea ice model, and a mixed layer ocean.","Harvard Univ, Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Cambridge, MA USA; Harvard Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Cambridge, MA USA",Harvard University; Harvard University,"Abbot, DS (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Cambridge, MA USA.",,"Abbot, Dorian/J-6352-2012; Tziperman, Eli/A-1219-2008",,,,,,18,63,63,0,16,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",0094-8276,1944-8007,,GEOPHYS RES LETT,Geophys.

In this study, the climatic response to prescribed changes in vegetation is investigated using the Weather Research and Forecasting model. When the vegetation is changed from bare or sparsely vegetated' category to grassland' in the NWHP, the climate shows both local and remote responses. Locally, the temperature increases in the winter but decreases in the summer. The precipitation level increases substantially in the summer while increases slightly in the winter, which is mainly caused by the increase in the amount of water-vapour and circulation adjustment. Additionally, atmospheric circulation anomalies also lead to remote circulation responses, including a decrease in precipitation over Central North China and an increase in precipitation over Central and South China. The results of this study bring to light the local and remote climatic responses to changes in vegetation in the NWHP using a state-of-the-art regional climate model.

There is interest in compiling databases for assessing the adequacy of acclimation for dealing with climate change. Here, we argue that the nature of acclimation is context dependent and therefore that estimates summarised across studies, especially those that have assayed stress using diverse methods, are limited in their utility when applied as a standardized metric or to a single general context such as average climate warming. Moreover, the dynamic nature of tolerances and acclimation drives important variation that is quickly obscured through many summary statistics or even in effect size analyses; retaining a strong focus on the temporal -level, population-level and treatment-level variance in forecasting climate change impacts on insects is essential. We summarise recent developments within the context of climate change and propose how future studies might validate the role of acclimation by integration across field studies and mechanistic modelling. Despite arguments to the contrary, to date no studies have convincingly demonstrated an important role for acclimation in recent climate change adaptation of insects. Paramount to these discussions is i) developing a strong conceptual framework for acclimation in the focal trait (s), ii) obtaining novel empirical data dissecting the fitness benefits and consequences of acclimation across diverse contexts and timescales, with iii) better coverage of underrepresented geographic regions and taxa.","[Terblanche, John S.; Hoffmann, Ary A.] Stellenbosch Univ, Dept Conservat Ecol & Entomol, Ctr Invas Biol, Stellenbosch, South Africa; [Hoffmann, Ary A.] Univ Melbourne, Bio21 Inst, Sch BioSci, Pest & Environm Adaptat Res Grp, Parkville, Vic, Australia",Stellenbosch University; University of Melbourne,"Terblanche, JS (corresponding author), Stellenbosch Univ, Dept Conservat Ecol & Entomol, Ctr Invas Biol, Stellenbosch, South Africa.",jst@sun.ac.za,,"Hoffmann, Ary/0000-0001-9497-7645; Terblanche, John/0000-0001-9665-9405",DSI-NRF Centre of Excellence for Invasion Biology,DSI-NRF Centre of Excellence for Invasion Biology,"The DSI-NRF Centre of Excellence for Invasion Biology provided funding towards AAH's visit through a CIB Visiting Fellows program.

Yet, some governments - including those in Australia - fail to meet agreed targets and continue to invest in the coal industry. Scientists and other scholars have expressed concern that the science is not prompting shifts in policy adequate to address current and future effects of climate change. Many have called for other tools - specifically, the arts and social sciences - to investigate and communicate about the environmental and social changes underway. In this context, this article explores the potential of interdisciplinary collaborative song-writing as research practice. Beginning on a boat on Australia's Great Barrier Reef, the research team adopted singing and song-writing as a method for coming together to reflect upon our research aims and motivations, to explore and express the delight and grief we were experiencing in this climate-changing land and seascape and potentially to reach new audiences and create different affects. Our multidisciplinary expertise offered impetus to pursue a hybrid form: an original song written, professionally recorded and vinyl pressed; scholarly notes to expand on our song lyrics; visual presentation of our music as annotated score; and written reflections on the process and its contribution to knowledge.

The system was designed to both entertain and educate the visitors, empowering them to understand how unsustainable behaviours may affect our lives in the future and emphasize the need to take relevant actions for building a more environmentally sustainable world. Augmented Gallery consists of an AR app running on networked smartphones used by visitors.

The Teitiota Case Before the Human Rights Committee,DIRITTI UMANI E DIRITTO INTERNAZIONALE,,,English,Article,,,,,,climate change and human rights; environmental migrants; non-refoulement; right to life; ICCPR; Responsibility to Protect,,"In its Views of 24 October 2019 in the case of Teitiota v. New Zealand, the Human Rights Committee had to decide whether a 'climate change migrant' enjoyed international protection against re-foulement under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The applicant claimed that his forced return to Kiribati exposed him to life-threatening natural hazards and lack of access to fresh water, in violation of his right to life, due to the serious environmental degradation caused by sea level rise in the island state. For the first time, the Committee recognized that the effects of climate change may expose individuals to a violation of their rights to life and to be free from inhuman and degrading treatment under Arts 6 or 7 of the Covenant, thereby triggering the non-refoulement obligation. However, in the specific case the Committee concluded that the domestic authorities' assessment that the author had not been exposed to a real risk of a violation of his right to life, including his right to a life with dignity, was not manifestly arbitrary, unreasonable or unjust. After discussing the Committee's assessment of the 'reasonable foreseeability' of this risk in light of the general environmental situation in Kiribati, which equally affects its entire population, this article analyses the high threshold of gravity - i.e., of 'uninhabitability' - applied by the Committee to ascertain the existence of such risk for the individual applicant. It then comments the aptness of such threshold to take into account the global responsibility for climate change adequately, its link with the notion of the 'responsibility to protect', and its limits and potentialities in the perspective of human rights protection.","[Maneggia, Amina] Univ Perugia, Dept Polit Sci, Int Law, Via A Pascoli 20, I-06123 Perugia, Italy",University of Perugia,"Maneggia, A (corresponding author), Univ Perugia, Dept Polit Sci, Int Law, Via A Pascoli 20, I-06123 Perugia, Italy.",amina.maneggia@unipg.it,,,,,,,0,0,0,1,5,SOC ED IL MULINO,BOLOGNA,"STRADA MAGGIORE 37, 40125 BOLOGNA, ITALY",1971-7105,1972-5485,,DIRITTI UMANI DIRITT,Diritti Umani Diritto Int.,MAY-AUG,2020,2,,,,635,643,,10.12829/97973,http://dx.doi.org/10.12829/97973,,,9,International Relations; Law,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),International Relations; Government & Law,NH6WK,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000564808300018,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this study Boosted Regression Trees modelling was used to relate the cover of submerged aquatic vegetation to the abiotic environment in the brackish Baltic Sea. The analyses showed that the majority of the studied submerged aquatic species are most sensitive to changes in water temperature, current velocity and winter ice scour. Surprisingly, water salinity, turbidity and eutrophication have little impact on the distributional pattern of the studied biota. Both small and large scale environmental variability contributes to the variability of submerged aquatic vegetation. When modelling species distribution under the projected influences of climate change, all of the studied submerged aquatic species appear to be very resilient to a broad range of environmental perturbation and biomass gains are expected when seawater temperature increases. This is mainly because vegetation develops faster in spring and has a longer growing season under the projected climate change scenario. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

They provide surface for heterogeneous reactions activating chlorine and bromine reservoir species during the polar night. The large-scale effects of PSCs are represented by means of parameterisations in current global chemistry-climate models, but one process is still a challenge: the representation of PSCs formed locally in conjunction with unresolved mountain waves. In this study, we investigate direct simulations of PSCs formed by mountain waves with the ICOsahedral Nonhydrostatic modelling framework (ICON) with its extension for Aerosols and Reactive Trace gases (ART) including local grid refinements (nesting) with two-way interaction. Here, the nesting is set up around the Antarctic Peninsula, which is a well-known hot spot for the generation of mountain waves in the Southern Hemisphere. We compare our model results with satellite measurements of PSCs from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) and gravity wave observations of the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS). For a mountain wave event from 19 to 29 July 2008 we find similar structures of PSCs as well as a fairly realistic development of the mountain wave between the satellite data and the ICON-ART simulations in the Antarctic Peninsula nest. We compare a global simulation without nesting with the nested configuration to show the benefits of adding the nesting. Although the mountain waves cannot be resolved explicitly at the global resolution used (about 160 km), their effect from the nested regions (about 80 and 40 km) on the global domain is represented. Thus, we show in this study that the ICON-ART model has the potential to bridge the gap between directly resolved mountain-wave-induced PSCs and their representation and effect on chemistry at coarse global resolutions.","[Weimer, Michael; Buchmuller, Jennifer; Kirner, Ole] Karlsruhe Inst Technol KIT, Steinbuch Ctr Comp, Eggenstein Leopoldshafen, Germany; [Weimer, Michael; Buchmuller, Jennifer; Ruhnke, Roland; Braesicke, Peter] Karlsruhe Inst Technol KIT, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Eggenstein Leopoldshafen, Germany; [Hoffmann, Lars] Forschungszentrum Julich, Julich Supercomp Ctr, Julich, Germany; [Luo, Beiping] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, Zurich, Switzerland; [Steiner, Michael] EMPA, Lab Air Pollut Environm Technol, Dubendorf, Switzerland; [Tritscher, Ines] Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Energy & Climate Res Stratosphere IEK 7, Julich, Germany; [Weimer, Michael] MIT, Dept Earth Atmospher & Planetary Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; Helmholtz Association; Research Center Julich; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science & Technology (EMPA); Helmholtz Association; Research Center Julich; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Weimer, M (corresponding author), Karlsruhe Inst Technol KIT, Steinbuch Ctr Comp, Eggenstein Leopoldshafen, Germany.;Weimer, M (corresponding author), Karlsruhe Inst Technol KIT, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Eggenstein Leopoldshafen, Germany.;Weimer, M (corresponding author), MIT, Dept Earth Atmospher & Planetary Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",michael.weimer@kit.edu,"Hoffmann, Lars/ABI-3746-2020; Ruhnke, Roland/J-8800-2012; Braesicke, Peter/D-8330-2016; Tritscher, Ines/O-2271-2014","Hoffmann, Lars/0000-0003-3773-4377; Ruhnke, Roland/0000-0002-0353-1603; Braesicke, Peter/0000-0003-1423-0619; Tritscher, Ines/0000-0001-5285-7952; Weimer, Michael/0000-0002-1004-4002","state of Baden-Wurttemberg through bwHPC; Ministry of Science, Research and the Arts Baden-Wurttemberg; Federal Ministry of Education and Research; Initiative and Networking Fund of the Helmholtz Association through the project Digital Earth; Initiative and Networking Fund of the Helmholtz Association through the project Advanced Earth System Modelling Capacity; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) [310479827]","state of Baden-Wurttemberg through bwHPC; Ministry of Science, Research and the Arts Baden-Wurttemberg; Federal Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); Initiative and Networking Fund of the Helmholtz Association through the project Digital Earth; Initiative and Networking Fund of the Helmholtz Association through the project Advanced Earth System Modelling Capacity; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG))","Parts of the simulations were performed on bwUniCluster, for which the authors acknowledge support by the state of Baden-Wurttemberg through bwHPC.

Energised by a burgeoning environmentalism acquired in New York City and terrified by the alreadyapparent impacts of mass tourism on this once-barren volcanic island, Manrique quite literally saw an opportunity in the landscape. Manrique and the local tourism bureau undertook a decades long project to rebrand and, more importantly, redesign the island as simultaneously artistic and ecologically unique. Thirty years later, UNESCO designated Lanzarote a World Heritage Site in part for this socio-ecological synthesis, in some ways precluding overdevelopment and in other ways encouraging Lanzarote's branding as a uniquely desirable tourist destination. Today, Lanzarote has made substantial public investment in the Museo Atlantico, a massive underwater museum and artificial reef, to extend Manrique's original legacy and sink tourism development to the seafloor. Lanzarote was one of the first `art islands,' discreet geologic sites made unique in a competitive globalising island tourism industry by embedding art into the local ecology itself. This paper explores how island socio-ecology shaped Lanzarote's development into an art island, and illustrates how ideas of art, ecology, and value can cross oceans, create connectivity, and alter environments.","[Meyers, Rennie] Univ Rhode Isl, Kingston, RI 02881 USA",University of Rhode Island,"Meyers, R (corresponding author), Univ Rhode Isl, Kingston, RI 02881 USA.",renniesmeyers@gmail.com,,,,,,,132,1,1,1,7,"MACQUARIE UNIV, DIV HUMANITIES",SYDNEY,"MACQUARIE UNIV, SYDNEY, NSW 2109, AUSTRALIA",1834-6049,1834-6057,,SHIMA,Shima,,2020,2,,,,26,56,,10.21463/shima.14.2.05,http://dx.doi.org/10.21463/shima.14.2.05,,,31,Geography,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Geography,NV8PH,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000574575700003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Three factors contribute to the intermodel spread: 1) model formulation, 2) control climate state, and 3) internal climate variability. This study focuses on the influence of Arctic sea ice in the control climate on the intermodel spread in warming, using idealized 1% yr(-1) CO2 increase simulations of 33 state-of-the-art global climate models, and combining sea ice-temperature relations on local to large spatial scales. On the Arctic mean scale, the spread in temperature trends is only weakly related to ice volume or area in the control climate, and is probably not dominated by internal variability. This suggests that other processes, such as ocean heat transport and meteorological conditions, play a more important role in the spread of long-term Arctic warming than control sea ice conditions. However, on a local scale, sea ice-warming relations show that in regions with more sea ice, models generally simulate more warming in winter and less warming in summer. The local winter warming is clearly related to control sea ice and universal among models, whereas summer sea ice-warming relations are more diverse, and are probably dominated by differences in model formulation. To obtain a more realistic representation of Arctic warming, it is recommended to simulate control sea ice conditions in climate models so that the spatial pattern is correct.","[van der Linden, E.

A thorough understanding of the accompanying biogeophysical consequences is crucial for sustainable future development of the region's ecosystem functions and society. In this study, data from ERA-Interim driven simulations conducted with the state-of-the-art regional climate model COSMO-CLM (CCLM; version 4.8.17) at 14 km horizontal resolution are analyzed over SEA for the period from 1990 to 2004, and during El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events for November to March. A simulation with large-scale deforested land cover is compared to a simulation with no land cover change. In order to attribute the differences due to deforestation to feedback mechanisms, the coupling strength concept is applied based on Pearson correlation coefficients. The correlations were calculated based on 10-day means between the latent heat flux and maximum temperature, the latent and sensible heat flux, and the latent heat flux and planetary boundary layer height. The results show that the coupling strength between land and atmosphere increased for all correlations due to deforestation. This implies a strong impact of the land on the atmosphere after deforestation. Differences in environmental conditions due to deforestation are most effective during La Nina years. The strength of La Nina events on the region is reduced as the impact of deforestation on the atmosphere with drier and warmer conditions superimpose this effect. The correlation strength also intensified and shifted towards stronger coupling during El Nino events for both Control and Grass simulations. However, El Nino years have the potential to become even warmer and drier than during usual conditions without deforestation. This could favor an increase in the formation of tropical cyclones. Whether deforestation will lead to a permanent transition to agricultural production increases in this region cannot be concluded. Rather, the impact of deforestation will be an additional threat besides global warming in the next decades due to the increase in the occurrence of multiple extreme events. This may change the type and severity of upcoming impacts and the vulnerability and sustainability of our society.","[Toelle, Merja H.] Justus Liebig Univ Giessen, Dept Geog, D-35390 Giessen, Germany; [Toelle, Merja H.] Univ Kassel, Ctr Environm Syst Res CESR, D-34117 Kassel, Germany",Justus Liebig University Giessen; Universitat Kassel,"Tolle, MH (corresponding author), Justus Liebig Univ Giessen, Dept Geog, D-35390 Giessen, Germany.;Tolle, MH (corresponding author), Univ Kassel, Ctr Environm Syst Res CESR, D-34117 Kassel, Germany.",merja.toelle@geogr.uni-giessen.de,"Tölle, Merja/E-4625-2013","Tölle, Merja/0000-0003-1958-2795",Ecological and Socioeconomic Functions of Tropical Lowland Rainforest Transformation Systems (EFForTS) under the support of the German Research Foundation (DFG) [CRC990]; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF); German Research Foundation (DFG) [401857120],Ecological and Socioeconomic Functions of Tropical Lowland Rainforest Transformation Systems (EFForTS) under the support of the German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),This research was part of research related to the project CRC990 Ecological and Socioeconomic Functions of Tropical Lowland Rainforest Transformation Systems (EFForTS) under the support of the German Research Foundation (DFG).

The near-surface temperature, wind speed, and relative humidity are compared with datasets of in situ observations, together with an assessment of the simulated surface mass balance (approximated by precipitation minus evaporation). No reanalysis clearly stands out as the best performing for all areas, seasons, and variables, and each of the reanalyses displays different biases. CFSR strongly overestimates the relative humidity during all seasons whereas ERA-5 and MERRA-2 (and, to a lesser extent, ERA-Interim) strongly underestimate relative humidity during winter. ERA-5 captures the seasonal cycle of near-surface temperature best and shows the smallest bias relative to the observations. The other reanalyses show a general temperature underestimation during the winter months in the Antarctic interior and overestimation in the coastal areas. All reanalyses underestimate the mean near-surface winds in the interior (except MERRA-2) and along the coast during the entire year. The winds at the Antarctic Peninsula are overestimated by all reanalyses except MERRA-2. All models are able to capture snowfall patterns related to atmospheric rivers, with varying accuracy. Accumulation is best represented by ERA-5, although it underestimates observed surface mass balance and there is some variability in the accumulation over the different elevation classes, for all reanalyses.","[Gossart, A.; Helsen, S.; Vanden Broucke, S.; van Lipzig, N.

The simulation of the AAIW in current climate models, however, has remained deficient, especially in the Atlantic sector. Here, we evaluate the simulation of the South Atlantic AAIW in eleven state-of-the-art coupled climate models. It is found that all the models show a common AAIW bias relative to the observation, with a saltier, warmer and lighter core located at a shallower depth. This AAIW bias seems to contribute to a deficient freshwater export by the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), potentially overstabilizing the AMOC. The causes of the bias are investigated in sensitivity experiments using an ocean alone model. It is found that the AAIW bias is caused neither by the surface climate bias nor the North Atlantic bias, although is weakly affected by the inter-basin exchange. This left the conclusion that the AAIW bias is caused predominantly by the deficient model representation of ocean dynamics and mixing processes in the AAIW region.","[Zhu, Chenyu; Liu, Zhengyu] Peking Univ, Sch Phys, Lab Climate & Ocean Atmosphere Studies LaCOAS, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Liu, Zhengyu; Gu, Sifan] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, 1225 W Dayton St, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Liu, Zhengyu; Gu, Sifan] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Nelson Ctr Climat Res, 1225 W Dayton St, Madison, WI 53706 USA",Peking University; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Zhu, CY (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Sch Phys, Lab Climate & Ocean Atmosphere Studies LaCOAS, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",zhuouc@163.com,"Zhu, Chenyu/GNM-9706-2022","Zhu, Chenyu/0000-0002-9330-4294",NOAA Climate Observations and Monitoring (COM) program; National Natural Science Foundation of China [NSFC41630527]; US National Science Foundation [NSF P2C2],NOAA Climate Observations and Monitoring (COM) program; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); US National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"We thank Dr. G.

To date, climate change vulnerability assessments have largely been based on projected changes in range size derived from the output of species distribution models (SDMs). A criticism of risk assessments based solely on these models is that information on species ecological and life history traits is lacking. Accordingly, we developed a points-based framework for assessing species vulnerability to climate change that considered species traits together with the projections of SDMs. Applying this method to the Australian elapid snakes (family Elapidae), we determined which species may be particularly susceptible in the future and assessed broad-scale biogeographic patterns in species vulnerability. By offering a more comprehensive and rigorous method for assessing vulnerability than those based solely on SDMs, this framework provides greater justification for resource allocation, and can help guide decisions regarding the most appropriate adaptation strategies.","[Cabrelli, Abigail L.; Stow, Adam J.; Hughes, Lesley] Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia",Macquarie University,"Cabrelli, AL (corresponding author), Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia.",abby.cabrelli@gmail.com,,"Hughes, Lesley/0000-0003-0313-9780; Stow, Adam/0000-0002-6796-4854",Macquarie University Research Excellence Scholarship,Macquarie University Research Excellence Scholarship,"We thank the Australian Museum, the Western Australian Museum, the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery, the NSW Parks and Wildlife Service and the Australian National Wildlife Collection for access to their reptile locality records.

Several positive feedbacks, most notably related to vegetation, have been shown to have favored the northward migration of the desert boundary. During this period, numerous lakes and wetlands existed in the Sahara region and might have acted as a local moisture source. However, earlier model studies of the effects of open water surfaces on the mid-Holocene North African climate suggested that these were weak and did not contribute significantly to this northward migration of the North African climate zones. Using a state-of-the-art climate model, we suggest that the effect of open-water surfaces on the mid-Holocene North African climate might have been much stronger than previously estimated, regionally more than doubling the simulated precipitation rates. It is thus possible that this effect, combined to other known positive feedbacks, favored the appearance of the Green Sahara. Citation: Krinner, G., A.-M. Lezine, P. Braconnot, P. Sepulchre, G.

The topography of the management unit was relatively gentle and the forests were dominated by Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.). We incorporated a model relating the site index (SI) to the site productivity into the forest projection model FTM. Using estimated changes in the net primary production (NPP) due to climate change and assuming a relative change in NPP equal to a relative change in the site productivity, we simulated possible future states of the forest under gradual adjustment of SI in response to climate change. We estimated changes in NPP by combining the boreal-adapted BIOMASS model with four regional climate change scenarios calculated using the RCAO model for the period 2071-2100 and two control period scenarios for the period 1961-1990. The modified WINDA model was used to calculate the probability of wind damage for individual forest stands in simulated future states of the forest. The climate change scenarios used represent non-extreme projections on a 100-year time scale in terms of global mean warming. A 15-40% increase in NPP was estimated to result from climate change until the period 2071-2100. Increasing sensitivity of the forest to wind was indicated when the management rules of today were applied. A greater proportion of the calculated change in probability of wind damage was due to changes in wind climate than to changes in the sensitivity of the forest to wind. While regional climate scenarios based on the HadAM3H general circulation model (GCM) indicated no change (SRES A2 emission scenario) or a slightly reduced (SRES B2 emission scenario) probability of wind damage, scenarios based on the ECHAM4/OPYC3 GCM indicated increased probability of wind damage. The assessment should, however, be reviewed as the simulation of forest growth under climate change as well as climate change scenarios are refined.","[Blennow, Kristina; Andersson, Mikael; Bergh, Johan; Sallnas, Ola; Olofsson, Erika] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, So Swedish Forest Res Ctr, S-23053 Alnarp, Sweden",Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences,"Blennow, K (corresponding author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, So Swedish Forest Res Ctr, POB 49, S-23053 Alnarp, Sweden.",Kristina.Blennow@ess.slu.se,"Bergh, Johan/R-4501-2016; Blennow, Kristina/D-7388-2016","Bergh, Johan/0000-0003-4723-1626; Blennow, Kristina/0000-0002-7602-5322",Swedish Research Council Formas; Lansforsakringsbolagens forskningsfond; Mistra,Swedish Research Council Formas(Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council Formas); Lansforsakringsbolagens forskningsfond; Mistra,"The authors would like to acknowledge Magnus Mossberg, Southern Swedish Forest Research Centre, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences for programming assistance, and the Rossby Centre of the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute for providing climate change scenario data.

These measurements reveal multidecadal tropospheric warming and stratospheric cooling, punctuated by short-term volcanic signals of reverse sign. Similar long-and short-term temperature signals occur in model simulations driven by human-caused changes in atmospheric composition and natural variations in volcanic aerosols. Most previous comparisons of modeled and observed atmospheric temperature changes have used results from individual models and individual observational records. In contrast, we rely on a large multimodel archive and multiple observational datasets. We show that a human-caused latitude/altitude pattern of atmospheric temperature change can be identified with high statistical confidence in satellite data. Results are robust to current uncertainties in models and observations. Virtually all previous research in this area has attempted to discriminate an anthropogenic signal from internal variability. Here, we present evidence that a human-caused signal can also be identified relative to the larger total natural variability arising from sources internal to the climate system, solar irradiance changes, and volcanic forcing. Consistent signal identification occurs because both internal and total natural variability (as simulated by state-of-the-art models) cannot produce sustained global-scale tropospheric warming and stratospheric cooling. Our results provide clear evidence for a discernible human influence on the thermal structure of the atmosphere.","[Santer, Benjamin D.; Painter, Jeffrey F.; Bonfils, Celine; Gleckler, Peter J.; Doutriaux, Charles; Taylor, Karl E.] Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, Program Climate Model Diag & Intercomparison, Livermore, CA 94550 USA; [Mears, Carl A.; Wentz, Frank J.] Remote Sensing Syst, Santa Rosa, CA 95401 USA; [Solomon, Susan] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Wigley, Tom M.

Fire activity is controlled by a number of biophysical factors, including climate, whose relevance varies across regions and landscapes. In light of the ongoing climate change, understanding the fire-climate relationships is an issue of current interest in order to identify the most vulnerable regions. Building upon recent global observations of burned areas and climate, we investigate the sensitivity of fire activity to fire-weather across the world's major biomes. We identify the biomes susceptible to inter-annual fire-weather fluctuations, unveiling a non-linear relationship with a saturation threshold past which the area burned can be considered insensitive to increasing fire-weather. Our results depict an unambiguous spatial pattern that identifies the world regions where short-term climate fluctuations are unlikely to produce any significant effect on current fire activity, and those most sensitive to fire-weather changes. In particular, the boreal forests and extensive areas of tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests (excluding Africa) as well as sizeable areas of temperate broadleaf forests are identified as highly sensitive. We then present near-future fire-weather scenarios (period 2026-2045) using a state-of-the-art ensemble or Earth System Models (ESMs) from the CMIP5 database, considering a moderate and a high emission scenario (RCPs 4.5 and 8.5). The projected anomalies in fire-weather for the vulnerable temperate biomes are small in magnitude and their direction is either negative or just slightly positive, although significant differences in the projected probability density functions suggest that disruptions of fire regimes may occur locally. Other sensitive ecosystems, like the rain forests of the Amazon basin may experience a significant increment in fire-weather that may result in severe impacts on fire regimes as a direct consequence of climate change in the next decades.

Although climate change adaptation is being mainstreamed in Thailand, a well-organized overview of the impacts of climate change and potential adaptation measures has been unavailable to date. Here we present a comprehensive review of climate-change impact studies that focused on the Thai water sector, based on a literature review of six sub-sectors: riverine hydrology, sediment erosion, coastal erosion, forest hydrology, agricultural hydrology, and urban hydrology. Our review examined the long-term availability of observational data, historical changes, projected changes in key variables, and the availability of economic assessments and their implications for adaptation actions. Although some basic hydrometeorological variables have been well monitored, specific historical changes due to climate change have seldom been detected. Furthermore, although numerous future projections have been proposed, the likely changes due to climate change remain unclear due to a general lack of systematic multi-model and multi-scenario assessments and limited spatiotemporal coverage of the study area. Several gaps in the research were identified, and ten research recommendations are presented. While the information contained herein contributes to state-of-the-art knowledge on the impact of climate change on the water sector in Thailand, it will also benefit other countries on the Indochina Peninsula with a similar climate.","[Kiguchi, Masashi; Matsumoto, Kyoko] Univ Tokyo, Inst Ind Sci, Tokyo, Japan; [Takata, Kumiko; Hanasaki, Naota] Natl Inst Environm Studies, Ctr Climate Change Adaptat, Ibaraki, Japan; [Takata, Kumiko] Azabu Univ, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Sagamihara, Kanagawa, Japan; [Archevarahuprok, Boonlert] Thai Meteorol Dept, Bangkok, Thailand; [Champathong, Adisorn] Royal Irrigat Dept, Bangkok, Thailand; [Ikoma, Eiji] Univ Tokyo, Earth Observat Data Integrat & Fus Res Initiat, Tokyo, Japan; [Jaikaeo, Chaiporn; Piamsa-Nga, Napaporn; Raksapatcharawong, Mongkol; Rangsiwanichpong, Prem; Ritphring, Sompratana; Suanpaga, Weerakaset; Kiatiwat, Thanya] Kasetsart Univ, Fac Engn, Bangkok, Thailand; [Kaewrueng, Sudsaisin] Kasetsart Univ, Fac Agr, Bangkok, Thailand; [Kanae, Shinjiro] Tokyo Inst Technol, Tokyo, Japan; [Kazama, So] Tohoku Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan; [Kuraji, Koichiro] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Agr & Life Sci, Tokyo, Japan; [Nakamura, Shinichiro] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Engn, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan; [Nguyen-Le, Dzung; Yamada, Tomohito] Hokkaido Univ, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan; [Noda, Keigo] Gifu Univ, Fac Appl Biol Sci, Gifu, Japan; [Shirakawa, Hiroaki] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Environm Studies, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan; [Somphong, Chatuphorn; Udo, Keiko] Tohoku Univ, Int Res Inst Disaster Sci, Tohoku, Miyagi, Japan; [Srisutham, Mallika] Khon Kaen Univ, Fac Agr, Khon Kaen, Thailand; [Suanburi, Desell] Kasetsart Univ, Fac Sci, Bangkok, Thailand; [Tebakari, Taichi] Toyama Prefectural Univ, Fac Engn, Toyama, Japan; [Trisurat, Yongyut] Kasetsart Univ, Fac Forestry, Bangkok, Thailand; [Wongsa, Sanit] King Mongkuts Univ Technol, Fac Ind Educ & Technol, Bangkok, Thailand; [Yoshida, Koshi] Ibaraki Univ, Fac Agr, Ibaraki, Japan; [Oki, Taikan] United Nat Univ, Tokyo, Japan; [Oki, Taikan] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Engn, Tokyo, Japan",University of Tokyo; National Institute for Environmental Studies - Japan; Azabu University; University of Tokyo; Kasetsart University; Kasetsart University; Tokyo Institute of Technology; Tohoku University; University of Tokyo; Nagoya University; Hokkaido University; Gifu University; Nagoya University; Tohoku University; Khon Kaen University; Kasetsart University; Toyama Prefectural University; Kasetsart University; King Mongkuts University of Technology North Bangkok; King Mongkuts University of Technology Thonburi; Ibaraki University; United Nations University; University of Tokyo,"Kiguchi, M (corresponding author), Univ Tokyo, Inst Ind Sci, Tokyo, Japan.",kiguchi@iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Hanasaki, Naota/C-2932-2009; Rangsiwanichpong, Prem/GXF-4107-2022; Oki, Taikan/E-5778-2010; Udo, Keiko/AAN-1610-2021; Nakamura, Shinichiro/ACF-3536-2022; Kanae, Shinjiro/E-5606-2010; Kiguchi, Masashi/GQP-0111-2022; Raksapatcharawong, Mongkol/AAH-6562-2021","Hanasaki, Naota/0000-0002-5092-7563; Rangsiwanichpong, Prem/0000-0002-1663-3537; Oki, Taikan/0000-0003-4067-4678; Udo, Keiko/0000-0003-0293-1354; Kanae, Shinjiro/0000-0002-3176-4957; Kiguchi, Masashi/0000-0002-8952-6855; TAKATA, Kumiko/0000-0003-4622-8927; Somphong, Chatuphorn/0000-0003-2965-0720; Nguyen-Le, Dzung/0000-0003-0214-3411","Japan Science and Technology Agency/Japan International Cooperation Agency; Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development (JST/JICA, SATREPS)","Japan Science and Technology Agency/Japan International Cooperation Agency(Japan Science & Technology Agency (JST)); Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development (JST/JICA, SATREPS)","This research was supported partially by the Japan Science and Technology Agency/Japan International Cooperation Agency, and the Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development (JST/JICA, SATREPS).",,202,13,13,7,23,IOP Publishing Ltd,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1748-9326,,,ENVIRON RES LETT,Environ.

The paper describes the method for calculating the economic potential of efficient district heating (DH) in Austria under different scenarios, assuming the full decarbonisation of the heating sector by 2050. A spatially explicit approach is used to derive heat demand density maps, heat distribution costs and potential DH areas. The obtained areas are clustered, and depending on their potential spreads, up to four supply portfolios on the installed generation capacities are assessed in each cluster. While this method maintains the level of detail, it significantly reduces the number of required sensitivity analyses. Finally, the least cost portfolios of DH supply in each cluster are identified and compared with the costs of individual heat supply. The economic potential of DH by 2050 is calculated accordingly. The analyses revealed that the DH market share within DH areas is the main driver of DH competitiveness. Depending on the scenario, the economic DH potential varies between 13% and 50% of space and water heating demand in Austria. The extensive application of renewable gases in this sector was not economically feasible under any scenario.","[Fallahnejad, Mostafa; Buechele, Richard; Hasani, Jeton; Kranzl, Lukas; Mascherbauer, Philipp] TU Wien, Inst Energy Syst & Elect Drives Energy Econ Grp, Gusshausstr 25-29-370-3, A-1040 Vienna, Austria; [Habiger, Jul; Hummel, Marcus; Mueller, Andreas; Schmidinger, David; Mayr, Bernhard] E Think Energy Res, Argentinierstr 18-10, A-1040 Vienna, Austria",Technische Universitat Wien,"Fallahnejad, M (corresponding author), TU Wien, Inst Energy Syst & Elect Drives Energy Econ Grp, Gusshausstr 25-29-370-3, A-1040 Vienna, Austria.",fallahnejad@eeg.tuwien.ac.at; buechele@eeg.tuwien.ac.at; habiger@e-think.ac.at; hasani@eeg.tuwien.ac.at; hummel@e-think.ac.at; kranzl@eeg.tuwien.ac.at; mascherbauer@eeg.tuwien.ac.at; mueller@e-think.ac.at; schmidinger@e-think.ac.at; mayr@e-think.ac.at,,"Fallahnejad, Mostafa/0000-0003-4078-1596; Kranzl, Lukas/0000-0003-3350-7134",Austrian Ministry of Climate Action; TU Wien Bibliothek,Austrian Ministry of Climate Action; TU Wien Bibliothek,This paper is part of the work funded by the Austrian Ministry of Climate Action in the frame of the reporting obligation of Art 14 of the EED.

Several phases of anthropogenic impact were observed. (i) Between 7.6 and 6.5 ka cal BP, synanthropic taxa (Urtica dioica type, Plantago lanceolata type) and coprophilous fungi (e.g. Sporormiella-type) are indicative of early (pre-agricultural) creation of small patches of pasture using fire, possibly for incipient animal husbandry or as part of a deliberate strategy to improve game availability. Such activities only had a minor effect on the deciduous Quercus-dominated forest established earlier during the Holocene Thermal Maximum. (ii) Between 5.9 and 4.8 ka cal BP a more intense signal indicative of pastoral activity was detected, corresponding to the Neolithic period. (iii) Between 4.8 and 3.4 ka cal BP, which fits within the hypothetical timeframe of petroglyph creation, the synanthropic and humidity (e.g. Cyperaceae, Mougeotia) indicators diminished while charcoal concentration increased, which can be explained by Mid-Holocene cooling/drying (Neoglaciation) in combination with reduced human impact, or by non-pastoral activities in the area possibly in association with the development of the rock art culture, converting pasture to protected open ground through anthropogenic fires. (iv) During the Late Bronze Age and Early Iron Age (3.4-2.5 ka cal BP), grazing pressure and fire regime intensity are high, coinciding with evidence of regional forest regression, despite an amelioration in climate. (v) Later phases, not corresponding to prehistoric rock art contexts, include a phase of heavy grazing and reduced fire frequency (from ca. 2.5 to 1.2 ka cal BP) as well as the near complete elimination of the deciduous woodland, the expansion of ericaceous shrubland and the evidence of local agriculture and afforestation. These results are consistent with earlier studies in the area and highlight the spatial heterogeneity in the vegetation especially during periods of prehistoric anthropogenic interference.

The models were integrated with observed forcing for the period 1850-2000 as part of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report. All models show enhanced variability at multi-decadal time scales in the North Atlantic sector similar to the observations, but with a large intermodel spread in amplitudes and frequencies for both the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) and the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). The models, in general, are able to reproduce the observed geographical patterns of warm and cold episodes, but not the phasing such as the early warming (1930s-1950s) and the following colder period (1960s-1980s). This indicates that the observed 20th century extreme in temperatures are due to primarily a fortuitous phasing of intrinsic climate variability and not dominated by external forcing. Most models show a realistic structure in the overturning circulation, where more than half of the available models have a mean overturning transport within the observed estimated range of 13-24 Sverdrup. Associated with a stronger than normal AMOC, the surface temperature is increased and the sea ice extent slightly reduced in the North Atlantic. Individual models show potential for decadal prediction based on the relationship between the AMO and AMOC, but the models strongly disagree both in phasing and strength of the covariability. This makes it difficult to identify common mechanisms and to assess the applicability for predictions.","[Medhaug, I.] Univ Bergen, Inst Geophys, Bergen, Norway; Univ Bergen, Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, Bergen, Norway",University of Bergen; Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research; University of Bergen,"Medhaug, I (corresponding author), Univ Bergen, Inst Geophys, Bergen, Norway.",iselin.medhaug@gfi.uib.no,,"Medhaug, Iselin/0000-0002-1115-8896; Furevik, Tore/0000-0002-1668-2785",Research Council of Norway,Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway),"The project has been supported by the Research Council of Norway through the NorClim project, and is also contributing to the BIAC and DecCen projects.

Through this analysis, the ideological relationships among speakers providing Congressional testimony on the issue of climate change are mapped. For the first time, issue stances of actors are systematically aggregated in order to measure coalitions and consensus among political actors in American climate politics in a relational way. Our findings show how consensus formed around the economic implications of regulating greenhouse gases and the policy instrument that should do the regulating. The paper is separated into three sections. First, we review the ways scholars have looked at climate change policymaking in the United States, paying particular attention to those who have looked at the issue within the US Congress. Next, we present analysis of statements made during Congressional hearings on climate change over a four-year period. Our analysis demonstrates how a polarized ideological actor space in the 109(th) Congress transforms into a more consensual actor landscape in the 110(th) Congress, which is significantly less guided by partisan differences.

Six state-of-the-art RCMs were constrained with common reanalysis lateral boundary forcing and upper troposphere nudging techniques to explore how the RCMs represented the evolution of the surface energy budget (SEB) components and their relation to cloud properties. We find that the main reasons for the modeled differences in the SEB components are a direct consequence of the RCM treatment of cloud and cloud-radiative interactions. The RCMs could be separated into groups by their overestimation or underestimation of cloud liquid. While radiative and turbulent heat flux errors were relatively large, they often invoke compensating errors. In addition, having the surface sea-ice concentrations constrained by the reanalysis or satellite observations limited how errors in the modeled radiative fluxes could affect the SEB and ultimately the surface evolution and its coupling with lower tropospheric mixing and cloud properties. Many of these results are consistent with RCM biases reported in studies over a decade ago. One of the six models was a fully coupled ocean-ice-atmosphere model. Despite the biases in overestimating cloud liquid, and associated SEB errors due to too optically thick clouds, its simulations were useful in understanding how the fully coupled system is forced by, and responds to, the SEB evolution. Moving forward, we suggest that development of RCM studies need to consider the fully coupled climate system.","[Sedlar, Joseph; Cassano, John; Seefeldt, Mark; Solomon, Amy] Univ Colorado, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Sedlar, Joseph] NOAA, Global Monitoring Div, Earth Syst Res Lab, Boulder, CO 80305 USA; [Tjernstrom, Michael] Stockholm Univ, Dept Meteorol, Stockholm, Sweden; [Tjernstrom, Michael] Stockholm Univ, Bert Bolin Ctr Climate Res, Stockholm, Sweden; [Rinke, Annette; Matthes, Heidrun] Helmholtz Ctr Polar & Marie Res, Alfred Wegener Inst, Potsdam, Germany; [Orr, Andrew; Phillips, Tony] British Antarct Survey, Natl Environm Res Council, Cambridge, England; [Cassano, John] Univ Colorado, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Fettweis, Xavier] Univ Liege, Dept Geog, Liege, Belgium; [Heinemann, Guenther] Univ Trier, Dept Environm Meteorol, Trier, Germany; [Solomon, Amy] NOAA, Phys Sci Div, Earth Syst Res Lab, Boulder, CO USA; [Webster, Stuart] Met Off, Exeter, Devon, England","University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Stockholm University; Stockholm University; Helmholtz Association; Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar & Marine Research; UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); NERC British Antarctic Survey; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; University of Liege; Universitat Trier; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Met Office - UK","Sedlar, J (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.;Sedlar, J (corresponding author), NOAA, Global Monitoring Div, Earth Syst Res Lab, Boulder, CO 80305 USA.",joseph.sedlar@colorado.edu,"Seefeldt, Mark W/D-3121-2011; Sedlar, Joseph/AAD-1060-2022; Matthes, Heidrun/N-1833-2018; Rinke, Annette/B-4922-2014","Seefeldt, Mark W/0000-0003-0719-2570; Sedlar, Joseph/0000-0003-3101-9401; Matthes, Heidrun/0000-0001-9913-7696; Phillips, Tony/0000-0002-3058-9157; Rinke, Annette/0000-0002-6685-9219; CASSANO, JOHN/0000-0003-3176-3978; Tjernstrom, Michael/0000-0002-6908-7410; Fettweis, Xavier/0000-0002-4140-3813","Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) [03F0776D]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) within the Transregional Collaborative Research Center ArctiC Amplification: Climate Relevant Atmospheric and SurfaCe Processes, and Feedback Mechanisms (AC)3 [268020496-TRR 172]; NOAA/ESRL Physical Science Division; Regional and Global Model Analysis (RGMA) component of the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Science","Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) within the Transregional Collaborative Research Center ArctiC Amplification: Climate Relevant Atmospheric and SurfaCe Processes, and Feedback Mechanisms (AC)3(German Research Foundation (DFG)); NOAA/ESRL Physical Science Division; Regional and Global Model Analysis (RGMA) component of the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Science(United States Department of Energy (DOE))","We thank the ECMWF for making reanalysis products freely available.

However, they are vulnerable to climate change, for example through shorter durations of ice cover, or through rising lake surface temperatures. Here we use a one-dimensional numerical lake model to assess climate change impacts on mixing regimes in 635 lakes worldwide. We run the lake model with input data from four state-of-the-art model projections of twenty-first-century climate under two emissions scenarios. Under the scenario with higher emissions (Representative Concentration Pathway 6.0), many lakes are projected to have reduced ice cover; about one-quarter of seasonally ice-covered lakes are projected to be permanently ice-free by 2080-2100. Surface waters are projected to warm, with a median warming across lakes of about 2.5 degrees C, and the most extreme warming about 5.5 degrees C. Our simulations suggest that around 100 of the studied lakes are projected to undergo changes in their mixing regimes. About one-quarter of these 100 lakes are currently classified as monomictic-undergoing one mixing event in most years- and will become permanently stratified systems. About one-sixth of these are currently dimictic-mixing twice per year- and will become monomictic. We conclude that many lakes will mix less frequently in response to climate change.","[Woolway, R.

In order to provide thermally comfortable and healthy environment for the occupants, the design on architectural form is found to be an effective solution on improving indoor thermal comfort of naturally ventilated gymnasiums. Therefore, a new perspective regarding optimization of naturally ventilated gymnasiums is proposed in the aspect of the architectural form. This paper presents the optimization of architectural form in naturally ventilated gymnasiums in which simulation and orthogonal experiment methods are combined. Through numerical simulation with FlowDesigner software, the significance of architectural form affecting indoor thermal comfort has been given, and the optimal architectural forms of naturally ventilated gymnasium are determined. The results show that the roof insulation type is the most significant factor influencing indoor thermal comfort; thus, it should be considered primarily in optimization. Moreover, the range analysis and variance analysis reveal the rankings of the factors for the gymnasium thermal comfort. In addition, it is demonstrated that the optimal gymnasium model, when compared with the initial gymnasium model, has a satisfactory effect on improving the indoor thermal comfort, as the average value of Predicted Thermal Sensation (PTS) in August decreased from 1.11 (Slightly hot) to 0.86 (Comfortable). This study provides a new insight for the designers in optimizing the architectural form of gymnasiums for achieving the indoor thermal comfort at hot and humid climate.","[Huang, Xiaodan] Guangdong Univ Technol, Sch Art & Design, Guangzhou 510090, Peoples R China; [Huang, Xiaodan; Zhang, Qingyuan; Tanaka, Ineko] Yokohama Natl Univ, Inst Urban Innovat, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2408501, Japan",Guangdong University of Technology; Yokohama National University,"Huang, XD (corresponding author), Guangdong Univ Technol, Sch Art & Design, Guangzhou 510090, Peoples R China.;Huang, XD (corresponding author), Yokohama Natl Univ, Inst Urban Innovat, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2408501, Japan.",dandyhuang@163.com; cho-seigen-jc@ynu.ac.jp; itanaka@ynu.ac.jp,,,"Youth Foundation of Guangdong University of Technology, China [17ZK0008]","Youth Foundation of Guangdong University of Technology, China","This research was funded by the Youth Foundation of Guangdong University of Technology, China (Grant No.17ZK0008).

To the extent mean temperature increases, insect populations accelerate deforestation. This alters climate via the loss of active carbon sequestration by live trees and increased carbon release from decomposing dead trees. A self-sustaining positive feedback loop can then emerge. Extensive field recordings demonstrate that bioacoustic communication plays a role in infestation dynamics and is likely to be a critical link in the feedback loop.

This bioenergy with CCS (BECCS) technology facilitates the achievement of the long-term temperature goal of the Paris Agreement. Here, we use five state-of-the-art Earth system models (ESMs) to explore the consequences of large-scale BECCS deployment on the climate-carbon cycle feedbacks under the CMIP6 SSP5-3.4-0S overshoot scenario keeping in mind that all these models use generic crop vegetation to simulate BECCS. First, we evaluate the land cover representation by ESMs and highlight the inconsistencies that emerge during translation of the data from integrated assessment models (IAMB) that are used to develop the scenario. Second, we evaluate the land-use change (LUC) emissions of ESMs against bookkeeping models. Finally, we show that an extensive cropland expansion for BECCS causes ecosystem carbon loss that drives the acceleration of carbon turnover and affects the CO2 fertilization effect- and climate-change-driven land carbon uptake. Over the 2000-2100 period, the LUC for BECCS leads to an offset of the CO2 fertilization effect-driven carbon uptake by 12.2 % and amplifies the climate-change-driven carbon loss by 14.6 %. A human choice on land area allocation for energy crops should take into account not only the potential amount of the bioenergy yield but also the LUC emissions, and the associated loss of future potential change in the carbon uptake. The dependency of the land carbon uptake on LUC is strong in the SSP5-3.4-OS scenario, but it also affects other Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) scenarios and should be taken into account by the IAM teams. Future studies should further investigate the trade-offs between the carbon gains from the bioenergy yield and losses from the reduced CO2 fertilization effect-driven carbon uptake where BECCS is applied.","[Melnikova, Irina; Boucher, Olivier; Cadule, Patricia] Sorbonne Univ, Inst Pierre Simon Laplace IPSL, CNRS, Paris, France; [Melnikova, Irina; Tanaka, Katsumasa; Vuichard, Nicolas; Ciais, Philippe] Univ Paris Saclay, Lab Sci Climat & Environnement LSCE, Commissariat Energie Atom & Energies Alternat, CEA,CNRS,UVSQ,IPSL, Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Tanaka, Katsumasa; Shiogama, Hideo; Tachiiri, Kaoru; Yokohata, Tokuta] Natl Inst Environm Studies NIES, Earth Syst Div, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Gasser, Thomas] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal IIASA, Laxenburg, Austria; [Hajima, Tomohiro; Tachiiri, Kaoru] Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, Res Inst Global Change, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan; [Quilcaille, Yann] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, Zurich, Switzerland; [Seferian, Roland] Univ Toulouse, CNRM, CNRS, Toulouse, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Universite Paris Cite; CEA; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Cite; Universite Paris Saclay; National Institute for Environmental Studies - Japan; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science & Technology (JAMSTEC); Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Toulouse,"Melnikova, I (corresponding author), Sorbonne Univ, Inst Pierre Simon Laplace IPSL, CNRS, Paris, France.;Melnikova, I (corresponding author), Univ Paris Saclay, Lab Sci Climat & Environnement LSCE, Commissariat Energie Atom & Energies Alternat, CEA,CNRS,UVSQ,IPSL, Gif Sur Yvette, France.",irina.melnikova@lsce.ipsl.fr,"Shiogama, Hideo/B-9598-2012; Yokohata, Tokuta/N-4540-2019; Tanaka, Katsumasa/B-8528-2013; Tachiiri, Kaoru/G-7607-2011; Quilcaille, Yann/GYR-1010-2022; Séférian, Roland/ABD-5465-2021; Gasser, Thomas/E-9815-2018; Boucher, Olivier/K-7483-2012","Shiogama, Hideo/0000-0001-5476-2148; Yokohata, Tokuta/0000-0001-7346-7988; Tanaka, Katsumasa/0000-0001-9601-6442; Quilcaille, Yann/0000-0002-1474-0144; Séférian, Roland/0000-0002-2571-2114; Gasser, Thomas/0000-0003-4882-2647; Boucher, Olivier/0000-0003-2328-5769; Melnikova, Irina/0000-0002-4352-191X","Agence Nationale de la Recherche [ANR-19-MPGA-0008]; Horizon 2020 (CONSTRAIN) [820829]; Agence de la transition ecologique; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology [JPMXD0717935715]; Environmental Restoration and Conservation Agency [JPMEERF20192004]","Agence Nationale de la Recherche(French National Research Agency (ANR)); Horizon 2020 (CONSTRAIN); Agence de la transition ecologique; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); Environmental Restoration and Conservation Agency","This research has been supported by the Agence Nationale de la Recherche (grant no.

This CAFE-60 submission satisfied, at least, the minimum requirements for the CSC to become a Global Producing Centre for Annual-to-Decadal Climate Prediction (GPC-ADCP) of the WMO Lead Centre for Annual-to-Decadal Climate Prediction. In practical terms, this has meant running the CAFE-60 version 1 modelling system for years 1960-2020, or a 61-year set, with a modest ensemble size of 10. Each decade-long forecast was initialised from the beginning of each November using a state-of-the-art assimilation methodology, and delivering the minimum requested data to the coordinating centre within the UKMO. The number 60 in CAFE-60 refers to the initial year of the assimilation, 1960, where we believe there is adequate observational data to produce a meaningful reanalysis output product for wide scientific application. This document describes the key features of the CAFE-60 assimilation and forecasting system, the climate and forecasting conforming post-processed datasets along with how to access the datasets via the CSIRO Data Access Portal, and the quality control measures implemented to achieve the highest possible data quality and delivery. Part of becoming a Data Producing Centre is the ongoing need to supply CAFE-60 forecast data, at least on an ongoing annual basis, to the UKMO; therefore, obtaining CAFE-60 operational status requires significant ongoing resources and efforts to continue. In addition to the annual dataset submission by the DCFP as a minimum requirement of being declared a Data Contributing Centre, a separate application from the Australian Permanent Representative with WMO (Dr Andrew Johnson) was required to obtain the GPCP status; this was completed in early September 2020, making CSIRO one of only five centres with this special GPC-ADCP status currently in the world.","[Collier, Mark A.; Kitsios, Vassili] CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere, Melbourne, Vic 3195, Australia; [O'Kane, Terence J.; Sandery, Paul A.] CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere, Hobart, Tas 7004, Australia; [Kitsios, Vassili] Monash Univ, Dept Mech & Aerosp Engn, Lab Turbulence Res Aerosp & Combust, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia",Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Monash University,"Collier, MA (corresponding author), CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere, Melbourne, Vic 3195, Australia.",mark.collier@csiro.au,"O'Kane, Terence J/B-1655-2009; Kitsios, Vassili/A-3141-2012; Collier, Mark/D-2663-2013","O'Kane, Terence J/0000-0002-2137-5915; Kitsios, Vassili/0000-0002-2543-0264; Collier, Mark/0000-0003-1391-9473",Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) Decadal Climate Forecasting Project,Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) Decadal Climate Forecasting Project,This work was supported by the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) Decadal Climate Forecasting Project (https://research.csiro.au/dfp).,,9,0,0,0,1,CSIRO PUBLISHING,CLAYTON,"UNIPARK, BLDG 1, LEVEL 1, 195 WELLINGTON RD, LOCKED BAG 10, CLAYTON, VIC 3168, AUSTRALIA",,2206-5865,,J SO HEMISPH EARTH,J.

Here we use state-of-the-art climate model ensembles from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) and present that the amplitude of the precipitation variability, relative to slowly varying mean precipitation, coherently increases with Delta(P) over bar, anchored over the central equatorial Pacific where a large SST swing occurs during El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycles. This increase owes to skewed probability distribution of precipitation as well as an asymmetrical precipitation response to positive and negative in situ SST anomalies and is robust despite uncertainty in the future ENSO amplitude change. The CMIP5 model ensembles also give a robust estimate of the projected Delta(P) over bar over the central equatorial Pacific, showing a 7% increase per unit increase of global-mean surface temperature. Observational constraints applied to the above relationship suggest that the amounts of increases in both mean precipitation and variability should be even larger than the model averages.","[Watanabe, Masahiro; Kimoto, Masahide] Univ Tokyo, Atmosphere & Ocean Res Inst, Kashiwa, Chiba, Japan; [Kamae, Youichi] Natl Inst Environm Studies, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan",University of Tokyo; National Institute for Environmental Studies - Japan,"Watanabe, M (corresponding author), Univ Tokyo, Atmosphere & Ocean Res Inst, Kashiwa, Chiba, Japan.",hiro@aori.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Kamae, Youichi/L-6694-2013; Watanabe, Masahiro/G-8228-2017; kimoto, masahide/P-9077-2014","Kamae, Youichi/0000-0003-0461-5718; ","MEXT, Japan; Mitsui Environment Fund [C-042]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [22106005] Funding Source: KAKEN","MEXT, Japan(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); Mitsui Environment Fund; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","We acknowledge the modeling groups, the Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison (PCMDI), and the WCRP's Working Group on Coupled Modeling (WGCM) for their efforts in making the CMIP5 multimodel data set available.

In this study, we utilized ENM to directly and independently reconstruct the Mid-Holocene distribution of the desert bighorn sheep, using rock art as an alternative source of past distributional information, in order to gain a better understanding of changes in the distribution of this species over the last 6,000 years. Location North American deserts. Taxon Desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis nelsoni). Methods We used 225 current locality records, eight bioclimatic variables from WorldClim and 57 past locality records based on rock art, in combination with CCSM4 and MIROC-ESM scenarios for the Mid-Holocene, to reconstruct via ENM the present and past ecological niches and geographic distribution of the species. For modelling ecological niches, we used Maxent, and the models were evaluated using a partial ROC test. We used a niche similarity test to compare present and past reconstructions, performing niche transfers to measure their inter-predictability, supported by a previous Mobility Oriented Parity test of climate analogy. Results The performances of the potential distribution models for the Mid-Holocene and present were statistically significant and describe a recent increase in the species' distributional areas, suggesting that past conditions were characterized by higher temperatures and lower precipitation, as was corroborated by the niche transfers. The niche similarity test showed no differences between the past and present niches. Main conclusions The models generated from rock art allowed a consistent reconstruction of the ecological niches and present and past distributions of the species. We therefore consider rock art to be a valuable, but hitherto largely ignored, source of information for this species. Analysis of current and past distributions revealed how the species have responded to past climatic changes.","[Gamez-Brunswick, Carolina; Rojas-Soto, Octavio] Inst Ecol AC, Lab Bioclimatol, Red Biol Evolut, Km 2-5 Antigua Carretera Coatepec 351, Xalapa 91070, Veracruz, Mexico",Instituto de Ecologia - Mexico,"Rojas-Soto, O (corresponding author), Inst Ecol AC, Lab Bioclimatol, Red Biol Evolut, Km 2-5 Antigua Carretera Coatepec 351, Xalapa 91070, Veracruz, Mexico.",octavio.rojas@inecol.mx,,"Gamez Brunswick, Carolina/0000-0002-8877-6908; Rojas-Soto, Octavio/0000-0002-0201-1454",Mexican Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT),Mexican Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)),"We thank Joaquin Arroyo, Sonia Gallina, Andres Lira, Juan Parra and Javier Nori for their valuable comments.

Hence the rich and varied tradition didn't get their due importance in the prevailing texts dealing with the history of Indian art. This paper hence attempts to come up with a comprehensive account on the same in order to enable a broader perspective of Indian art and enhance the scopes of further research and discoveries.

Why online adaptation databases may fail to catalyze adaptation action,WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-CLIMATE CHANGE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,COMMUNICATION; FRAMEWORK; SCIENCE; MEDIA; ART,"Over the last decade a plethora of action-oriented research projects has been conducted in developing countries, exploring how to effectively adapt to the anticipated impacts of climate change. Many intergovernmental agencies and development organizations have chosen to disseminate their research results via online databases. It is unclear, however, whether these databases are useful in terms of actual adaptation planning and implementation. A systematic review of online databases has found at least 64 databases and tools online related to climate change adaptation. Despite the abundance of databases, this analysis reveals that the existing body of online databases generally lack the structure and mechanics to identify, extract, and synthesize both effective and ineffective climate change adaptation practices, projects, programs, and policies. Even relatively basic information, such as identification of projects' projected versus actual costs is absent, which are crucial decision-making criteria particularly in developing country contexts where resource constraints are significant. In this paper we evaluate these online tools with a focus on identifying features that potentially could contribute to knowledge sharing and successful exchange of climate change adaptation projects and practices within a developing country context. We conclude the paper with recommendations for how to improve efforts to communicate climate change research, such as more nuanced needs assessments of potential users of databases.

Global climate models typically assume that major climatic changes occur synchronously over continental to hemispheric distances. The last major reorganization of the ocean-atmosphere system in the North Atlantic realm took place during the Younger Dryas (YD), an similar to 1100 yr cold period at the end of the last glaciation. Within this region, several terrestrial records of the YD show at least two phases, an initial cold phase followed by a second phase of climatic amelioration related to a resumption of North Atlantic overturning. We show that the onset of climatic amelioration during the YD cold period was locally abrupt, but time-transgressive across Europe. Atmospheric proxy signals record the resumption of thermohaline circulation midway through the Younger Dryas, occurring 100 yr before deposition of ash from the Icelandic Vedde eruption in a German varve lake record, and 20 yr after the same isochron in western Norway, 1350 km farther north. Synchronization of two high-resolution continental records, using the Vedde Ash layer (12,140 +/- 40 varve yr B. P.), allows us to trace the shifting of the polar front as a major control of regional climate amelioration during the YD in the North Atlantic realm.

Our investigation uses the state-of-the-art regional climate model WRF to produce the six-member, multi-physics ensembles. Results show that our model setup simulates a realistic cyclone track and the transition from an initial disturbance to a tropical-like cyclone with a deep warm core. However, the simulated transition occurs earlier than for the observed medicane. The response of the medicane to future climate change is investigated with a pseudo global warming (PGW) approach. This is the first application of the PGW framework to medicanes. The PGW approach adds a climate change delta (defined as difference between future and present climate) to WRF's boundary conditions which is obtained for all prognostic variables using the mean change in an ensemble of CMIP5 simulations. A PGW simulation where the climate change delta is added to all prognostic variables (PGW(ALL)) shows that most of the medicane characteristics moderately intensify, e.g. surface wind speed, uptake of water vapour, and precipitation. However, the minimum sea level pressure (SLP) is almost identical to that under present climate conditions. Two additional PGW simulations were undertaken; One simulation adds the projected change in sea surface and skin temperature only (PGW(SST)) while the second simulation adds the PGW changes to only atmospheric variables (PGW(ATMS)); i.e. we use present-day sea surface temperatures. These simulations show opposing responses of the medicane. In PGW(SST), the medicane is more intense than PGW(ALL) as indicated by lower SLP values, the stronger surface wind, and the more intense evaporation and precipitation. In contrast, the medicane in PGW(ATMS) still transitions into a tropical-like cyclone with a deep warm core, but the PGW(ATMS) medicane weakens considerably (SLP, surface wind, and rainfall decrease). This difference can be explained by an increase in water vapour driven by the warmer ocean surface (favourable for cumulus convection). The warmer and drier atmosphere in PGW(ATMS) tends to inhibit condensation (unfavourable for cumulus convection). The warmer ocean and warmer atmosphere have counteracting effects which leads to only a modest enhancement of the medicane by global warming. The novel approach in this study provides new insights into the different roles of warming of the ocean and atmosphere in medicane development.","[Koseki, Shunya] Univ Bergen, Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, Geophys Inst, Bergen, Norway; [Mooney, Priscilla A.] NORCE Norwegian Res Ctr AS, Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, Bergen, Norway; [Cabos, William] Univ Alcala, Dept Fis & Matemat, Alcala De Henares, Spain; [Angel Gaertner, Miguel] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Fac Environm Sci & Biochem, Toledo, Spain; [de la Vara, Alba] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Environm Sci Inst, Toledo, Spain; [Jesus Gonzalez-Aleman, Juan] Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Fis Tierra & Astrofis, Madrid, Spain; [de la Vara, Alba] Univ Politecn Madrid, Dept Matemat Aplicada Ingn Ind, ETSI Ind, Madrid, Spain",Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research; University of Bergen; Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research; Norwegian Research Centre (NORCE); Universidad de Alcala; Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha; Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha; Complutense University of Madrid; Universidad Politecnica de Madrid,"Koseki, S (corresponding author), Univ Bergen, Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, Geophys Inst, Bergen, Norway.",shunya.koseki@gfi.uib.no,"Gaertner, Miguel Angel/ABH-1938-2020; DE LA VARA, ALBA/AAA-7409-2021; Cabos Narvaez, William David/L-7374-2014","Gaertner, Miguel Angel/0000-0001-9909-8826; DE LA VARA, ALBA/0000-0001-8877-6361; Cabos Narvaez, William David/0000-0003-3638-6438; Gonzalez-Aleman, Juan Jesus/0000-0001-5940-7356",IBERTROPIC project [CGL2017-89583-R]; Norwegian High-Performance Computing Program [NS9039K]; Giner de los Rios 2018/2019; Giner de los Rios 2019/2020;  [BES_2014-067905];  [FJC2018-035821-I],IBERTROPIC project; Norwegian High-Performance Computing Program; Giner de los Rios 2018/2019; Giner de los Rios 2019/2020; ; ,"This study has been supported by IBERTROPIC project (grant agreement no.

Here we present three newly documented rock art sites in the Gobi-Altai Mountains of south-central Mongolia, a cave (Gazar Agui 1), a rock shelter (Gazar Agui 13) and an open-air landscape site overlooking a palaeolake (Unegt Uul). In addition, we re-examine the preservation of the rock art cave site of Saalit Agui some 20 years after its original documentation, using digital technology not available at that time. Comparisons of rock art at Gazar Agui 1 and Saalit Agui with previously documented rock art in Mongolia suggest links with Mesolithic and Neolithic anthropomorphic iconography. Unegt Uul and Gazar Agui 13 show Early Bronze Age to Iron Age symbols, suggesting two distinct periods of production, by hunter-gatherers during the Early Holocene and by later hunter-pastoralists during the Late Holocene. Our findings suggest that wet periods in mountainous basins of the Gobi-Altai were likely key to early human habitation, with pastoralism dominating during arid periods. Our observations further indicate that preservation of rock art sites in the region is currently under threat due to human activity and climate change.","[Vanwezer, Nils; Taylor, William Timothy Treal; Amano, Noel; Boivin, Nicole; Petraglia, Michael] Max Planck Inst Sci Human Hist, Dept Archaeol, Kahla Str 10, D-07745 Jena, Germany; [Taylor, William Timothy Treal] Univ Colorado, Museum Nat Hist, Henderson Bldg, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Bayarsaikhan, Jamsranjav] Natl Museum Mongolia, Ulaanbaatar 210646, Mongolia; [Breitenbach, Sebastian F.

Such downscaling methods should be robust and accurate (to handle, e.g., extreme events and uncertainties), but the noncontinuous and highly nonlinear nature of rainfall makes this task particularly challenging. This paper brings together and extends state-of-the-art methods into an integrated and robust probabilistic methodology to downscale local daily rainfall series from an ensemble of climate simulations. The downscaling is based on generalized linear models (GLMs) that relate monthly GCM-scale atmospheric variables to local-scale daily rainfall series. A cross-validation step ensures that the fitted models are correctly conditioned by the climate variables, and a statistical procedure is proposed to test whether the statistical relationships identified for the reference period also hold in a future perturbed climate (i.e., to test the stationarity assumption). Additionally, we propose a strategy to downweigh poorly performing GCM-GLM couples. The methodology is assessed at 27 locations covering Switzerland and is shown to perform well in reproducing historical rainfall statistics including extremes and interannual variability. Furthermore, the projections are consistent with the simulations of physically based dynamical models. Using an original visualization method based on heat maps, we show that although the downscaling models were fitted at each of the 27 sites independently, their projections follow a spatially coherent pattern and that regions exhibiting different climate change impacts can be identified.","[Beuchat, X.] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Lab Ecohydrol, Stn 2, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne,"Beuchat, X (corresponding author), Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Lab Ecohydrol, Stn 2, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",xavier.beuchat@epfl.ch; bettina.schaefli@epfl.ch; marc.soutter@epfl.ch; andre.mermoud@epfl.ch,"Schaefli, Bettina/B-2069-2010","Schaefli, Bettina/0000-0003-1140-6244","European FP6 project SWITCH; Swiss National Science Foundation; Office of Science, U.S. Department of Energy; EU","European FP6 project SWITCH; Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission); Office of Science, U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); EU(European Commission)","This study was carried out thanks to the financial support of the European FP6 project SWITCH.

This paper tests this viewpoint using state-of-the-art air-sea turbulent heat flux observational analyses and a climate model run at different resolutions. It is found that in midlatitude ocean frontal zones the variability of air-sea heat fluxes is not predominantly driven by the atmosphere variations but instead is forced by sea surface temperature (SST) variations arising from intrinsic oceanic variability. Meanwhile in most of the tropics and subtropics wind is the dominant driver of heat flux variability, and atmosphere humidity is mainly important in higher latitudes. The predominance of ocean forcing of heat fluxes found in frontal regions occurs on scales of around 700 km or less. Spatially smoothing the data to larger scales results in the traditional atmosphere-driving case, while filtering to retain only small scales of 5 degrees or less leads to ocean forcing of heat fluxes over most of the globe. All observational analyses examined (1 degrees OAFlux; 0.25 degrees J-OFURO3; 0.25 degrees SeaFlux) show this general behavior. A standard resolution (1 degrees) climate model fails to reproduce the midlatitude, small-scale ocean forcing of heat flux: refining the ocean grid to resolve eddies (0.1 degrees) gives a more realistic representation of ocean forcing but the variability of both SST and of heat flux is too high compared to observational analyses.","[Small, R.

The recent changes in accumulation rates and geochemical characteristics (grain size distribution, elemental composition, organic carbon and carbonate concentrations) recorded in a sediment core from San Jose Island Lagoon (SJIL, Gulf of California) were evaluated to determine its relationship with anthropogenic impacts and climatic variability. The Pb-210-derived chronology was corroborated with 239+240PU and (CS)-C-137 stratigraphic markers. The mass accumulation rate increased up to similar to 3 times during the past similar to 100 years (0.16 +/- 0.03 to 0.51 +/- 0.06 g cm(-2) yr(-1)). The contents of terrigenous and marine (salinity) indicator elements, as well as fine-grained sediments, also increased considerably, although no anthropization evidences were observed; indeed, the enrichment factor of trace elements indicated that the ecosystem is still a pristine environment. By using multivariate statistical techniques, we inferred that the larger input of fine-grained terrigenous sediments could be related to the enhancement of soil erosion from the catchment, under the influence of higher rainfall rates, especially during the last 20 years. In addition, the higher doncentrations of salinity indicator elements most likely resulted from higher evaporation rates in the lagoon, caused by higher minimum atmospheric temperatures. We concluded that recent climate variability has become the main driver for sedimentary geochemical changes in San Jose Island Lagoon.

The Reformed Church's continued repression of dissident views through civic means, including physical attacks, prompted explicit responses from artists such as Molenaer, Pynas and Moeyaert. But it is also possible to connect some broader developments in Dutch art of the period with the climate of tension and caution that resulted from the conflict: the retreat of tire sensual nude (after its Mannerist halcyon), the sudden increase in vanitas imagery and the related flourishing of depictions of the aged. Likely parallel to them was the rise of the tonal phase in Dutch art, which is here interpreted as a moralizing assertion of sobriety responding to, and pursuing a market in, a charged atmosphere of religious conflict. These developments also affected the work of Lievens and Rembrandt; with respect to nudity; depictions of the aged, and their adoption of snore muted palettes during the 1620s.",,,,,,,,,,,24,1,1,0,0,GEBR MANN VERLAG,BERLIN 61,"LINDENSTRASSE 76 POSTFACH 110303, W-1000 BERLIN 61, GERMANY",0075-2207,,,JAHRB BERLIN MUSEEN,Jahrb.

We developed a thermodynamic model to analyse the effects of environmental conditions on the system performance and power output during the year considering monthly changes in temperature, daylength and solar radiation using real climate and geographical data. The results showed that for a 30 m(2) dish collector aperture area, the cycle outlet power was estimated from 3.70 kW in winter to 9.87 kW in summer, while the lowest and the highest cycle efficiencies were 19.44% and 35.07%, respectively for sunny days. The performance of the cycle was also compared with different climates and latitudes in Toronto and Phoenix. The total efficiencies in Edmonton were similar as that in Phoenix in summer but much lower in winter. However, the total electricity output in summer was higher in Edmonton than other two cities. It is found that the highest electricity output in winter is only a half of that in summer day in Edmonton. Furthermore, the cycle could achieve the highest total daily electricity output and fuel consumption in Edmonton in summer due to longer daylength, and higher latitude despite a colder climate if including a combustion chamber. Particularly, more than a half day has no electricity output in Edmonton in winter day if without combustion chamber. Therefore, it demonstrates that this state-of-the-art hybrid system can produce electricity and recover heat in a cold climate region but the climate effects should be considered.","[Delavar, Mojtaba Aghajani; Wang, Junye] Athabasca Univ, Fac Sci & Technol, 1 Univ Dr, Athabasca, AB T9S 3A3, Canada",Athabasca University,"Wang, JY (corresponding author), Athabasca Univ, Fac Sci & Technol, 1 Univ Dr, Athabasca, AB T9S 3A3, Canada.",junyew@athabascau.ca,"Wang, Junye/AAG-6657-2019","Wang, Junye/0000-0001-5562-1400",Alberta Economic Development and Trade for Campus Alberta Innovation Program (CAIP) Research Chair [RCP-12-001-BCAIP],Alberta Economic Development and Trade for Campus Alberta Innovation Program (CAIP) Research Chair,This research was supported by the Alberta Economic Development and Trade for Campus Alberta Innovation Program (CAIP) Research Chair (No. RCP-12-001-BCAIP).,,34,2,2,0,1,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",1359-4311,,,APPL THERM ENG,Appl.

However, this upward trend needs to be balanced against recent pronounced SIE fluctuations occurring there. In the space of 3 years, the SIE sank from its highest value ever reached in September 2014 to record low in February 2017. In this work, a set of six state-of-the-art global climate models is used to evaluate the potential predictability of the Antarctic sea ice at such timescales. This first multi-model study of Antarctic sea ice predictability reveals that the ice edge location can potentially be predicted up to 3 years in advance. However, the ice edge location predictability shows contrasted seasonal performances, with high predictability in winter and no predictability in summer. The reemergence of the predictability from one winter to next is provided by the ocean through its large thermal inertia. Sea surface heat anomalies are stored at depth at the end of the winter and influences the sea ice advance the following year as they resurface. The effectiveness of this mechanism across models is found to depend upon the depth of the mixed layer. One should be very cautious about these potential predictability estimates as there is evidence that the Antarctic sea ice predictability is promoted by deep Southern Ocean convection. We therefore suspect models with excessive convection to show higher sea ice potential predictability results due to an incorrect representation of the Southern Ocean.","[Marchi, Sylvain; Fichefet, Thierry; Goosse, Hugues] Catholic Univ Louvain, Earth & Life Inst, Georges Lemaitre Ctr Earth & Climate Res, Louvain La Neuve, Belgium; [Zunz, Violette] Vrije Univ Brussel, Dept Geog, Brussels, Belgium; [Tietsche, Steffen; Day, Jonathan J.] European Ctr Medium Range Weather Forecasts, Reading, Berks, England; [Hawkins, Ed] Univ Reading, Dept Meteorol, NCAS Climate, Reading, Berks, England",Universite Catholique Louvain; Vrije Universiteit Brussel; European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF); UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); NERC National Centre for Atmospheric Science; University of Reading,"Marchi, S (corresponding author), Catholic Univ Louvain, Earth & Life Inst, Georges Lemaitre Ctr Earth & Climate Res, Louvain La Neuve, Belgium.",sylvain.marchi@uclouvain.be,"Hawkins, Ed/B-7921-2011; Tietsche, Steffen/F-7633-2015","Hawkins, Ed/0000-0001-9477-3677; Tietsche, Steffen/0000-0002-2961-0289","Natural Environment Research Council [ncas10009, NE/I029447/1] Funding Source: researchfish; NERC [NE/I029447/1] Funding Source: UKRI",Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),,,72,12,12,1,18,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0930-7575,1432-0894,,CLIM DYNAM,Clim.

However, a synoptic characterization of the influence of climate change on mesoscale stirring and transport in the surface ocean is missing. To bridge this gap, we exploit a high-resolution, fully coupled climate model of the Mediterranean basin using a Network Theory approach. We project significant increases of horizontal stirring and kinetic energies in the next century, likely due to increments of available potential energy. The future evolution of basin-scale transport patterns hints at a rearrangement of the main hydrodynamic provinces, defined as regions of the surface ocean that are well mixed internally but with minimal cross-flow across their boundaries. This results in increased heterogeneity of province sizes and stronger mixing in their interiors. Our approach can be readily applied to other oceanic regions, providing information for the present and future marine spatial planning. Plain Language Summary Transport and mixing of water masses driven by ocean currents influence a variety of fundamental processes, including heat redistribution, ecosystem functioning, and pollutants spreading. Therefore, understanding how fluid transport will be affected by climate change is crucial, in particular in the ocean surface, where marine life and human activities are concentrated. Here, we exploit a state-of-the-art climate model over the Mediterranean basin using a novel methodology which integrates Network Theory concepts with Lagrangian modeling. We assess past conditions and future changes at climatic scales of ocean stirring and transport over the entire basin. Our results reveal a significant increment of surface stirring linked to an increase of currents kinetic energy, which in turn could be ascribed to increments of available potential energy. We then provide a regionalization of the ocean surface based on hydrodynamic provinces that are well mixed internally but with little leaking across their boundaries. Our model project an increased heterogeneity of province sizes and a stronger mixing in their interiors, while their mean area and coherence remain unaffected. Our approach could be applied to other oceanic domains and help designing adaptive strategies for marine spatial planning.","[Ser-Giacomi, Enrico] MIT, Dept Earth Atmospher & Planetary Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Ser-Giacomi, Enrico; Thomsen, Soren; Mignot, Juliette] Sorbonne Univ, CNRS, LOCEAN IPSL, IRD,UMR 7159, Paris, France; [Jorda-Sanchez, Gabriel] Inst Espanol Oceanog, Ctr Oceanog Balears, Palma De Mallorca, Spain; [Soto-Navarro, Javier] IMEDEA UIB CSIC, Mediterranean Inst Adv Studies, Mallorca, Spain; [Sevault, Florence] Univ Toulouse, CNRS, CNRM, Meteo France, Toulouse, France; [Rossi, Vincent] Aix Marseille Univ, Mediterranean Inst Oceanog, Univ Toulon, UMR 7294,CNRS,UM 110,IRD, Marseille, France",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Earth Sciences & Astronomy (INSU); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle (MNHN); UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Universite Paris Cite; Spanish Institute of Oceanography; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Instituto Mediterraneo de Estudios Avanzados (IMEDEA); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Earth Sciences & Astronomy (INSU); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); UDICE-French Research Universities; Aix-Marseille Universite,"Ser-Giacomi, E (corresponding author), MIT, Dept Earth Atmospher & Planetary Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.;Ser-Giacomi, E (corresponding author), Sorbonne Univ, CNRS, LOCEAN IPSL, IRD,UMR 7159, Paris, France.",enrico.sergiacomi@gmail.com,"Rossi, Vincent/AAL-9090-2021","Rossi, Vincent/0000-0001-7291-0415; Soto-Navarro, Javier/0000-0003-0250-1397",European Commission [WACO 749699],European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre),"S.

However, the number of reports documenting other types of range shifts - such as in east-west directions across longitudes or, even more unexpectedly, towards tropical latitudes and lower elevations - is increasing rapidly. Recent studies show that these range shifts may not be so unexpected once the local climate changes are accounted for. We here provide an updated synthesis of the fast-moving research on climate-related range shifts. By describing the current state of the art on geographical patterns of species range shifts under contemporary climate change for plants and animals across both terrestrial and marine ecosystems, we identified a number of research shortfalls. In addition to the recognised geographic shortfall in the tropics, we found taxonomic and methodological shortfalls with knowledge gaps regarding range shifts of prokaryotes, lowland range shifts of terrestrial plants, and bathymetric range shifts of marine plants. Based on this review, we provide a research agenda for filling these gaps. We outline a comprehensive framework for assessing multidimensional changes in species distributions, which should then be contrasted with expectations based on climate change indices, such as velocity measures accounting for complex local climate changes. Finally, we propose a unified classification of geographical patterns of species range shifts, arranged in a bi-dimensional space defined by species' persistence and movement rates. Placing the observed and expected shifts into this bi-dimensional space should lead to more informed assessments of extinction risks.","[Lenoir, J.] Jules Verne Univ Picardie, CNRS, Plant Biodivers Lab,FRE3498, Unite Rech Ecol & Dynam Syst Anthropises EDYSAN, FR-80037 Amiens 1, France; [Svenning, J. -C.] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, Sect Ecoinformat & Biodivers, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Aarhus University,"Lenoir, J (corresponding author), Jules Verne Univ Picardie, CNRS, Plant Biodivers Lab,FRE3498, Unite Rech Ecol & Dynam Syst Anthropises EDYSAN, 1 Rue Louvels, FR-80037 Amiens 1, France.",jonathan.lenoir@u-picardie.fr,"Svenning, Jens-Christian/C-8977-2012; Lenoir, Jonathan/AAE-8441-2019","Svenning, Jens-Christian/0000-0002-3415-0862; Lenoir, Jonathan/0000-0003-0638-9582",European Research Council [ERC-2012-StG-310886-HISTFUNC]; Aarhus Univ.; Aarhus Univ.

However, there is relatively little attention paid to whether, should a dangerous temperature level be exceeded, it is feasible for the global temperature to then return to safer levels in a usefully short time. We focus on the timescales needed to reduce atmospheric greenhouse gases and associated temperatures back below potentially dangerous thresholds, using a state-of-the-art general circulation model. This analysis is extended with a simple climate model to provide uncertainty bounds. We find that even for very large reductions in emissions, temperature reduction is likely to occur at a low rate. Policy-makers need to consider such very long recovery timescales implicit in the Earth system when formulating future emission pathways that have the potential to 'overshoot' particular atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases and, more importantly, related temperature levels that might be considered dangerous.","[Lowe, J.

In the Coachella Valley, a desert region in Southern California, the warm and dry climate during winter months attracts seasonal visitors from Canada and northern US states (snowbirds). However, global warming may adversely impact the snowbird season and other tourist attractions through rising temperatures. We analyzed how increasing temperatures are likely to impact three key components of the tourism industry in the region: climate in the winter snowbird season, visitation at an outdoor tourist attraction, and the likelihood of extreme heat at an annual festival. We used statistically downscaled climate models to make predictions about future visitation to the region by calculating changing probabilities of extreme heat during the tourist season and local events. Our analysis predicts a shortened snowbird season, which we define as the time of year with daily maximum temperatures below a threshold of 30 degrees C, under two future climate scenarios and time periods. We find a nonlinear relationship between daily maximum temperatures and daily zoo visits, where visitation sharply declines after a threshold of 30 degrees C. Using this threshold, we predict a decrease in zoo visitation by up to 18% and a shortening of the snowbird season by up to 36% by the end of the century. We also predict an increased likelihood of extreme heat stress during the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival.","[Yanez, Cindy C.] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Phys & Astron, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Yanez, Cindy C.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Hopkins, Francesca M.; Porter, William C.] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Environm Sci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA",University of California System; University of California Riverside; University of California System; University of California Irvine; University of California System; University of California Riverside,"Yanez, CC (corresponding author), Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Phys & Astron, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.;Yanez, CC (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",ccyanez@uci.edu,"Porter, William/AAO-7389-2021","/0000-0002-3121-8323; Yanez, Cindy/0000-0003-1521-2906",National Science Foundation's Graduate Research Fellowship Program; University of California's Chancellor's Research Fellowship,National Science Foundation's Graduate Research Fellowship Program(National Science Foundation (NSF)); University of California's Chancellor's Research Fellowship,This research was supported by the National Science Foundation's Graduate Research Fellowship Program and the University of California's Chancellor's Research Fellowship.,,46,3,3,3,25,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

I use a generalized additive model to downscale winter rainfall from a state-of-the-art paleoclimate simulation. The model performs well at reproducing the present-day pattern of rainfall in the northeastern Mediterranean, and it generates physically-interpretable estimates of past rainfall consistent with global and regional proxy records of early Holocene climate. Comparing modeled rainfall with Neolithic settlement patterns reveals spatially-heterogeneous regional impacts of this period of global aridification. Only the humid regions of the Aegean coast experienced major drought, while more inland zones temporarily experienced more rainfall. The result of this spatially heterogeneous climate event was, conversely, more homogeneous regional rainfall. Neolithic colonists from southwest Asia would have encountered new landscapes with a more familiar, and predictable, precipitation regime. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Despite limited documentation of potential future releases associated with thawing permafrost and degassing methane hydrates, the large potential for future methane releases calls for improved understanding of the interaction of a changing climate with processes in the Arctic and chemical feedbacks in the atmosphere. Here we apply a state of the art atmospheric chemistry transport model to show that large emissions of CH4 would likely have an unexpectedly large impact on the chemical composition of the atmosphere and on radiative forcing (RF). The indirect contribution to RF of additional methane emission is particularly important. It is shown that if global methane emissions were to increase by factors of 2.5 and 5.2 above current emissions, the indirect contributions to RF would be about 250% and 400%, respectively, of the RF that can be attributed to directly emitted methane alone. Assuming several hypothetical scenarios of CH4 release associated with permafrost thaw, shallow marine hydrate degassing, and submarine landslides, we find a strong positive feedback on RF through atmospheric chemistry. In particular, the impact of CH4 is enhanced through increase of its lifetime, and of atmospheric abundances of ozone, stratospheric water vapor, and CO2 as a result of atmospheric chemical processes. Despite uncertainties in emission scenarios, our results provide a better understanding of the feedbacks in the atmospheric chemistry that would amplify climate warming.","[Isaksen, Ivar S.

The most biased models overestimate solar incoming radiation, because of cloud deficit and have difficulty to sustain evaporation. These deficiencies are also involved in the spread of the summer temperature projections among models in the midlatitude; the models which simulate a higher-than-average warming overestimate the present climate net shortwave radiation which increases more-than-average in the future, in link with a decrease of cloudiness. They also show a higher-than-average reduction of evaporative fraction in areas with soil moisture-limited evaporation regimes.

To shed light on the role of urban surfaces in fostering climate resilient and sustainable cities, this paper proposes a catalogue of solutions for the urban surface use. The catalogue presents the main surface uses suitable for the built environment, and discusses the potential conflicts and synergies among them in the view of a multiple and integrated utilization of urban surfaces. Reviewing studies published in the last 15 years, this study aims to answer three major questions: (i) which solutions do exist, (ii) where can these be applied, and (iii) which benefits do they provide. The discussion demonstrates that the use of urban surfaces might lead the development of multiple opportunities for improving the existing urban environments and supporting not only environmental, but also social and economic resilience. Finally, it emphasizes the need for specific quantitative and qualitative approaches to address the multi-disciplinary challenges posed by the design and implementation of surface uses, and the evaluation of their contribution to site-specific objectives.","[Croce, Silvia; Vettorato, Daniele] EURAC Res, Inst Renewable Energy, Bolzano, Italy; [Croce, Silvia] Univ Padua, Dept Civil Environm & Architectural Engn, Padua, Italy",European Academy of Bozen-Bolzano; University of Padua,"Croce, S (corresponding author), EURAC Res, Inst Renewable Energy, Bolzano, Italy.;Croce, S (corresponding author), Univ Padua, Dept Civil Environm & Architectural Engn, Padua, Italy.",silvia.croce@eurac.edu,,"VETTORATO, DANIELE/0000-0002-5482-1723; Croce, Silvia/0000-0003-1345-8769",,,,,237,8,8,8,39,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2210-6707,2210-6715,,SUSTAIN CITIES SOC,Sust.

This study aims to evaluate the effect of various facade systems with cool materials on the thermal behavior and energy performance of a typical existing office building in a hot climate. The proposed hybrid retrofit method combines design and energy retrofit strategies while evaluating the effects of different workspace layouts and facade systems on external surface temperatures and total energy consumption. Applying such a method, the most optimal design and energy retrofit strategies were selected using a combination of optimization and scenario-based approaches.

Specifically, the authors consider how youth of color engage the educational context of an 11th grade English language arts (ELA) class as a basis for (re)imagining their history, culture and themselves to construct counter-narratives away from framing their lived educational experiences as failures, deficient and depicted in damage-centered (Tuck, 2009) ways. The research engages the process and challenges of creating this type of space within a school setting, as well as examining the ways in which students envision these locations. Design/methodology/approach Critical ethnography centered the emphasis on youth engagement for social change, as well as the inquiry on how the classroom space was constructed, shared and navigated by the students and ourselves (Madison, 2005). In addition, the research design reflects critical ethnography through the use of prolonged participation in the field (nine and half months), a focus on culture (specifically school and classroom culture/climate) and a critical theory-based framework [hybridity, third space and youth participatory action research (YPAR)]. Findings Three major themes emerged from the data that demonstrate how instructors and students collectively engaged in a third space through the YPAR project. These themes include developing an ethic of care with students and among instructors, cultivating an atmosphere of social justice awareness and the contrast of the classroom space with the wider-Hillside Vocational High School environment. Originality/value The study engages the use of YPAR within a high school class that became a unique space for students to learn and develop. The ELA class did not just reflect adding the first space and second space together or merging the two. Instead, it seemed to demonstrate the creation of a new type of space or the development of a third space. In this space, students could bring and bridge their out-of-school and in-school experiences to develop new knowledge and ways of seeing the world.","[Green, Keisha L.; Morales Morales, Daniel] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Teacher Educ & Curriculum Studies, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [George Mwangi, Chrystal; Bettencourt, Genia M.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Educ Policy Res & Adm, Amherst, MA 01003 USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst,"Green, KL (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Dept Teacher Educ & Curriculum Studies, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",klgreen@umass.edu; demorale@educ.umass.edu; chrystal@umass.edu; gbettenc@umass.edu,"Bettencourt, Genia M./O-3814-2016","Bettencourt, Genia M./0000-0003-4663-3631",,,,,44,2,2,1,5,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1175-8708,,,ENGL TEACH-PRACT CRI,Eng.

The cause has often been assumed to be the eruption of Mount Tambora in April 1815, however this link has not, until now, been proven. Here we apply state-of-the-art event attribution methods to quantify the contribution by the eruption and random weather variability to this extreme European summer climate anomaly. By selecting analogue summers that have similar sea-levelpressure patterns to that observed in 1816 from both observations and unperturbed climate model simulations, we show that the circulation state can reproduce the precipitation anomaly without external forcing, but can explain only about a quarter of the anomalously cold conditions. We find that in climate models, including the forcing by the Tambora eruption makes the European cold anomaly up to 100 times more likely, while the precipitation anomaly became 1.5-3 times as likely, attributing a large fraction of the observed anomalies to the volcanic forcing. Our study thus demonstrates how linking regional climate anomalies to large-scale circulation is necessary to quantitatively interpret and attribute post-eruption variability.","[Schurer, Andrew P.; Hegerl, Gabriele C.; Cowan, Tim; Tett, Simon F.

These impacts may be exacerbated by climate and socio-economic changes. Resilience thinking has become an important way for city planners and decision makers to manage flood risks. Despite different definitions of resilience, a consistent theme is that flood resilient cities are impacted less by extreme flood events. Therefore, flood risk professionals and planners need to understand flood impacts to build flood resilient cities. This paper presents a state-of-the-art literature review on flood impact assessment in urban areas, detailing their application, and their limitations. It describes both techniques for dealing with individual categories of impacts, as well as methodologies for integrating them.

In this study, we tested the hypothesis that temporal trends and interannual variability in seabird indicators reflect simultaneously occurring bottom-up (climatic) and competitor (pink salmon) forcing of food webs. To test this hypothesis, we derived multivariate seabird indicators for the Bering Sea-Aleutian Island (BSAI) ecosystem and related them to physical and biological conditions known to affect pelagic food webs in the ecosystem. We examined covariance in the breeding biology of congeneric pelagic gulls (kittiwakes Rissa tridactyla and R. brevirostris) and auks (murres Uria aalge and U. lomvia), all of which are abundant and well-studied in the BSAI. At the large ecosystem scale, kittiwake and murre breeding success and phenology (hatch dates) covaried among congeners, so data could be combined using multivariate techniques, but patterns of response differed substantially between the genera. While data from all sites (n = 5) in the ecosystem could be combined, the south eastern Bering Sea shelf colonies (St. George, St. Paul, and Cape Peirce) provided the strongest loadings on indicators, and hence had the strongest influence on modes of variability. The kittiwake breeding success mode of variability, dominated by biennial variation, was significantly related to both climatic factors and potential competitor interactions. The murre indicator mode was interannual and only weakly related to the climatic factors measured. The kittiwake phenology indicator mode of variability showed multi-year periods (stanzas) of late or early breeding, while the murre phenology indicator showed a trend towards earlier timing. Ocean climate relationships with the kittiwake breeding success indicator suggest that early-season (winter-spring) environmental conditions and the abundance of pink salmon affect the pelagic food webs that support these seabirds in the BSAI ecosystem.

Our findings showed that the indoor climate in all the investigated historic rural houses needs improvement. The room temperature was mainly too low during winter. Leaky houses had also a larger vertical temperature difference. The relative humidity in the unheated and periodically heated houses was high during winter and caused risk for mould growth in 17% of all houses and 33% of unheated houses. Significant differences of indoor humidity loads in different houses were revealed depending on the living density and usage profile. During the winter period, the design value of moisture excess was 4-5g/m(3) and the average moisture load was 2-3.5g/m(3). The indoor humidity load in historic houses was similar to that in modern houses. The results of the questionnaire showed that main problems were related to unstable or too low temperatures. At the same time, inhabitants rated the overall indoor climate as healthy and no statistically important relations were found between average indoor temperature and complaints about too cold or too warm indoor temperatures.","[Alev, Uellar; Kalamees, Targo; Arumaegi, Endrik] Tallinn Univ Technol, Bldg Phys & Energy Efficiency, EE-19086 Tallinn, Estonia; [Arumaegi, Endrik; Donarelli, Anna; Brostrom, Tor] Uppsala Univ, Dept Art Hist Conservat, S-62167 Visby, Sweden; [Eskola, Lari; Jokisalo, Juha; Siren, Kai] Aalto Univ, Dept Energy Technol, Aalto 00076, Finland",Tallinn University of Technology; Uppsala University; Aalto University,"Alev, U (corresponding author), Tallinn Univ Technol, Bldg Phys & Energy Efficiency, Ehitajate Tee 5, EE-19086 Tallinn, Estonia.",ullar.alev@ttu.ee,"Siren, Kai E/C-7941-2012; Broström, Tor/AAG-5751-2021; Kalamees, Targo/B-4245-2009","Arumagi, Endrik/0000-0001-8404-7639; Kalamees, Targo/0000-0002-1424-6154",,,,,65,0,0,0,44,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-8628,1758-9622,,ARCHIT SCI REV,Archit.

J,"Jones, G",,,,"Jones, Gavin",,,"To a God Unknown: Drought, Climate, and Race in the West",STEINBECK REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,Steinbeck; drought; race; magical realism,,"To a God Unknown (1933) has typically been viewed as one of John Steinbeck's most problematic works, not least because of the novel's apparently jarring mixture of realistic and fantastic elements. This article reevaluates Steinbeck's early novel by placing it in the context of emergent ideas about race and about climate-and indeed, about the links between race and climate-in the American West. To a God Unknown is best understood not as a failed early novel but as an experimental work that attempts to fuse realist and symbolic modes in ways parallel to the genre of magical realism, which first developed in post-Expressionist art from the 1920s, and flowered in Latin American writing from the 1960s. By exploring Steinbeck's thinking during his composition of the novel, particularly his interest in race psychopathology and his reading of Ellsworth Huntington's Civilization and Climate (1915), we discover how To a God Unknown's magical realism marks a pioneering attempt to understand and represent the aridity and drought that define the climate of the West and have profound implications for the kind of civilization it can sustain. Through formal analysis in historical context, the essay attempts to lay the groundwork for further considerations of Steinbeck as a writer of the Anthropocene whose works are continuous with the environmental and racial critique associated with later writers of the Global South.","[Jones, Gavin] Stanford Univ, Humanities, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Stanford University,"Jones, G (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Humanities, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",,,,,,,,29,3,3,0,1,PENN STATE UNIV PRESS,UNIVERSITY PK,"820 NORTH UNIV DRIVE, U S B 1, STE C, UNIVERSITY PK, PA 16802 USA",1546-007X,1754-6087,,STEINBECK REV,Steinbeck Rev.,,2017,1,,,,1,22,,,,,,22,"Literature, American",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Literature,FB2PN,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000405985800002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Specifically, six case studies of DTs are compared, illustrating their application, content, technological infrastructure, and priority results. The projects presented provide an overview of the existing DT typologies, focusing on the evaluative/prefigurative use and the limits/potential of the tool in light of the socio-health, climate, and environmental crises. Reflections on DT reveal, on the one hand, its potential role in supporting decision-making and participatory processes and, on the other, the potential utopian trend of data-driven planning encouraged by public-private investments in the smart city/twin city sector. In conclusion, the study underlines the innovative role of DT as a cutting-edge scientific format in the disciplinary framework but highlights that the practical use of the tool is still in an experimental research-action phase. From this theoretical-critical review, it is possible to hypothesise new research paths to implement the realism and application potential of DTs for urban planning and urban governance.","[Caprari, Giorgio; Camardelli, Marialucia] Univ Camerino, Sch Architecture & Design, I-63100 Ascoli Piceno, Italy; [Castelli, Giordana; Malvezzi, Roberto] Res Natl Council CNR, Dept Engn ICT & Technol Energy & Transport DIITET, I-00185 Rome, Italy; [Montuori, Marco] Res Natl Council CNR, Inst Complex Syst ISC, I-00185 Rome, Italy",University of Camerino; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto dei Sistemi Complessi (ISC-CNR),"Caprari, G (corresponding author), Univ Camerino, Sch Architecture & Design, I-63100 Ascoli Piceno, Italy.",giorgio.caprari@unicam.it,,"Caprari, Giorgio/0000-0002-9263-8292","Ministry of Economic Development (MISE, Italy) [prot.G.0010812/2020-U-]; National Institute of Urbanism (INU-Italy) [prot_65562_06102021]","Ministry of Economic Development (MISE, Italy); National Institute of Urbanism (INU-Italy)","This research is framed within CTEMT Project financed by the Ministry of Economic Development (MISE, Italy) with convention prot.G.0010812/2020-U-, 5 February 2020, signed between the MISE and the Municipality of Matera (Basilicata Region, Italy).

There is no single recipe for greening urban economies and increasing their environmental change resilience, but effective and flexible governance appears important. Many green economic measures can potentially promote prosperity and environmental resilience in different urban contexts. The links are complex and sometimes problematic. Conflicts of vision, interest and strategy may be deep-seated, leading to delays, sub-optimal outcomes or failure. Sometimes, too, unintended consequences adversely affect accessibility or equity. This article surveys the state of the art in relation to African towns and cities, illustrated with pertinent examples.

The most notable feature of the differences between the control and doubled carbon dioxide climates is in the distribution of cloud-water in the mixed-phase temperature band. The difference is greatest at mid and high latitudes. We found that the amount of cloud lee in the mixed phase layer in the control climate largely determines how much the cloud-water distribution changes for the doubled carbon dioxide climate. Therefore evaluation of the cloud ice distribution by comparison with data is important for future climate sensitivity studies. Cloud ice and cloud liquid both decrease in the layer below the melting layer, but only cloud liquid increases in the mixed-phase layer. Although the decrease in cloud-water below the melting layer occurs at all latitudes, the increase in cloud liquid in the mixed-phase layer is restricted to those latitudes where there is a large amount of cloud ice in the mixed-phase layer. If the cloud ice in the mixed-phase layer is concentrated at high latitudes, doubling of carbon dioxide might shift the center of cloud water distribution poleward which could decrease solar reflection because solar insolation is less at higher latitude. The magnitude of this poleward shift of cloud water appears to be larger for the higher climate sensitivity models, and it is consistent with the associated changes in cloud albedo forcing. For the control climate there is a clear relationship between the differences in cloud-water and relative humidity between the different models, for both magnitude and distribution. On the other hand the ratio of cloud ice to cloud-water follows the threshold temperature which is determined in each model. Improved measurements of relative humidity could be used to constrain the modeled representation of cloud water. At the same time, comparative analysis in global cloud resolving model simulations is necessary for further understanding of the relationships suggested in this paper.","JAMSTEC, FRCGC, Kanazawa Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2360001, Japan; NIES, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; Univ Tokyo, CCSR, Chiba, Japan; Met Off, Hadley Ctr Climate Predict & Res, Exeter, Devon, England; Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Miami, FL 33149 USA; Univ Illinois, Dept Atmospher Sci, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; Univ Michigan, Dept Atmospher Ocean & Space Sci, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science & Technology (JAMSTEC); National Institute for Environmental Studies - Japan; University of Tokyo; Met Office - UK; Hadley Centre; University of Miami; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Tsushima, Y (corresponding author), JAMSTEC, FRCGC, Kanazawa Ku, 3173-25 Showamachi, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2360001, Japan.",tsussi@jamstec.go.jp,"Ringer, Mark/E-7294-2013; Andronova, Natalia/I-8983-2012; Emori, Seita/D-1950-2012; Soden, Brian/ABC-3659-2021; 小倉, 知夫/I-3502-2018","Ringer, Mark/0000-0003-4014-2583; Soden, Brian/0000-0001-9693-8236",,,,,34,141,141,0,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0930-7575,1432-0894,,CLIM DYNAM,Clim.

We also show that statistical modelling of the trends in future ozone works well in reproducing the model output between 1900 and 2050. However, beyond 2050, and especially under large climate change scenarios, the statistical model results are in poorer agreement with the fully interactive Earth system model output. This suggests that additional processes occurring in the Earth system model such as changes in the production of ozone at higher temperatures or changes in the influx of ozone from the stratosphere, which are not captured by the statistical model, have a first order impact on the evolution of surface ozone over the twenty-first century. We show in a series of idealized box model simulations, with two different chemical schemes, that changes in temperature lead to diverging responses between the schemes. This points at the chemical mechanisms as being a source of uncertainty in the response of ozone to changes in temperature, and so climate, in the future. This underscores the need for more work to be performed to better understand the response of ozone to changes in temperature and constrain how well this relationship is simulated in models.

Much of this interest is driven by the notion that global climate change might alter tropical cyclone frequency or intensity, and that this response will in turn have important social impacts. Here, we summarize recent advances in our understanding of both these linkages. We summarize the current state of the art for research on the link between tropical cyclones and climate at various timescales, from subseasonal to anthropogenic warming, using models of the global atmosphere and ocean. Improvements in computational capabilities have enabled the representation of tropical cyclones in these models to become much more realistic, primarily by increasing models' horizontal resolution, although there remain deficiencies in storm intensity. We also discuss the capability of the current models to forecast tropical cyclone activity at subseasonal and seasonal timescales. Our current understanding of the possible changes in tropical cyclone activity under global climate change is summarized and the remaining challenges are highlighted. We then turn to recent progress in the quantitative modeling of tropical cyclones' socioeconomic impact. Advances in geospatial analysis have enabled researchers to link meteorological observations with socioeconomic data, allowing them to measure the effect that tropical cyclone exposure has on numerous human outcomes. New studies generally find that the social impact of tropical cyclones, both financially and using alternative measures of well-being, are larger than previously thought. While questions still outnumber results in this young field, several findings open the door for innovative strategies to manage tropical cyclone risk and losses in both current and future climates.","[Camargo, Suzana J.] Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY 10964 USA; [Hsiang, Solomon M.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Goldman Sch Publ Policy, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",Columbia University; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Camargo, SJ (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY 10964 USA.",,"Camargo, Suzana J./C-6106-2009","Camargo, Suzana J./0000-0002-0802-5160",,,,,322,8,8,0,2,BLACKWELL SCIENCE PUBL,OXFORD,"OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0EL, ENGLAND",,,978-1-119-15704-5; 978-1-119-15701-4,GEOPHYS MONOGR,,,2016,,,,,303,342,,,,,,40,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Book Citation Index – Science (BKCI-S),Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,BJ0BD,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000416605400019,View Full Record in Web of Science

Given the agricultural economy of the continent, a seasonal perspective is adopted as it is more pertinent than an annual-average one, which can mask offsetting but agriculturally sensitive seasonal hydroclimate variations. Examination of linear trends in seasonal surface air temperature (SAT) shows that heat stress has increased in several regions, including Sudan and northern Africa where the largest SAT trends occur in the warm season. Broadly speaking, the northern continent has warmed more than the southern one in all seasons. Precipitation trends are varied but notable declining trends are found in the countries along the Gulf of Guinea, especially in the source region of the Niger River in West Africa, and in the Congo River basin. Rainfall over the African Great Lakes-one of the largest freshwater repositories-has, however, increased. It is shown that the Sahara Desert has expanded significantly over the twentieth century, by 11%-18% depending on the season, and by 10% when defined using annual rainfall. The expansion rate is sensitively dependent on the analysis period in view of the multidecadal periods of desert expansion (including from the drying of the Sahel in the 1950s-80s) and contraction in the 1902-2013 record, and the stability of the rain gauge network. The desert expanded southward in summer, reflecting retreat of the northern edge of the Sahel rainfall belt, and to the north in winter, indicating potential impact of the widening of the tropics. Specific mechanisms for the expansion are investigated. Finally, this observational analysis is used to evaluate the state-of-the-art climate simulations from a comparison of the twentieth-century hydroclimate trends. The evaluation shows that modeling regional hydroclimate change over the African continent remains challenging, warranting caution in the development of adaptation and mitigation strategies.","[Thomas, Natalie; Nigam, Sumant] Univ Maryland, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Nigam, Sumant] Natl Acad Sci Engn & Med, Washington, DC 20001 USA","University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; National Academies of Sciences, Engineering & Medicine","Nigam, S (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.;Nigam, S (corresponding author), Natl Acad Sci Engn & Med, Washington, DC 20001 USA.",nigam@umd.edu,,"Thomas, Natalie/0000-0002-6433-7257",Department of Defense (DoD) through the National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship (NDSEG) Program; U.S. National Science Foundation [AGS 1439940],Department of Defense (DoD) through the National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship (NDSEG) Program; U.S. National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),NT was supported by the Department of Defense (DoD) through the National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship (NDSEG) Program.

Within agricultural systems, farmers have the option of significantly transforming their practices, or migrating elsewhere in the search for a better lifestyle (and exiting the agricultural socio-ecological system). However, if governments, communities and industry leaders are to provide climate change impact support to agricultural regions, then it becomes critical to predict the conditions under which farmers, households and communities will choose to either transform their farming or migrate. We hypothesize that those conditions are likely to reflect environmental, economic and social conditions within a region, where some communities and/or some farmers may respond differently depending on their environmental, economic and social factors. Here, we examine how the perception of farmers to transformational change is influenced by social, environmental and economic factors in six villages within the Famenin County of western Iran, which have experienced a notable recent decrease in groundwater levels, an increase in temperature due to reduced rainfall and no support from government. Results show that environmental, economic and social factors were all important influences on the social transformations that were occurring within each village and across the region. In sum, environmental flexibility and local corporation eased the transformation process. Place attachment and social capital were critical to facilitate transformation during all parts of the transformation process. These results are discussed as two separate scenarios.","[Khanian, Mojtaba; Salimi, Marziyeh] Islamic Azad Univ, Hamedan Branch, Young Researchers & Elite Club, Hamadan, Iran; [Marshall, Nadine] CSIRO, Land & Water, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Zakerhaghighi, Kianoosh] Islamic Azad Univ, Fac Art & Architecture, Dept Urban Planning, Hamedan Branch, Hamadan, Iran; [Naghdi, Asadollah] Bu Ali Sina Univ, Fac Econ & Social Sci, Dept Social Sci, Hamadan, Iran",Islamic Azad University; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Islamic Azad University; Bu Ali Sina University,"Khanian, M (corresponding author), Islamic Azad Univ, Hamedan Branch, Young Researchers & Elite Club, Hamadan, Iran.",khanian.mojtaba@gmail.com,"Khanian, Mojtaba/AAA-1141-2022; Zakerhaghighi, Kianoosh/Z-2086-2019","Khanian, Mojtaba/0000-0002-4867-9927; Zakerhaghighi, Kianoosh/0000-0002-7963-0499; Naghdi, Asadollah/0000-0002-6403-6948",,,,,74,15,15,0,12,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-0947,,,WEATHER CLIM EXTREME,Weather Clim.

They consist of policy instruments that target different actors and address multiple goals across several policy sectors and levels. The analysis of these complex arrangements extends beyond purely technical efficiency criteria, as several sources of tension between instruments may be identified, such as conflicting interests, goals, and approaches to implementation. The proliferation of governance networks complicates the understanding of actors' interactions, the types of authority influencing the outcomes of policy mixes, and importance of different levels of governance. This article provides a framework to address these analytical challenges, particularly the interconnected networks of policy actors and policy instruments. It draws on polycentric governance literature to analyse how power matters in policy networks. This includes identifying distinct types of power, actors' position, and variables that explain patterns of conflict, competition, convergence, and divergence in policy choices and outcomes. The framework is applied to the climate and land use policies implemented in the state of Mato Grosso, Brazil. Several methods were used to clarify these variables and to characterise policy mixes being implemented in the region, including social network analysis.","[Milhorance, Carolina; Bursztyn, Marcel; Sabourin, Eric] Univ Brasilia CSD UnB, Ctr Sustainable Dev, Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Sabourin, Eric] MUSE Montpellier, CIRAD, Umr ART Dev, Montpellier, France",CIRAD; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Paul-Valery; Universite Perpignan Via Domitia; Universite de Montpellier,"Milhorance, C (corresponding author), Univ Brasilia CSD UnB, Ctr Sustainable Dev, Rua IsidDutra,445 Casa 08 Sambaqui, BR-88051010 Florianopolis, SC, Brazil.",cmilhorance@gmail.com,"Bursztyn, Marcel/F-9921-2012; Milhorance, Carolina/AAY-4743-2020","Milhorance, Carolina/0000-0002-3290-8596; SABOURIN, Eric/0000-0002-1171-2535",European Commission-Horizon 2020 Research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska Curie [691053]; Instituto Nacional de Ciencia e Tecnologia (project INCT) [16-2014 ODISSEIA]; French Association Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) under project ARTIMIX [ANR-17-CE03-0005],European Commission-Horizon 2020 Research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska Curie; Instituto Nacional de Ciencia e Tecnologia (project INCT); French Association Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) under project ARTIMIX(French National Research Agency (ANR)),"The project leading to this publication has received funding from the European Commission-Horizon 2020 Research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska Curie [grant number 691053], from Instituto Nacional de Ciencia e Tecnologia (project INCT no 16-2014 ODISSEIA), and from the French Association Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) under project ARTIMIX No ANR-17-CE03-0005.",,47,9,9,9,37,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1523-908X,1522-7200,,J ENVIRON POL PLAN,J.

These maps were produced from the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service climate variables dataset that contains hourly air temperature raster data for 100 European cities (2008-2017), namely Lisbon and part of its metropolitan area. Over 610 0 0 maps (20 08-2014) were extracted in NetCDF format and processed in geographic-information-systems (GIS). An urban mask was created from the recently updated Local Climate Zones (LCZ) classification for this area and a cell of the LCZ class Low Plants (non-urban) was chosen to calculate the temperature difference. UHI intensity was estimated using an R script. The outputs of this process were divided by thermal seasons and LWT. Ultimately, average UHI intensity by LWT was estimated. Average UHI according to meteorological conditions is available in GeoTIFF raster format (Appendix 1), with a spatial resolution of 100 x 100m pixels, as well as hourly average UHI for each LWT (Appendix 2 to 16). This data may provide valuable information for urban planners, designers and architects in the process of pinpointing recurrent hot and cool spots/neighborhoods in the city and its heating/cooling degrees. Moreover, these maps may contribute to a construction of an early warning system that anticipates which weather conditions we might expect an significant increase in thermal discomfort on those critical areas in the city.

The imposition of additional taxes on energy products affects negatively low-income households that face funding scarcity, increasing the risk of energy poverty. In this study, the state-of-the-art general equilibrium model GEM E3-FIT is significantly expanded to represent ten income classes in all EU Member States. Each income class is differentiated by income sources, savings, and consumption patterns. We use the new modelling capabilities of GEM-E3-FIT to quantify the distributional impacts of European Union's ambitious emission reduction targets, in particular exploring their effects on income by skill and on energy-related expenditure by income class. The analysis shows that the transition to climate neutrality may increase modestly inequality across income classes, with low-income households facing the most negative effects. However, using carbon tax revenues as lump-sum transfers to support household income and as reduced social security contributions will increase employment and reduce income inequality across households in EU countries.

In terms of space cooling technologies, the global market is largely dominated by window air conditioners and ductless mini-splits. However, numerous other options are available and require more exploration to clearly identify their advantages against conventional systems. In this regard, there are plenty of studies about active cooling systems, but still little is known about the best choices for their application in high-density buildings in extreme humid climates, where latent loads are dominant. In such a framework, this paper briefly examines and identifies possible solutions for space cooling in non-residential buildings in hot-humid climates. In this sense, an all-air system with heat recovery and a radiant ceiling coupled with air handling were identified as the most recommended options for such environments, based on their working principles. Furthermore, the study includes a detailed assessment of the application of these solutions on a case-study building in Mogadishu, Somalia, from the point of view of the cooling demand to the energy consumption of the selected cooling systems. The findings of this work can be extrapolated to be then applied in other developing cities, and outline the path future research should follow to improve the systems.","[Litardo, Jaqueline; Del Pero, Claudio; Leonforte, Fabrizio; Aste, Niccolo] Politecn Milan, Dept Architecture Built Environm & Construct Engn, Politecn Milano, Via Ponzio 31, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Molinaroli, Luca] Politecn Milan, Dept Energy, Via Lambruschini 4, I-20156 Milan, Italy",Polytechnic University of Milan; Polytechnic University of Milan,"Litardo, J (corresponding author), Politecn Milan, Dept Architecture Built Environm & Construct Engn, Politecn Milano, Via Ponzio 31, I-20133 Milan, Italy.",jaqueline.litardo@polimi.it,"Litardo, Jaqueline/AAP-5699-2020","Litardo, Jaqueline/0000-0002-1668-4289; Del Pero, Claudio/0000-0003-4205-2805; Molinaroli, Luca/0000-0003-4130-6375",,,,,142,1,1,4,4,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0360-1323,1873-684X,,BUILD ENVIRON,Build.

Isoprene (IP) and monoterpenes (MT) are the most important precursors of SOA originating from forests. The climate impacts from OA are currently estimated through parameterizations of water uptake that drastically simplify the complexity of OA. We combine laboratory experiments, thermodynamic modeling, field observations, and climate modeling to (1) explain the molecular mechanisms behind RH-dependent SOA water-uptake with solubility and phase separation; (2) show that laboratory data on IP- and MT-SOA hygroscopicity are representative of ambient data with corresponding OA source profiles; and (3) demonstrate the sensitivity of the modeled aerosol climate effect to assumed OA water affinity. We conclude that the commonly used single-parameter hygroscopicity framework can introduce significant error when quantifying the climate effects of organic aerosol. The results highlight the need for better constraints on the overall global OA mass loadings and its molecular composition, including currently underexplored anthropogenic and marine OA sources. Plain Language Summary The interaction of airborne particulate matter (aerosols) with water is of critical importance for processes governing climate, precipitation, and public health. It also modulates the delivery and bioavailability of nutrients to terrestrial and oceanic ecosystems. We present a microphysical explanation to the humidity-dependent water uptake behavior of organic aerosol, which challenges the highly simplified theoretical descriptions used in, e.g., present climate models. With the comprehensive analysis of laboratory data using molecular models, we explain the microphysical behavior of the aerosol over the range of humidity observed in the atmosphere, in a way that has never been done before. We also demonstrate the presence of these phenomena in the ambient atmosphere from data collected in the field. We further show, using two state-of-the-art climate models, that misrepresenting the water affinity of atmospheric organic aerosol can lead to significant biases in the estimates of the anthropogenic influence on climate.","[Rastak, N.; Navarro, J.

Triggering sources for multi-year droughts in this region include randomly occurring atmospheric blocking patterns, ocean impacts on atmospheric circulation, and climate's response to anthropogenic radiative forcings. A combination of these sources translates into a difficulty to predict the onset and length of such droughts on multi-year timescales. Here we present results from a new multi-year dynamical prediction system that exhibits a high degree of skill in forecasting wildfire probabilities and drought for 10-23 and 10-45 months lead time, which extends far beyond the current seasonal prediction activities for southwestern North America. Using a state-of-the-art earth system model along with 3-dimensional ocean data assimilation and by prescribing the external radiative forcings, this system simulates the observed low-frequency variability of precipitation, soil water, and wildfire probabilities in close agreement with observational records and reanalysis data. The underlying source of multi-year predictability can be traced back to variations of the Atlantic/ Pacific sea surface temperature gradient, external radiative forcings, and the low-pass filtering characteristics of soils.","[Chikamoto, Yoshimitsu] Utah State Univ, Dept Plants Soils & Climate, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Timmermann, Axel] Pusan Natl Univ, Inst Basic Sci Ctr Climate Phys, Busan, South Korea; [Widlansky, Matthew J.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Joint Inst Marine & Atmospher Res, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Balmaseda, Magdalena A.] European Ctr Medium Range Weather Forecasts, Reading, Berks, England; [Stott, Lowell] Univ Southern Calif, Dept Earth Sci, Los Angeles, CA USA",Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University; Institute for Basic Science - Korea (IBS); Pusan National University; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF); University of Southern California,"Chikamoto, Y (corresponding author), Utah State Univ, Dept Plants Soils & Climate, Logan, UT 84322 USA.",yoshi.chikamoto@usu.edu,"Timmermann, Axel/Y-2799-2019; Timmermann, Axel/F-4977-2011","Timmermann, Axel/0000-0003-0657-2969; Timmermann, Axel/0000-0003-0657-2969; Alonso Balmaseda, Magdalena/0000-0002-9611-8788; Chikamoto, Yoshimitsu/0000-0003-1001-5188","CAR's Computational and Information Systems Laboratory - National Science Foundation [ark:/85065/d7wd3xhc]; Utah Agricultural Experiment Station, Utah State University [9013]","CAR's Computational and Information Systems Laboratory - National Science Foundation; Utah Agricultural Experiment Station, Utah State University","The CESM experiment in this paper was conducted by the University of Southern California Center for HighPerformance Computing and Communications (http://hpcc.usc.edu) and the high-performance computing support from Yellowstone (ark:/85065/d7wd3xhc) provided by NCAR's Computational and Information Systems Laboratory sponsored by the National Science Foundation.

Here, we contribute a landscape-level climatic analysis of postglacial vs. projected future migration requirements for 24 common western North American tree species. Using a recently developed velocity of climate change algorithm, we quantify required migration velocities for all populations of species to track climate habitat, based on projections from general circulation models for the 2080s and the last glacial maximum, 21 000 yr ago. Specifically, we ask if nearby climate refugia exist for at least some populations within species ranges and whether the current landscape position of species imply qualitatively different migration requirements in the future compared to those during glacial-interglacial cycles. Results showed that velocities to reach the nearest climate refugia in the future still exceed the fastest reconstructed post-glacial migration requirements, but not by orders of magnitude. Regarding landscape positions, we find a low correlation among past and future migration requirements (r = 0.38), suggesting that qualitatively different migration patterns may emerge in the future for some species. Species identified as occupying landscape positions requiring disproportionally faster migration requirements in the future include whitebark pine, pinyon pine, and coast redwood. We discuss uncertainties of our analytical approach as well as implications for human-assisted migration and conservation action to address climate change.","[Roberts, David R.; Hamann, Andreas] Univ Alberta, Dept Renewable Resources, 751 Gen Serv Bldg, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H1, Canada; [Roberts, David R.] Univ Freiburg, Dept Biometry & Environm Syst Anal, DE-79106 Freiburg, Germany",University of Alberta; University of Freiburg,"Roberts, DR (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Dept Renewable Resources, 751 Gen Serv Bldg, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H1, Canada.",drr3@ualberta.ca,,"Roberts, David/0000-0002-3437-2422",U.S. Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs Fulbright Program; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) [RGPIN-330527-07]; Alexander Von Humboldt Foundation through the German Federal Ministry for Education and Research,U.S. Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs Fulbright Program; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); Alexander Von Humboldt Foundation through the German Federal Ministry for Education and Research(Alexander von Humboldt Foundation),"We thank the U.S. Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs Fulbright Program for a visiting scholar grant and the host David Ackerly at UC Berkeley for valuable discussions.

This article argues that dominant cultural imaginaries inform material and discursive practices of place-making with significant consequence for diverse, inclusive and climate change-responsive urban environments. Urban planning in the modern global city commonly deploys imaginaries in line with neoliberal logics, and this article takes a particular interest in the impact of this on Indigenous Australians, whose original dispossession connects through to current Indigenous urban experiences of exclusion which are set to intensify in the face of increasing climate change. The article explores what urban resilience means in this context, focusing on a case study of urban development in Port Adelaide, South Australia, and broadens the question of dispossession through the forces of global capital to potentially all of humanity in the Anthropocene.","[Potter, Emily] Deakin Univ, Sch Commun & Creat Arts, Burwood Highway, Burwood, Vic 3125, Australia",Deakin University,"Potter, E (corresponding author), Deakin Univ, Sch Commun & Creat Arts, Burwood Highway, Burwood, Vic 3125, Australia.",e.potter@deakin.edu.au,,"Potter, Emily/0000-0002-4171-3002",,,,,52,11,11,2,13,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0042-0980,1360-063X,,URBAN STUD,Urban Stud.,MAY,2020,7,,SI,,1536,1552,,10.1177/0042098018821304,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0042098018821304,,,17,Environmental Studies; Urban Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Urban Studies,LN4MU,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000532914400011,View Full Record in Web of Science

All these elements influence the vegetative growth of different varieties throughout the peninsula, and are tied to grape quality and wine type. In the current study, an integrated analysis of climate, soil, topography and vegetative growth was performed for the Iberian DO regions, using state-of-the-art datasets. For climatic assessment, a categorized index, accounting for phenological/thermal development, water availability and grape ripening conditions was computed. Soil textural classes were established to distinguish soil types. Elevation and aspect (orientation) were also taken into account, as the leading topographic elements. A spectral vegetation index was used to assess grapevine vegetative growth and an integrated analysis of all variables was performed. The results showed that the integrated climate-soil-topography influence on vine performance is evident. Most Iberian vineyards are grown in temperate dry climates with loamy soils, presenting low vegetative growth. Vineyards in temperate humid conditions tend to show higher vegetative growth. Conversely, in cooler/warmer climates, lower vigour vineyards prevail and other factors, such as soil type and precipitation acquire more important roles in driving vigour. Vines in prevailing loamy soils are grown over a wide climatic diversity, suggesting that precipitation is the primary factor influencing vigour. The present assessment of terroir characteristics allows direct comparison among wine regions and may have great value to viticulturists, particularly under a changing climate.","[Fraga, Helder; Malheiro, Aureliano C.; Moutinho-Pereira, Jose; Santos, Joao A.] UTAD, Ctr Res & Technol Agroenvironm & Biol Sci, Vila Real, Portugal; [Cardoso, Rita M.; Soares, Pedro M.

Further, an intention was to explain and discuss whether investments in the physical environment in the form of art, design and architecture do have an effect on employees. Design/methodology/approach - To conclude whether aesthetics had an impact on employees in terms of job satisfaction, motivation and their self-perception of their own ability to provide customer service, the authors undertook a quantitative study of 222 employees in seven companies. The authors subsequently commenced five in-depth, semi-structured interviews with four accessible corporate art buyers and one curator to identify the main motivations for purchasing art and placing it in the work place. Findings - With regard to perceptions of art, design and architecture, the physical environment is perceived as a whole and seems to play a significant role in organizational life for employees in companies that have invested in art. The research implies, however, that the companies that invested in art, design and architecture, despite the positive influence on employees' self-perceived service ability, did not accumulate benefits on service ability relative to employees in companies without art. Practical implications - Managers should cautiously reflect on their motivations for investing in art, design and architecture. Useful motivations might include projecting a desired external image or decoration or expressing connection to a community. Investing in art, design and architecture independent of what the organization is trying to do strategically will create cosmetic solutions that lack any wider purpose. Originality/value - Despite increased corporate interest in aesthetics, little research has been done to determine the effect on employees. The research shortage may be due to the challenge of understanding the meaning of the visible expressions. This paper is a contribution to strengthen the knowledge of the impact of workspace aesthetics on employees (the authors subsequently undertook five in-depth, semi-structured interviews with four accessible corporate art buyers at Storebrand (insurance and banking corporation), Telenor (mobile operator), Hydro (aluminium company), Nordic Choice Hotels and one curator).","[Bjerke, Rune; Ind, Nicholas] Oslo Sch Management, Dept Mkt, Oslo, Norway",,"Bjerke, R (corresponding author), Oslo Sch Management, Dept Mkt, Oslo, Norway.",rune.bjerke@mh.no,,"Ind, Nicholas/0000-0003-0797-2438",,,,,88,5,5,0,12,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1450-2194,1758-888X,,EUROMED J BUS,EuroMed J.

It focuses on the social networks created during the Lower Magdalenian of the Cantabrian region (Spain), and visible through similarities of portable art representations. It uses Species Distribution Modeling and Maximum Classification Likelihood on faunal presence data to reconstruct prehistoric biomes, and contextualize the networks reconstructed through the art analysis. It demonstrates the potential of mapping the recreated networks onto the reconstructed biomes and of identifying the linked sites' foraging and minimal band territories to distinguish between local mobility movement and inter-group social alliances. The results show that, during the Lower Magdalenian, the majority of movements seen through artistic similarities probably represent the seasonal mobility of one or two hunter-gatherer groups, and that only a few intersite links represent social networks used to exchange mates and gather information.

In this regard, the estimation of areas with maximum similarity in wave climate spatial areas and the determination of associated representative point locations for these areas can play an important role in climate research and in engineering applications. To deal with this issue, we apply a state-of-the-art clustering method, Geo-SOM, to determine geographical areas with similar wave regimes, in terms of mean wave direction (MWD), mean wave period (T0), and significant wave height (Hs). Although this method has many strengths, a weakness is related to detection and accounting of the most extreme and rare events. To resolve this deficiency, an initial preprocessing method (called PGGeo-SOM) is applied. To evaluate the performance of this method, extreme wave parameters, including Hs and T0, are calculated. We simulate the present climate, represented as 1979 to 2017, compared to the future climate, 2060-98, following the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) future scenario RCP8.5 in the northwestern Atlantic Ocean. In this approach, the wave parameter data are divided into distinct groups, or clusters, motivated by their geographical positions. For each cluster, the centroid spatial point and the time series of data are extracted, for Hs, MWD, and T0. Extreme values are estimated for 5-, 10-, 25-, 50-, and 100-yr return periods, using Gumbel, exponential, and Weibull stochastic models, for both present and future climates. Results show that for parameter T0, the impact of climate change for the study area is a decreasing trend, while for Hs, in coastal and shelf areas up to about 1000 km from the coastline, increasing trends are estimated, and in open-ocean areas, far from the coast, decreasing trends are obtained.","[Goharnejad, Hamid; Perrie, Will; Toulany, Bash; Casey, Mike; Zhang, Minghong] Fisheries & Oceans Canada, Bedford Inst Oceanog, Dartmouth, NS, Canada",Bedford Institute of Oceanography; Fisheries & Oceans Canada,"Goharnejad, H (corresponding author), Fisheries & Oceans Canada, Bedford Inst Oceanog, Dartmouth, NS, Canada.",hgn1982@gmail.com,,,"Canada's Competitive Science Research Fund (CSRF) Program, Ocean Frontier Institute; Marine Environmental Observation, Prediction and Response Network","Canada's Competitive Science Research Fund (CSRF) Program, Ocean Frontier Institute; Marine Environmental Observation, Prediction and Response Network","We were supported by Canada's Competitive Science Research Fund (CSRF) Program, Ocean Frontier Institute and Marine Environmental Observation, Prediction and Response Network in this study.",,73,0,0,2,2,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693, UNITED STATES",0739-0572,1520-0426,,J ATMOS OCEAN TECH,J.

American Delsartism helped create an intellectual climate favourable to the emergence of a new dance art in America. The paper describes the transformation of the Delsarte System, the influences of his students, especially Steele Mackaye, the emergence of the 'harmonic gymnastics' and the popularization of this form of gymnastics by Genevieve Stebbins, a student of Mackaye. Stebbins furthered the Delsarte System in America through extensive work as a teacher, writer and performer. Most of her teaching was done in fashionable seminaries and academies for young ladies. In addition, she taught the Delsarte System and yoga breathing exercises to adult groups. The third phase of Delsartism was represented by Henrietta Russell. Its basic ideal was to treat life as art. The paper shows that American Delsartism was not an esoteric cult for the few. There is ample evidence that it was known and taught throughout the country and touched a large portion of the middle and upper classes.","Univ Calif Irvine, Irvine, CA 92717 USA",University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Ruyter, NLC (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, Irvine, CA 92717 USA.",nlruyter@uci.edu,,,,,,,30,1,1,0,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0952-3367,,,INT J HIST SPORT,Int.

From 2002 to 2017, the satellites of the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission have observed changes in terrestrial water storage (TWS) with an unprecedented level of accuracy. In this paper, we use a statistical model trained with GRACE observations to reconstruct past climate-driven changes in TWS from historical and near-real-time meteorological datasets at daily and monthly scales. Unlike most hydrological models which represent water reservoirs individually (e.g., snow, soil moisture) and usually provide a single model run, the presented approach directly reconstructs total TWS changes and includes hundreds of ensemble members which can be used to quantify predictive uncertainty. We compare these data-driven TWS estimates with other independent evaluation datasets such as the sea level budget, large-scale water balance from atmospheric reanalysis, and in situ streamflow measurements. We find that the presented approach performs overall as well or better than a set of state-of-the-art global hydrological models (Water Resources Reanalysis version 2). We provide reconstructed TWS anomalies at a spatial resolution of 0.5 degrees, at both daily and monthly scales over the period 1901 to present, based on two different GRACE products and three different meteorological forcing datasets, resulting in six reconstructed TWS datasets of 100 ensemble members each. Possible user groups and applications include hydrological modeling and model benchmarking, sea level budget studies, assessments of long-term changes in the frequency of droughts, the analysis of climate signals in geodetic time series, and the interpretation of the data gap between the GRACE and GRACE Follow-On missions.

The Community Atmosphere Model, version 3.3, was modified to represent irrigation for the fraction of each grid cell equipped for irrigation according to datasets from the Food and Agriculture Organization. Results indicate substantial regional differences in the magnitude of irrigation-induced cooling, which are attributed to three primary factors: differences in extent of the irrigated area, differences in the simulated soil moisture for the control simulation (without irrigation), and the nature of cloud response to irrigation. The last factor appeared especially important for the dry season in India, although further analysis with other models and observations are needed to verify this feedback. Comparison with observed temperatures revealed substantially lower biases in several regions for the simulation with irrigation than for the control, suggesting that the lack of irrigation may be an important component of temperature bias in this model or that irrigation compensates for other biases. The results of this study should help to translate the results from past regional efforts, which have largely focused on the United States, to regions in the developing world that in many cases continue to experience significant expansion of irrigated land.","[Lobell, David] Stanford Univ, Program Food Secur & Environm, Woods Inst Environm, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Lobell, David] Stanford Univ, Freeman Spogli Inst Int Studies, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Bala, Govindasamy] Indian Inst Sci, Ctr Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Bangalore 560012, Karnataka, India; [Mirin, Art; Phillips, Thomas; Rotman, Doug] Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, Livermore, CA USA; [Maxwell, Reed] Colorado Sch Mines, Dept Geol & Geol Engn, Golden, CO 80401 USA",Stanford University; Stanford University; Indian Institute of Science (IISC) - Bangalore; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory; Colorado School of Mines,"Lobell, D (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Program Food Secur & Environm, Woods Inst Environm, Y2E2 Bldg,MC4205,473 Via Ortega, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",dlobell@stanford.edu,"Bala, Govindasamy/ABF-3255-2020; Maxwell, Reed M/D-7980-2013","Bala, Govindasamy/0000-0002-3079-0600; Maxwell, Reed M/0000-0002-1364-4441; Lobell, David/0000-0002-5969-3476",U.

Impact models for large scale flood risk assessment have made leaps forward in the past few years, thanks to the increased availability of high resolution climate projections and of information on local exposure and vulnerability to river floods. Yet, state-of-the-art flood impact models rely on a number of input data and techniques that can substantially influence their results. This work compares estimates of river flood risk in Europe from three recent case studies, assuming global warming scenarios of 1.5, 2, and 3 degrees Celsius from pre-industrial levels. The assessment is based on comparing ensemble projections of expected damage and population affected at country level. Differences and common points between the three cases are shown, to point out main sources of uncertainty, strengths, and limitations. In addition, the multi-model comparison helps identify regions with the largest agreement on specific changes in flood risk. Results show that global warming is linked to substantial increase in flood risk over most countries in Central and Western Europe at all warming levels. In Eastern Europe, the average change in flood risk is smaller and the multi-model agreement is poorer.","[Alfieri, Lorenzo; Dottori, Francesco; Salamon, Peter; Feyen, Luc] European Commiss Joint Res Ctr, I-21027 Ispra, Italy; [Betts, Richard] Univ Exeter, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Exeter EX4 4PS, Devon, England; [Betts, Richard] Met Off Hadley Ctr, Exeter EX1 3PB, Devon, England",European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site; University of Exeter; Met Office - UK; Hadley Centre,"Alfieri, L (corresponding author), European Commiss Joint Res Ctr, I-21027 Ispra, Italy.",lorenzo.alfieri@ec.europa.eu; Francesco.DOTTORI@ec.europa.eu; R.A.Betts@exeter.ac.uk; Peter.SALAMON@ec.europa.eu; Luc.FEYEN@ec.europa.eu,"Betts, Richard A/P-8976-2015; Feyen, Luc/ABD-6195-2021; Alfieri, Lorenzo/AAJ-6668-2021","Betts, Richard A/0000-0002-4929-0307; Alfieri, Lorenzo/0000-0002-3616-386X; Salamon, Peter/0000-0002-5419-5398; Dottori, Francesco/0000-0002-1388-3303",European Union Seventh Framework Programme FP7 [603864],European Union Seventh Framework Programme FP7,The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Union Seventh Framework Programme FP7/2007-2013 under grant agreement no 603864 ( HELIX: High-End cLimate Impacts and eXtremes; www.helixclimate.eu).,,62,65,65,3,26,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2225-1154,,CLIMATE,Climate,MAR,2018,1,,,,,,16,10.3390/cli6010016,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/cli6010016,,,19,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,GA7HH,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000428506200006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Four loess sections distributed over art area with present-day moist to semi-arid climates were studied. In addition to traditional paleoclimate proxies, such as grain-size distribution as proxy for wind-strength and source aridity, and magnetic susceptibility as proxy for precipitation (and temperature), pedo-chemical elemental ratios, obtained by selective sediment leaching procedures, function as sensitive recorders of variations in weathering intensity due to changes in precipitation and temperature. Especially, the earth alkaline element ratios of Ba/Sr and Sr/Ca are subject to strong variations as a result of carbonate dissolution/precipitation and variable cation exchange capacity on clay minerals along the elemental sequence of Ca-Sr-Ba. As shown by the close similarity to the magnetic susceptibility records in the different loess sections, these ratios reflect the effects of weathering intensity as a result of precipitation changes. The fact that Ba/Sr unequivocally shows higher values in both soils and paleosols in the four studied sections over the present-day climate gradient, singles this elemental ratio out as an interesting paleoclimate proxy.

Previous investigations carried out in our study area located in Central-Western Santa Cruz province, Patagonia, have stated that climatic fluctuations during the Late Holocene (last 2500 years) were the cause of a reduction of hunter-gatherers' residential mobility. The new climatic conditions were characterized by important environmental droughts, which increased during the Mediaeval Climatic Anomaly, circa 900 years BP. This reduction in mobility resulted in concentrations of populations in low altitude basins and increased logistical and seasonal mobility, defined as a process of extensification. In this paper we take a broad spatial perspective to evaluate to what extent the low residential mobility identified in our research area had a correlation in a larger regional scale. Also we assess if this lead to a regional differentiation among hunter-gatherer populations, previous to European contact (450 years BP). In order to achieve these aims, we undertake a coarse grain analysis, using available data published on the composition and distribution of the archaeological record for Central-Southern Patagonia, an area of about 450.000 km(2). Specifically, we consider evidence about technology, zooarchaeology, rock art, mortuary record and paleodietary studies. The analysis indicates that a reduced residential mobility could have occurred in certain areas of the study region, linked to the aforementioned climatic changes. On the issue of regional differentiation, the archaeological record highlights the complexity of this process. There are a variety of arguments both for and against the idea of a process of regionalization in Central-Southern Patagonia in the Late Holocene. We propose a process of differentiation of populations with low residential mobility which nonetheless remained connected through the circulation of goods, information and people.

The annual means, seasonal cycles, and 3-D distributions of SLCFs were evaluated using several metrics, such as absolute and percent model biases and correlation coefficients. The results show a large range in model performance, with no one particular model or model type performing well for all regions and all SLCF species. The multi-model mean (mmm) was able to represent the general features of SLCFs in the Arctic and had the best overall performance. For the SLCFs with the greatest radiative impact (CH4, O-3, BC, and SO42-), the mmm was within +/- 25 % of the measurements across the Northern Hemisphere. Therefore, we recommend a multi-model ensemble be used for simulating climate and health impacts of SLCFs. Of the SLCFs in our study, model biases were smallest for CH4 and greatest for OA. For most SLCFs, model biases skewed from positive to negative with increasing latitude. Our analysis suggests that vertical mixing, long-range transport, deposition, and wildfires remain highly uncertain processes. These processes need better representation within atmospheric models to improve their simulation of SLCFs in the Arctic environment. As model development proceeds in these areas, we highly recommend that the vertical and 3-D distribution of SLCFs be evaluated, as that information is critical to improving the uncertain processes in models.","[Whaley, Cynthia H.;

This question is pertinent, as doubts about the future are increasingly urgent, while the need to engage with the future is not sufficiently addressed by the quantitative growth of future studies. In the case of climate change, for example, the future consequences of global temperature increase are well-known, but do not invoke action accordingly. While some see the use of art as an effective means to engage with the future, others criticise such usage as reducing art to an instrumental value, at the expense of aesthetic values. This raises fundamental questions about how art and imagination can be engaging and what this implies for future studies. To address the issue, we resort to a pragmatist understanding of art. We present a reading of the work of John Dewey (1859-1952). In his Art as Experience, Dewey claimed that art can be seen as a mode of prediction not found in charts and statistics. He presents the experience of art as a reciprocal process that is imaginative: in our engagement with art, we experience the artwork, while the experience also produces us. The aesthetic experience is transformative. This mutual coming into existence is not a planned creation, but insinuates an open future as well as an open past. As a next step, we review the production of futures in future studies, using Dewey's understandings on how imagination and the future connect in the aesthetic experience. First, we look at methods to produce futures: extrapolations, Delphi Surveys, surveys, simulations and scenarios. Second, we evaluate how the produced futures engage their audience, distinguishing between narratives, symbols, graphs and images. We conclude that while futures studies have been successful in showing routes to the future, they also have difficulties to relate to futures in a more open, imaginative and responsible way. They are informative but not transformative. The difficulty of future studies to engage, hinders responsible responses.","[van Lente, Harro; Peters, Peter] Univ Maastricht, Maastricht, Netherlands",Maastricht University,"van Lente, H (corresponding author), Univ Maastricht, Maastricht, Netherlands.",h.vanlente@maastrichtuniversity.nl,,"van Lente, Harro/0000-0002-4719-360X",,,,,35,0,0,12,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",2195-4194,2195-2248,,EUR J FUTURES RES,Eur.

The urban surface energy balance is influenced in various ways by physical parameters related to building architecture. The albedo of the covering materials of roofs and walls is crucial for the radiation balance, the thermal conductivity and thermal capacity of the construction materials influence the heat storage inside the urban fabric. In this study we introduce a methodology to define the characteristics of building architecture with the precision required by state of the art urban canopy parametrisations. The geographical scope of our analysis is France. We assume that the building architecture depends mainly on the urban typology, the building use, the construction period, and the geographical location. Based on a literature survey on architectural practices and building regulation standards in France we define one to three building archetypes for each combination of these four parameters. For each building archetype, information on the construction type of walls and roofs (main materials, insulation, internal and external cover), the glazing ratio, type of windows, presence of shading elements, the airtightness and presence of a mechanical ventilation system is provided. We perform idealised simulations with TEB to determine the sensitivity of the urban surface energy balance on building architecture. We find that the albedo of the roof and the presence of insulation materials in wall and roof as well as their position with respect to the main wall and roof material are crucial for an accurate simulation of the urban energy balance. Future developments of the architectural database will therefore focus on these parameters. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Since meteorological observations in high mountains are sparse, climate model data are frequently used. State of the art climate reanalysis products or general circulation models have a horizontal spatial resolution on the order of 50 x 50 km, i.e. far too coarse to represent the spatial variability of near-surface temperatures in mountain regions. Based on the assumption that elevation is the main factor determining the distribution of temperatures, we present a SAGA-GIS based approach for elevation and bias correction of climate model output data. Modeled temperature and geopotential height at different pressure levels were used to derive local temperature profiles by means of a polynomial regression approach. Atmospheric temperatures at surface level can then be derived from the regression equation. Compared with a simple elevation adjustment of ERA-Interim near-surface temperatures using an invariant lapse rate of 0.65 degrees C per 100 m, the method showed good results, particularly in complex terrain. The method was used to generate high-resolution daily temperature fields for a target area in Central Asia for the period from 1989 onwards. Gridded trends of different temperature indices were calculated. For winter and spring, the highest temperature trends were detected in the high mountain regions. In summer, the calculated trend magnitudes were generally smaller. During the post-monsoon season, trends were more pronounced at low elevations. For the southern slopes of the Himalayan Arc and the valleys of the Tibetan Plateau, a significant decrease in frost days and an increase in growing degree days were detected.","[Gerlitz, Lars; Conrad, Olaf; Boehner, Juergen] Univ Hamburg, Inst Geog, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany; [Thomas, Axel] GIS Serv GmbH, D-55263 Wackernheim, Germany",University of Hamburg,"Gerlitz, L (corresponding author), Univ Hamburg, Inst Geog, Bundesstr 55, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany.",lars.gerlitz@uni-hamburg.de,"Thomas, Axel/AAH-7310-2019; Boehner, Juergen/I-9844-2014","Thomas, Axel/0000-0002-3596-0103; Boehner, Juergen/0000-0002-0842-0152",,,,,36,32,32,1,44,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0936-577X,1616-1572,,CLIM RES,Clim.

Finally, an analysis on tropical events allows inferring a likely future of climatic tropical features as summer rainfall or tropical storms.","[Dorta Antequera, Pedro; Lopez Diez, Abel; Diaz Pacheco, Jaime] Univ La Laguna, Catedra Reducc Riesgo Desastres Ciudades Resilien, San Cristobal la Laguna, Spain",Universidad de la Laguna,"Antequera, PD (corresponding author), Univ La Laguna, Catedra Reducc Riesgo Desastres Ciudades Resilien, San Cristobal la Laguna, Spain.",pdorta@ull.es; alopezd@ull.es; jdiazpac@ull.es,,,,,,,75,0,0,1,11,UNIV GRANADA,GRANADA,"CUESTA DEL HOSPICIO S-N, CAMPUS UNIV, GRANADA, 18071, SPAIN",0210-5462,2340-0129,,CUAD GEOGR,Cuad.

The observations illustrate many scales of variability in the atmosphere from the seasonal overturning Hadley-Walker circulation to high-frequency transient variability associated with baroclinic storms with high vertical resolution. The Asian monsoon circulation has a strong impact on upper-tropospheric humidity, with large humidity gradients to the west of the monsoon. The vertical structure of humidity is generally bimodal, with high humidity in the upper and lower troposphere, and a dry middle troposphere. The highest variances in humidity are seen around the midlatitude tropopause. AIRS data are compared to a simulation from a state-of-the-art climate model. The model does a good job of reproducing the mean humidity distribution but is slightly moister than the observations in the middle and upper troposphere. The model has difficultly reproducing many scales of observed variability, particularly in the Tropics.

It is a known fact that microorganisms, which are associated with plant, may stimulate plant growth and enhance resistance to disease and abiotic stresses. The effects of climate change factors, such as elevated CO2, drought, and temperature on beneficial plant-microorganism interactions are increasingly being explored. Organisms live in concert with thousands of other species, such as some beneficial and pathogenic species which have little to no effect on complex communities. Since natural communities are composed of organisms with very different life history traits and dispersal ability, it is unlikely that all of the microbial community will respond to climatic change factors in a similar way. Among the different factors related to climate change, elevated CO2 had a positive influence on the abundance of arbuscular and ectomycorrhizal fungi, whereas the effects on plant-growth-promoting bacteria and endophytic fungi were more variable. The rise in temperature effects on beneficial plant-associated microorganisms were more variable, positive, neutral, and negative, which were equally common and varied considerably with the temperature range. Likewise, plant-growth-promoting microorganisms (i.e., bacteria and fungi) positively affected plants subjected to drought stress. In this chapter, we explore how climatic change affects soil microbes and plant-associated microorganisms.","[Mekala, Srikanth] CCSHAU, Dept Vegetable Sci, Hisar, Haryana, India; [Polepongu, Srilatha] PJSTAU, Dept Plant Pathol, Aswaraopeta, Telangana, India",CCS Haryana Agricultural University,"Mekala, S (corresponding author), CCSHAU, Dept Vegetable Sci, Hisar, Haryana, India.",,,,,,,,68,3,3,1,8,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",,,978-3-030-26657-8; 978-3-030-26656-1,,,,2019,,,,,31,41,,10.1007/978-3-030-26657-8_3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-26657-8_3,10.1007/978-3-030-26657-8,,11,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Microbiology,Book Citation Index – Science (BKCI-S),Agriculture; Plant Sciences; Microbiology,BR3ZQ,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000649657000003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Life Cycle Thinking (LCT) offers a robust methodological background as one of the approaches to achieving system analysis for a product along its lifecycle. On the other hand, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) can perform state-of-art system analysis characterising its sustainability fronts as a compelling set of tools. Pork, as the most consumed meat across Europe (circa 34 kg per capita per year), compounded with the sector's contribution to global greenhouse gases (GHG) doubling over the past decade necessitated this research. Our objective was to map hotspots along the value chain and recommend the best available practices for realising the sectoral contribution to carbon neutrality and climate change adaptation. To achieve the objective, we compared organic and conventional production systems by basing our analysis on Recipe midpoint 2016 (H) V1.13 as implemented in OpenLCA 1.10.2 using AGRIBALYSE (R) 3.0 datasets for eleven indicators. We found that producing 1 kg of pig meat under an organic production system had almost double the environmental impact of conventional systems for land use, water consumption, acidification, and ecotoxicity. Feed production and manure management are the significant hotspots accounting for over 90% of environmental impacts associated with 1 kg pig meat Liveweight (LW) production. Similarly, efficient conventional systems were less harmful to the environment in per capita unit of production and land use compared with organic ones in ten out of the eleven impacts evaluated. Implementing increased efficiency, reduced use of inputs for feed production, and innovative manure management practices with technological potential were some of the best practices the research recommended to realise minimal impacts on the identified hotspots.","[Ndue, Kennedy; Pal, Goda] Szechenyi Istvan Univ, Doctoral Sch Reg & Business Adm Sci, H-9026 Gyor, Hungary",University of Istvan Szechenyi,"Ndue, K (corresponding author), Szechenyi Istvan Univ, Doctoral Sch Reg & Business Adm Sci, H-9026 Gyor, Hungary.",mutua.kennedy.ndue@sze.hu; goda.pal@sze.hu,,"Goda, Pal/0000-0002-1900-2175; NDUE, Kennedy/0000-0003-0406-9606",Doctoral Publications Support Program of Szechenyi Istvan University-Gyor (Hungary) [2022],Doctoral Publications Support Program of Szechenyi Istvan University-Gyor (Hungary),This research APC was supported by the Doctoral Publications Support Program of Szechenyi Istvan University-Gyor (Hungary) 2022.,,58,2,2,7,7,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-445X,,LAND-BASEL,Land,JUN,2022,6,,,,,,827,10.3390/land11060827,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land11060827,,,17,Environmental Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,2K6BX,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000816419900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In the context of heritage preservation the Temperierung system was mainly developed by the State Office for Non-State Museums in Bavaria for heating and climatization of museums and exhibit buildings. Based on the ongoing research project Temperierung as a Tool for Preventive Conservation-An Assessment a close and interdisciplinary collaboration is established between building physicists, conservators and practitioners from 18 selected museums. The paper highlights the different existing Temperierung systems within the project, main components of the system and different types of application. The main principles of the technique are explained and compared to more commonly known heating systems like convector/radiator heating and wall/floor heating. Preliminary results of the measured indoor climate and effects of the Temperierung heating system of several chosen museums are presented. The impacts of the indoor climate to the conservation of artifacts, influenced by Temperierung heating, are discussed with typical methods of indoor climate assessment and with conservational assessment. The detailed and neutral description of Temperierung heating gives a basis for planners and persons in charge for retrofitting historical museum buildings. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

SCC is generally estimated using integrated assessment models (IAMs), primarily the DICE, FUND, and PAGE models. However, these models often report different SCC estimates. Inconsistent SCCs can lead to over-/underestimation of the costs and benefits of emission reduction, further undermining the effectiveness of climate policies. The reasons behind such inconsistent SCCs, however, remain unclear. Here, we quantitatively decompose two core components of IAMs, climate modules and damage functions, and find that the core reason for SCC disparities lies in differences in climate modules. These differences explain 60%-95% of SCC variations. SCC estimates are more consistent when DICE/FUND/PAGE IAMs are coupled with a reduced-complexity climate module. Our study highlights the importance of considering a common modeling framework by synthesizing state-of-the-art information on climate science to provide more consistent science-based advice to policy makers.","[Wang, Tianpeng; Teng, Fei; Deng, Xu; Xie, Jun] Tsinghua Univ, Inst Energy Environm & Econ, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China",Tsinghua University,"Teng, F (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Inst Energy Environm & Econ, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",tengfei@tsinghua.edu.cn,"teng, fei/M-1720-2015","teng, fei/0000-0003-0371-1142; Wang, Tianpeng/0000-0001-7470-2409",National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFA0602702],National Key Research and Development Program of China,Acknowledgments We would like to thank the seven anonymous reviewers for their suggestions and comments.

In recent years, the TP has been affected by exog-enous pollutants and the concentrations of some pollutants have shown an increasing trend, especially light -absorbing aerosols (LAAs), when ice core records, ground-and aircraft-based field campaigns and satellite technology enabled synthesized monitoring. The enhanced warming of the vast majority of regions in TP, together with Arctic warming, and snow/ice decline, represents credible evidence of anthropogenic climate change. This paper provides a comprehensive review of studies on the sources, characteristics and climate im-pacts of LAAs over the TP. Adjacent to the two major emission sources of LAAs in East Asia and South Asia, the unique geographical location and climatic characteristics of the TP make it possible for TP LAAs to cause at-mospheric warming and accelerated glacier melting, affecting the hydrological cycle in South Asia, East Asia and even the Northern Hemisphere, thus causing a series of serious environmental and social problems. LAAs, such as black carbon and dust, can strongly absorb solar radiation and and have significantly influence on climate change. Moreover, light-absorbing impurities (LAIs) on snow/ice can reduce the snow/ice albedo and further accelerate the snow/ice melting. Both LAAs and LAIs over the TP can induce thermodynamic feedback processes, cause significant warming of the TP and then lead to a strengthening of the early monsoon and affect the sub-sequent evolution of the monsoon. Many mechanisms have been proposed forth regarding how TP LAAs modulate the phase, intensity, and amplitude of the Asian climate system. A wide range of theoretical, obser-vational, and modeling findings on TP LAAs and their climate impacts are synthesized, in which dust aerosols from drylands and black carbon from biomass burning are considered leading components. By coupling an in-tegrated approach with state-of-the-art modeling, high temporal and fine spatial resolution remote sensing ob-servations with increasing sampling over the TP will provide further insights into TP aerosols.","[Chen, Siyu; Zhang, Renhe] Fudan Univ, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Inst Atmospher Sci, Shanghai 200438, Peoples R China; [Chen, Siyu; Chen, Yu; Gong, Yongqi; Guan, Yawen] Lanzhou Univ, Key Lab Semiarid Climate Change, Minist Educ, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China; [Mao, Rui] Beijing Normal Univ, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yulan] Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Ecoenvironm & Resources, State key Lab Cryospher Sci, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China; [Ji, Zhenming] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Atmospher Sci, Guangzhou 510275, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Renhe] Fudan Univ, Inst Atmospher Sci, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Fudan University; Lanzhou University; Beijing Normal University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Sun Yat Sen University; Fudan University,"Zhang, RH (corresponding author), Fudan Univ, Inst Atmospher Sci, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",rhzhang@fudan.edu.cn,"Zhang, Renhe/AAA-6301-2020; Chen, Siyu/D-3855-2016","Zhang, Renhe/0000-0001-7750-8679; Chen, Siyu/0000-0003-2532-6050","National Natural Science Foundation of China [42175106, 91837103]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2020M681156]; Research Innovation Team Building Project [lzujbky-2020-ct0]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); Research Innovation Team Building Project,"Acknowledgements This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 42175106, 91837103) , China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2020M681156) , and Research Innovation Team Building Project (lzujbky-2020-ct0) .",,238,0,0,23,23,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0012-8252,1872-6828,,EARTH-SCI REV,Earth-Sci.

The simulations cover the period from December 2006 to November 2014 and use the new dust scheme implemented in RegCM4 that splits 12 dust size groups according to the changes of dry deposition velocity with size (isogradient method). In the model, dust is emitted over desert and semi-desert grid cells when a wind speed threshold value is exceeded. This critical wind speed value varies and depends on soil particle size distribution, surface roughness and soil moisture. The simulated dust optical depth is evaluated over the Sahara and the Mediterranean with the pure dust product LIVAS derived from CALIPSO satellite observations (http://lidar.space.noa.gr:8080/livas/). Furthermore the evaluation results are discussed with respect to the comparison of the simulated wind speed and precipitation fields in our domain with the ERA-interim reanalysis and CRU observational gridded datasets. We combine the simulated emission and deposition fluxes and present their annual cycle to explain the biases we observe in the dust optical depth.

The discipline has rapidly grown since its beginnings in 1840 with the work of Von Liebig on plant nutrition. At present, the cycles of water, carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and many other elements are known in great detail. Based on this information, many biogeochemical models have been developed. Applications of the models in forestry have focused on problems relating to environmental change, especially concerning the effects of pollution, climate change and changes in management. So the state of the art is that we have a fair understanding of biogeochemical cycles, have increasing quantities of data, and models that we can apply. However, progress can, and still needs, to be made. Various forest ecosystem types are poorly represented in the database, and long-term data are scarce. Many variables that are essential to biogeochemical modelling, like net primary productivity, have not been studied well, especially regarding their response to environmental change. Weaknesses in current biogeochemical modelling are lack of balance in the modelling of different components of the biogeochemical cycles, and insufficient quantification of the uncertainty of model outputs. We suggest that the forest research community in general, and forest biogeochemical modelling in particular, might follow the example of the climate change research community in how they integrate research effort and identify areas where knowledge and predictive capability can be improved.","Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland",UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (UKCEH),,,"Levy, Peter E/K-6523-2012; Van Oijen, Marcel/K-2746-2012","Levy, Peter E/0000-0002-8505-1901; Van Oijen, Marcel/0000-0003-4028-3626",,,,,48,8,8,0,4,EUROPEAN FOREST INSTITUTE,JOENSUU,"TORIKATU 34, FIN-80100 JOENSUU, FINLAND",1237-8801,,952-5453-00-6,EUR FOREST INST PROC,,,2004,49,,,,157,169,,,,,,13,Biodiversity Conservation; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,BCE62,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000228882700014,View Full Record in Web of Science

New technologies often give rise to societal controversies about their potential risks and benefits. Over the last decades, social scientists, psychologists, and philosophers have criticized quantitative approaches to risk on the grounds that they oversimplify its societal and ethical implications. There is broad consensus amongst these scholars that stakeholders and their values and concerns should be included in decision-making about technological risks. It has also been argued that the emotional responses of people can shed important light on the ethical aspects of risk and uncertainty. However, people's emotions can be narrowly focused and biased. This article therefore assesses the role that technology-inspired artworks can play in overcoming such biases, by challenging our imagination and providing us with different perspectives on possible technological developments and their implications for society. Philosophers have not yet studied such artworks, so this constitutes an entirely new field of research for scholars of risk and moral theory. In particular, we focus on the case of BNCI (Brain/Neural Computer Interface) technologies and related artworks. These technologies and artworks touch on questions of what it means to be human, thereby raising profound ethical and philosophical challenges. We discuss the experiences of artists, scientists, and engineers who are directly involved with BNCI technologies, and who were interviewed during a Hackathon at Amsterdam's Waag Society in June 2016. Their views are analyzed in light of philosophical and aesthetic theories, which allows us to consider relevant ethical and conceptual issues as well as topics for further investigation.","[Roeser, Sabine; Alfano, Veronica] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Technol Policy & Management, Delft, Netherlands; [Alfano, Veronica] Australian Catholic Univ, Inst Relig & Crit Inquiry, Banyo, Australia; [Nevejan, Caroline] Univ Amsterdam, AISSR, Amsterdam, Netherlands",Delft University of Technology; Australian Catholic University; University of Amsterdam,"Roeser, S (corresponding author), Delft Univ Technol, Fac Technol Policy & Management, Delft, Netherlands.",S.Roeser@tudelft.nl,,"Alfano, Veronica/0000-0002-9906-2556",EU [686987],EU(European Commission),"The authors wish to thank the EU-funded FET-Open project BrainHack (project number 686987) for making this research possible.

We propose a methodology that advances the state-of-the-art by correcting not just the 1D intensity distributions separately but the full two-dimensional statistical distribution. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed method, it is applied to the REMO regional climate model output using point measurements of hourly temperature and precipitation from 6 weather stations over Germany as observations. A standard cross-validation is performed by dividing the data into two nonoverlapping 15 year periods. Results show that the methodology effectively improves the temperature-precipitation copula in the validation period, unlike separate 1D temperature and precipitation corrections which, by construction, leave the copula unchanged. An unexpected result is that a relatively small number (<5) of temperature bins are required to achieve significant improvements in the copula. Results are similar for all stations.

By applying large deviation theory to a state-of-the-art Earth system model, we define the climatology of persistent heatwaves and cold spells in key target geographical regions by estimating the rate functions for the surface temperature, and we assess the impact of increasing CO2 concentration on such persistent anomalies. Hence, we can better quantify the increasing hazard due to heatwaves in a warmer climate. We show that two 2010 high impact events-summer Russian heatwave and winter Dzud in Mongolia-are associated with atmospheric patterns that are exceptional compared to the typical ones but typical compared to the climatology of extremes. Their dynamics is encoded in the natural variability of the climate.

It is often classified as the driest inhabited continent due to the extremely low annual average rainfall (465 mm) and associated low annual average runoff (57 mm). This has required a regular revision of Australia's water policy to align with the needs of its society. Several changes in water policy have been formulated in recent times with the objective of striking a balance between the consumptive and environmental components of flows in Australian catchments. Some of the developments that affect irrigated agriculture include: (i) the Council of Australian Government's water reforms; (ii) the Murray-Darling Basin Commission cap (the volume of water that could be diverted under 1993-94 levels of development); (iii) environmental flow rules; and (iv) the National Water Initiative. At a strategic level global climate change threatens the viability of irrigated agriculture and other industries. Under the present water reforms, longer-term water security is not guaranteed because these reforms do not explicitly take into account threats to water quantity and quality due to enhanced climate variability and change. At an operational level, current water allocation systems do not take into account state-of-the-art climate forecasting methods. Therefore, it is often not until after the irrigation season is well underway that irrigators have a reasonable knowledge of how much water will be available. Thus, there is considerable risk associated with planting and crop establishment decisions, resulting in a need for climate forecasting tools aimed at risk management. There is also a need for Australian water legislation and policy to be revisited to incorporate climate change and adaptive management options.","[Khan, Shahbaz] CSIRO Land & Water, Wagga Wagga, NSW 2678, Australia; [Khan, Shahbaz] Charles Sturt Univ, Wagga Wagga, NSW 2678, Australia",Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Charles Sturt University,"Khan, S (corresponding author), CSIRO Land & Water, Locked Bag 588, Wagga Wagga, NSW 2678, Australia.",shahbaz.khan@csiro.au,"mahsum, masot/ABC-4546-2020",,,,,,31,23,23,2,23,CSIRO PUBLISHING,COLLINGWOOD,"150 OXFORD ST, PO BOX 1139, COLLINGWOOD, VICTORIA 3066, AUSTRALIA",0816-1089,,,AUST J EXP AGR,Aust.

Greater confidence in these regional projections may be established by their replication in state-of-the-art, high-resolution global climate models that resolve synoptic-scale dynamics. We evaluated the representation of the wintertime eddy-driven and subtropical jet streams, extratropical cyclone activity, and precipitation across the North Atlantic and Europe under historical (1985-2011) and RCP8.5 sea surface temperature forcing in an ensemble of atmosphere-only HadGEM3-GA3.0 simulations, where horizontal atmospheric resolution is increased from 135 to 25 km. Under RCP8.5, increased (decreased) frequency of northern (southern) eddy-driven jet occurrences and a basinwide poleward shift in the upper-level westerly flow are simulated. Increasing atmospheric resolution significantly enhances these climate change responses. At 25-km resolution, these enhanced changes in large-scale circulation amplify increases (decreases) in extratropical cyclone track density and mean intensity across the northern (southern) Euro-Atlantic region under RCP8.5. These synoptic changes with resolution impact the overall climate change response of mean and heavy winter precipitation: wetter (drier) conditions in northern (southern) Europe are also amplified at 25-km resolution. For example, the reduction in heavy precipitation simulated over the Iberian Peninsula under RCP8.5 is similar to 15% at 135 km but similar to 30% at 25-km resolution. Conversely, a shift to more frequent high extratropical cyclone (ETC)-associated precipitation rates is simulated over Scandinavia under RCP8.5, which is enhanced at 25 km. This study provides evidence that global atmospheric resolution may be a crucial consideration in European winter climate change projections.","[Baker, Alexander J.; Schiemann, Reinhard; Hodges, Kevin, I; Demory, Marie-Estelle; Shaffrey, Len C.; Vidale, Pier Luigi] Univ Reading, Natl Ctr Atmospher Sci, Reading, Berks, England; [Baker, Alexander J.; Schiemann, Reinhard; Hodges, Kevin, I; Demory, Marie-Estelle; Shaffrey, Len C.; Vidale, Pier Luigi] Univ Reading, Dept Meteorol, Reading, Berks, England; [Mizielinski, Matthew S.; Roberts, Malcolm J.; Strachan, Jane] Met Off Hadley Ctr, Exeter, Devon, England",UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); NERC National Centre for Atmospheric Science; University of Reading; University of Reading; Met Office - UK; Hadley Centre,"Baker, AJ (corresponding author), Univ Reading, Natl Ctr Atmospher Sci, Reading, Berks, England.;Baker, AJ (corresponding author), Univ Reading, Dept Meteorol, Reading, Berks, England.",alexander.baker@reading.ac.uk,"Schiemann, Reinhard/K-7755-2012; Vidale, Pier Luigi/AAF-6468-2019","Schiemann, Reinhard/0000-0003-3095-9856; Vidale, Pier Luigi/0000-0002-1800-8460; Baker, Alexander/0000-0003-2697-1350; Demory, Marie-Estelle/0000-0002-5764-3248","PRIMAVERA project - European Commission's Horizon2020 programme [641727]; PRACE Research Infrastructure; Centre for Environmental-DataAnalysis; NERC [ncas10016, jwcrp01003] Funding Source: UKRI",PRIMAVERA project - European Commission's Horizon2020 programme; PRACE Research Infrastructure; Centre for Environmental-DataAnalysis; NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"PH UPSCALE simulations were supported by the PRACE Research Infrastructure (www.prace-ri.eu) and the Centre for Environmental-DataAnalysis, which operates the JASMIN platform for data storage and analysis (www.jasmin.ac.uk).AJB gratefully acknowledges financial support from the PRIMAVERA project, which is funded by the European Commission's Horizon2020 programme (Grant Agreement 641727).

Based on daily precipitation data sets from state-of-the-art coupled climate model cohort that participated in Coupled Climate Model Inter-comparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6), this study brings out the efficacy of these models in resolving the intra-seasonal signatures of monsoon season rainfall. Out of 27 CMIP6 models considered in the present study, only 21 are able to simulate the annual cycle well within the acceptance bound derived from the observations based rainfall. CMIP6 models Can-ESM5, HadGEM3-GC31, MRI-ESM2, UKESM1, ACCESS-CM2 and ACCESS-ESM1-5 are failed to resolve the onset phase of the monsoon in the month of June. Subsequent analysis revealed reasonable skills of most of the 27 CMIP6 models in demarcating 2 dominant intra-seasonal oscillations (ISOs) of monsoon viz 10-20 and 30-60 days. It is noted from the present analysis that CMIP6 models resolve the 10-20 days ISOs signal significantly but unexpectedly show conspicuous shift in 30-60 days ISOs with respect to the observational data sets over the central Indian region which results in extended dry spell in the beginning of the monsoon season. Westward propagating 10-20 days and Northward propagating 30-60 days ISOs characteristics are well simulated by 50% of CMIP6 models considered in the present study. Multi model mean of 27 CMIP6 models seems to preserve the shape of the distribution of 10-20 days ISOs in good agreement with the observational datasets as compared to low frequency 30-60 days oscillations, nevertheless, considering huge inter-model variations in ISOs particularly for 30-60 days ISOs and inability of CMIP6 models in detecting climatological wet and dry spells of ISOs, caution must be taken while delineating the intra-seasonal variability of the South Asian monsoon using CMIP6 models. Inter-model spread amongst the CMIP6 models considered in the present study may be attributed to the pathways of the interaction of model components, variants, model physics and representation of feedback mechanism.","[Singh, Charu] Indian Inst Remote Sensing, Marine & Atmospher Sci Dept, ISRO, Dehra Dun, Uttarakhand, India","Department of Space (DoS), Government of India; Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO); Indian Institute of Remote Sensing (IIRS)","Singh, C (corresponding author), Indian Inst Remote Sensing, Marine & Atmospher Sci Dept, ISRO, Dehra Dun, Uttarakhand, India.",charu@iirs.gov.in,,,,,,,74,0,0,11,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0930-7575,1432-0894,,CLIM DYNAM,Clim.

A hindcast simulation for the period 1980-2013 is conducted, the forcing set of which is used to produce two warmer forcing sets that conserve all the variability features of the original one. Comparing the results of the three simulations shows that higher temperatures cause a decrease of the mean overturning circulation. However, from a seasonal point of view, an increase of the overturning circulation can be noticed during winter while a strong decrease occurs during summer. An analysis of the vertical viscosity shows that these results coincide with an increase of vertical mixing at the level of the halocline during winter and a strong decrease of the vertical mixing at the level of the seasonal thermocline during spring and summer. These results can provide an explanation for the anoxic intervals observed in the Baltic Sea during extended warm periods.","[Hordoir, Robinson] Inst Marine Res, POB 1870, N-5817 Bergen, Norway; [Hordoir, Robinson; Fransner, Filippa] Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, Bergen, Norway; [Samuelsson, Patrick; Schimanke, Semjon] Swedish Meteorol & Hydrol Inst, Norrkoping, Sweden; [Fransner, Filippa] Bergen Univ, Geophys Inst, Bergen, Norway",Institute of Marine Research - Norway; Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research; Swedish Meteorological & Hydrological Institute; University of Bergen,"Hordoir, R (corresponding author), Inst Marine Res, POB 1870, N-5817 Bergen, Norway.",robinson.hordoir@hi.no,"Fransner, Filippa/AAZ-6647-2020; Hordoir, Robinson/AAZ-6174-2020","Fransner, Filippa/0000-0001-8280-4018; ","SmartSea project of the Strategic Research Council of Academy of Finland [292 985]; BONUS (Art 185) - EU; BONUS (Art 185) - Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agriculture Sciences and Spatial Planning (FORMAS)","SmartSea project of the Strategic Research Council of Academy of Finland; BONUS (Art 185) - EU; BONUS (Art 185) - Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agriculture Sciences and Spatial Planning (FORMAS)","This work was funded by the SmartSea project of the Strategic Research Council of Academy of Finland, grant No: 292 985.

A white exterior surface, so-called cool roof, applied to decrease cooling loads and to save energy, increases the condensation risk due to lower energy gains at day time. The nightly overcooling phenomena will be intensified and leads to much lower temperature at the exterior surface compared to a standard roof. Observations (Energy Design Update (R) 2006) show that the increased condensation risk may lead to moisture damage. There have been questions raised about the sustainability of using cool roof membranes in Northern US climate zones due to the potential of moisture accumulation below the membrane. Transient hygrothermal simulation using real climate data are state of the art today and can help to study different effects. Variations of several input parameter, such as short-wave absorptivity of the solar radiation, ventilation underneath the membrane with interior or exterior air, specific climate data, etc., show their influences on the moisture accumulation underneath the membrane of a typical mechanically attached roof systems for commercial buildings. Consequently, the most significant input parameter can be determined and used as additional criteria for a better design.","[Pallin, Simon] Chalmers, Chalmers, Sweden; [Kehrer, Manfred] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Oak Ridge, TN USA",Chalmers University of Technology; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Oak Ridge National Laboratory,"Pallin, S (corresponding author), Chalmers, Chalmers, Sweden.",simon.pallin@chalmers.se; kehrerm@ornl.gov,,"Pallin, Simon/0000-0001-7197-6746",,,,,22,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",2194-9832,,978-3-319-04531-3; 978-3-319-04530-6,BUILD PATHOL REHABIL,,,2014,,,,,197,215,,10.1007/978-3-319-04531-3_9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-04531-3_9,10.1007/978-3-319-04531-3,,19,Thermodynamics; Construction & Building Technology,Book Citation Index – Science (BKCI-S),Thermodynamics; Construction & Building Technology,BB4PK,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000343290600009,View Full Record in Web of Science

Mean burned area fraction derived from MODIS date of burning product was implemented in a set of 1-year long WRF-NMM/SSiB2 model simulations. Vegetation cover fraction and LAI were degraded daily based on mean burned area fraction and on the survival rate for each vegetation land cover type. Additionally, ground darkening associated with wildfire-induced ash and charcoal deposition was imposed through lower ground albedo for a period after burning. In general, wildfire-induced vegetation and ground condition deterioration increased mean surface albedo by exposing the brighter bare ground, which in turn caused a decrease in monthly surface net radiation. On average, the wildfire-season albedo increase was approximately 6.3 % over the Sahel. The associated decrease in surface available energy caused a drop in surface sensible heat flux to the atmosphere during the dry months of winter and early spring, which gradually transitioned to a more substantial decrease in surface evapotranspiration in April and May that lessened throughout the rainy season. Overall, post-fire land condition deterioration resulted in a decrease in precipitation over sub-Saharan Africa, associated with the weakening of the West African monsoon progression through the region. A decrease in atmospheric moisture flux convergence was observed in the burned area simulations, which played a dominant role in reducing precipitation in the area, especially in the months preceding the monsoon onset. The areas with the largest precipitation impact were those covered by savannas and rainforests, where annual precipitation decreased by 3.8 and 3.3 %, respectively. The resulting precipitation decrease and vegetation deterioration caused a drop in gross primary productivity in the region, which was strongest in late winter and early spring. This study suggests the cooling and drying of atmosphere induced by burned areas caused the strengthening of subsidence during pre-onset and weakening of upward atmospheric motion during onset and mature stages of the monsoon leading to a waning of convective instability and precipitation. Monthly mid-tropospheric vertical wind showed a strengthening of downward motion in winter and spring seasons, and weakening of upward movement during the rainy months. Furthermore, precipitation energy analysis revealed that most of precipitation decrease originated from convective events, which supports the hypothesis of reduced convective instability due to wildfires.","[De Sales, Fernando; Xue, Yongkang; Okin, Gregory S.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Geog, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; [Xue, Yongkang] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Los Angeles, CA USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"De Sales, F (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Geog, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA.",fsales@ucla.edu,"Okin, Greg/D-3226-2019; De Sales, Fernando/J-7959-2019; xue, yongkang/M-6756-2018","xue, yongkang/0000-0002-6169-9631",NASA [NNX-11AQ16G S04]; NSF [AGS-1115506],NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),This study was funded by NASA grant NNX-11AQ16G S04 and NSF Grant AGS-1115506.

Here we show that across continental Africa, the estimated geographic range of climatic suitability for malaria transmission is more sensitive to the precipitation threshold than the thermal response curve applied. To address this problem we use downscaled daily climate predictions from seven GCMs to run a continental-scale hydrological model for a process-based representation of mosquito breeding habitat availability. A more complex pattern of malaria suitability emerges as water is routed through drainage networks and river corridors serve as year-round transmission foci. The estimated hydro-climatically suitable area for stable malaria transmission is smaller than previous models suggest and shows only a very small increase in state-of-the-art future climate scenarios. However, bigger geographical shifts are observed than with most rainfall threshold models and the pattern of that shift is very different when using a hydrological model to estimate surface water availability for vector breeding.","[Smith, M.

Nowadays, many people worldwide are forced to work from their housing units due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the existing residential buildings were only designed for living activities, not for desk-related tasks. This is more critical in tropical regions with the overabundance of indoor daylight and lack of external shadings on existing buildings. Despite the limitations for modifying the external facades, interior retrofit plays a major role in improving visual environments. Daylighting performances of various configurations, including internal shading devices, interior surfaces, and window films, were experimented with the Radiance-IES program. A field measurement of daylight was conducted in a home office room under the Malaysian tropical sky to validate the simulated results. This research proved that the existing residential buildings in the tropical climates had poor daylighting performance where the mean indoor illuminance could be over 10,000 lx. The combination of a light shelf, a partial blind, and the tinted window film could effectively 85% alleviate the excessive indoor daylight level.

From the ensemble mean of the CCMs, the BDC exhibits strengthening trends in both the 20th and 21st centuries; however, the acceleration rates of tropical upwelling and southern downwelling during 2001-2050 are smaller than those during 1960-2000, while the acceleration rate of the northern downward branch of the BDC during 2001-2050 is slightly larger than that during 1960-2000. The differences in the extratropical downwelling trends between the two periods are closely related to changes in planetary-wave propagation into the stratosphere caused by the combined effects of increases in the concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and changes in stratospheric ozone. Model simulations demonstrate that the response of southern downwelling to stratospheric ozone depletion is larger than that to the increase in GHGs, but that the latter plays a more important role in the strengthening of northern downwelling. This result suggests that, under the expected future climate, northern downwelling will play a more important role in balancing tropical upwelling.","[Hu, Dingzhu; Xu, Qi; Wang, Xudong; Liu, Meichen] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, CIC FEMD, Joint Int Res Lab Climate & Environm Change ILCEC, Key Lab Meteorol Disasters,China Minist Educ KLME, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Guo, Yipeng] Nanjing Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Mesoscale Severe Weather, Nanjing 210093, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Guo, Yipeng] Nanjing Univ, Sch Atmospher Sci, Nanjing 210093, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Wang, Feiyang; Li, Yuanpu; Sang, Wenjun] Lanzhou Univ, Coll Atmospher Sci, Minist Educ, Key Lab Semiarid Climate Change, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China",Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Nanjing University; Nanjing University; Lanzhou University,"Guo, YP (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Mesoscale Severe Weather, Nanjing 210093, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.;Guo, YP (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ, Sch Atmospher Sci, Nanjing 210093, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",guoyp@nju.edu.cn,,"Li, Yuanpu/0000-0003-3047-5675","Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province of China [BK20160949]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41330425, 41675039, 91537213]; Postdoctoral Science Foundation of China [2016M591882]; PAPD project of Jiangsu Province",Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province of China(Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Postdoctoral Science Foundation of China(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); PAPD project of Jiangsu Province,"The authors are grateful to the groups and agencies for providing the datasets used in this study.

The focus of this study is the relative role of the mean upper ocean density structure vs. anomalous wind forcing in controlling the spectral characteristics of tropical Pacific interannual variability. It is shown that an extensive South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ) creates a potential vorticity (PV) barrier in the Southern Hemisphere similar to the one associated with the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) in the Northern Hemisphere in both climate models. The PV barrier in the Southern Hemisphere strongly constrains the mean equator-ward flow in the ocean model pycnocline, creating a '' choke point '' for the mean flow around 10 degrees S. It is then examined whether the PV barrier can also limit the anomalous flow associated with mass recharge/discharge to/from the equatorial thermocline at interannual timescales. If the anomalous flow were impeded by the mean PV structure the meridional extent of the area involved in the mass recharge/discharge process would be narrower, leading to a shorter adjustment (and ENSO) timescale. Comparison of the two climate models, both of which have similarly erroneous PV structures in the southern tropical Pacific, but different interannual timescales, shows that the meridional extent of the anomalous meridional transport is primarily controlled by the latitudinal location of the wind stress curl anomalies, while the mean state bias in the Southern Hemisphere does not seem to have any significant influence.

New to the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) is the Tier 1 Last Interglacial experiment for 127 000 years ago (lig127k), designed to address the climate responses to stronger orbital forcing than the mid-Holocene experiment, using the same state-of-the-art models as for the future and following a common experimental protocol. Here we present a first analysis of a multi-model ensemble of 17 climate models, all of which have completed the CMIP6 DECK (Diagnostic, Evaluation and Characterization of Klima) experiments. The equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) of these models varies from 1.8 to 5.6 degrees C. The seasonal character of the insolation anomalies results in strong summer warming over the Northern Hemisphere continents in the lig127k ensemble as compared to the CMIP6 piControl and much-reduced minimum sea ice in the Arctic. The multi-model results indicate enhanced summer monsoonal precipitation in the Northern Hemisphere and reductions in the Southern Hemisphere. These responses are greater in the lig127k than the CMIP6 midHolocene simulations as expected from the larger insolation anomalies at 127 than 6 ka. New synthesis for surface temperature and precipitation, targeted for 127 ka, have been developed for comparison to the multi-model ensemble. The lig127k model ensemble and data reconstructions are in good agreement for summer temperature anomalies over Canada, Scandinavia, and the North Atlantic and for precipitation over the Northern Hemisphere continents. The model-data comparisons and mismatches point to further study of the sensitivity of the simulations to uncertainties in the boundary conditions and of the uncertainties and sparse coverage in current proxy reconstructions. The CMIP6-Paleoclimate Modeling Intercomparison Project (PMIP4) lig127k simulations, in combination with the proxy record, improve our confidence in future projections of monsoons, surface temperature, and Arctic sea ice, thus providing a key target for model evaluation and optimization.","[Otto-Bliesner, Bette L.; Brady, Esther C.; Tomas, Robert] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Climate & Global Dynam Lab, Boulder, CO 80305 USA; [Zhao, Anni; Brierley, Chris M.; Isaacs, Elizabeth; Tzedakis, Polychronis C.] UCL, Environm Change Res Ctr, Dept Geog, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Axford, Yarrow] Northwestern Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Evanston, IL USA; [Capron, Emilie] Univ Copenhagen, Niels Bohr Inst, Phys Ice Climate & Earth, DK-2200 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Govin, Aline; Kageyama, Masa; Braconnot, Pascale; Sicard, Marie] Univ Paris Saclay, Lab Sci Climat & Environm CEA CNRS UVSQ, LSCE IPSL, F-91190 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Hoffman, Jeremy S.] Sci Museum Virginia, Richmond, VA 23220 USA; [Hoffman, Jeremy S.] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Ctr Environm Studies, Richmond, VA 23220 USA; [Scussolini, Paolo] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Williams, Charles J.

Understanding how these flowsfundamental players in the global distribution of heat, gases, and nutrientsrespond to climate change is currently a widely debated issue among oceanographers. Here, the authors analyze the circulation responses of these coarse-resolution coupled models to surface fluxes. Under a future CMIP5 climate pathway where the equivalent atmospheric CO2 reaches 1370 ppm by 2100, the models robustly project reduced Southern Ocean density in the upper 2000 m accompanied by strengthened stratification. Despite an overall increase in overlying wind stress (similar to 20%), the projected ACC transports lie within +/- 15% of their historical state, and no significant relationship with changes in the magnitude or position of the wind stress is identified. The models indicate that a weakening of ACC transport at the end of the twenty-first century is correlated with a strong increase in the surface heat and freshwater fluxes in the ACC region. In contrast, the surface heat gain across the ACC region and the wind-driven surface transports are significantly correlated with an increased upper and decreased lower Eulerian-mean meridional overturning circulation. The change in the eddy-induced overturning in both the depth and density spaces is quantified, and it is found that the CMIP5 models project partial eddy compensation of the upper and lower overturning cells.","[Downes, Stephanie M.] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Earth Sci, Acton, ACT 0200, Australia; Australian Natl Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Climate Syst Sci, Acton, ACT 0200, Australia",Australian National University; Australian National University,"Downes, SM (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Earth Sci, Acton, ACT 0200, Australia.",stephanie.downes@anu.edu.au,"Hogg, Andy McC./A-7553-2011; Hogg, Andy/AAZ-8733-2021","Hogg, Andy McC./0000-0001-5898-7635; Hogg, Andy/0000-0001-5898-7635",Australian Commonwealth Government; Australian Research Council Future Fellowship [FT120100842],Australian Commonwealth Government(Australian Government); Australian Research Council Future Fellowship(Australian Research Council),"The authors wish to thank the modelers responsible for the development of the CMIP5 models analyzed here and their continuous assistance with these types of multimodel projects.

A series of large-scale experiments have been performed in the context of the European HYDRALAB-PLUS PROTEUS (Protection of offshore wind turbine monopiles against scouring) project in the Fast Flow Facility in HR Wallingford. These experiments make use of state of the art optical and acoustic measurement techniques to assess the damage of scour protections under the combined action of waves and currents. These novel PROTEUS tests focus on the study of the grading of the scour protection material as a stabilizing parameter, which has never been done under the combined action of waves and currents at a large scale. Scale effects are reduced and, thus, design risks are minimized. Moreover, the generated data will support the development of future scour protection designs and the validation of numerical models used by researchers worldwide. The testing program objectives are: (i) to compare the performance of single-layer wide-graded material used against scouring with current design practices; (ii) to verify the stability of the scour protection designs under extreme flow conditions; (iii) to provide a benchmark dataset for scour protection stability at large scale; and (iv) to investigate the scale effects on scour protection stability.","[Chavez, Carlos Emilio Arboleda; Stratigaki, Vasiliki; Wu, Minghao; Troch, Peter] Univ Ghent, Dept Civil Engn, B-9052 Ghent, Belgium; [Schendel, Alexander; Welzel, Mario; Villanueva, Raul; Schlurmann, Torsten] Ludwig Franzius Inst Hydraul Estuarine & Coastal, D-30167 Hannover, Germany; [De Vos, Leen] Flemish Govt, Dept Mobil & Publ Works, Geotech Div, B-9052 Ghent, Belgium; [Kisacik, Dogan] Dokuz Eylul Univ, Inst Marine Sci & Technol, TR-35340 Izmir, Turkey; [Pinto, Francisco Taveira; Fazeres-Ferradosa, Tiago; Santos, Paulo Rosa] Univ Porto, CIIMAR Interdisciplinary Ctr Marine & Environm Re, Fac Engn, Hydraul Water Resources & Environm Div, P-4200465 Porto, Portugal; [Baelus, Leen; Szengel, Viktoria; Bolle, Annelies] Int Marine & Dredging Consultant NV, B-2018 Antwerp, Belgium; [Whitehouse, Richard; Todd, David] HR Wallingford Ltd, Howbery Pk, Wallingford OX10 8BA, Oxon, England",Ghent University; Leibniz University Hannover; Dokuz Eylul University; Universidade do Porto; HR Wallingford Limited,"Chavez, CEA (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Dept Civil Engn, B-9052 Ghent, Belgium.",carlosemilio.arboledachavez@ugent.be; vicky.stratigaki@ugent.be; minghao.wu@ugent.be; peter.troch@ugent.be; schendel@lufi.uni-hannover.de; welzel@lufi.uni-hannover.de; villanueva@lufi.uni-hannover.de; schlurmann@lufi.uni-hannover.de; leen.devos@mow.vlaanderen.be; dogan.kisacik@deu.edu.tr; fpinto@fe.up.pt; tferradosa@fe.up.pt; pjrsantos@fe.up.pt; leen.baelus@imdc.be; viktoria.szengel@imdc.be; annelies.bolle@imdc.be; r.whitehouse@hrwallingford.com; d.todd@hrwallingford.com,"Stratigaki, Vasiliki/P-5942-2014; Ferradosa, Tiago João Fazeres/AAC-2360-2019; Santos, Paulo Jorge Rosa/B-5351-2019; Pinto, Francisco T/J-8714-2015; Taveira-Pinto, Francisco/AAB-7090-2020; Schlurmann, Torsten/AAE-8223-2019; Troch, Peter/L-2463-2017; kisacik, dogan/S-5842-2019","Stratigaki, Vasiliki/0000-0002-4898-5692; Ferradosa, Tiago João Fazeres/0000-0002-8549-3320; Santos, Paulo Jorge Rosa/0000-0002-3768-3314; Pinto, Francisco T/0000-0003-4337-8428; Taveira-Pinto, Francisco/0000-0003-4337-8428; Troch, Peter/0000-0003-3274-0874; kisacik, dogan/0000-0001-5933-6770; Todd, David/0000-0003-2403-6158; Whitehouse, Richard/0000-0002-4270-6445; Schlurmann, Torsten/0000-0002-4691-7629; Villanueva, Raul/0000-0001-8264-3824; Wu, Minghao/0000-0002-2357-7238; Schendel, Alexander/0000-0003-4938-1062; Arboleda, Carlos/0000-0002-5316-4477","European Community's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program [654110]; FWO (Research Foundation-Flanders) [3G052716]; European Fund for Regional Development (FEDER), through the COMPETE2020 [POCI-01-0145-FEDER-032170]; Programa Operacional Competitividade e Internacionalizacao (POCI); FCT/MCTES through national funds (PIDDAC)","European Community's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program; FWO (Research Foundation-Flanders)(FWO); European Fund for Regional Development (FEDER), through the COMPETE2020; Programa Operacional Competitividade e Internacionalizacao (POCI); FCT/MCTES through national funds (PIDDAC)","The work described in this publication was supported by the European Community's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program through the grant to HYDRALAB-PLUS, Contract no. 654110.

Classification of NZEB is based on renewable energy (RE) supply options, energy measurement process, RE-sources location, and balances whether are energetic or exergetic. In general, it is traditionally agreed that there are three main steps to reach the NZEB performance, starting through the use of passive strategies, energy efficient technologies, and then RE generation systems. Then, these three steps could be accompanied with the smart integration of advanced efficient energy technologies. A state of the art shows that the main ZEB studies are related to: energy savings, reduce electric bills, energy independence, pollution reduction, and occupants comfort, in addition, others are more interested in the aesthetic aspect by combining modern technologies with innovations to achieve high energy and sustainability performance. Building optimization is a promising technique to evaluate NZEB design choices; it has been adopted to choose the perfect solution to reach the zero energy performance through the optimization of an objective function related to energy (thermal loads, RE generation, energy savings) and/or environment (CO2 emissions) and/or economy (life-cycle cost (LCC), net-present value (NPV), investment cost). This paper starts by presenting the global energetic and pollution challenges the world faces. Moreover, it shows, to the best to the author's knowledge, the existing NZEB definitions and the corresponding case studies investigated in 8 different climatic zones (humid continental, humid subtropical, Mediterranean, moderate continental, moderate continental, marine west coast, tropical, semi-arid and hot), the paper also focus on the importance to treat each climate separately. Even in the same country, two or more climates may co-exist. NZEBs drawbacks are also presented. Furthermore, different optimization problems are reviewed in the last section. Building energy optimization methods are employed to obtain the ideal solution for specific objective functions which are either related to energy, and/or environment and/or economy. Optimization variables are distributed between passive and/or RE generation systems. Finally, a table summarizing the most commonly used electric and thermal RE applications which yield to the zero energy balance in each climate, as well as three flowcharts are presented to summarize the whole three-stage procedure, to reach NZEB, starting from building designing, passing through the optimization procedure, and lastly categorizing the zero energy balance.","[Harkouss, Fatima; Fardoun, Farouk] Lebanese Univ, Dept GIM, Univ Inst Technol, Saida, Lebanon; [Harkouss, Fatima; Biwole, Pascal Henry] Univ Cote dAzur, CNRS, JA Dieudonne Lab, UMR 7351, Parc Valrose, F-06108 Nice, France; [Biwole, Pascal Henry] PSL Res Univ, MINES ParisTech, PERSEE Ctr Proc Renewable Energies & Energy Syst, CS 10207, F-06904 Sophia Antipolis, France",Lebanese University; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Cote d'Azur; UDICE-French Research Universities; PSL Research University Paris; MINES ParisTech,"Fardoun, F (corresponding author), Lebanese Univ, Dept GIM, Univ Inst Technol, Saida, Lebanon.",ffardoun@ul.edu.lb,"Biwole, Pascal/Q-7246-2017","Biwole, Pascal/0000-0001-6325-1390",Lebanese University; association of specialization and scientific orientation,Lebanese University; association of specialization and scientific orientation,The authors would like to thank the Lebanese University as well as the association of specialization and scientific orientation for their support.,,140,36,36,3,53,TSINGHUA UNIV PRESS,BEIJING,"TSINGHUA UNIV, RM A703, XUEYAN BLDG, BEIJING, 100084, PEOPLES R CHINA",1996-3599,1996-8744,,BUILD SIMUL-CHINA,Build.

Here, we investigate how a glacial relict species (Saduria entomon), having relatively cold, low salinity biogeographic origin, could be affected by the combined scenarios of climate change and eutrophication. It is an important prey for higher trophic-level species such as cod, and a predator of other benthic animals. We constructed habitat distribution models based occurrence and density of this species across the entire Baltic and estimated the relative importance of different driving variables. We then used two regional coupled oceanbiogeochemical models to investigate the combined impacts of two future climate change and nutrient loads scenarios on its spatial distribution in 2070-2100. According to the scenarios, the Baltic Sea will become warmer and fresher. Our results show that expected changes in salinity and temperature outrank those due to two nutrient-load scenarios (Baltic Sea Action Plan and business as usual) in their effect on S. entomon distribution. The results are relatively similar when using different models with the same scenarios, thereby increasing the confidence of projections. Overall, our models predict a net increase (and local declines) of suitable habitat area, total abundance and biomass for this species, which is probably facilitated by strong osmoregulation ability and tolerance to temperature changes. We emphasize the necessity of considering multiple hydrographic variables when estimating climate change impacts on species living in brackish and and estuarine systems.","[Gogina, Mayya; Zettler, Michael L.; Radtke, Hagen] Leibniz Inst Baltic Sea Res, Seestr 15, D-18119 Rostock, Germany; [Wahlstroem, Irene; Andersson, Helen] Swedish Meteorol & Hydrog Inst, SE-60176 Norrkoping, Sweden; [Kuznetsov, Ivan] Helmholtz Zentrum Polar & Meeresforsch, Alfred Wegener Inst, AWI Campus,Klussmannstr 3d,Postfach 12016, D-27515 Bremerhaven, Germany; [MacKenzie, Brian R.] Tech Univ Denmark, Natl Inst Aquatic Resources, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark","Leibniz Institut fur Ostseeforschung Warnemunde; Helmholtz Association; Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar & Marine Research; Technical University of Denmark","Gogina, M (corresponding author), Leibniz Inst Baltic Sea Res, Seestr 15, D-18119 Rostock, Germany.",mayya.gogina@io-warnemuende.de,"MacKenzie, Brian R./T-9379-2019; Kuznetsov, Ivan/ABC-6870-2020; Gogina, Mayya/C-4922-2014","MacKenzie, Brian R./0000-0002-4798-0363; Kuznetsov, Ivan/0000-0001-5910-8081; Gogina, Mayya/0000-0003-0909-4296; Zettler, Michael Lothar/0000-0002-5437-5495",BMBF project KUNO Project SECOS-Synthese - German Federal Ministry for Education and Research [03F0738]; Leibniz Institute for Baltic Sea Research within the BONUS Ecosupport project [217246]; BONUS BIO-C3 project (EU FP7 Art 185); European Community; Clime Marine project by the Swedish Research Council Formas [2017-01949],BMBF project KUNO Project SECOS-Synthese - German Federal Ministry for Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); Leibniz Institute for Baltic Sea Research within the BONUS Ecosupport project; BONUS BIO-C3 project (EU FP7 Art 185); European Community(European Commission); Clime Marine project by the Swedish Research Council Formas(Swedish Research Council Formas),"MG and HR were funded by the BMBF project KUNO Project SECOS-Synthese (03F0738) supported by the German Federal Ministry for Education and Research.

These changes were not easy to simulate for actual phenologies because of the rudimentary temporal (season) and spatial (regional) resolution of climate model projections. We investigate the effect of climate change on the regional incidence of a pest insect with nearly worldwide distribution and very high potential for adaptation to season length and temperature - the Codling Moth, Cydia pomonella. Seasonal and regional climate change signals were downscaled to the hourly temporal scale of a pest phenology model and the spatial scale of pest habitats using a stochastic weather generator operating at daily scale in combination with a re-sampling approach for simulation of hourly weather data. Under future conditions of increased temperatures (2045-2074), the present risk of below 20% for a pronounced second generation (peak larval emergence) in Switzerland will increase to 70-100%. The risk of an additional third generation will increase from presently 0-2% to 100%. We identified a significant two-week shift to earlier dates in phenological stages, such as overwintering adult flight. The relative extent (magnitude) of first generation pupae and all later stages will significantly increase. The presence of first generation pupae and later stages will be prolonged. A significant decrease in the length of overlap of first and second generation larval emergence was identified. Such shifts in phenology may induce changes in life-history traits regulating the life cycle. An accordingly life-history adaptation in photoperiodic diapause induction to shorter day-length is expected and would thereby even more increase the risk of an additional generation. With respect to Codling Moth management, the shifts in phenology and voltinism projected here will require adaptations of plant protection strategies to maintain their sustainability.","[Stoeckli, Sibylle; Samietz, Joerg] ACW, Agroscope Changins Wadenswil Res Stn, Wadenswil, Switzerland; [Hirschi, Martin; Spirig, Christoph; Rotach, Mathias W.] Fed Off Meteorol & Climatol MeteoSwiss, Zurich, Switzerland; [Calanca, Pierluigi] Agroscope Reckenholz Tanikon Res Stn ART, Zurich, Switzerland; [Rotach, Mathias W.] Univ Innsbruck, Inst Meteorol & Geophys, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria",Swiss Federal Research Station Agroscope; Federal Office of Meteorology & Climatology (MeteoSwiss); Swiss Federal Research Station Agroscope; Swiss Federal Research Station for Agroecology & Agriculture; University of Innsbruck,"Stoeckli, S (corresponding author), ACW, Agroscope Changins Wadenswil Res Stn, Wadenswil, Switzerland.",sibylle.stoeckli@acw.admin.ch,"Hirschi, Martin/ABF-1564-2020; Rotach, Mathias/E-9938-2018; Spirig, Christoph/D-2471-2014","Hirschi, Martin/0000-0001-9154-756X; Rotach, Mathias/0000-0003-2283-309X; Spirig, Christoph/0000-0001-9535-7333",Swiss State Secretariat for Education and Research SER [C09.0052]; National Centre of Competence in Research on Climate (NCCR Climate) of the Swiss National Science Foundation,Swiss State Secretariat for Education and Research SER; National Centre of Competence in Research on Climate (NCCR Climate) of the Swiss National Science Foundation,"The project was funded by the Swiss State Secretariat for Education and Research SER (grant number C09.0052) in the framework of COST 734 (Impacts of Climate Change and Variability on European Agriculture - CLIVAGRI).

In general, the models are too warm relative to the observations, especially in winter, where the difference is of the order of 10 degrees C over western Europe. One of the causes of this discrepancy may be related to the low spatial resolution of these models. To assess the impact of using high-resolution models on simulated climate sensitivity, we use three approaches to obtain high-resolution climate simulations over Europe: first art atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) with a stretched grid over Europe, second a homogeneous T106 AGCM (high resolution everywhere on the globe) and last a limited area model (LAM) nested in a low-resolution AGCM. With all three methods, we have performed simulations of the European climate for present and LGM conditions, according to the experimental design recommended by the Palaeoclimate Modeling Intercomparison Project (PMIP). Model results have been compared with updated pollen-based palaeoclimatic indicators for temperature and precipitation that were initially developed in PMIP. For each model, a low-resolution global run was also performed. As expected, the low-resolution simulations underestimate the large cooling indicated by pollen data, especially in winter, despite revised slightly warmer reconstructions of the temperatures of the coldest month, and show results in the range of those obtained in PMIP with similar models. The two high-resolution AGCMs do not improve the temperature field and cannot account for the discrepancy between model results and data, especially in winter. However, they are able to reproduce trends in precipitation more closely than their low-resolution counterparts do, but the simulated climates are still not as arid as depicted by the data. Conversely, the LAM temperature results compare well with climate reconstructions in winter but the simulated hydrological cycle is not consistent with the data. Finally, these results are discussed in regard of other possible causes for discrepancies between models and palaeoclimatic reconstructions for the LGM European climate.","Univ Paris 06, UMR 7619 Sisyphe, Paris, France; Univ Bristol, BRIDGE, Sch Geog Sci, Bristol BS8 1SS, Avon, England; CEA CNRS, Lab Sci Climat & Environm, IPSL, UMR, Gif Sur Yvette, France; Univ Tokyo, CCSR, Tokyo, Japan; Univ Franche Comte, Lab Chronoecol, CNRS, UMR 6565, F-25030 Besancon, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; University of Bristol; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Cite; Universite Paris Saclay; CEA; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); University of Tokyo; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Franche-Comte,"Jost, A (corresponding author), Univ Paris 06, UMR 7619 Sisyphe, Paris, France.",Anne.Jost@ccr.jussieu.fr,"Jost, Anne/AAW-3993-2020; Ramstein, Gilles/L-3328-2014; Lunt, Daniel J/G-9451-2011; Valdes, Paul/C-4129-2013; KAGEYAMA, Masa/F-2389-2010; Valdes, Paul/T-2004-2019; Abe-Ouchi, Ayako/M-6359-2013","Ramstein, Gilles/0000-0002-1522-917X; Lunt, Daniel J/0000-0003-3585-6928; KAGEYAMA, Masa/0000-0003-0822-5880; Valdes, Paul/0000-0002-1902-3283; Abe-Ouchi, Ayako/0000-0003-1745-5952",,,,,42,121,121,0,18,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0930-7575,,,CLIM DYNAM,Clim.

The index allows for the very first assessment of atmospherically driven intense sea level oscillations at the tsunami timescale (< 2 hr) in future climates. The index has been computed using outputs from evaluation, historical, and three scenario MED-11_CNRM Med-CORDEX regional atmospheric climate runs. The reliability of the index has been verified against reanalysis simulations and on documented meteotsunami events. No significant changes in the index are projected under RCP2.6 and RCP4.5 scenarios, while the yearly number of days with meteotsunamis is expected to increase by 34% under the RCP8.5 scenario by the year 2100. This increase will dominantly occur during the summer season (May-August), being contemporaneous with maximum index values. The presented results are relevant for assessment of sea level extremes worldwide, since high-frequency sea level oscillations may contribute up to 40% of the total range. Plain Language Summary The study aims to develop the proxy methodology to be used for assessment of meteotsunamis-atmospherically driven waves in a tsunami frequency band-in the future climate, as the present climate models are far from reproduction of processes on a minute and a kilometer scale. The proxy estimates are based on connecting synoptic parameters and patterns to the high-frequency sea level observations. The methodology is successfully verified for Ciutadella harbor, a known hot spot for meteotsunamis, on state-of-the-art reanalysis data. It seems that meteotsunamis are likely not to increase in all but business-as-usual (RCP8.5) climate scenarios, where the increase is matching the season when meteotsunami reach their maximum (spring-summer). The methodology might be useful for assessing meteotsunami hazard in future climates, while being applied at places where meteotsunamis are driven dominantly by a single atmospheric process. Global and regional analyses indicate that these might encompass the majority of midlatitudal regions.","[Vilibic, Ivica; Sepic, Jadranka; Dunic, Natalija] Inst Oceanog & Fisheries, Split, Croatia; [Sevault, Florence] Meteo France, CNRM UMR 3589, Toulouse, France; [Monserrat, Sebastian; Jorda, Gabriel] Univ Balearic Isl, Dept Phys, Palma de Mallorca, Spain; [Jorda, Gabriel] Ctr Oceanog Balears, Inst Espanol Oceanog, Palma de Mallorca, Spain",Croatian Institute of Oceanography & Fisheries (IZOR); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Earth Sciences & Astronomy (INSU); Meteo France; Universitat de les Illes Balears; Spanish Institute of Oceanography,"Vilibic, I (corresponding author), Inst Oceanog & Fisheries, Split, Croatia.",vilibic@izor.hr,"Sepic, Jadranka/V-4466-2018; Vilibic, Ivica/AAE-5160-2019; Monserrat, Sebastian/G-9641-2015","Sepic, Jadranka/0000-0002-5624-1351; Monserrat, Sebastian/0000-0002-5965-4872",CLIFISH project (Spanish MINECO grant) [CTM2015-66400-C3-2-R]; MESSI (UKF) [25/15]; ADIOS (Croatian Science Foundation) [IP-2016-06-1955],CLIFISH project (Spanish MINECO grant); MESSI (UKF); ADIOS (Croatian Science Foundation),"We sincerely thank Centre National de Recherches Meteorologiques for providing access to variables sourced from EVAL, HIST, RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5 simulations, Ports de les Illes Balears, Govern de les Illes Balears, Palma de Mallorca for providing us with tide gauge data at Ciutadella, and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts for providing the atmospheric reanalysis data (accessible at www.ecmwf.int).Comments raised by two anonymous reviewers were greatly appreciated.

The ENEA-REG system is made up of two interchangeable regional climate models as atmospheric components (RegCM, REGional Climate Model, and WRF, Weather Research and Forecasting), a river model (Hydrological Discharge, HD), and an ocean model (Massachusetts Institute of Technology General Circulation Model, MITgcm); processes taking place at the land surface are represented within the atmospheric models with the possibility to use several land surface schemes of different complexity. The coupling between these components is performed through the RegESM driver. Here, we present and describe our regional Earth system model and evaluate its components using a multidecadal hindcast simulation over the period 1980-2013 driven by ERA-Interim reanalysis. We show that the atmospheric components correctly reproduce both large-scale and local features of the Euro-Mediterranean climate, although we found some remarkable biases: in particular, WRF has a significant cold bias during winter over the northeastern bound of the domain and a warm bias in the whole continental Europe during summer, while RegCM overestimates the wind speed over the Mediterranean Sea. Similarly, the ocean component correctly reproduces the analyzed ocean properties with performances comparable to the state-of-art coupled regional models contributing to the Med-CORDEX initiative. Our regional Earth system model allows studying the Euro-Mediterranean climate system and can be applied to both hindcast and scenario simulations.","[Anav, Alessandro; Carillo, Adriana; Palma, Massimiliano; Struglia, Maria Vittoria; Sannino, Gianmaria] Italian Natl Agcy New Technol Energy & Environm, ENEA, Rome, Italy; [Turuncoglu, Ufuk Utku] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA",Italian National Agency New Technical Energy & Sustainable Economics Development; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA,"Anav, A (corresponding author), Italian Natl Agcy New Technol Energy & Environm, ENEA, Rome, Italy.",alessandro.anav@enea.it,"Struglia, Maria Vittoria/AAD-6738-2022; Carillo, Adriana/AAF-7596-2022; Carillo, Adriana/AFK-0627-2022; Anav, Alessandro/P-2284-2018","Struglia, Maria Vittoria/0000-0002-0821-333X; Anav, Alessandro/0000-0002-4217-7563; Sannino, Gianmaria/0000-0002-3985-9432; Carillo, Adriana/0000-0003-4955-3047","SOCLIMACT project (DownScaling CLImate imPACTs and decarbonisation pathways in EU islands, and enhancing socioeconomic and non-market evaluation of Climate Change for Europe, for 2050 and beyond); National Center for Atmospheric Research - National Science Foundation [1852977]; ENEA; Italian National Agency for New Technologies, Energy and Sustainable Economic Development; European research programs","SOCLIMACT project (DownScaling CLImate imPACTs and decarbonisation pathways in EU islands, and enhancing socioeconomic and non-market evaluation of Climate Change for Europe, for 2050 and beyond); National Center for Atmospheric Research - National Science Foundation; ENEA(ENEA, Italy); Italian National Agency for New Technologies, Energy and Sustainable Economic Development(ENEA, Italy); European research programs","This research has been supported by the SOCLIMACT project (DownScaling CLImate imPACTs and decarbonisation pathways in EU islands, and enhancing socioeconomic and non-market evaluation of Climate Change for Europe, for 2050 and beyond).

However, so far little is known about the performance of ERA5 over the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS). In this study, we compare the near-surface climate from the new ERA5 reanalysis to ERA-Interim, the Arctic System Reanalysis (ASR) as well as to a state-of-the-art polar regional climate model (MAR). The results show (1) that ERA5 does not outperform ERA-Interim significantly when compared with near-surface climate observations over GrIS, but ASR better models the near-surface temperature than both ERA reanalyses. (2) Polar regional climate models (e.g., MAR) are still a useful tool to downscale the GrIS climate compared to ERA5, as in particular the near-surface temperature in summer has a key role for representing snow and ice processes such as the surface melt. However, assimilating satellite data and using a more recent radiative scheme enable both ERA and ASR reanalyses to represent more satisfactorily than MAR the downward solar and infrared fluxes. (3) MAR near-surface climate is not affected when forced at its lateral boundaries by either ERA5 or ERA-Interim. Therefore, forcing polar regional climate models with ERA5 starting from 1950 will enable long and homogeneous surface mass balance reconstructions.","[Delhasse, Alison; Kittel, Christoph; Amory, Charles; Hofer, Stefan; Fettweis, Xavier] Univ Liege, Dept Geog, Lab Climatol, SPHERES, Liege, Belgium; [Hofer, Stefan] Univ Bristol, Sch Geog Sci, Bristol, Avon, England; [van, Dirk; Fausto, Robert S.] Geol Survey Denmark & Greenland GEUS, DK-1350 Copenhagen, Denmark",University of Liege; University of Bristol; Geological Survey Of Denmark & Greenland,"Delhasse, A (corresponding author), Univ Liege, Dept Geog, Lab Climatol, SPHERES, Liege, Belgium.",alison.delhasse@uliege.be,"Fausto, Robert S./K-6185-2018","Fausto, Robert S./0000-0003-1317-8185; Kittel, Christoph/0000-0001-6586-9784; Amory, Charles/0000-0002-5906-4303; Hofer, Stefan/0000-0002-5249-1249; Fettweis, Xavier/0000-0002-4140-3813; van As, Dirk/0000-0002-6553-8982; Delhasse, Alison/0000-0003-0961-1601",Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique de Belgique (F.R.S.FNRS) [2.5020.11]; Tier-1 supercomputer (Zenobe) of the Federation Wallonie Bruxelles infrastructure - Walloon Region [1117545],Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique de Belgique (F.R.S.FNRS)(Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique - FNRS); Tier-1 supercomputer (Zenobe) of the Federation Wallonie Bruxelles infrastructure - Walloon Region,"Computational resources have been provided by the Consortium des Equipements de Calcul Intensif (CECI), funded by the Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique de Belgique (F.R.S.FNRS) under grant no. 2.5020.11 and the Tier-1 supercomputer (Zenobe) of the Federation Wallonie Bruxelles infrastructure funded by the Walloon Region under grant agreement no. 1117545.

New buildings on the MIT campus are not following the example of the bizarre Stata Center. The robotic exoskeleton is a valuable development made under unusual conditions. No attempt is made to judge ethics or long-term effects of WikiLeaks activity but it is shown to be wide ranging and to be defended eloquently by its main operative. Practical implications - The need to reduce carbon emissions is confirmed by studies of the oceans, probably among other factors.

Interdisciplinary initiatives seeking to understand and exploit the potential benefits of seasonal forecasts for agriculture have produced a number of quantitative ex-ante assessments of the economic value of seasonal climate forecasts. The realism, robustness, and credibility of such assessments become increasingly important as efforts shift from basic research toward applied research and implementation. This paper surveys published evidence about the economic value of seasonal climate forecasts for agriculture, characterizing the agricultural systems, approaches followed, and scales of analysis. The climate forecast valuation literature has contributed insights into the influence of forecast characteristics, risk attitudes, insurance, policy, and the scale of adoption on the value of forecasts. Key innovations in the more recent literature include explicit treatment of the uncertainty of forecast value estimates, incorporation of elicited management responses into bioeconomic modeling, and treatment of environmental impacts, in addition to financial outcomes of forecast response. It is argued that the picture of the value of seasonal forecasts for agriculture is still incomplete and often biased, in part because of significant gaps in published valuation research. Key gaps include sampling of a narrow range of farming systems and locations, incorporation of an overly restricted set of potential management responses, failure to consider forecast responses that could lead to regime shifts, and failure to incorporate state-of-the-art developments in seasonal forecasting. This paper concludes with six recommendations to enhance the realism, robustness, and credibility of ex-ante valuation of seasonal climate forecasts.","[Meza, Francisco J.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Agron & Ingn Forestal, Santiago 30622, Chile; [Hansen, James W.; Osgood, Daniel] Columbia Univ, Int Res Inst Climate & Soc, New York, NY USA",Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile; Columbia University,"Meza, FJ (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Agron & Ingn Forestal, Santiago 30622, Chile.",fmeza@puc.cl,"Meza, Francisco J/F-9297-2014; Hansen, James W/M-1449-2015","Hansen, James W/0000-0002-8599-7895; Meza, Francisco/0000-0002-9853-227X",,,,,91,98,100,1,29,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",1558-8424,1558-8432,,J APPL METEOROL CLIM,J.

Such effects are often manifested in reductions in net primary productivity (NPP). Investigating a Europe-wide network of annual radial tree growth records confirms this pattern: we find that 28% of tree ring width (TRW) indices are below two standard deviations in years in which extremely low precipitation, high temperatures or the combination of both noticeably affect tree growth. Based on these findings, we investigate possibilities for detecting climate-driven patterns in long-term TRW data to evaluate state-of-the-art dynamic vegetation models such as the Lund-Potsdam-Jena dynamic global vegetation model for managed land (LPJmL). The major problem in this context is that LPJmL simulates NPP but not explicitly the radial tree growth, and we need to develop a generic method to allow for a comparison between simulated and observed response patterns. We propose an analysis scheme that quantifies the coincidence rate of climate extremes with some biotic responses (here TRW or simulated NPP). We find a relative reduction of 34% in simulated NPP during precipitation, temperature and combined extremes. This reduction is comparable to the TRW response patterns, but the model responds much more sensitively to drought stress. We identify 10 extreme years during the 20th century during which both model and measurements indicate high coincidence rates across Europe. However, we detect substantial regional differences in simulated and observed responses to climatic extreme events. One explanation for this discrepancy could be the tendency of tree ring data to originate from climatically stressed sites. The difference between model and observed data is amplified by the fact that dynamic vegetation models are designed to simulate mean ecosystem responses on landscape or regional scales. We find that both simulation results and measurements display carry-over effects from climate anomalies during the previous year. We conclude that radial tree growth chronologies provide a suitable basis for generic model benchmarks. The broad application of coincidence analysis in generic model benchmarks along with an increased availability of representative long-term measurements and improved process-based models will refine projections of the long-term carbon balance in terrestrial ecosystems.","[Rammig, A.; Wiedermann, M.; Donges, J.

Although two thirds of the global rivers are regulated by dams, the impacts of river regulation on stream temperature and thermoelectricity production have not been evaluated in previous studies. Using a state-of-the-art integrated water cycle model and a power generation model, we quantify the impacts of river regulation on stream temperature and usable capacity of once-through thermoelectric power in the United States. Our study demonstrates that by lowering stream temperature and increasing water availability during the low-flow season, river regulation can curtail the loss of summer power plant usable capacity induced by climate change. The alleviation of power loss by water management is comparable to that resulting from emission mitigation that reduces warming in the future. Our new findings highlight the necessity of incorporating water management effects in thermoelectric power vulnerability assessment.","[Zhang, Xiao; Leung, L.

We demonstrated the methodology on scenarios representing sequential enhancements of the cloudburst management plan for a district that has been appointed to become the first climate resilient neighbourhood in Copenhagen. The results show that if the cloudburst system is exploited to discharge runoff from selected areas that are disconnected from the combined sewer system, then the plan leads to multiple benefits.

Time series analysis of high-resolution imagery showed that permafrost degradation increased the area of three large fens by 26% from 1949 to 2018, but surprisingly permafrost also aggraded in small areas. Permafrost soils in adjacent birch forests frequently had fen peat near the surface indicating recent permafrost degradation and aggradation. We attribute groundwater as the primary driver of recent permafrost degradation, while climate extremes (especially cold, less snowy winters) caused recent permafrost aggradation, but only after ecological succession provided conditions favorable for permafrost formation. Near-surface groundwater temperatures during early winters (2-6 degrees C during 2011-2014) contributed to a near steady rate of lateral permafrost degradation (0.36 m/yr) over three periods. Fairbanks climate records (1904-2019) showed large ranges in mean winter temperatures (12 degrees C) and snow depths (69 cm) between cold, less snowy winters and warm, snowy winters. During ecological succession from the collapsing margins to the fen centers over a similar to 250-yr period, vegetation transitioned from aquatic forbs to shrubs and mosses, water depths decreased, and the soil carbon stock of new peat increased. These interactions among permafrost, groundwater, climate warming, and succession complicate our ability to project future ecological transitions and soil carbon changes across this dynamic boreal lowland landscape. The more frequent warm, snowy winters since 2014 and model projections for warmer winters, however, indicate that the region has crossed a tipping point where permafrost will no longer form and permafrost loss is irreversible.","[Jorgenson, M.

The climate of a given region determinate the type of crops, management systems, and finally the cash return of the unit area of the land. The effect of climatic factors on agriculture and natural resource management is evident. Not only the macroclimate that affect agriculture, but also it is strongly affected by the microclimatic variation. Climatic factors affect the crop water requirements, time of cultivation, length of crop stand in the field, tolerance to pests and diseases, economic viability of agricultural production, and finally the total yield and product quality. The start point of any agricultural development is to understand the prevailing climate. The measurement of climatic data as well as the quality control of such data is the corner stone of the utilization processes. It is a costly operation and involves the utilization of a state of the art technology. Taking the case of Egypt, distribution uniformity of irrigation water and fertilizers, pests and diseases prediction, and planting dates are major problems under different climatic regions in Egypt. Uneven field surface, short furrows or small basin, losses by deep percolation, and fertilizer losses through soil profile characterize the old land. Such conditions affect water and fertilizer distribution efficiency. Early planting is one of the options for summer-cultivated crops in order to get the maximum economical yield at harvesting. Early prediction for diseases and insects is important to help the farmers avoiding heavy spray of pesticides and take necessary actions to avoid diseases. The use of climatic data could help in providing tools for proper management. The Central Laboratory for Agricultural Climate (CLAC) was established in the Agricultural Research Center in Egypt to provide information on the accurate irrigation scheduling that reduces the cost of irrigation and minimizes problems related to the misuse of water. Early pest and disease forecast and warnings allow suitable time for taking necessary actions to avoid chemical spray. Proper calculation of sowing dates ensures uniform plantation and reduces the cost of sowing seeds in several crops. The above mentioned agricultural management practices require real time weather data system covering the country. The system covers more than 33 agrometeorological stations. The data is collected automatically or manually, stored on a database, and utilized by several models and knowledge based systems. The dissemination of information occurs through different mass media facilities as well as a web page. Agricultural decision support system with mathematical and logical models is linked with a Geographical Information System (GIS) to provide tools for planning the land utilization and resource management options.","Ain Shams Univ, Cent Lab Agr Climate Agr Res Ctr, Giza, Egypt",Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Ain Shams University,"Abou-Hadid, AF (corresponding author), Ain Shams Univ, Cent Lab Agr Climate Agr Res Ctr, Giza, Egypt.",,,"Abou Hadid, Ayman/0000-0003-0548-7447",,,,,9,1,1,0,5,INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,90-6605-935-4,ACTA HORTIC,,,2002,582,,,,41,51,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2002.582.2,http://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2002.582.2,,,11,Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BV17V,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000178069400002,View Full Record in Web of Science

In 1892, Cornelius Vanderbilt II built an 11,600 m(2)Italian Renaissance style summer residence equipped with the most modern domestic technology available. This house retains original architectural finishes, furnishings, and a decorative arts collection, to give visitors insight into America's Gilded Age. The mansion's original design relied upon the ocean setting for its natural ventilation during summer occupancy; a convection heat system maintained the building through winter. A century later, risks to the collection due to extreme fluctuations in temperature and relative humidity along with rising energy costs prompted a climate modification feasibility study. The expense and complexity of conventional systems were deemed prohibitive, intrusive, and unsustainable. A high-efficiency geothermal heat pump system was chosen because it could generate conditioned, filtered air, re-use historic convection heat shafts, and significantly offset heating costs. Since going online in 2018, the system has stabilized the interior environment and considerably reduced fuel consumption. Discussion will include challenges encountered through design, installation and start-up, and assessment of environmental data.","[Miller, Patricia] Preservat Soc Newport Cty, 424 Bellevue Ave, Newport, RI 02840 USA",,"Miller, P (corresponding author), Preservat Soc Newport Cty, 424 Bellevue Ave, Newport, RI 02840 USA.",pmiller2@newportmansions.org,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0039-3630,2047-0584,,STUD CONSERV,Stud.

It has been suggested that more ambition mitigations of short-lived climate forcer (SLCF) emissions could potentially be a way to reduce the risk of overshooting the 1.5 or 2 degrees C target in a cost-effective way. In this study, we employ eight state-of-the-art integrated assessment models (IAMs) to examine the global temperature effects of ambitious reductions of methane, black and organic carbon, and hydrofluorocarbon emissions. The SLCFs measures considered are found to add significantly to the effect of the NDCs on short-term global mean temperature (GMT) (in the year 2040: - 0.03 to - 0.15 degrees C) and on reducing the short-term rate-of-change (by - 2 to 15%), but only a small effect on reducing the maximum temperature change before 2100. This, because later in the century under assumed ambitious climate policy, SLCF mitigation is maximized, either directly or indirectly due to changes in the energy system. All three SLCF groups can contribute to achieving GMT changes.","[Harmsen, Mathijre; van Vuuren, Detlef P.] PBL Netherlands Environm Assessment Agcy, Bezuidenhoutseweg 30, NL-2594 AV The Hague, Netherlands; [Harmsen, Mathijre; van Vuuren, Detlef P.] Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Heidelberglaan 2, NL-3584 CS Utrecht, Netherlands; [Fricko, Oliver; Klimont, Zbigniew; Riahi, Keywan] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Schlosspl 1, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria; [Hilaire, Jerome; Luderer, Gunnar] Leibniz Assoc, Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res PIK, POB 60 12 03, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany; [Hilaire, Jerome] Mercator Res Inst Global Commons & Climate Change, Torgauerstr 12, D-10829 Berlin, Germany; [Drouet, Laurent; Aleluia Reis, Lara] RFF CMCC European Inst Econ & Environm EIEE, Via Bergognone 34, I-20144 Milan, Italy; [Durand-Lasserve, Olivier] OECD Environm Directorate, 2 Rue Andre Pascal, F-75116 Paris, France; [Fujimori, Shinichiro] Kyoto Univ, Dept Environm Engn, Nishikyo Ku, 361,C1-3,Katsura Campus, Kyoto 6158540, Japan; [Fujimori, Shinichiro] Natl Inst Environm Studies, Ctr Social & Environm Syst Res, 16-2 Onogawa, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058506, Japan; [Keramidas, Kimon] European Commiss JRC, Edificio Expo,Calle Inca Garcilaso 3, Seville 41092, Spain; [Sano, Fuminori] Res Inst Innovat Technol Earth, 9-2 Kizugawadai, Kizugawa, Kyoto 6190292, Japan; [Smith, Steven J.] Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Joint Global Change Res Inst, 5825 Univ Res Court,Suite 3500, College Pk, MD 20740 USA",Utrecht University; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD); Kyoto University; National Institute for Environmental Studies - Japan; Research Institute of Innovative Technology for the Earth; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Pacific Northwest National Laboratory,"Harmsen, M (corresponding author), PBL Netherlands Environm Assessment Agcy, Bezuidenhoutseweg 30, NL-2594 AV The Hague, Netherlands.;Harmsen, M (corresponding author), Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Heidelberglaan 2, NL-3584 CS Utrecht, Netherlands.",j.h.m.harmsen@uu.nl,"Fujimori, Shinichiro/A-1288-2015; Fricko, Oliver/ABE-5732-2020; Drouet, Laurent/J-9894-2019; Riahi, Keywan/B-6426-2011; Klimont, Zbigniew/P-7641-2015","Fujimori, Shinichiro/0000-0001-7897-1796; Fricko, Oliver/0000-0002-6835-9883; Drouet, Laurent/0000-0002-4087-7662; Riahi, Keywan/0000-0001-7193-3498; Klimont, Zbigniew/0000-0003-2630-198X; Aleluia Reis, Lara/0000-0002-6676-7007; Smith, Steven/0000-0003-3248-5607",,,,,42,10,10,1,4,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

Study focus: The severity of climate change in Taiwan is increasing, and the average temperature in Taiwan has increased by 1.0-1.4 degrees C over the last century, which is higher than the global average. A state-of-the-art hybrid of Multi-dimensional Complementary Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (MCEEMD) and Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN) is developed for the analysis, simulation, and forecasting of extreme temperature events. The MCEEMD is first introduced to process non-stationary, nonlinear gridded climate data from 1960 to 2017. The RBFNN model is then coupled with the MCEEMD algorithm to forecast the 7-day daily maximum temperatures in Taipei. New hydrological insights for the region: Long-term time series data such as temperature exhibit non-stationarity, and non-linearity, thus making it more challenging to assessing the future trend and variability. It is shown that for daily maximum temperatures in Taipei, changes in extremes are more pronounced and impactful than changes in the mean values in response to global warming. The newly developed hybrid MCEEMD-RBFNN model is capable of analyzing the nonstationary and nonlinear daily maximum temperature data, and then forecasting the daily maximum temperature over the next 7 days. Short-term trends and variability of daily maximum temperature in Taipei can thus be identified and diagnosed for hazard prevention and risk assessment of heatwave events.","[Lin, Ming-Liang; Tsai, Christina W.; Chen, Chun-Kuang] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Taipei, Taiwan",National Taiwan University,"Tsai, CW (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Taipei, Taiwan.",cwstsai@ntu.edu.tw,,"Tsai, Christina/0000-0003-2309-6335","Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan [107-2628-E-002-002-MY3, 108-2221-E-002-011-MY3, 110-2628-E-002-008-]","Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)","The authors thank the Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan for financially supporting this research under the contract numbers MOST 107-2628-E-002-002-MY3, 108-2221-E-002-011-MY3, and 110-2628-E-002-008-.

One of the main causes of discrepancies between results has been the lack of comprehensive and systematical studies on modern pollen dispersal and deposition processes, particularly on the quantification of these processes. Based on empirical studies performed in China over the last 30 years, this paper provides the state-of-the-art of the understanding of pollen dispersal and deposition processes in China and the remaining questions to be investigated. We show that major progress has been achieved in the study of modern pollen dispersal and deposition processes, and in the application of models of the pollen-vegetation-climate relationships for quantitative reconstruction of past vegetation and climate. However, several issues are not entirely solved or understood yet, such as how to quantify the reworking and re-deposition of pollen grains in quaternary alluvial sediments, the influence of pollen preservation on pollen assemblages, and human impact on vegetation. Even so, the progress made during the last decades makes it possible to achieve significantly more precise and informative reconstructions of past vegetation, land-use and climate in China than was possible earlier.

South Africa was one of 12 original signatories to the Antarctic Treaty, ratified in 1960. The Treaty's purpose is to protect Antarctica and to set aside the continent, the surrounding sub-Antarctic islands and the Southern Ocean (mostly south of 60 degrees S), solely and permanently for peaceful purposes and for cooperative scientific research. One of the conditions of being part of the Treaty is that South Africa must maintain a year-round base on Antarctica (SANAE IV) and engage in cooperative research activities. SANAE IV conducts various forms of cutting-edge research in the fields of astronomical, atmospheric, meteorological, geological and life sciences throughout the year. In addition, the South African National Antarctic Programme (SANAP) maintains a presence on Marion Island that includes managing Marion and Prince Edward Islands and the surrounding 200 km exclusive economic zone (EEZ) as South African territory, and it also runs an important meteorological station on Gough Island. SANAP's brief includes providing logistical support for oceanographic research and weather observations in the Southern Ocean, particularly in the context of marine living resources and climate change. To fulfil this role, South Africa commissioned Finland to build a new state-of-the-art polar resupply and research vessel, the SA Agulhas II, which arrived in Cape Town in May 2012 and has since carried out a number of valuable scientific voyages.",,,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,2,WITS UNIV PRESS,JOHANNESBURG,"PO WITS, JOHANNESBURG, 2050, SOUTH AFRICA",,,978-1-86814-918-6,,,,2015,,,,,102,107,,,,,,6,Ecology; Environmental Sciences,Book Citation Index – Science (BKCI-S),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BI2DT,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000408825800037,View Full Record in Web of Science

These errors include prominently a severe dry bias over all the Northern Hemisphere monsoon regions, excessive rainfall over the ocean and an unrealistic double inter-tropical convergence zone (ITCZ) structure in the tropical Pacific. While these systematic errors can be partly reduced by increasing the horizontal atmospheric resolution of the models, they also illustrate our incomplete understanding of the key mechanisms controlling the position of the ITCZ during boreal summer. Using a large collection of coupled models and dedicated coupled experiments, we show that these tropical rainfall errors are partly associated with insufficient surface thermal forcing and incorrect representation of the surface albedo over the Northern Hemisphere continents. Improving the parameterization of the land albedo in two global coupled models leads to a large reduction of these systematic errors and further demonstrates that the Northern Hemisphere subtropical deserts play a seminal role in these improvements through a heat low mechanism.","[Terray, P.] IITM, IISc NIO IITM IRD Joint Int Lab, Indo French Cell Water Sci, Pune 411008, Maharashtra, India; [Terray, P.; Masson, S.] Univ Paris 06, UPMC, Sorbonne Univ, CNRS,IRD,MNHN,LOCEAN Lab, 4 Pl Jussieu, F-75005 Paris, France; [Sooraj, K.

However, state-of-the-art long-term global climate simulations are unable to resolve the spatiotemporal characteristics necessary for resource assessment or operational planning. We introduce an adversarial deep learning approach to super resolve wind velocity and solar irradiance outputs from global climate models to scales sufficient for renewable energy resource assessment. Using adversarial training to improve the physical and perceptual performance of our networks, we demonstrate up to a 50x resolution enhancement of wind and solar data. In validation studies, the inferred fields are robust to input noise, possess the correct small-scale properties of atmospheric turbulent flow and solar irradiance, and retain consistency at large scales with coarse data. An additional advantage of our fully convolutional architecture is that it allows for training on small domains and evaluation onarbitrarily-sized inputs, including global scale. We conclude with a super-resolution study of renewable energy resources based on climate scenario data from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Fifth Assessment Report.","[Stengel, Karen; Glaws, Andrew; King, Ryan N.] Natl Renewable Energy Lab, Computat Sci Ctr, Golden, CO 80401 USA; [Hettinger, Dylan] Natl Renewable Energy Lab, Strateg Energy Anal Ctr, Golden, CO 80401 USA",United States Department of Energy (DOE); National Renewable Energy Laboratory - USA; United States Department of Energy (DOE); National Renewable Energy Laboratory - USA,"King, RN (corresponding author), Natl Renewable Energy Lab, Computat Sci Ctr, Golden, CO 80401 USA.",Ryan.King@nrel.gov,,,US DOE [DE-AC36-08GO28308]; Laboratory Directed Research and Development (LDRD) program at the NREL; DOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy,US DOE(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Laboratory Directed Research and Development (LDRD) program at the NREL; DOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)),"We acknowledge the World Climate Research Program's Working Group which is responsible for the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP), and we thank the climate modeling groups (listed in Table 1 of this paper) for producing and making available their model output.

Solid governance structures provide the framework for adequate knowledge, funding, and planning security for practical measures. This is particularly challenging in Colombia, where a difficult topography and weak infrastructures result in high demands for technical solutions. Moreover, the country has experienced over five decades of rural violence leading to political, social and economic disparities as well as to an outspoken mistrust between civil society and political leaders. The hence stretched relations between authorities and citizens have negative impacts on the country's ability to create solid governance structures and adapt successfully-independent of how advanced technical solutions may be. This twofold analysis first elaborates the current state of the art of adaptation governance, outlining the specific challenges and depicting basic elements which have to be addressed when designing an adaptation governance framework. As one of the few papers currently addressing this issue, this analysis pays special attention to the impact of power politics. Second, against the backdrop of this theoretical outline, the wicked case of Colombia is analyzed. Through a qualitative case study design using textual analysis, this chapter focuses on hindering and enabling factors under the conditions of limited state resources. In order to create a holistic understanding, it draws on an interdisciplinary perspective. The analysis concludes with a discussion of the findings. Inferences show that climate change adaptation is highly complex and that technical and societal aspects must both be considered in order to design sustainable solutions. Besides the well-known challenges, a strong research-policy linkage and power dynamics are decisive challenges for the creation of an adaptation governance framework. The case study confirms the importance of these factors.","[Mohr, Kerstin] Univ Potsdam, Fac Econ & Social Sci, August Bebel Str 89, D-14482 Potsdam, Germany",University of Potsdam,"Mohr, K (corresponding author), Univ Potsdam, Fac Econ & Social Sci, August Bebel Str 89, D-14482 Potsdam, Germany.",kmohr@uni-potsdam.de,,,,,,,61,1,1,0,0,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1610-2010,,978-3-030-37425-9; 978-3-030-37424-2,CLIM CHANG MANAG,,,2020,,,,,1009,1027,,10.1007/978-3-030-37425-9_52,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-37425-9_52,10.1007/978-3-030-37425-9,,19,"Engineering, Civil; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences; Regional & Urban Planning",Book Citation Index – Social Sciences & Humanities (BKCI-SSH); Book Citation Index – Science (BKCI-S),Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences; Public Administration,BR9KL,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000677532400053,View Full Record in Web of Science

Billions of dollars are spent suppressing wildfires each year. In the past decades, academic research has made substantial contributions to the understanding of fire and its interaction with climate and land management. Most reviews of the academic literature, however, are centered in either natural or social science. We offer an integrated cross-disciplinary guide to state-of-the art fire science and use this review to identify research gaps. We focus on the modern era and understanding fire in the context of a changing climate in western North America. We find that studies combining social and natural science perspectives remain limited and that interactions among coupled system components are poorly understood. For example, while natural science studies have identified how fuel treatments alter fire regimes, few social science studies examine how decisions are made about fuel treatments and how these decisions respond to changes in fire regimes. A key challenge is to better quantify the effects of actual fire management policies in a way that accounts for the complexity of coupled natural and natural-human system interactions.","[Ayres, Andrew; Degolia, Alexander; Fienup, Matthew; Kim, Yunyeol; Sainz, Jade; Urbisci, Laura; Viana, Daniel; Wesolowski, Graham; Plantinga, Andrew J.; Tague, Christina] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Bren Sch Environm Sci & Management, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara,"Tague, C (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Bren Sch Environm Sci & Management, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",ctague@bren.ucsb.edu,,"Kim, Junyeol/0000-0002-3275-0450; Viana, Daniel/0000-0002-6000-2011; Tague, Christina (Naomi)/0000-0003-1463-308X","Direct For Biological Sciences [1639145] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1520847] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Div Of Biological Infrastructure [1052875] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Direct For Biological Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE)); Div Of Biological Infrastructure(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO))",,,157,8,8,1,37,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1749-8198,,,GEOGR COMPASS,Geogr.

The National Weather Service, National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP), Environmental Modeling Center (EMC) develops regional and global weather prediction models, coupled ocean-atmosphere models for seasonal to interannual climate predictions, and a coastal ocean forecast model. A three dimensional variational data assimilation system is used to specify the initial conditions for the forecast models. Data from the following satellite instruments are currently used in one or more of these models: High Resolution Infrared Sounder (HIRS), Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU), Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit-A (AMSU-A), Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES) sounder, GOES, METEOSAT, and Geostationary Meteorology Satellite (GMS) imagers, Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I), ESA Remote-sensing Satellite-2 (ERS-2) scatterometer, Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet Spectrometer/2 (SBUV/2), and Oceanic Topography Experiment (TOPEX) and ERS-2 altimeters.

Therefore, multi-model simulations for present-day conditions, performed for the 4th assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, have been analysed and compared with re-analysis data sets. The spatial patterns of atmospheric teleconnections are reproduced reasonably by most of the models. The comparison of coupled with atmosphere-only runs confirmed that a better representation of the forcing by sea surface temperatures has the potential to slightly improve the representation of only wave train-like patterns. Due to internally generated climate variability, the models are not able to reproduce the observed temporal behaviour. Insights into the dynamical reasons for the limited skill of climate models in reproducing teleconnections have been obtained by studying the relation between major teleconnections and zonal wind variability patterns. About half of the models are able to reproduce the observed relationship. For these cases, the quality of simulated teleconnection patterns is largely determined by the quality of zonal wind variability patterns. Therefore, improvements of simulated eddy-mean flow interaction have the potential to improve the atmospheric teleconnections.","[Handorf, Doerthe; Dethloff, Klaus] Alfred Wegener Inst Polar & Marine Res, Res Dept Potsdam, D-14471 Potsdam, Germany","Helmholtz Association; Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar & Marine Research","Handorf, D (corresponding author), Alfred Wegener Inst Polar & Marine Res, Res Dept Potsdam, Telegrafenberg A43, D-14471 Potsdam, Germany.",doerthe.handorf@awi.de,"Dethloff, Klaus/B-4879-2014",,,,,,69,22,22,0,27,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",,1600-0870,,TELLUS A,Tellus Ser.

Any changes in the climatology of the amount, duration, and timing of the snowpack may have long-lasting environmental and economic consequences. At present, the principal tools used to examine future climatic changes are general circulation models; however, they do not provide information at the scales required for investigating many of the impacts in which snow plays a major role. In order to address this gap, a statistical downscaling methodology for simulating climatological snow cover parameters was developed. The methodology utilizes the Statistical DownScaling Model to construct climate change scenarios at daily time scales that are subsequently evaluated based on their ability to reproduce seasonal snow cover statistics. Two different observational datasets (station and gridded) were used as predictands and empirical relationships were created between the predictands and regional scale predictors. The methodology was tested at 20 locations across the Northeast and was then applied to output from HadCM3 under the A2 and B2 emissions scenarios. The methodology performed well at capturing key properties of station-based snow cover over a range of climates and was found to perform better than the technique used in previous work in the Northeast. By the end of the century, the projections revealed characteristics that are consistent with declining snow cover, yet there are likely to be regional variations in the next several decades, especially when elevation is considered.","[Tryhorn, Lee; DeGaetano, Art] Cornell Univ, Northeast Reg Climate Ctr, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Tryhorn, Lee] Cornell Univ, New York State Water Resources Inst, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Tryhorn, Lee; DeGaetano, Art] Cornell Univ, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Cornell University; Cornell University; Cornell University,"DeGaetano, A (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Northeast Reg Climate Ctr, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",atd2@cornell.edu,,,"Northeast Regional Climate Center under NOAA [EA133E07CN0090, NA10OAR4310179]; New York State Energy Research and Development Authority",Northeast Regional Climate Center under NOAA; New York State Energy Research and Development Authority,"This work was partially supported by the Northeast Regional Climate Center under NOAA contracts EA133E07CN0090, NA10OAR4310179, and the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority.

The interannual anomalies in water vapor are strongly related to the dynamical quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO), and this study presents the first QBO composite of the time height structure of the equatorial water vapor anomalies. The anomalies display upward propagation below about 10 hPa in a manner analogous to the annual tape recorder effect, but at higher levels they show clear downward propagation. This study examined these variations in the Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate (MIROC)-AGCM and in four models in phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) that simulate realistic QBOs. Diagnostic budget analysis of the MIROC-AGCM data and comparisons among the CMIP5 model results demonstrate (i) the importance of temperature anomalies at the tropopause induced by the QBO for lower-stratospheric water vapor variations and (ii) that upper-stratospheric water vapor anomalies are largely driven by advection of the mean vertical gradient of water content by the QBO interannual fluctuations in the vertical wind.","[Kawatani, Yoshio] Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2360001, Japan; [Lee, Jae N.] Univ Maryland Baltimore Cty, Joint Ctr Earth Syst Technol, Baltimore, MD 21228 USA; [Hamilton, Kevin] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Int Pacific Res Ctr, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA",Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science & Technology (JAMSTEC); University System of Maryland; University of Maryland Baltimore County; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa,"Kawatani, Y (corresponding author), Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, Kanazawa Ku, 3173-25 Showamachi, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2360001, Japan.",yoskawatani@jamstec.go.jp,"; Kawatani, Yoshio/B-1777-2013","Hamilton, Kevin/0000-0002-3560-8097; Kawatani, Yoshio/0000-0003-3260-8830","Environment Research and Technology Development Fund of the Ministry of the Environment, Japan [2A-1201]; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [26287117]; Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC); NOAA [NA11NMF4320128]; NASA Living With a Star Targeted Research and Technology Program [NNH10ZDA001N-LWSTRT]; MEXT; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [26287117] Funding Source: KAKEN","Environment Research and Technology Development Fund of the Ministry of the Environment, Japan(Ministry of the Environment, Japan); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC); NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); NASA Living With a Star Targeted Research and Technology Program; MEXT(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","The authors thank Drs.

In this study, we improved the modeling of permafrost processes in a state-of-the-art climate model by taking into account some of the relevant physical properties of soil such as changes in the thermophysical properties due to soil freezing. As a result, the improved version of the global land surface model was able to reproduce a more realistic permafrost distribution at the southern limit of the permafrost area by increasing the freezing of soil moisture in winter. The improved modeling of permafrost processes also had a significant effect on future projections. Using the conventional formulation, the predicted cumulative reduction of the permafrost area by year 2100 was approximately 60% (40-80% range of uncertainty from a multi-model ensemble) in the RCP8.5 scenario, while with the improved formulation, the reduction was approximately 35% (20-50%).

In order to obtain wave data at shallow water and due to the scarcity of instrumental data, ocean wave reanalysis databases ought to be downscaled to increase the spatial resolution and simulate the wave transformation process. In this paper, a hybrid downscaling methodology to transfer wave climate to coastal areas has been developed combining a numerical wave model (dynamical downscaling) with mathematical tools (statistical downscaling). A maximum dissimilarity selection algorithm (MDA) is applied in order to obtain a representative subset of sea states in deep water areas. The reduced number of selected cases spans the marine climate variability, guaranteeing that all possible sea states are represented and capturing even the extreme events. These sea states are propagated using a state-of-the-art wave propagation model. The time series of the propagated sea state parameters at a particular location are reconstructed using a non-linear interpolation technique based on radial basis functions (RBFs), providing excellent results in a high dimensional space with scattered data as occurs in the cases selected with MDA. The numerical validation of the results confirms the ability of the developed methodology to reconstruct sea state time series in shallow water at a particular location and to estimate different spatial wave climate parameters with a considerable reduction in the computational effort.

By analyzing observational data and performing Indian and Pacific Ocean pacemaker experiments using a state-of-the-art climate model, we find that a positive IOD (pIOD) can favor both cold and warm sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTA) in the tropical Pacific, in contrast to the previously identified pIOD-El Nino connection. The diverse impacts of the pIOD on ENSO are related to SSTA in the Seychelles-Chagos thermocline ridge (SCTR; 60 degrees-85 degrees E, 7 degrees-15 degrees S) as part of the warm pole of the pIOD. Specifically, a pIOD with SCTR warming can cause warm SSTA in the southeastern Indian Ocean, which induces La Nina-like conditions in the tropical Pacific through interbasin interaction processes associated with a recently identified climate phenomenon dubbed the warm pool dipole.'' This study identifies a new pIOD-ENSO relationship and examines the associated mechanisms.","[Zhang, Lei; Han, Weiqing] Univ Colorado, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Meehl, Gerald A.; Hu, Aixue; Rosenbloom, Nan] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [Shinoda, Toshiaki] Texas A&M Univ Corpus Christi, Dept Phys & Environm Sci, Corpus Christi, TX USA; [McPhaden, Michael J.] NOAA, Pacific Marine Environm Lab, 7600 Sand Point Way Ne, Seattle, WA 98115 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University Corpus Christi; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Zhang, L (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",lezh8230@colorado.edu,"Shinoda, Toshiaki/S-1721-2019","Shinoda, Toshiaki/0000-0003-1416-2206","NSF [AGS 1935279, OCE 1658132, OCE-1658218]; NASA [NNX17AI63G, 80NSSC21K1190, NNX17AH25G]; Regional and Global Model Analysis (RGMA) component of the Earth and Environmental System Modeling Program of the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Biological and Environmental Research (BER) via National Science Foundation [IA 1844590]; NOAA [NA17OAR4310256]; DoD [W911NF-20-1-0309]",NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); Regional and Global Model Analysis (RGMA) component of the Earth and Environmental System Modeling Program of the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Biological and Environmental Research (BER) via National Science Foundation; NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); DoD(United States Department of Defense),"Authors Han and Zhang are supported by NSF AGS 1935279, NASA Ocean Surface Topography Science Team NNX17AI63G and 80NSSC21K1190, and NSF OCE 1658132.

Here we use a state-of-the-art multi-ice-core reconstruction of explosive volcanism, representing the dominant global external driver of severe short-term climatic change, to reveal a systematic association between eruptions and dynastic collapse across two millennia of Chinese history. We next employ a 1,062-year reconstruction of Chinese warfare as a proxy for political and socioeconomic stress to reveal the dynamic role of volcanic climatic shocks in collapse. We find that smaller shocks may act as the ultimate cause of collapse at times of high pre-existing stress, whereas larger shocks may act with greater independence as proximate causes without substantial observed pre-existing stress. We further show that post-collapse warfare tends to diminish rapidly, such that collapse itself may act as an evolved adaptation tied to the influential mandate of heaven concept in which successive dynasties could claim legitimacy as divinely sanctioned mandate holders, facilitating a more rapid restoration of social order. Collapses of China's ruling dynasties were associated with explosive volcanic eruptions over the past two millennia, with the degree of influence depending on pre-existing stress in society, as suggested by a systematic analysis of eruptions and Chinese warfare.","[Gao, Chaochao] Zhejiang Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Hangzhou, Peoples R China; [Ludlow, Francis; Matthews, John A.; Breen, Richard] Trinity Coll Dublin, Trinity Ctr Environm Humanities, Sch Hist & Humanities, Dublin, Ireland; [Ludlow, Francis; Matthews, John A.; Breen, Richard] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dept Hist, Sch Hist & Humanities, Dublin, Ireland; [Stine, Alexander R.] San Francisco State Univ, Dept Earth & Climate Sci, San Francisco, CA 94132 USA; [Robock, Alan] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Environm Sci, New Brunswick, NJ USA; [Pan, Yuqing] Florida State Univ, Dept Stat, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Nolan, Brianan] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Rachel Carson Ctr Environm & Soc, Leopoldstr 11a, D-80802 Munich, Germany; [Sigl, Michael] Univ Bern, Phys Inst, Climate & Environm Phys, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Sigl, Michael] Univ Bern, Climate Change Res, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland",Zhejiang University; Trinity College Dublin; Trinity College Dublin; California State University System; San Francisco State University; Rutgers State University New Brunswick; State University System of Florida; Florida State University; University of Munich; University of Bern; University of Bern,"Gao, CC (corresponding author), Zhejiang Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Hangzhou, Peoples R China.;Ludlow, F (corresponding author), Trinity Coll Dublin, Trinity Ctr Environm Humanities, Sch Hist & Humanities, Dublin, Ireland.;Ludlow, F (corresponding author), Trinity Coll Dublin, Dept Hist, Sch Hist & Humanities, Dublin, Ireland.",gaocc@zju.edu.cn; ludlowf@tcd.ie,"Matthews, John Alphonsus/AHA-6808-2022; Robock, Alan/B-6385-2016; Stine, Alexander/O-8104-2016","Matthews, John Alphonsus/0000-0002-1553-393X; Stine, Alexander/0000-0002-1676-5572; Sigl, Michael/0000-0002-9028-9703; Ludlow, Francis/0000-0003-0008-0314; Robock, Alan/0000-0002-6319-5656","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41875092]; U.S. National Science Foundation [AGS-1430051, AGS-1617844, AGS-2017113]; NSF [AGS-1903674, ICER-1824770]; Irish Research Council Laureate Award (CLICAB) [IRCLA/2017/303]; Harvard University Center for the Environment (Ziff Environmental Fellowship); Rachel Carson Center for Environment and Society; LMU Munich; Yale Climate & Energy Institute; Initiative for the Science of the Human Past at Harvard (SoHP); European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program (THERA project) [820047]; ERC (NorFish project) [669461]; Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS); Swiss Academy of Sciences (SCNAT)","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); U.S. National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Irish Research Council Laureate Award (CLICAB)(Irish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology); Harvard University Center for the Environment (Ziff Environmental Fellowship); Rachel Carson Center for Environment and Society; LMU Munich; Yale Climate & Energy Institute; Initiative for the Science of the Human Past at Harvard (SoHP); European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program (THERA project)(European Research Council (ERC)); ERC (NorFish project); Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)(Chinese Academy of Sciences); Swiss Academy of Sciences (SCNAT)","C.G. is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China grant 41875092.

The chosen algorithms in the study includes NSGAII, epsilon-NSGAII, epsilon-MOEA, PAES, PESAII and SPEAII. The performance of all aforementioned algorithms is assessed and compared using performance indicators to evaluate proximity, diversity and consistency. Our insights to this comparative study enhanced our understanding of MOEAs performance in order to solve a non-linear complex climate control problem.

For example, we can mention that the Ab-Anbars in arid and desert areas of Iran, which are used to store water in seasons with precipitation for use in the rest of the year, has been an optimal way to use natural resources and provide climate comfort. The Ab-Anbars are realized with ventilated cisterns through openings on their roof or wind-catchers to keep the water cool and provide comfortable conditions for the occupants. In order to study the essential role of natural ventilation and cooling in the Ab-Anbars, thermal analysis with CFD software was carried out to assess the effectiveness of a typical wind-catcher according to different wind directions in Yazd city. The results showed that Ab-Anbars have played an important role in reducing cooling loads and supply the necessary ventilation rate of buildings and can be used in the future for application in contemporary architecture and urban planning.","[Yousefi, Fazeleh] Univ Yazd, Dept Art & Architecture, Yazd 8913875639, Iran; [Nocera, Francesco] Univ Catania, Dept Civil Engn & Architecture, I-95131 Catania, Italy",University of Yazd; University of Catania,"Yousefi, F (corresponding author), Univ Yazd, Dept Art & Architecture, Yazd 8913875639, Iran.",fazeleh.yousefi@stu.yazd.ac.ir; fnocera@unict.it,"Nocera, Francesco/C-4712-2013","Nocera, Francesco/0000-0001-5673-5418",,,,,47,0,0,2,5,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2571-9408,,HERITAGE-BASEL,Heritage,DEC,2021,4,,,,3987,4000,,10.3390/heritage4040219,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/heritage4040219,,,14,"Humanities, Multidisciplinary; Multidisciplinary Sciences",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Arts & Humanities - Other Topics; Science & Technology - Other Topics,YA4TH,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000738327000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here we demonstrate the capability of CERA-20C in producing more physically consistent ocean and atmosphere boundary conditions, by focusing on sea surface temperature (SST)-precipitation intraseasonal relationships. CERA-20C reproduces well the observed SST-precipitation correlations, while these relationships are poorly represented in ERA-20C, with the greatest discrepancies in the early 1900s. The improved relationships in CERA-20C are due to intraseasonal improvements in SST that are not present in the external HadISST2 product. In CERA-20C, SST-precipitation relationships are slightly weaker in the 1900s than in the 2000s, mainly due to differences in the assimilated observation density. We also find that the coupled model initialized from CERA-20C in the 2000s realistically simulates these relationships, while relaxing SST toward HadISST2 tends to damp these relationships. CERA-20C has improved mean and variance in precipitation over ERA-20C, but these are mostly due to improvements in the atmospheric model and not due to coupled feedbacks. Plain Language Summary Climate reanalyses, reconstructions of past weather and climate conditions, are of importance in the climate research and forecasting community. The European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts has recently launched its first ocean-atmosphere coupled reanalysis for the twentieth century, known as CERA-20C. Many users are expected. One of the main breakthroughs of this state-of-the-art data set is resolving the air-sea interactions via coupled modeling, while the ocean and atmosphere models are constrained separately by observations. This paper shows that the sea surface temperature-precipitation relationships are much better reproduced in CERA-20C than in its predecessors. Such significant improvement in CERA-20C is due to the ocean surface that more realistically reflects the intraseasonal variations in the atmosphere through the coupled processes. The results highlight the advances of coupled reanalysis in producing physically consistent ocean and atmosphere conditions, indicating that we are moving in the right direction on climate reanalysis. This could have an immediate impact on the plans for producing global climate reanalyses at some institutions. In addition, the metrics of lead-lag correlations applied here could be easily implemented to other climate data sets, to evaluate the quality of climate data.","[Feng, Xiangbo; Haines, Keith; Liu, Chunlei; Polo, Irene] Univ Reading, Dept Meteorol, Reading, Berks, England; [Haines, Keith; Liu, Chunlei] Univ Reading, Natl Ctr Earth Observat, Reading, Berks, England; [de Boisseson, Eric] European Ctr Medium Range Weather Forecasts, Reading, Berks, England",University of Reading; UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); NERC National Centre for Earth Observation; University of Reading; European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF),"Feng, XB (corresponding author), Univ Reading, Dept Meteorol, Reading, Berks, England.",xiangbo.feng@reading.ac.uk,"Feng, Xiangbo/GPX-6346-2022; FENG, Xiangbo/Z-1109-2019; Feng, Xiangbo/O-7828-2015","Feng, Xiangbo/0000-0003-4143-107X; Haines, Keith/0000-0003-2768-2374; Liu, Chunlei/0000-0002-6663-452X","EU FP7 funded ERA-CLIM2 project [607029]; NERC [K005480/1, N006054/1, H5193700, 603521]; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/N006054/1, NE/N006038/1, nceo020006, NE/J005894/1, NE/K005480/1, nceo020004, NE/R016518/1] Funding Source: researchfish; NERC [NE/N006038/1, nceo020004, nceo020006, NE/K005480/1, NE/J005894/1, NE/N006054/1] Funding Source: UKRI",EU FP7 funded ERA-CLIM2 project; NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"CERA-20C, ERA-20C, and ERA-20CM used in this paper are accessible via the ECMWF public data sets (http://apps.ecmwf.int/datasets/).

Its broadly recognised counterpart is the Younger Dryas or Greenland Stadial-1 (ca. 12.85-11.65 cal. kyr BP based on the NGRIP ice core records). Our study suggests that accumulation of the analysed late-glacial sediments occurred in a deep and relatively cold water meso-eutrophic lake with a strong mixing regime and relatively high silica content. Combining these results together with available pollen-based environmental reconstructions we suggest that climate cooling, together with an intensified winter monsoon and thicker snow cover could influence changes in regional vegetation, sedimentation processes and trophic status of the lake during the transition from the last interstadial to stadial around Lake Suigetsu. A decrease in total pollen concentration and increase in Fagus pollen percentage indicate local vegetation stress/disturbances and suggest that cooling started at least 2-3 decades prior to the major shift in the inorganic sediment (accumulation of detrital layers) and in diatom assemblages (change from Aulacoseira ambigua to Aulacoseira subarctica dominance), which took about 10 years. The transition from the last stadial to the Holocene again shows that vegetation in the lake catchment area reacted first to the regional climate change, i.e. to the weakening of the winter monsoon and decrease in winter snow accumulation. The increase in the vegetation cover density and reduced volume of surface runoff associated with the decrease in melt water supply is likely responsible for the reduced soil erosion activity which caused the cessation in detrital layer accumulation and consequent decrease in the amount of nutrients brought to the lake and lowering of the water nutrient status. The latter process finally influenced changes in the diatom assemblages, including the return to dominance of A. subarctica ca. 30 years after the virtual disappearance of detrital layers from the sediment. Our results demonstrate the rapid response of the Lake Suigetsu system to the global cooling and subsequent warming, and allow clear definition of the onset and termination of the late-glacial climate reversal. Despite the fact that the lake system shows a more abrupt shift from the warm to cold (and cold to warm) environments than terrestrial records of vegetation demonstrate, we do not see any delayed response of local vegetation to the climate change. This last conclusion is of particular importance for application of the SG06 pollen record for quantitative climate reconstruction. (C) 2011 Elsevier By.

Due to the negative impacts of this invasive species in aquatic ecosystems, it is necessary to study the factors affecting its distribution. The present study was conducted to investigate the impact of climate change on the distribution of the invasive stone moroko in Asian ecosystems. For this purpose, climatic data including maximum temperature of the warmest month (MTWM). minimum temperature of the coldest month (MTCM). mean temperature of the warmest quarter (MTWQ). mean temperature of the wettest quarter (MTWeQ), precipitation of the warmest quarter (PWaQ), precipitation of the coldest quarter (PCQ) and precipitation of the wettest month (PWM) were downloaded from the WorldClim climate data. In addition. the occurrence data (Geographic data. latitude and longitude) of P. parva were also downloaded from the GBIF website (www.gbif.org). To evaluate the relationship between climatic data with a Pearson correlation coefficient (r> 0.75), ENMTools v1.3 software was used. In order to identify the most important factors affecting the distribution of P. parva, Jacknife test was applied. The results showed that MTWQ, MTWeQ and MTCM had the highest contribution to the distribution of stone moroko in the Asian aquatic ecosystems. According to our results, the distribution of this species is largely affected by temperature and precipitation fluctuations. The findings presented in this study can be used to predict, control and prevent the spread of non-native species such as P. parva in freshwater bodies.","[Radkhah, Ali Reza; Eagderi, Soheil] Univ Tehran, Fac Nat Resources, Dept Fisheries, Karaj, Iran; [Cicek, Erdogan] Nevsehir Haci Bektas Veli Univ, Fac Art & Sci, Dept Biol, Nevsehir, Turkey",University of Tehran; Nevsehir Haci Bektas Veli University,"Eagderi, S (corresponding author), Univ Tehran, Fac Nat Resources, Dept Fisheries, Karaj, Iran.",soheil.eagderi@ut.ac.ir,"eagderi, soheil/J-7403-2015","eagderi, soheil/0000-0001-8649-9452",,,,,37,0,0,2,2,"INST ZOOLOGY, BAS",SOFIA,"1000 SOFIA, 1, TSAR OSVOBODITEL BLVD, SOFIA, 00000, BULGARIA",0324-0770,,,ACTA ZOOL BULGAR,Acta Zool.

The integration of recent developments in big data analytics and climate change science with agriculture can greatly accelerate agricultural research and innovation for climate smart agriculture (CSA). CSA refers to an integrated set of technologies and practices that simultaneously improve farm productivity and incomes, increase adaptive capacity to climate change effects, and reduce green house gas emissions from farming. It is a multi-stage, multi-objective, data-driven, and knowledge based approach to agriculture, with the farm as the most fundamental unit for both strategic and tactical decisions. This paper explores how big data analytics can accelerate research and innovation for CSA. Three levels at which big data can enhance farmer field level insights and actionable knowledge for the practice of CSA are identified: (i) developing a predictive capability to factor climate change effects to scales relevant to farming practice, (ii) speeding up plant breeding for higher productivity and climate resilience, and (iii) delivery of customized and prescriptive real-time farm knowledge for higher productivity, climate change adaptation and mitigation. The state-of-art on big data based approaches at each of the three levels is assessed. The paper also identifies the research and institutional challenges, and the way forward for leveraging big data in research and innovation aimed at climate smart agriculture in India.","[Rao, N.

For this purpose we have compiled a state-of-the-art multi-model multi-scenario ensemble of global and regional precipitation projections. This ensemble combines several global projections from the CMIP3 and CMIP5 databases, along with some recently downscaled regional CORDEX-Africa projections. Altogether daily precipitation data from 77 different climate change projections is analysed; separated into 31 projections for a high and 46 for a low emission scenario. We find a robust indication that, independent of the underlying emission scenario, annual total precipitation amounts over the central African region are not likely to change severely in the future. However some robust changes in precipitation characteristics, like the intensification of heavy rainfall events as well as an increase in the number of dry spells during the rainy season are projected for the future. Further analysis shows that over some regions the results of the climate change assessment clearly depend on the size of the analyzed ensemble. This indicates the need of a large-enough ensemble of independent climate projections to allow for a reliable climate change assessment.","[Haensler, Andreas; Saeed, Fahad; Jacob, Daniela] Helmholtz Zentrum Geesthacht, CSC, Hamburg, Germany; [Jacob, Daniela] Max Planck Inst Meteorol, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Zentrum Geesthacht - Zentrum fur Material- und Kustenforschung; Max Planck Society,"Haensler, A (corresponding author), Helmholtz Zentrum Geesthacht, CSC, Fischertwiete 1, Hamburg, Germany.",andreas.haensler@hzg.de,,"Haensler, Andreas/0000-0002-3471-7523","German Ministry for Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety via the GIZ (Deutsche Gesellschaft fuer internationale Zusammenarbeit GmbH)","German Ministry for Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety via the GIZ (Deutsche Gesellschaft fuer internationale Zusammenarbeit GmbH)","The work has been conducted within the project: Climate changes scenarios for the Congo basin.

One of the reasons for this is the increase of comfort demands worldwide. The most cooling and air conditioning systems are the conventional electrically driven one type such as compression refrigeration machines and air conditioning systems. Through the huge electricity consumption for cooling and air conditioning, the environmental problems get bigger and bigger, because of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other pollutant emissions. One of the possibilities to reduce the primary energy consumption is through the use of solar energy for driving the thermal driven absorption or adsorption refrigeration systems, or desiccant cooling. Another possibility is using solar energy to produce electrical energy and this can be used to drive the conventional refrigeration systems. Many research and developmental efforts in the last years have been done to enforce the spreading of solar-driven cooling systems. This paper will illustrate the state of the art about the energy consumption for cooling and air conditioning systems, available solar-driven cooling systems and the potential of the utilization of such systems in comparison to the conventional ones. Moreover, this paper highlights some different methods of optimization, which used to maximize the performance and minimize the cost.","[Alahmer, Ali] Al Zaytoonah Univ, Faulty Engn & Technol, Dept Alternat Energy Technol, POB 130, Amman 11733, Jordan; [Alahmer, Ali] Tafila Tech Univ, Dept Mech Engn, POB 179, Tafila 66110, Jordan; [Ajib, Salman] TH Ostwestfalen Lippe, Dept Renewable Energies & Decentralized Energy Su, Hoxter, Germany",Al-Zaytoonah University of Jordan; Tafila Technical University,"Alahmer, A (corresponding author), Al Zaytoonah Univ, Faulty Engn & Technol, Dept Alternat Energy Technol, POB 130, Amman 11733, Jordan.",a.alahmer@ttu.edu.jo,"Alahmer, Ali/C-8901-2019","Alahmer, Ali/0000-0002-2994-1504",,,,,129,44,46,5,34,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0196-8904,1879-2227,,ENERG CONVERS MANAGE,Energy Conv.

Continuing the 2019 study by O'Kane et al., we compare multiyear ensemble ENSO forecasts from the Climate Analysis Forecast Ensemble (CAFE) to ensemble forecasts from state-of-the-art dynamical coupled models in the North American Multimodel Ensemble (NMME) project. The CAFE initial perturbations are targeted such that they are specific to tropical Pacific thermocline variability. With respect to individual NMME forecasts and multimodel ensemble averages, the CAFE forecasts reveal improvements in skill when predicting ENSO at lead times greater than 6 months, in particular when predictability is most strongly limited by the boreal spring barrier. Initial forecast perturbations generated exclusively as disturbances in the equatorial Pacific thermocline are shown to improve the forecast skill at longer lead times in terms of anomaly correlation and the random walk sign test. Our results indicate that augmenting current initialization methods with initial perturbations targeting instabilities specific to the tropical Pacific thermocline may improve long-range ENSO prediction.","[O'Kane, Terence J.; Squire, Dougal T.; Sandery, Paul A.; Kitsios, Vassili; Matear, Richard J.; Moore, Thomas S.; Risbey, James S.; Watterson, Ian G.] CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere, Hobart, Tas, Australia",Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"O'Kane, TJ (corresponding author), CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere, Hobart, Tas, Australia.",terence.okane@csiro.au,"O'Kane, Terence/AAV-1123-2021; Risbey, James/M-8419-2013; O'Kane, Terence J/B-1655-2009; matear, richard J/C-5133-2011; Moore, Thomas/AAU-9480-2021; Squire, Dougie/AAI-6207-2021; Kitsios, Vassili/A-3141-2012; Collier, Mark/D-2663-2013","O'Kane, Terence/0000-0002-2137-5915; Risbey, James/0000-0003-3202-9142; O'Kane, Terence J/0000-0002-2137-5915; matear, richard J/0000-0002-3225-0800; Moore, Thomas/0000-0003-3930-1946; Squire, Dougie/0000-0003-3271-6874; Kitsios, Vassili/0000-0002-2543-0264; Watterson, Ian/0000-0001-9484-018X; Sandery, Paul/0000-0002-1551-5408; Collier, Mark/0000-0003-1391-9473",Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) Decadal Climate Forecasting Project,Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) Decadal Climate Forecasting Project,The authors were supported by the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) Decadal Climate Forecasting Project (https://research.csiro.au/dfp).,,28,6,6,3,9,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0894-8755,1520-0442,,J CLIMATE,J.

This leads to a warm bias near the North American coast, where the modelled Gulf Stream separates from the coast further north, and a cold anomaly to the east of the Grand Banks of Newfoundland, where the North Atlantic Current remains too zonal in this region. Using an atmosphere-only model forced with the sea surface temperature (SST) biases in the North Atlantic, we consider the impact they have on the mean state and the variability in the North Atlantic European region in winter. Our results show that the SST errors produce a mean sea-level pressure response that is similar in magnitude and pattern to the atmospheric circulation errors in the coupled climate model. The work also suggests that errors in the coupled model storm tracks and North Atlantic Oscillation, compared to reanalysis data, can also be explained partly by these SST errors. Our results suggest that both the error in the Gulf Stream separation location and the path of the North Atlantic Current around the Grand Banks play important roles in affecting the atmospheric circulation. Reducing these coupled model errors could improve significantly the representation of the large-scale atmospheric circulation of the North Atlantic and European region.

This was the first time that architects started to present themselves as specialists. This paper traces the changing climate in the Dutch art of building as documented through the articles and images published in the Bouwkundige Bijdragen, the first architectural journal in the Netherlands, and analyses these changes through the contributions and writings of the Amsterdam-based architect Johannes Hermanus Leliman (1828-1910). Leliman represents one of the main voices in Dutch architectural debates and was a fervent advocate of eclecticism. Leliman and his fellow architects utilised the pages of the Bouwkundige Bijdragen to passionately discuss the prospects for a new Dutch architecture, architectural history, technical innovations and building materials, or German and French inspirations, from 1843 to 1881. The paper examines the journal as a principal outlet and platform for the emergence of new ideas and theories at the moment of Dutch architects' self-emancipation.","[de Jong, Sigrid] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"de Jong, S (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Zurich, Switzerland.",sigrid.dejong@gta.arch.ethz.ch,,,,,,,47,0,0,1,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1360-2365,1466-4410,,J ARCHITECTURE,J.

A significant strand of the growing geographical literature on art's critical potential focuses on issues of ecological import such as climate change, locating critique in problematisation of Eurocentric aesthetics for its links with colonialism and racialised humanism. Still another strand focuses on neoliberal geopolitics, appraising contemporary art's critical potential against post-political approaches to democracy, peace, and prosperity. I bring together these two strands, both methodologically and empirically, as I consider the politics of ecology in Turkey's Kurdistan, inextricably intertwined with both state-endorsed racial violence in the 20th century and neoliberal democratisation and peace-making in the 21st century. Methodologically, I develop and operationalise the concept of extractivism in conversation with recent critics of the Anthropocene thesis who foreground racial capitalism rather than humanity as the geopolitical - geological and geographical - force afflicting ecology. Empirically, I draw on the artworks under discussion to unpack how extractivism in Turkey's Kurdistan has not only continued unabated throughout the neoliberal-democratic transition from war to peace but has also structured the latter paradigm on the former, influencing realms beyond resource extraction. The resulting argument is the following. Challenging the Eurocentrism of aesthetics and/or the neoliberal post-political paradigm remain important indicators of art's critical (geo)political potential. However, a fuller appraisal of this potential also requires asking if and to what extent such challenges redistribute agency vis-a-vis power relations formed by and formative of extractivism as a set of racialised practices operating not only through industries of extraction proper, like mining, agriculture, and construction, but also through cultural ones like art.","[Cayli, Eray] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci LSE, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Cayli, E (corresponding author), London Sch Econ & Polit Sci LSE, London, England.",e.cayli@lse.ac.uk,,"CAYLI, ERAY/0000-0001-8113-0349",Leverhulme Trust Early Career Fellowship [ECF-2017-529],Leverhulme Trust Early Career Fellowship(Leverhulme Trust),Leverhulme Trust Early Career Fellowship Grant number: ECF-2017-529.,,91,1,1,0,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0020-2754,1475-5661,,T I BRIT GEOGR,Trans.

Large intermodel spread exists in the 37 state-of-the-art CGCMs in simulating the ENSO-NWP relationship. Eight high-skill and eight low-skill models are selected to explore how the bias arises. By comparing the results among high-skill models, low-skill models, and observations, the simulation skill of the ENSO-NWP relationship largely depends on whether the model can reasonably reproduce the ENSO decay pace. Warm SST anomaly bias in the equatorial western Pacific (EWP) is found to persist into the ENSO decay summer in the low-skill models, obstructing the formation of an anomalous anticyclone in the NWP. Further analysis shows that the warm EWPSST anomaly bias is possibly related to the excessive westward extension of cold tongue in these models, which increases climatological zonal SST gradient in the EWP. Under westerly wind anomalies, the larger climatological zonal SST gradient could lead to warmer zonal advections in the low-skill models than that in the high-skill models, which could lead to warm EWPSST anomaly bias in the low-skill models. And the warm EWP SST anomaly bias could strengthen westerly wind anomalies over the western Pacific by triggering convection and atmospheric Rossby waves, which, in turn, could maintain the warm SST anomaly bias in the EWP.","[Jiang, Wenping; Huang, Gang; Hu, Kaiming; Wu, Renguang; Chen, Xiaolong; Tao, Weichen] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, State Key Lab Numer Modeling Atmospher Sci & Geop, 40 Hua Yan Li, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Huang, Gang; Hu, Kaiming] Joint Ctr Global Change Studies, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Huang, Gang; Hu, Kaiming] Shenzhen Key Lab Severe Weather South China, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Hu, Kaiming; Wu, Renguang; Gong, Hainan] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Ctr Monsoon Syst Res, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Wenping; Tao, Weichen] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Huang, G (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, State Key Lab Numer Modeling Atmospher Sci & Geop, 40 Hua Yan Li, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.",hg@mail.iap.ac.cn,"huang, gang/D-6427-2012; Gong, Hainan/R-2934-2019; Chen, Xiaolong/AAO-7147-2020","huang, gang/0000-0002-8692-7856; Gong, Hainan/0000-0002-6501-162X; ","National Natural Science Foundation of China [91337105, 41425019, 41275083]; public science and technology research funds projects of ocean [201505013]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); public science and technology research funds projects of ocean,"We thank the anonymous reviewers for the valuable comments that helped us to improve the manuscript.

Two models were assessed: the river basin scale model Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and the continental model of water availability and use WaterGAP. Future climate change scenarios were provided by two general circulation models coupled with the A2 emission scenario: IPSL-CM4 and MIROC3.2. To assess the impact of climate change on environmental flows, a method based conceptually on the range of variability approach was used. The results indicate that the environmental flow regime in the Narew basin is subject to climate change risk, whose magnitude and spatial variability varies with climate model and hydrological modeling scale. Most of the analyzed sites experienced moderate impacts for the Generic Environmental Flow Indicator (GEFI), the Floodplain Inundation Indicator, and the River Habitat Availability Indicator. The consistency between SWAT and WaterGAP for GEFI was medium: in 55 to 66% of analyzed sites, the models suggested the same level of impact. Hence, we suggest that state-of-the-art, high-resolution, global- or continental-scale models, such as WaterGAP, could be useful tools for water management decision-makers and wetland conservation practitioners, whereas models such as SWAT should serve as a complementary tool for more specific, smaller-scale, local assessments.","[Piniewski, Mikolaj; Okruszko, Tomasz] Warsaw Univ Life Sci, Dep Hydraul Engn, PL-02787 Warsaw, Poland; [Laize, Cedric L.

This detailed description of a particular practice may inform a discussion of ways in which artful approaches, in general, may come to matter in STEAM education, with implications for both educational research and practice. Added to that, the chapter argues that such art-based practices can also be relevant more widely in the context of sustainability education, such as on the theme of climate change. Precisely because the content of the art workshop at hand is not prima facie linked to it, there is an unexpected potential to take up such a tangential theme in an unusual way. Typically, participants feel invigorated to enter new territory - both spatial and mental. On a meta-level, the session can also be seen as a practice in facing complexity, uncertainty, not knowing. The chapter suggests that such artful educational practices have intrinsic merit if we are to equip new generations with skills to live in and endure post-normal times. In the workshop Metamorphoses of Organic Forms, participants are invited to imagine how forms in nature might either evolve or disintegrate over time. The workshop lends itself to follow-up lessons in biology and natural history. The outcome is not given. Participants go through a shared process step by step, following a sequence that is outlined for them as they go along. They are encouraged to imagine how natural phenomena might grow or decay in time and they do this in a series of short sessions where they sculpt works in clay. Such a practice in art-based environmental education is arguably a form of poor pedagogy. This educational activity is primarily and fundamentally an open-ended process. Rather than requiring an extensive methodology, its practice requires participants to surrender themselves to a process that will be unique each time it is performed. Such a practice is an expression of a view on education that is not centred on the transmission of knowledge but rather looks at attention as education and the education of attention.","[van Boeckel, Jan] Acad Design & Crafts Gothenburg, Visual Art Educ, Gothenburg, Sweden; [van Boeckel, Jan] Ctr Environm & Dev Studies & Climate Change Leade, Uppsala, Sweden; [van Boeckel, Jan] Estonian Acad Arts, Pedag, Tallinn, Estonia; [van Boeckel, Jan] Iceland Univ Arts, Design Theory, Reykjavik, Iceland",Estonian Academy of Arts,"van Boeckel, J (corresponding author), Acad Design & Crafts Gothenburg, Visual Art Educ, Gothenburg, Sweden.",,,,,,,,23,0,0,0,1,BRILL SENSE,LEIDEN,"P O BOX 9000, LEIDEN, 2300 PA, NETHERLANDS",2542-8721,2542-873X,978-90-04-42163-9; 978-90-04-42158-5; 978-90-04-39611-1,CRIT ISSU FUT LEA T,,,2020,,,,,245,265,,10.1163/9789004421585_015,http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/9789004421585_015,,,21,"Education & Educational Research; Education, Scientific Disciplines",Book Citation Index – Social Sciences & Humanities (BKCI-SSH); Book Citation Index – Science (BKCI-S),Education & Educational Research,BR6WT,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000664379200015,View Full Record in Web of Science

The Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO), an organized envelope of tropical convection, is recognized as one of the leading sources of subseasonal predictability. This review synthesizes the latest progress regarding the MJO predictability and prediction. During the past decade, the MJO prediction skill in dynamical prediction systems has exceeded the skill of empirical predictions. Such improvement has been mainly attributed to more observations and computer resources, advances in theoretical understanding, and improved numerical models aided in part by multinational efforts through field campaigns and multimodel experiments. The state-of-the-art dynamical forecasts have shown MJO prediction skill up to 5 weeks. Prediction skill can be extended by improving the ensemble generation approach tailored for MJO prediction and by averaging multiensembles or multimodels. MJO prediction skill can be influenced by the tropical mean state and low-frequency climate mode variations, as well as by the extratropical circulation. MJO prediction skill is proven to be sensitive to model physics, ocean-atmosphere coupling, and quality of initial conditions, while the impact of the model resolution seems to be marginal. Remaining challenges and recommendations on new research avenues to fully realize the predictability of the MJO are discussed.","[Kim, Hyemi] SUNY Stony Brook, Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Vitart, Frederic] European Ctr Medium Range Weather Forecasts, Reading, Berks, England; [Waliser, Duane E.] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook; European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF); California Institute of Technology; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL),"Kim, H (corresponding author), SUNY Stony Brook, Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA.",hyemi.kim@stonybrook.edu,,"Kim, Hye-Mi/0000-0003-4713-4658","NSF [AGS-1652289]; NOAA [NA16OAR4310070]; NASA Modeling, Analysis and Prediction Program; KMA RD Program [KMI2018-03110]","NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); NASA Modeling, Analysis and Prediction Program(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); KMA RD Program","Constructive and valuable comments from three anonymous reviewers are greatly appreciated.

The PRECIS simulations at 50 x 50 km horizontal resolution are made for two time slices, present (1961-1990) and the future (2071-2100), for two socioeconomic scenarios A2 and B2. The model simulations under the scenarios of increasing greenhouse gas concentrations and sulphate aerosols are analysed to study the likely changes in the frequency, intensity and the tracks of cyclonic disturbances forming over north Indian Ocean (Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea) and the Indian landmass during monsoon season. The model overestimates the frequency of cyclonic disturbances over the Indian subcontinent in baseline simulations (1961-1990). The change is evaluated towards the end of present century (2071-2100) with respect to the baseline climate. The present study indicates that the storm tracks simulated by the model are southwards as compared to the observed tracks during the monsoon season, especially for the two main monsoon months, viz., July and August. The analysis suggests that the frequency of cyclonic disturbances forming over north Indian Ocean is likely to reduce by 9% towards the end of the present century in response to the global warming. However, the intensity of cyclonic disturbances is likely to increase by about 11% compared to the present.","[Patwardhan, Savita; Kulkarni, Ashwini; Kumar, K.

As these systems are becoming less efficient, issues such as sewer overflows and increase in urban flooding leading to surge in pollutant loads to receiving water bodies are becoming pervasive rapidly. A comprehensive investigation is required to understand these factors impacting the functioning of urban drainage, which vary spatially and temporally and are more complex when weaving together. It is necessary to establish a cost-effective, integrated planning and design framework for every local area by incorporating fit for purpose alternatives. Carefully selected adaptive measures are required for the provision of sustainable drainage systems to meet combined challenges of climate change and urbanization.

However, today the large government forecast centers almost exclusively rely on complex fully coupled dynamical forecast systems for their subseasonal to seasonal (S2S) predictions while statistical techniques are mostly neglected and those techniques still in use have not been updated in decades. In this Opinion Article, we argue that new statistical techniques mostly developed outside the field of climate science, collectively referred to as machine learning, can be adopted by climate forecasters to increase the accuracy of S2S predictions. We present an example of where unsupervised learning demonstrates higher accuracy in a seasonal prediction than the state-of-the-art dynamical systems. We also summarize some relevant machine learning methods that are most applicable to climate prediction. Finally, we show by comparing real-time dynamical model forecasts with observations from winter 2017/2018 that dynamical model forecasts are almost entirely insensitive to polar vortex (PV) variability and the impact on sensible weather. Instead, statistical forecasts more accurately predicted the resultant sensible weather from a mid-winter PV disruption than the dynamical forecasts. The important implication from the poor dynamical forecasts is that if Arctic change influences mid-latitude weather through PV variability, then the ability of dynamical models to demonstrate the existence of such a pathway is compromised. We conclude by suggesting that S2S prediction will be most beneficial to the public by incorporating mixed or a hybrid of dynamical forecasts and updated statistical techniques such as machine learning.

J,"Jarasse, D",,,,"Jarasse, D",,,Racial myths and the quest for the scientific in the construction of art history in France 1840-1870.,REVUE DE L ART,,,French,Article,,,,,,,,"In the eighteenth century, the factors determining the spirit of nations or national characteristics depended more on the climate and the society, than on blood. However with the Romantic generation, the spread of mythicized, anthropological knowledge and the desire to make art history into a science combined together to promote the racial criteria which seemed to re-introduce nature into history and fostered the connection to the model of the natural sciences. This tendency can be seen in the work of historians like Hippolyte Fortoul on Daniel Ramee. But the most outstanding historian in the decade of the 1840s is still Alfred Michiels, who, starting in 1845, constructed a history of art that he judged more scientific because it manipulated the laws, or the principles, and gave an integral part to race in the overall system of explanations of cause and effect. With the development of racial myths around 1860, especially Aryan ism and Semitism, which found their heralds in Gobineau and Renan, race tended to become a major factor, notably in Taine's scientistic analysis. The architect-historians, like Ramee or Viollet-le-Duc, who read Gobineau and the others, adopted the mythic narratives and the racializing theories (race struggles, ethnical mixes...) to the point of rewriting their books using this explanatory mode. Ramee developed a form of primitive anti-Semitism. Viollet-le-Duc sang the praises of the role of the Aryans in the arts. When anthropologists cast doubt on these theories, other social sciences, nevertheless, continued to seek them out as a model of scientificity.","Univ Bordeaux 3, F-33607 Pessac, France",Universite Bordeaux-Montaigne,"Jarasse, D (corresponding author), Univ Bordeaux 3, Domaine Univ, F-33607 Pessac, France.",,,,,,,,69,0,0,0,1,EDITIONS C N R S,PARIS,"20/22 RUE ST.

This article describes and evaluates the model version ECHAM6.3-HAM2.3-MOZ1.0 with a focus on the tropospheric gas-phase chemistry. A 10-year model simulation was performed to test the stability of the model and provide data for its evaluation. The comparison to observations concentrates on the year 2008 and includes total column observations of ozone and CO from IASI and OMI, Aura MLS observations of temperature, HNO3, CIO, and O-3 for the evaluation of polar stratospheric processes, an ozonesonde climatology, surface ozone observations from the TOAR database, and surface CO data from the Global Atmosphere Watch network. Global budgets of ozone, OH, NOx, aerosols, clouds, and radiation are analyzed and compared to the literature. ECHAMHAMMOZ performs well in many aspects. However, in the base simulation, lightning NOx emissions are very low, and the impact of the heterogeneous reaction of HNO3 on dust and sea salt aerosol is too strong. Sensitivity simulations with increased lightning NOx or modified heterogeneous chemistry deteriorate the comparison with observations and yield excessively large ozone budget terms and too much OH. We hypothesize that this is an impact of potential issues with tropical convection in the ECHAM model.","[Schultz, Martin G.; Stadtler, Scarlet; Schroeder, Sabine; Taraborrelli, Domenico; Franco, Bruno] Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Energie & Klimaforsch, IEK 8, Julich, Germany; [Krefting, Jonathan] Univ Bonn, Meteorol Inst, Bonn, Germany; [Henrot, Alexandra] Univ Liege, Unite Modelisat Climat & Cycles Biogeochim, Liege, Belgium; [Ferrachat, Sylvaine; Lohmann, Ulrike; Neubauer, David] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, Zurich, Switzerland; [Siegenthaler-Le Drian, Colombe] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, C2SM, Zurich, Switzerland; [Wahl, Sebastian] GEOMAR Helmholtz Ctr Ocean Res Kiel, Kiel, Germany; [Kokkola, Harri; Kuehn, Thomas] Atmospher Res Ctr Eastern Finland, Finnish Meteorol Inst, Kuopio, Finland; [Rast, Sebastian; Schmidt, Hauke] Max Planck Inst Meteorol, Hamburg, Germany; [Stier, Philip] Univ Oxford, Dept Phys, Atmospher Ocean & Planetary Phys, Oxford, England; [Kinnison, Doug; Tyndall, Geoffrey S.; Orlando, John J.] NCAR, Atmospher Chem Observat & Modeling, Boulder, CO USA; [Franco, Bruno; Wespes, Catherine] ULB, Serv Chim Quant & Photophys, Brussels, Belgium; [Schultz, Martin G.] Forschungszentrum Julich, Julich Supercomp Ctr, Julich, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Research Center Julich; University of Bonn; University of Liege; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Helmholtz Association; GEOMAR Helmholtz Center for Ocean Research Kiel; Finnish Meteorological Institute; Max Planck Society; University of Oxford; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; Universite Libre de Bruxelles; Helmholtz Association; Research Center Julich,"Schultz, MG (corresponding author), Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Energie & Klimaforsch, IEK 8, Julich, Germany.;Schultz, MG (corresponding author), Forschungszentrum Julich, Julich Supercomp Ctr, Julich, Germany.",m.schultz@fz-juelich.de,"Schröder, Sabine/CAF-0104-2022; Wahl, Sebastian/AFI-1518-2022; Lohmann, Ulrike/B-6153-2009; Kokkola, Harri/J-5993-2014; Kühn, Thomas/AAZ-6834-2020; Wahl, Sebastian/AAF-3644-2022; Schultz, Martin G/I-9512-2012; Taraborrelli, Domenico/O-8668-2015; Franco, Bruno/O-5853-2019; Stier, Philip/B-2258-2008; Kühn, Thomas/AAS-1949-2021; Schröder, Sabine/Q-2656-2018","Schröder, Sabine/0000-0002-0309-8010; Lohmann, Ulrike/0000-0001-8885-3785; Kokkola, Harri/0000-0002-1404-6670; Kühn, Thomas/0000-0001-5978-0601; Schultz, Martin G/0000-0003-3455-774X; Taraborrelli, Domenico/0000-0003-2213-6307; Franco, Bruno/0000-0003-0736-458X; Stier, Philip/0000-0002-1191-0128; Schröder, Sabine/0000-0002-0309-8010; Neubauer, David/0000-0002-9869-3946; Schmidt, Hauke/0000-0001-7977-5041","Helmholtz POF program; European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) projects BACCHUS [603445]; European Research Council project RECAP under the European Union's Horizon research and innovation program [724602]; Belgian State Federal Office for Scientific, Technical and Cultural Affairs; European Space Agency (ESA Prodex IASI Flow); European Space Agency (AC SAF); NERC [NE/J022624/1] Funding Source: UKRI","Helmholtz POF program; European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) projects BACCHUS; European Research Council project RECAP under the European Union's Horizon research and innovation program; Belgian State Federal Office for Scientific, Technical and Cultural Affairs; European Space Agency (ESA Prodex IASI Flow); European Space Agency (AC SAF)(European Space Agency); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC))","The ECHAM-HAMMOZ model is developed by a consortium composed of ETH Zurich, the Max-Planck-Institut fur Meteorologie, Forschungszentrum Julich, the University of Oxford, the Finnish Meteorological Institute, and the Leibniz Institute for Tropospheric Research and managed by the Center for Climate Systems Modeling (C2SM) at ETH Zurich.

Previous studies have shown large uncertainties in the time when surface air temperature (SAT) change over China will reach 2 degrees C relative to the pre-industrial era. To understand the uncertainties, we analyzed the projected SAT in the twenty-first century using 40 state-of-the-art climate models under two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5. The 2 degrees C threshold-crossing time (TCT) of SAT averaged across China was around 2033 and 2029 for RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively. Considering a +/- 1 sigma range of intermodel SAT change, the upper and lower bounds of the 2 degrees C TCT could differ by about 25 years or even more. Uncertainty in the projected SAT and the warming rate around the TCT are the two main factors responsible for the TCT uncertainty. The former is determined by the climate sensitivity represented by the global mean surface temperature response. About 45 % of the intermodel variance of the projected 2 degrees C TCT for averaged SAT over China can be explained by climate sensitivity across the models, which is contributed mainly by central and southern China. In a climate more sensitive to CO2 forcing, stronger greenhouse effect, less stratus cloud over the East Asian monsoon region, and less snow cover on the Tibetan Plateau result in increased downward longwave radiation, increased shortwave radiation, and decreased shortwave radiation reflected by the surface, respectively, all of which may advance the TCT.","[Chen, Xiaolong; Zhou, Tianjun] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, State Key Lab Numer Modeling Atmospher Sci & Geop, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS","Chen, XL (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, State Key Lab Numer Modeling Atmospher Sci & Geop, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.",chenxl@lasg.iap.ac.cn,"ZHOU, Tianjun/C-3195-2012; Chen, Xiaolong/AAO-7147-2020","ZHOU, Tianjun/0000-0002-5829-7279; ",Strategic Priority Research Program-Climate Change: Carbon Budget and Related Issues'' of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA05110300]; Research Fund for Commonwealth Trades (Meteorology) [GYHY201506012]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41420104006]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2015M581152],Strategic Priority Research Program-Climate Change: Carbon Budget and Related Issues'' of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); Research Fund for Commonwealth Trades (Meteorology); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation),"We thank three anonymous reviewers for their constructive suggestions for improving this study.

In other words, are they too expensive for small schools to operate? The presence of a business school necessitates hiring business faculty with comparatively high salary expectations. Design/methodology/approach This paper analyses the cost effectiveness of business schools at four small liberal arts universities. Findings Our results show that cost is most strongly correlated with class size and adjunct instruction as opposed to faculty salaries. Research limitations/implications Thus, class size and the implementation of adjunct instruction can make having a business school not only affordable but also advantageous. Practical implications Business schools offer a way for universities with missions centred around developing the whole person through a liberal arts education to remain a going concern in such a volatile climate.

In this study, the latest observations and results obtained with state-of-the-art climate models are combined. In addition, regional effects due to ocean dynamics and changes in the Earth's gravity field induced by melting of land-based ice masses have been taken into account. The climate scenarios are constructed for the target years 2050 and 2100, for both a moderate and a large rise in global mean atmospheric temperature (2 C and 4 C in 2100 respectively). The climate scenarios contain contributions from changes in ocean density (global thermal expansion and local steric changes related to changing ocean dynamics) and changes in ocean mass (melting of mountain glaciers and ice caps, changes in the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, and (minor) terrestrial water-storage contributions). All major components depend on the global temperature rise achieved in the target periods considered. The resulting set of climate scenarios represents our best estimate of twenty-first century sea level rise in the northeast Atlantic Ocean, given the current understanding of the various contributions. For 2100, they yield a local rise of 30 to 55 cm and 40 to 80 cm for the moderate and large rise in global mean atmospheric temperature, respectively.","[Katsman, Caroline A.; Hazeleger, Wilco; Drijfhout, Sybren S.; Oldenborgh, Geert Jan van; Burgers, Gerrit] Royal Netherlands Meteorol Inst KNMI, Global Climate Div, NL-3730 AE De Bilt, Netherlands",Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute,"Katsman, C (corresponding author), Royal Netherlands Meteorol Inst KNMI, Global Climate Div, POB 201, NL-3730 AE De Bilt, Netherlands.",katsman@knmi.nl,"van Oldenborgh, Geert Jan/A-4176-2011; Drijfhout, Sybren/I-4230-2016","van Oldenborgh, Geert Jan/0000-0002-6898-9535; Hazeleger, Wilco/0000-0002-4566-958X",,,,,76,59,59,2,40,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

J,"Weinstein, TI",,,,"Weinstein, Tania Islas",,,Expuestas:Laborious Expectations and the Plight of Feminist Art in Contemporary Mexico,SIGNS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"In 2015, the Modern Art Museum (MAM) in Mexico City put on a much-anticipated exhibit of the works of Lorena Wolffer, a feminist artist and political activist known for tackling issues of gender-based violence in her work. However, the exhibit soon became a flash point for a debate about sexual violence in art institutions and the personal responsibilities of artist activists when a MAM worker was harassed and fired. Many members of the Mexican artistic community loudly condemned Wolffer for denouncing sexual violence in her work while not doing enough to help the victim and even going ahead with her show. This article analyzes Wolffer's oeuvre-situating it within both Mexico's contemporary political climate and existing debates on feminist activist art-and the scandal at the museum. It argues that the personal and professional expectations and critiques placed on many feminist artists arise not simply from the subject matter of their work but also from the form that their artistic practice takes and the types of labor it entails, which often include decentering the authorial element of creation, giving voice and presence to ordinary citizens, helping victims of gender- and sexual-based violence heal, and educating the broader public about these issues. This often entails privileging the artistic process over the production of objects that are sold in the art market. To bear out this argument, this article contrasts Wolffer's work with that of Santiago Sierra, an artist who engages in politically critical art but eschews normative political commitments and activism. The article concludes that while the artistic field in Mexico is ostensibly becoming more open to feminist art and nontraditional artistic practices, its organizational, curatorial, and critical facets remain staunchly antithetical to a feminist project.","[Weinstein, Tania Islas] McGill Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Montreal, PQ, Canada",McGill University,"Weinstein, TI (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",,,,,,,,59,0,0,2,5,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0097-9740,1545-6943,,SIGNS,Signs,1-Jun,2020,4,,SI,,903,929,,10.1086/707800,http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/707800,,,27,Women's Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Women's Studies,MD6MN,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000544085800006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Using advanced methods from statistical physics that are able to distinguish between trends and persistence we have shown recently that this rule may well extend to months, years and decades, and on these scales the decay of the persistence seems to follow a universal power law. Here we review these studies and discuss, how the law can be used as an (uncomfortable) test bed for the state-of-the-art climate models. It turns out that the models considered display wide performance differences and actually fail to reproduce the universal power law behavior of the persistence. It seems that the models tend to underestimate persistence while overestimating trends, and this fact may imply that the models exaggerate the expected global warming of the atmosphere.

Adapting to climate uncertainty requires trialing out new experiments in water governance and establishing processes to learn from those experiments. Social learning is regarded as an important aspect that supports the transformation of water governance systems. Understanding where and how social learning is occurring is critical to improving adaptation outcomes of water management in an uncertain climate. Yet, there is little research asserting the scope of social learning processes in a wide variety of empirical contexts. This article examines social learning in water management in Western Australia. Two specific case studies involving the state-of-the-art experiments in surface and groundwater management are used to illustrate and to understand the institutional dynamics and barriers of social learning. The cases depict single-loop learning to a larger extent and double-loop learning to a lesser extent. The findings emphasize the importance of dealing with learning externalities, the mismatch of ecological and administrative scales, and facilitating actor networks and multilevel interaction in order to embed social learning in climate adaptation. Water governance reforms should facilitate institutional configurations that enhance social learning opportunities.","[Ananda, Jayanath] CQ Univ, Sch Business & Law, Melbourne Campus, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia; [McFarlane, Don] Univ Western Australia, Sch Agr & Environm, Crawley, WA, Australia; [Loh, Michael] Water Corp, Infrastruct Planning Branch, Leederville, WA, Australia",Central Queensland University; University of Western Australia,"Ananda, J (corresponding author), CQ Univ, Sch Business & Law, Melbourne Campus, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia.",j.ananda@cqu.edu.au,"Ananda, Jayanath/C-9715-2013","Ananda, Jayanath/0000-0002-4072-6725",,,,,61,8,8,1,11,"WILEY PERIODICALS, INC",SAN FRANCISCO,"ONE MONTGOMERY ST, SUITE 1200, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94104 USA",1756-932X,1756-9338,,ENVIRON POLICY GOV,Environ.

This brings to the fore multiple challenges in the search for anticipatory governance and the role herein for climate foresight. Foresight entails processes to envision challenging futures and question limiting assumptions about what futures are possible, but these processes also impact upon presentday politics. While foresight-related activities are proliferating in sustainability research and planning, critical social science scrutiny of such processes remains minimal. Two key gaps in understanding are: (a) the link between foresight, planning and policy change; and (b) the very prospects of relying on foresight in the present to steer largely unknowable futures. In addressing these gaps, we review the field of climate foresight research here, situating it within a broader interdisciplinary body of literature relating to anticipation and anticipatory governance. In doing so, we identify a conceptual lens through which to analyze the political implications of foresight processes, and apply it to the case of two ongoing foresight initiatives. We conclude with noting the urgent need for further research on the role of foresight within anticipatory climate governance in a post-Paris era.","[Vervoort, Joost] Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Vervoort, Joost] Univ Oxford, Environm Change Inst, Oxford, England; [Gupta, Aarti] Wageningen Univ & Res, Environm Policy Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands",Utrecht University; University of Oxford; Wageningen University & Research,"Vervoort, J (corresponding author), Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Utrecht, Netherlands.;Vervoort, J (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Environm Change Inst, Oxford, England.",j.m.vervoort@uu.nl; joost.vervoort@eci.ox.ac.uk,,,"EU under 7th Framework Program [KBBE.2013.2.5-01, 613532]; EU FP7 CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS); CGIAR Fund Council, Australia (ACIAR); European Union; International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD)","EU under 7th Framework Program; EU FP7 CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS)(CGIAR); CGIAR Fund Council, Australia (ACIAR)(CGIAR); European Union(European Commission); International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD)","This research is part of the TRANSMANGO project.

The new model, called LMDz-NEMO-Med, is composed of LMDz4-regional as atmospheric component and of NEMOMED8 as oceanic component. This AORCM equilibrates freely, without any flux adjustment, neither in fresh water nor in heat. At its atmospheric lateral boundary conditions, it is driven by ERA-40 data from 1958 to 2001, after a spin-up of 40 years in coupled configuration. The model performance is assessed and compared with available observational datasets. The model skill in reproducing mean state and inter-annual variability of main atmospheric and oceanic surface fields is in line with that of state-of-the-art AORCMs. Considering the ocean behaviour, the inter-annual variations of the basin-scale heat content are in very good agreement with the observations. The model results concerning salt content could not be adequately validated. High inter-annual variability of deep convection in the Gulf of Lion is simulated, with 53 % of convective winters, representative of the present climate state. The role of different factors influencing the deep convection and its inter-annual variability is examined, including dynamic and hydrostatic ocean preconditioning and atmospheric surface forcing. A conceptual framework is outlined and validated in linking the occurrence of deep convection to the efficiency of the integrated surface buoyancy fluxes along the winter season to mix the initially stratified averaged water column down to the convective threshold depth. This simple framework (based only on 2 independent variables) is able to explain 60 % (resp. 69 %) of inter-annual variability of the deep water formation rate (resp. maximum mixed layer depth) for the West Mediterranean Deep Water (WMDW) formation process.","[L'Heveder, Blandine; Li, Laurent] Univ Paris 06, Meteorol Dynam Lab, F-75252 Paris 05, France; [Sevault, Florence; Somot, Samuel] Meteo France, Ctr Natl Rech Meteorol, Toulouse, France",UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Meteo France,"L'Heveder, B (corresponding author), Univ Paris 06, Meteorol Dynam Lab, Tour 45-55,3E Etage,Case Postale 99,4,Pl Jussieu, F-75252 Paris 05, France.",blh@locean-ipsl.upmc.fr,"Somot, Samuel/A-7585-2008; Li, Laurent/X-3278-2019","Li, Laurent/0000-0002-3855-3976; Somot, Samuel/0000-0002-5066-2921",European Project CIRCE: Integrated Project Climate Change and Impact Research: the Mediterranean Environment,European Project CIRCE: Integrated Project Climate Change and Impact Research: the Mediterranean Environment,We would like to thank M.

In the literature various devices are proposed which enable in-situ CT hygro-, thermo- or mechanical testing, each with its own merits and limitations. However none of them is able to perform advanced hygro-thermo-mechanical tests on specimens subjected to multiple loading modes, while accurately controlling and measuring the force, displacement, temperature and relative humidity in real time. Therefore, this work proposes an in-situ CT device which allows such multi-faceted experiments. Improvements to the current state-of-the-art devices include: (1) a compact, lightweight and rotationally symmetric design that enables high-resolution CT scans by minimization of wobble during scanning, in practically all lab-scale CT scanners; (2) a stationary region of interest by loading the sample from both sides, which enables high resolution CT characterization of materials exhibiting a large fracture strain; and (3) improved testing modularity by exchanging clamping methods to allow samples of various sizes (e.g., circular or rectangular) to be inserted in a variety of ways, thereby facilitating complex experiments such as three- or four-point bending tests. Validation experiments demonstrate that stringent requirements on CT resolution, loading and displacement accuracy and climate control are met. Furthermore, the in-situ testing capabilities of the device were validated by CT characterization of the creasing and folding process of multi-layer cardboard under varying (controlled) levels of relative humidity and temperature.","[Vonk, N.

The aims of the study were to compare the relative importance of individual and combined effects of CC, 2 x CO2, and photosynthetic acclimation, and to assess the importance of local site conditions. The model was driven by hourly means for temperature (T), precipitation (P), global radiation (G), vapour pressure (VP), and wind speed (U). Local climate scenarios were derived by statistical downscaling techniques from a 2 x CO2 simulation with the General Circulation Model of the Canadian Climate Centre (CCC-GCMII). Simulations over 14 growing seasons to account for year-to-year variability of climate were carried out for a low, relatively dry site, and a high, more humid site. At both sites, shoot dry matter responded positively to 2 x CO2 with the site at low elevation being more sensitive than the higher site. The effect of assumed changes in climate was negative at the lower, but positive at the higher site. Shoot dry matter was more sensitive to the effects of 2 x CO2 than to CC. Both effects combined increased shoot dry matter by up to 20%. This was attributed to direct effects of 2 x CO2 and increased T,and indirect stimulation via increased soil N availability. Biomass partitioning to roots increased with 2 x CO2 but decreased with CC, while an intermediate response resulted from the combination. Leaf area index (LAI) increased under 2 x CO2, but not enough to compensate fully for a decrease in leaf conductance. Under the 2 x CO2 scenario evapotranspiration (ET) decreased, but increased under CC. Photosynthetic acclimation reduced the effect of 2 x CO2 on shoot growth, but had little effect on ET. The seasonal water use efficiency (WUE) was improved under 2 x CO2, and reduced under CC. With the combination of both factors, the change was small but still positive, especially at the high elevation site with more favourable soil water conditions. This reflects the stronger positive yield response in combination with a smaller increase in ET under cooler, more humid conditions. The results for the combination of factors suggest that except for shoot growth, effects of 2 x CO2 and CC tend to offset each other. While CC determines the sign of the ET response, the sign of the biomass response is determined by 2 x CO2. The results highlight the importance of a site-specific analysis of ecosystem responses by using a flexible approach based on a combination of state-of-the-art downscaling, spatially resolved data sets, and a mechanistic model to obtain quantitative and reproducible assessments of climate change impacts at the ecosystem level.","Inst Environm Protect & Agr IUL Liebefeld, Swiss Fed Res Stn Agroecol & Agr FAL, CH-3003 Bern, Switzerland; Univ Bern, Inst Geog, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; Swiss Fed Inst Technol Zurich, Inst Terr Ecol, Syst Ecol Grp, CH-8952 Schlieren, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Research Station Agroscope; Swiss Federal Research Station for Agroecology & Agriculture; University of Bern; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Riedo, M (corresponding author), Inst Environm Protect & Agr IUL Liebefeld, Swiss Fed Res Stn Agroecol & Agr FAL, CH-3003 Bern, Switzerland.",juerg.fuhrer@iul.admin.ch,,,,,,,46,40,41,0,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

Here we describe the first application of RCM simulations with Regional Climate Model Version 4 (RegCM4) for radiation fluxes over the South West Indian Ocean (SWIO). We analyzed the performance of RegCM4 on radiation fluxes, especially its radiative schemes presentation, which could provide basic information for surface solar radiation temporal-spatial variability analysis with RegCM4 over SWIO region. We used ERA-Interim reanalysis data for the period 2000-2005 to drive RegCM4 to simulate the radiation budget and associated parameters such as cloud cover, precipitation and surface temperature, over Southern Africa and the SWIO with a horizontal resolution of 50 km. The 2 existing available radiation schemes were tested and evaluated: (1) the default radiation scheme of the NCAR Community Climate Model Version 3 (CCM); and (2) the recently implemented Rapid Radiation Transfer Model (RRTM). To analyze the behavior of the radiation schemes and their impact on the surface climate, model outputs were validated against available satellite and reanalysis data. A comparison of the seasonal radiation budget as simulated by RegCM4-CCM and RegCM4-RRTM at the surface and at the top of the atmosphere showed good qualitative agreement. RegCM4 with the RRTM scheme generally better simulates the radiation budget and cloud cover over the whole domain with regard to the reference data than RegCM4 with the CCM scheme; RRTM could therefore be chosen as the radiative scheme in subsequent studies of surface solar radiation by RegCM4.","[Li, Peng; Li, Qi] Guangxi Univ Sci & Technol, 268 Ave Donghuan, Liuzhou 545006, Guangxi, Peoples R China; [Chiacchio, Marc] Stockholm Univ, Dept Meteorol, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Chiacchio, Marc] Stockholm Univ, Bolin Ctr Climate Res, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden",Guangxi University of Science & Technology; Stockholm University; Stockholm University,"Li, P (corresponding author), Guangxi Univ Sci & Technol, 268 Ave Donghuan, Liuzhou 545006, Guangxi, Peoples R China.",lipeng.candy@gmail.com,,,lab LE2P at the University of Reunion,lab LE2P at the University of Reunion,"This study was supported by the lab LE2P at the University of Reunion by providing the research platform.

The RegCM, which is run with a 60 km gridpoint spacing is interactively coupled with a state-of-the-art surface physics package that includes full surface hydrology calculations (the Biosphere-Atmosphere Transfer Scheme or BATS). The hydrologic budgets of ten regional drainage basins in the US are analysed. Model results are compared with available observations and with results from previous modelling experiments to evaluate the feasibility of using nested RegCM/GCM models for hydrology studies. In our experiment, the model captures the basic seasonality of the basin hydrologic budgets, although the simulated precipitation amounts are too high over the western US and too low over the eastern US. As a result, runoff, snow cover and soil water content are underestimated over the eastern US basins, while evaporation and runoff are overestimated in some of the western US basins. Topographically induced characteristics of precipitation, snow cover and runoff are well simulated over the mountainous western regions. Also well captured is the interbasin variation of hydrologic budgets which occurs in response to different climatic settings. The springtime snowmelt and peak runoff season generally occurs in the model earlier in the year than is observed. Although our work indicates that the coupled regional modelling system can be useful in applications to hydrological studies, results from this experiment indicate that better accuracy in the simulation of regional climatic variables and more detailed representation of some hydrologic processes would be required before the coupled modelling system could be used to provide accurate assessments of hydrologic responses to climate change.",,,"GIORGI, F (corresponding author), NATL CTR ATMOSPHER RES, POB 3000, BOULDER, CO 80307 USA.",,"Giorgi, Filippo/C-3169-2013",,,,,,42,28,31,1,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0035-9009,1477-870X,,Q J ROY METEOR SOC,Q.

In this contribution we report on the development of an innovative micro scale tri-generation system (power + heating + cooling), equipped with a rotor based desiccant system adapted to the Mediterranean conditions which receives heat for the desiccant regeneration from a combined heat and power (CHP) cycle. The paper presents the design of the advanced desiccant air handling unit which uses a high efficient combination of a vapor compression chiller working at a high evaporator temperature and a desiccant wheel (silica gel). The electricity of the chiller is supplied by the CHP system and the heat to regenerate the desiccant is the waste heat of the CHP. System simulations have been used to optimize the hydraulic design and the operation strategy in order to minimize operation costs and maximize energy savings. Some new component models, e.g. for the advanced desiccant cycle were developed for this purpose. The final design of the entire system consisting of the CHP system, the vapor compression chiller, the advanced desiccant air handling unit and the load system is described. The load system is composed of an air duct network with induction units and a chilled water network with fan-coils in the office rooms. Regarding energy performance results indicate an electricity saving > 30% in comparison to state-of-the-art solutions based on conventional technology.

High interpretability can provide qualitative understanding between the meteorological variables and the climate phenomena which is helpful for climate scientists to learn causes of climate events. However, detecting the features which have efficient interpretability to observed events is challenging in spatio-temporal climate data because the key features may be overlooked by the redundancy due to the high degree of spatial and temporal correlations among the features, especially in high dimensionality. Furthermore, climate events occurred in different regions or different times may have different explanatory patterns, detecting explanations for overall climate phenomena is also difficult. Here we propose Galaxy, a new interpretable predictive model. Galaxy allows us to represent the explanatory patterns of subpopulations within an overall population of the target. Each explanatory pattern is defined by the smallest feature subset that the conditional distribution of target actually depends on, which we define as the minimal target explanation. Based on the detection of such explanatory patterns, Galaxy can detect the Galaxy space, the explanations for the overall target population, by sequentially detecting target explanation of every individual subpopulation of the target, and then forecast the target variable by their ensemble predictive power. We validate our approach by comparing Galaxy to several state-of-the-art baselines in a set of comparative experiments and then evaluate how Galaxy can be used to identify the explanatory space and give a referential explanation report in a real-world scenario on a given location in the United States.","[Zhuang, Yong; Shu, Xin; Ding, Wei] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Comp Sci, Boston, MA 02125 USA; [Small, David L.; Islam, Shafiqul] Tufts Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Boston, MA 02111 USA; [Yu, Kui] Hefei Univ Technol, Sch Comp & Informat, Hefei, Anhui, Peoples R China",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Boston; Tufts University; Hefei University of Technology,"Zhuang, Y (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Dept Comp Sci, Boston, MA 02125 USA.",yong.zhuang001@umb.edu; David.Small@tufts.edu; xin.shu001@umb.edu; yukui@hfut.edu.cn; Shafiqul.Islam@tufts.edu; Wei.Ding@umb.edu,,"Ding, Wei/0000-0002-3383-551X; Zhuang, Yong/0000-0003-4456-4556",National Science Foundation [1743010]; Oracle Education Foundation; National Science Foundation of China [61876206],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Oracle Education Foundation; National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"Funding for this research was provided in part by the National Science Foundation grant 1743010, Oracle Education Foundation grant to the College of Science and Mathematics at the University of Massachusetts Boston and the National Science Foundation of China under Grant 61876206.",,21,0,0,0,2,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-1-5386-9125-0,,,,2018,,,,,146,153,,10.1109/ICBK.2018.00027,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICBK.2018.00027,,,8,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Engineering,BM7MB,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000468072300019,View Full Record in Web of Science

These patterns are a secondary result of the temperature distribution and are therefore difficult to specify, but the practical importance attached to any regional changes in soil moisture is obviously enormous. In this study we have attempted to see how experiments with climate models reveal regional soil moisture changes over North America when carbon dioxide is doubled (or the equivalent radiation perturbation due to an increase in all the greenhouse gases takes place). Results from five of the current state of the art climate models are compared with each other and with existing estimates of soil moisture distribution, with emphasis on how they respond to the carbon dioxide perturbation. (The models are those of GFDL, GISS, NCAR, OSU, and UKMO.) There is considerable difference between the soil moisture formulations and the resulting outputs of these five models in terms of soil moisture distribution changes, but some general conclusions can be drawn nevertheless: (i) The agreement between models is considerably better in the wintertime than in the summertime; (ii) one subset of the models agrees remarkably well in winter, while a different subset shows better agreement in summer; (iii) we can tentatively conclude on the basis of the model experiments that in winter there may be an increase in soil moisture in North America at high latitudes and an onset of drier conditions in the southern states and Mexico; and (iv) that in summer there may be a tendency toward drier conditions in the middle of the continent together with wetter conditions along the Gulf Coast and the West Coast of the United States and Canada. These conclusions must, of course, be taken with great caution until they can be checked with greatly improved climate models, but it is reassuring to note that most of these features are consistent with the results of studies of past warmer periods.","[Kellogg, William W.] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [Zhao, Zong-Ci] Peking Univ, Dept Geophys, Beijing, Peoples R China",National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; Peking University,"Kellogg, WW (corresponding author), NCAR, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA.",,,,National Science Foundation; Department of Energy,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)),The National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) is sponsored by the National Science Foundation.

The wet and dry seasons will be defined, and the important roles played by the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) in modulating the rainfall during these seasons will be discussed. The seasonal climate forecasts in this paper are made by 13 state of the art coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (CGCMs) and by the Florida State University Synthetic Superensemble (FSUSSE), whose forecasts are obtained by a weighted combination of the individual CGCM forecasts based on a training period. The success of the models in simulating the observed 1989-2001 climatology of the various forecast parameters will be examined and linked to the models' success in predicting the seasonal climate for individual years. Seasonal forecasts will be examined for precipitation, sea-surface temperature (SST), 2-meter air temperature, and 850hPa u- and v-wind components during the period 1989-2001. Evaluation metrics include root mean square (RMS) error and Brier skill score. It will be shown that the FSUSSE is superior to the individual CGCMs and their ensemble mean both in simulating the 1989-2001 climatology for the various parameters and in predicting the seasonal climate of the various parameters for individual years. The seasonal climate forecasts of the FSUSSE and of the ensemble mean of the 13 state of the art CGCMs will be evaluated for years (during the period 1989-2001) that have particular ENSO and NAO signals that are known to influence Caribbean weather, particularly the rainfall. It will be shown that the FSUSSE provides superior forecasts of rainfall, SST, 2-meter air temperature, and 850hPa u- and v-wind components during dry summers that are modulated by negative SOI and/or positive NAO indices. Such summers have become a feature of a twenty-year pattern of drought in the Caribbean region. The results presented in this paper will show that the FSUSSE is a valuable tool for forecasting rainfall and other atmospheric and oceanic variables during such periods of drought.","Florida State Univ, Dept Meteorol, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; Univ W Indies, Dept Phys, Mona, Jamaica; Tech Univ Istanbul, Dept Meteorol, Istanbul, Turkey",State University System of Florida; Florida State University; University West Indies Mona Jamaica; Istanbul Technical University,"Ross, RS (corresponding author), Florida State Univ, Dept Meteorol, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.",bross@coven.met.fsu.edu,"stefanova, lydia/B-2759-2013; Chakraborty, Arindam/M-9044-2014; SIRDAS, Sevinc ASILHAN/AAG-4679-2021","Chakraborty, Arindam/0000-0002-4288-0216; SIRDAS, Sevinc ASILHAN/0000-0003-2396-6038",,,,,27,1,1,0,5,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0177-7971,,,METEOROL ATMOS PHYS,Meteorol.

The satellite instruments must be capable of observing atmospheric and surface temperature trends as small as 0.1 degrees C decade(-1), ozone changes as little as 1% decade(-1), and variations in the sun's output as tiny as 0.1% decade(-1). To address these problems and recommend directions for improvements in satellite instrument calibration, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System-Integrated Program Office (NPOESS-IPO), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) organized a workshop at the University of Maryland Inn and Conference Center, College Park, Maryland, 12-14 November 2002. Some 75 scientists participated including researchers who develop and analyze long-term datasets from satellites; experts in the field of satellite instrument calibration, and physicists working on state-of-the-art calibration sources and standards. The workshop defined the absolute accuracies and long-term stabilities of global climate datasets that are needed to detect expected trends, translated these dataset accuracies and stabilities to required satellite instrument accuracies and stabilities, and evaluated the ability of current observing systems to meet these requirements. The workshop's recommendations include a set of basic axioms or overarching principles that must guide high quality climate observations in general, and a road map for improving satellite instrument characterization, calibration, intercalibration, and associated activities to meet the challenge of measuring global climate change.

As sisters of ocean and ice, the poets reference the climate relationships between ice melt in Greenland and sea inundation of the Marshall Islands as part of the extended, but differentiated, island colonial histories of occupation, militarism, and development. Having been brought together by environmental activist organisation 350.org , Jetnil-Kijiner and Niviana also strategically use their positionalities as Indigenous islanders to critique not only the continuity between colonial and neo-liberal operations but also the continuity between colonial and environmental scopic regimes, that taken together, stymie climate change imaginaries. In response to these discourses, they claim a feminist hydro-ontological imaginary. Ultimately, the video poem allows an examination of the value of materialist hydro-feminisms and feminism without borders (Mohanty, 2003) to extend Island Studies frameworks of the aquapelagic-the assemblage of human interactivity with sea, land, and sky.","[Faris, Jaimey Hamilton] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA",University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa,"Faris, JH (corresponding author), Univ Hawaii Manoa, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",jhamiltonfaris@gmail.com,,"Hamilton Faris, Jaimey/0000-0003-4647-4474",,,,,96,8,8,1,42,"MACQUARIE UNIV, DIV HUMANITIES",SYDNEY,"MACQUARIE UNIV, SYDNEY, NSW 2109, AUSTRALIA",1834-6049,1834-6057,,SHIMA,Shima,,2019,2,,,,76,99,,10.21463/shima.13.2.08,http://dx.doi.org/10.21463/shima.13.2.08,,,24,Geography,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Geography,JA4VW,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000487836900006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Prior to this point (late 13th Century AD) New Zealand contained a diverse avian megafauna dominated by nine species of large flightless ratite moa (Dinornithiformes). We used ancient DNA approaches to generate mitochondrial DNA sequence data from 39 crested moa (Pachyornis australis) and 145 heavy-footed moa (Pachyornis elephantopus) specimens. In combination with radiocarbon dating and dietary isotope analysis we examined the effects of Late Pleistocene and Holocene climate and environmental change on the phylogeography, palaeodemographics, and eventual extinction of Pachyornis. We show that Pachyornis changed altitudinal, longitudinal and latitudinal ranges through the Late Quaternary in response to alterations in the distribution of suitable habitat. However, we found no evidence for large-scale change in population sizes during the past 40,000 radiocarbon years BP (approximately 44,000 calendar years BP), or significant changes in delta C-13 and delta N-15 isotope signatures over this time period. The results suggest that crested moa tracked habitat through time with little consequence to population size. For the more broadly distributed heavy-footed moa, changes in climate and habitat distribution may have promoted phylogeographic structuring. Overall this study suggests that the likelihood of megafaunal extinction in New Zealand was greatly reduced in the absence of humans. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, an analysis has been done for investigating the impacts of these deep ocean biases, especially those which occur in temperature and salinity, ensuing biases in ocean dynamics and large scale air-sea interactions in state of the art CGCMs. The outputs from historical runs of 20 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP-5) models have been analyzed for Indian Ocean. All candidate models develop internal warm and saline biases approximately between a depth range of 100 and 800 m in long term simulations. These internal biases are found to have implications in large scale ocean dynamics via their linkage through baroclinicity of the ocean. The role of internal biases in the ensuing dynamics is correlated via relations between Brunt Vaisala frequency (N-2) and baroclinic wave speeds using both Sturm-Loiuville theorem and WKBJ approximation. The CMIP-5 models analyzed here have a higher baroclinic speed compared to that of observations. Annual propagating modes in the ocean reveal higher speeds in most of the models, and that the phase reversal is taking place at lead or lag by a month or more as compared to observations. The study suggests that faster wave propagation in climate models due to subsurface biases in temperature, salinity, N-2 and baroclinicity have potential to impact simulated planetary scale events in terms of their life cycle, periodicity and seasonality as analyzed with Indian Ocean Dipole Zonal Mode. A corollary being a cautionary outlook on climate projections made by coupled models as long as the biases are persistent.","[Shikha, Singh; Valsala, Vinu] Indian Inst Trop Meteorol, Dev Skilled Manpower Earth Syst Sci DESK, Pune, Maharashtra, India; [Shikha, Singh] Indian Inst Technol, Inter Disciplinary Program Climate Studies, Bombay, Maharashtra, India",Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) - India; Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM); Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Bombay,"Shikha, S (corresponding author), Indian Inst Trop Meteorol, DESK, Pune 411008, Maharashtra, India.",shikha.cat@tropmet.res.in,"Valsala, Vinu/V-8414-2019",,IITM,IITM,"Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune is an autonomous body under the Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES), Govt. of India and this work has been supported by various programs operating at IITM.

Teacher self-efficacy is defined as teacher beliefs in their ability to perform a teaching task. If teachers have strong teacher self-efficacy in the teaching of arts education, they are more likely to incorporate arts in the classroom. Alternatively, if teachers have weak teacher self-efficacy in the teaching of arts education they are less likely to include aspects of the arts in their curriculum. Little is known about teacher self-efficacy beliefs towards arts education in early childhood education. Since arts education is an important element in the curriculum of any classroom - including all early childhood classrooms - investigation of the beliefs that shape teacher practice is desirable. In 2010, a survey was distributed using convenience sampling to early childhood teachers throughout Queensland. There were 21 respondents, representing a response rate of 27%. Each completed an adapted version of the Teachers' Sense of Efficacy Scale for Arts Education. Perceived competence towards each of the five arts strands (dance, drama, media, visual arts and music) were compared to perceived competence in maths and English. The number of hours taught in each of the arts strands was also investigated. Findings suggest all of the respondent early childhood teachers had greater perceived competence for teaching maths and English compared to any of the arts strands. Some early childhood teachers did not engage with some of the arts strands (particularly drama, dance, media) in their daily classrooms. These findings provide glimpses of the current day-to-day running of early childhood classrooms and the role of arts education in the current climate of policy reform and accountability.","[Garvis, Susanne] Griffith Univ, Areas Mus & Arts Educ, Nathan, Qld, Australia; [Pendergast, Donna] Griffith Univ, Nathan, Qld, Australia",Griffith University; Griffith University,"Garvis, S (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Areas Mus & Arts Educ, Nathan, Qld, Australia.",,"Pendergast, Donna L/D-3558-2019","Pendergast, Donna L/0000-0002-8305-6127",,,,,30,19,19,1,1,ARIZONA STATE UNIV,TEMPE,"C/O GULLY GAMMAGE HALL/SCHOOL ART, TEMPE, AZ 85287 USA",1529-8094,,,INT J EDUC ARTS,Int.

Following the example of the United States, the phenomenon has now reached Europe. This article addresses the many questions raised by climate change litigation in a cross-border context. Starting from the treaty framework for greenhouse gas emissions, it analyses issues in respect of court jurisdiction and the applicable law from a European perspective. The authors argue for a balancing of the legitimate interests of, on one hand, private individuals who suffer the consequences of climate change and, on the other, industrial firms that have acquired and relied on emission rights. With regard to the competent court, they suggest limiting court jurisdiction under Art. 7(2) Brussels Ia Regulation to those places where it was foreseeable, from the perspective of the polluter, that damage would occur. With regard to the applicable law, they propose tempering Art. 7 Rome II Regulation by an analogous application of Art. 5(1) para. 2 of the same Regulation. While the victim can generally choose between the law of the country where the damage originated and where the damage occurred, the latter option should be restricted in the case of climate change litigation because the place of damage is typically unforseeable for the tortfeasor. Furthermore, a valid authorization by the state of emission should be taken into account under Art. 17 Rome II Regulation insofar as appropriate. The law of the country where the damage occurred could apply to liability where an authorization does not exist, was obviously invalid, obtained by fraud or where such authorization has been consciously transgressed.","[Lehmann, Matthias] Rheinischen Friedrich Wilhelms Univ Bonn, Bonn, Germany; [Lehmann, Matthias] Inst Int Privatrecht & Rechtsvergleichung, Adenauerallee 24-42, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Eichel, Florian] Univ Bern, Schanzeneckstr 1,Postfach 3444, CH-3001 Bern, Switzerland",University of Bonn; University of Bern,"Lehmann, M (corresponding author), Rheinischen Friedrich Wilhelms Univ Bonn, Bonn, Germany.;Lehmann, M (corresponding author), Inst Int Privatrecht & Rechtsvergleichung, Adenauerallee 24-42, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.",,,,,,,,67,1,1,0,1,MOHR SIEBECK,TUBINGEN,"PO BOX 2040, TUBINGEN, 72010, GERMANY",0033-7250,1868-7059,,RABELS Z AUSL INT PR,Rabels Z.

Southeast Asia is one of the main rice growing areas, and Thailand is the world's fifth largest producer of this crop. Thailand is tied with Burma as the largest per capita rice producer: about 113 ton per person per year. Approximately one quarter of the land area of the Kingdom of Thailand is used for rice production, and this commodity constituted 12.6% of the GDP in 1988. Rice made up 8.6% of the 1988 exports from the country. The above information supports the contention of this paper; that it is important both regionally and nationally for Thailand to adopt policies which would offset any negative trends imposed by possible climate changes on rice production. Possible climate change scenarios from three Global Climate Models (GCMs) are illustrated, and one of these was selected for more detailed study as regards its potential impact on rice production. Four groups of factors arc considered by our state-of-the-art rice plant process computer simulation model in estimating rice yield. These are: cultural practice, soils, climate, and genetics of the variety planted. The main focus of our study is on the genetic characteristics of crop yield; although, a portion of the cultural practice is of necessity considered along with the varietal aspects. We have shown how the GCM climate change scenario can be used by the rice model to produce information concerning the effect on yield estimates of variations in the vector of input genetic coefficients, This methodology has been used to modify the genetic coefficients of the rice varieties currently grown at 7 selected locations across Thailand in order to obtain a set of ''improved'' varieties which would produce higher yields at these locations under a ''new'' climate. Such improved yields require changes in sowing dates and fertilizer application scheduling. Finally these ''representative'' yield estimates are aggregated to area production values and then transformed into economic terms to illustrate possible baht/year impacts at the national level of both climate change impacts and of the beneficial effects of planting our ''improved'' varieties under modified Lum practice, Although our study is by no means comprehensive at this point, it is extensive enough to make the points that: a national policy which would direct rice breeders to consider possible climate change influences in their breeding programs would be cost beneficial, a national policy to encourage a cooperative effort between the agricultural extension service and the farming community which would highlight the variety selection/climate change/cultural practice interactive effects would be cost beneficial, and because of the geographical variability associated with the results we have obtained, a more extensive and comprehensive study of the type we present will be needed to produce quantitative information which ran be used in strategic and tactical decision making at the national and regional levels.","SRINAKARINWIROT UNIV,DEPT MATH,BANGKOK 10110,THAILAND; OKLAHOMA STATE UNIV,DEPT AGR ENGN,STILLWATER,OK 73069",Srinakharinwirot University; Oklahoma State University System; Oklahoma State University - Stillwater,,,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,11,SCI SOC THAILAND,BANGKOK,"CHULALONGKORN UNIV FACULTY OF SCIENCE, BANGKOK 10330, THAILAND",0303-8122,,,J SCI SOC THAILAND,J.

Here we document how current climate and seasonal prediction models simulate the timing and amplitude of this ISM-ENSO teleconnection. Many Coupled General Circulation Models (CGCMs) do simulate a simultaneous inverse relationship between ENSO and ISM, though with a large spread. However, most of them show significant negative correlations before ISM, which are at odd with observations. Consistent with this systematic error, simulated Nino-3.4 Sea Surface Temperature (SST) variability has erroneous high amplitude during boreal spring and ISM rainfall variability is also too strong during the first part of ISM. The role of the Indian Ocean (IO) in modulating the ISM-ENSO relationships is further investigated using dedicated experiments with the SINTEX-F2 CGCM. Decoupled tropical Pacific and IO experiments are conducted to assess the direct relationship between ISM and IO SSTs on one hand, and the specific role of IO feedback on ENSO on the other hand. The direct effect of IO SSTs on ISM is weak and insignificant at the interannual time scale in the Pacific decoupled experiment. On the other hand, IO decoupled experiments demonstrate that El Nino shifts rapidly to La Nina when ocean-atmosphere coupling is active in the whole IO or only in its western part. This IO negative feedback is mostly active during the decaying phase of El Nino, which is accompanied by a basin-wide warming in the IO, and significantly modulates the length of ENSO events in our simulations. This IO feedback operates through a modulation of the Walker circulation over the IO, which strengthens and shifts eastward an anomalous anticyclone centered on the Philippine Sea and associated easterly wind anomalies in the equatorial western Pacific during boreal winter. In turn, these atmospheric anomalies lead to a fast ENSO turnabout via oceanic adjustement processes mediated by eastward propagating upwelling Kelvin waves. An experiment in which only the SouthEast Indian Ocean (SEIO) is decoupled, demonstrates that the equatorial SST gradient in the IO during boreal winter plays a fundamental role in the efficiency of IO feedback. In this experiment, simulated ISM-ENSO lead-lag correlations match closely the observations. This success is associated with removal of erroneous SEIO SST variability during boreal winter in the SEIO decoupled experiment. Finally, it is illustrated that most CMIP5 CGCMs exhibit similar SST errors in the SEIO during boreal winter in addition to an exagerated SEIO SST variability during boreal fall.","[Terray, Pascal; Masson, Sebastien] Univ Paris 06 CNRS IRD MNHN, LOCEAN IPSL, Sorbonne Univ UPMC, BP100 4 Pl Jussieu, F-75252 Paris 05, France; [Sooraj, K.

Based on a hermeneutic phenomenological analysis (van Manen, 1990) that connects the children's experiences and the artist-educators' experiences of how learning became possible in different ways, it is argued that enriched conditions for learning can be fostered through integrating art forms (here dance and visual arts) and by tools that constitute an embodied and culturally sensitive pedagogy.","[Nielsen, Charlotte Svendler] Univ Copenhagen, Studies, Dept Nutr Exercise & Sports, Res Cluster Embodiment Learning & Social Change, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Samuel, Gerard M.] Univ Cape Town, Sch Dance, Cape Town, South Africa; [Wilson, Lisa] Univ Cape Town, Ctr Theatre Dance & Performance Studies, Cape Town, South Africa; [Vedel, Karen A.] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Arts & Cultural Studies, Theatre & Performance Studies, Copenhagen, Denmark",University of Copenhagen; University of Cape Town; University of Cape Town; University of Copenhagen,"Nielsen, CS (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen, Studies, Dept Nutr Exercise & Sports, Res Cluster Embodiment Learning & Social Change, Copenhagen, Denmark.",,"Svendler Nielsen, Charlotte/D-7665-2015","Svendler Nielsen, Charlotte/0000-0003-0811-1832",Danish Agency for Science and Higher Education [5132-00138B]; Danish Agency for Culture and Palaces [5132-00138B]; Municipality of Copenhagen's Open School funds [5132-00138B],Danish Agency for Science and Higher Education; Danish Agency for Culture and Palaces; Municipality of Copenhagen's Open School funds,"The Red Apples-Green Applesproject was made possible by funding [grant no. 5132-00138B from the Danish Agency for Science and Higher Education (an International Network Program led by Karen A.

Observations and hindcast simulations suggest that from the early 1970s to the mid-1990s the subpolar gyre became fresher while the gyre and meridional circulations intensified. This is opposite to the relationship of freshening causing a weakened circulation, most often reproduced by climate models. The authors hypothesize that both these configurations exist but dominate on different time scales: a fresher subpolar gyre when the circulation is more intense, at interannual frequencies (configuration A), and a saltier subpolar gyre when the circulation is more intense, at longer periods (configuration B). Rather than going into the detail of the mechanisms sustaining each configuration, the authors' objective is to identify which configuration dominates and to test whether this depends on frequency, in preindustrial control runs of five climate models from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). To this end, the authors have developed a novel intercomparison method that enables analysis of freshwater budget and circulation changes in a physical perspective that overcomes model specificities. Lag correlations and a cross-spectral analysis between freshwater content changes and circulation indices validate the authors' hypothesis, as configuration A is only visible at interannual frequencies while configuration B is mostly visible at decadal and longer periods, suggesting that the driving role of salinity on the circulation depends on frequency. Overall, this analysis underscores the large differences among state-of-the-art climate models in their representations of the North Atlantic freshwater budget.","[Deshayes, Julie] Univ Cape Town, ICEMASA, ZA-7701 Cape Town, South Africa; [Deshayes, Julie] CNRS IRD IFREMER UBO, Lab Phys Oceans, Plouzane, France; [Deshayes, Julie; Curry, Ruth] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [Msadek, Rym] NOAA, Geophys Fluid Dynam Lab, Princeton, NJ USA",University of Cape Town; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Ifremer; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite de Bretagne Occidentale; Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Deshayes, J (corresponding author), Univ Cape Town, Dept Oceanog, Private Bag X3, ZA-7701 Cape Town, South Africa.",julie.deshayes@ird.fr,,"Deshayes, Julie/0000-0002-1462-686X",NSF [0751896]; IFREMER through project RICCO,NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); IFREMER through project RICCO,"We are thankful to the modeling groups that gave us access to their control simulations before they were available to public, in particular to Juliette Mignot, Laurent Terray, Aurore Voldoire, David Salas, Gokhan Danabasoglu, and Claude Talandier.

In this case, the model output for the variable of interest (e.g. precipitation) is directly downscaled using observations. In this paper we test the performance of a MOS implementation of the popular analog methodology (referred to as MOS analog) applied to downscale daily precipitation outputs over Spain. To this aim, we consider the state-of-the-art ERA40-driven RCMs provided by the EU-funded ENSEMBLES project and the Spain02 gridded observations data set, using the common period 1961-2000. The MOS analog method improves the representation of the mean regimes, the annual cycle, the frequency and the extremes of precipitation for all RCMs, regardless of the region and the model reliability (including relatively low-performing models), while preserving the daily accuracy. The good performance of the method in this complex climatic region suggests its potential transferability to other regions. Furthermore, in order to test the robustness of the method in changing climate conditions, a cross-validation in driest or wettest years was performed. The method improves the RCM results in both cases, especially in the former.","[Turco, M.; Llasat, M.

In more general sense are analysed the cultural climate of Ferrara and the reasons for this heavy impoverishment of the artistic contexts of the age preceding the Renaissance one. This loss of the works of art is due to the dominating taste for the golden ages of the so-called Officina ferrarese and, also, to the destruction or dismantling yet during the 17th and 18th centuries of the waste majority of the Medieval Ferrarese monumental complexes. In clear countertendency and anticipating the times (as long before the legendary exhibition Mostra della pittura ferrarese - Exhibition of the Ferrarese painting - of 1933, the determinant factor to revaluate the pre-Renaissance artist of the school of Ferrara), must be considered the scholarly career at the Bologna University of the young Filippo de Pisis and his much more precocious journalistic activity relative to the themes here examined. One of the rare moments of the partial compensation to this limited sensibility of Ferrarese milieu to the proper primitives is the worthy activity in acquisition of the works of art by the local Bank - the Cassa di Risparmio di Ferrara in the second half of the 20th century.","[Guerzi, Chiara] Univ Ferrara, Accad Belle Arti Frosinone & Cultrice Materia, Ferrara, Italy; [Guerzi, Chiara] Univ Ferrara, Cattedra Storia Arte Moderna, Ferrara, Italy",University of Ferrara; University of Ferrara,"Guerzi, C (corresponding author), Univ Ferrara, Accad Belle Arti Frosinone & Cultrice Materia, Ferrara, Italy.;Guerzi, C (corresponding author), Univ Ferrara, Cattedra Storia Arte Moderna, Ferrara, Italy.",chiaraguerzi@gmail.com,,,,,,,72,0,0,0,0,"UNIV STUDI PARMA, DIPT BENI CULTURALI & SPETTACOLO",PARMA,"PIAZZA DELLA PACE 7 A, PILOTTA, PARMA, 43100, ITALY",2038-8411,,,RIC S-CONFIN,Ric.

The two main approaches for climate downscaling are dynamical and statistical. The traditional dynamical downscaling methods are quite time- and resource-consuming based on general circulation models (GCMs). Recently, more and more researchers construct a statistical deep learning model for climate downscaling motivated by the single-image superresolution (SISR) process in computer vision (CV). This is an approach that uses historical climate observations to learn a low-resolution to high-resolution mapping and produces great enhancements in terms of efficiency and effectiveness. Therefore, it has provided an appreciable new insight and successful downscaling solution to multiple climate phenomena. However, most existing models only make a simple analogy between climate downscaling and SISR and ignore the underlying dynamical mechanisms, which leads to the overaveraged downscaling results lacking crucial physical details. In this paper, we incorporate the a priori meteorological knowledge into a deep learning formalization for climate downscaling. More specifically, we consider the multiscale spatial correlations and the chaos in multiple climate events. Depending on two characteristics, we build up a two-stage deep learning model containing a stepwise reconstruction process and ensemble inference, which is named climate downscaling network (CDN). It can extract more local/remote spatial dependencies and provide more comprehensive captures of extreme conditions. We evaluate our model based on two datasets: climate science dataset (CSD) and benchmark image dataset (BID). The results demonstrate that our model shows the effectiveness and superiority in downscaling daily precipitation data from 2.5 degrees to 0.5 degrees over Asia and Europe. In addition, our model exhibits better performance than the other traditional approaches and state-of-the-art deep learning models.","[Mu, Bin; Qin, Bo; Yuan, Shijin; Qin, Xiaoyun] Tongji Univ, Sch Software Engn, Shanghai 100052, Peoples R China",Tongji University,"Yuan, SJ (corresponding author), Tongji Univ, Sch Software Engn, Shanghai 100052, Peoples R China.",binmu@tongji.edu.cn; brunoqin@163.com; yuanshijin2003@163.com; qxy1345@163.com,"Yuan, Shijin/M-3177-2017","Yuan, Shijin/0000-0002-8102-3137; Qin, Bo/0000-0001-7093-6531",Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [22120190207]; Key Project Fund of Shanghai 2020 Science and Technology Innovation Action Plan for social development [20dz1200702]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [42075141],Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Key Project Fund of Shanghai 2020 Science and Technology Innovation Action Plan for social development; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This study was supported in part by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities under Grant 22120190207, the Key Project Fund of Shanghai 2020 Science and Technology Innovation Action Plan for social development under Grant 20dz1200702, and National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 42075141.",,46,1,1,4,20,HINDAWI LTD,LONDON,"ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND",1024-123X,1563-5147,,MATH PROBL ENG,Math.

This is well known, and to overcome this problem, bias correction (BC; i.e. the correction of model output towards observations in a post-processing step) has now become a standard procedure in climate change impact studies. In this paper we argue that BC is currently often used in an invalid way: it is added to the GCM/RCM model chain without sufficient proof that the consistency of the latter (i.e. the agreement between model dynamics/model output and our judgement) as well as the generality of its applicability increases. BC methods often impair the advantages of circulation models by altering spatiotemporal field consistency, relations among variables and by violating conservation principles. Currently used BC methods largely neglect feedback mechanisms, and it is unclear whether they are time-invariant under climate change conditions. Applying BC increases agreement of climate model output with observations in hindcasts and hence narrows the uncertainty range of simulations and predictions without, however, providing a satisfactory physical justification. This is in most cases not transparent to the end user. We argue that this hides rather than reduces uncertainty, which may lead to avoidable forejudging of end users and decision makers. We present here a brief overview of state-of-the-art bias correction methods, discuss the related assumptions and implications, draw conclusions on the validity of bias correction and propose ways to cope with biased output of circulation models in the short term and how to reduce the bias in the long term. The most promising strategy for improved future global and regional circulation model simulations is the increase in model resolution to the convection-permitting scale in combination with ensemble predictions based on sophisticated approaches for ensemble perturbation.

The quantity and quality of crop yield can be affected by water stress, heat stress or frost or by pests and diseases. As climate conditions change, suitability zones for the cultivation of specific crops may shift. For planners and land managers it is important to understand such changes in order to develop short- and long-term adaptation strategies for resource and development planning. In this paper, we present a flexible and comprehensive, rule-based approach for evaluating crop-specific climate suitability. Climate indices are calculated over dynamically estimated phenological phases, and factor suitability functions are defined to relate these phase-specific climate indices to suitability values. The dynamic consideration of crop phenology allows to assess effects of climate-induced shifts in phenological development. To complement the knowledge-based definition of factor suitability functions with empirical data, we introduce an automated procedure for refining this definition within knowledge-based bounds based on observed climate and yield data. The approach was tested and applied for grain maize (Zea mays L) production in Switzerland. Comparison with independent yield data showed a good agreement with crop-specific climatic suitability, both in terms of temporal and spatial variability. Analysis of phase-specific suitability limitations at three representative sites revealed that suitability during the period 1981-2011 was mostly limited by sub-optimum temperatures and radiation during early and late phases, whereas drought was only an important limitation in exceptionally dry years (e.g. 2003 and 2010). An analysis of constant changes in temperature and precipitation indicated that grain maize suitability at a selected site on the western Central Plateau was more sensitive to temperature changes than to changes in precipitation. This suggests that this crop could benefit from an increase in temperature, not only through shifting towards the temperature optimum, but also by avoiding drought stress through accelerated plant development. However, these positive effects could be counteracted by negative effects of shortened phenology (i.e. reduced biomass accumulation) and heat stress. These results show that the approach offers diverse possibilities for applications, including climate impacts studies, and serves to provide information for the planning of crop adaptation strategies.

With the aim to investigate and quantify how well a GNSS RO observing system is able to detect climate trends, we are currently performing an ( climate) observing system simulation experiment over the 25-year period 2001 to 2025, which involves quasi-realistic modeling of the neutral atmosphere and the ionosphere. We carried out two climate simulations with the general circulation model MAECHAM5 ( Middle Atmosphere European Centre/ Hamburg Model Version 5) of the MPI-M Hamburg, covering the period 2001-2025: One control run with natural variability only and one run also including anthropogenic forcings due to greenhouse gases, sulfate aerosols, and tropospheric ozone. On the basis of this, we perform quasi-realistic simulations of RO observables for a small GNSS receiver constellation ( six satellites), state-of-the-art data processing for atmospheric profiles retrieval, and a statistical analysis of temperature trends in both the observed'' climatology and the true'' climatology. Here we describe the setup of the experiment and results from a test bed study conducted to obtain a basic set of realistic estimates of observational errors ( instrument- and retrieval processing-related errors) and sampling errors ( due to spatial-temporal undersampling). The test bed results, obtained for a typical summer season and compared to the climatic 2001-2025 trends from the MAECHAM5 simulation including anthropogenic forcing, were found encouraging for performing the full 25-year experiment. They indicated that observational and sampling errors ( both contributing about 0.2 K) are consistent with recent estimates of these errors from real RO data and that they should be sufficiently small for monitoring expected temperature trends in the global atmosphere over the next 10 to 20 years in most regions of the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere ( UTLS). Inspection of the MAECHAM5 trends in different RO-accessible atmospheric parameters ( microwave refractivity and pressure/ geopotential height in addition to temperature) indicates complementary climate change sensitivity in different regions of the UTLS so that optimized climate monitoring shall combine information from all climatic key variables retrievable from GNSS RO data.","[Foelsche, Ulrich; Kirchengast, Gottfried; Steiner, Andrea K.] Graz Univ, Wegener Ctr Climate & Global Change, WegCtr, A-8010 Graz, Austria; [Foelsche, Ulrich; Kirchengast, Gottfried; Steiner, Andrea K.] Graz Univ, IGAM, A-8010 Graz, Austria; [Kornblueh, Luis; Bengtsson, Lennart] Max Planck Inst Meteorol, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany; [Manzini, Elisa] INGV, I-40128 Bologna, Italy; [Manzini, Elisa] Ctr Euromediterraneo Cambiamento Climat, I-40128 Bologna, Italy",University of Graz; University of Graz; Max Planck Society; Istituto Nazionale Geofisica e Vulcanologia (INGV),"Foelsche, U (corresponding author), Graz Univ, Wegener Ctr Climate & Global Change, WegCtr, Leechgasse 25, A-8010 Graz, Austria.",ulrich.foelsche@uni-graz.at,"Kirchengast, Gottfried/D-4990-2016; Steiner, Andrea K/F-7980-2017; Foelsche, Ulrich/AAK-6102-2020; Manzini, Elisa/H-5760-2011","Kirchengast, Gottfried/0000-0001-9187-937X; Steiner, Andrea K/0000-0003-1201-3303; Foelsche, Ulrich/0000-0002-9899-6453; ",,,,,76,26,26,1,7,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",2169-897X,2169-8996,,J GEOPHYS RES-ATMOS,J.

This paper addresses how current policies on air pollution, climate change and access to clean cooking fuels can effectively reduce both outdoor and household air pollution and improve human health. A state of the art modeling framework is used that combines an integrated assessment model and an atmospheric model to estimate the spatial extent and distribution of outdoor air pollution exposures. Estimates of household energy access and use are modeled by accounting for heterogeneous household energy choices and affordability constraints for rural and urban populations spanning the entire income distribution. Results are presented for 2030 for a set of policy scenarios on air pollution, climate change and energy access and include spatially explicit emissions of air pollutants; ambient concentrations of PM2.5; and health impacts in terms of disability adjusted life years (DALYs) from both ambient and household air pollution. The results stress the importance of enforcing current worldwide air quality legislation in addressing the impacts of outdoor air pollution. A combination of stringent policies on outdoor air pollution, climate change and access to clean cooking fuels is found to be effective in achieving reductions in average ambient PM2.5 exposures to below World Health Organization recommended levels for a majority of the world's population and results in a significant decline in the global burden of disease from both outdoor and household air pollution.

This study developed and evaluated a novel framework based on machine learning techniques with climate reanalysis data to estimate leaf wetness. We compared the Random Forest, kernelized Support Vector Machine, Feed-forward Neural Network, and Classification and Regression Tree models with hourly surface and near-surface meteorological inputs from state-of-the-art climate reanalysis datasets, ERA5 and MERRA2. The models were trained and cross-validated using three-year hourly leaf wetness observation data at nine agricultural sites in Alabama and six sites in California. The models were intercompared with each other and with a simple model based on observed relative humidity (with 90% used as threshold, referred as RH). The results indicated that the machine learning models based on ERA5 showed better performance than the MERRA2-based models as well as the observation-based RH model. In particular, the ERA5-based Random Forest model showed the best performance for estimating hourly leaf wetness occurrence (Accuracy = 83%, Precision = 78.2%) and daily LWD (MAE =2.8 h, RMSE = 4 h) than the other approaches. In comparison with the RH method, the ERA5-driven Random Forest model showed at least 2 h smaller MAE and RMSE than the other methods for estimating daily LWD, suggesting a great potential for practical applications. The results also showed that the ERA5-driven Random Forest model accurately predicted the leaf wetness occurrence in space (with 70 to 87% accuracy), suggesting a potential for large-scale crop disease surveillance and climate impact assessment, particularly for regions with sparse in situ observation data.","[Asadi, Parisa; Tian, Di] Auburn Univ, Dept Crop Soil & Environm Sci, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Asadi, Parisa] Auburn Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Auburn, AL 36849 USA",Auburn University System; Auburn University; Auburn University System; Auburn University,"Tian, D (corresponding author), Auburn Univ, Dept Crop Soil & Environm Sci, Auburn, AL 36849 USA.",tiandi@auburn.edu,,"Tian, Di/0000-0001-7752-947X; asadi, parisa/0000-0001-9988-0308",Auburn University Alabama Agricultural Experiment Station [1012578]; Hatch program of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) [1012578]; USDA-NIFA Agriculture and Food Research Initiative Competitive Grant [1019690]; Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research [FFAR-FFNIA19-0000000050],Auburn University Alabama Agricultural Experiment Station; Hatch program of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA); USDA-NIFA Agriculture and Food Research Initiative Competitive Grant; Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research,"This research was supported in part by the Auburn University Alabama Agricultural Experiment Station and the Hatch program of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) (No. 1012578), by the USDA-NIFA Agriculture and Food Research Initiative Competitive Grant (No. 1019690), and by the Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research (No. FFAR-FFNIA19-0000000050).",,43,2,2,6,17,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0168-1923,1873-2240,,AGR FOREST METEOROL,Agric.

Comparing results across climate models allows us to evaluate which effects are robust to uncertainty in projected climate outcomes. Comparing effects of different drivers in isolation and in combination allows us to determine the relative contributions of the climate-mediated effects on system evolution. Our results indicate that national-level energy and economic impacts are largely driven by increases in electricity demand that follow from a consistent increase in surface air temperature that is largely robust to the choice of climate model. Other electricity system changes can be equally or more significant in some regions, but these effects are more regionally variable, less significant when aggregated to the national scale, and less robust to the choice of climate model.

Considering future climate change, this study attempts to reevaluate significant wave height (Hs) as well as average spectral wave period (Tz) with a return period of 100 years for a series of locations along the western Indian coastline. Historical waves are simulated using a numerical wave model forced by wind data extracted from the archives of the National Center for Environmental Prediction and the National Center for Atmospheric Research, while future wave data are generated by a state-of-the-art Canadian general circulation model. A statistical extreme value analysis of past and projected wave data carried out with the help of the generalized Pareto distribution showed an increase in 100-year Hs and Tz along the Indian coastline, pointing out the necessity to reconsider the safety of offshore structures in the light of global warming.","[Satyavathi, Pentapati; Deo, Makarand C.] Indian Inst Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Bombay 400076, Maharashtra, India; [Satyavathi, Pentapati] MIT Acad Engn, Pune 400076, Maharashtra, India; [Kerkar, Jyoti; Vethamony, Ponnumony] Natl Inst Oceanog, Panaji, Goa, India",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Bombay; Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India; CSIR - National Institute of Oceanography (NIO),"Deo, MC (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Bombay 400076, Maharashtra, India.",mcdeo@civil.iitb.ac.in,,"Deo, M C/0000-0002-5986-2356; Ponnumony, Vethamony/0000-0002-2747-7568",,,,,34,7,7,0,1,MARINE TECHNOLOGY SOC INC,COLUMBIA,"5565 STERRETT PLACE, STE 108, COLUMBIA, MD 21044 USA",0025-3324,1948-1209,,MAR TECHNOL SOC J,Mar.

Design/methodology/approach - It begins by taking a view on arts-based research, considering mainly Eisner and Dewey but exploring the possibilities of other forms such as baroque research. It goes on to look at some examples of arts-based research that has been carried out, funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council. The authors conclude by saying that interdisciplinary research, while being encouraged by research councils, is also made more difficult by these same research councils' funding structures. Findings - The authors consider that this has an effect on defining what educational research is and could be. The authors argue that this is important not only in relation to the range of disciplinary perspectives that can be drawn upon within educational settings, for example, the need to engage with disciplines such as English, History, Philosophy, Music and Fine Art, but also in relation to methodological understandings of how research should be conducted within educational settings. Originality/value - The research studies are arts based but with an original educational orientation.","[Marshall, Bethan] Kings Coll London, London WC2R 2LS, England; [Pahl, Kate] Univ Sheffield, Sch Educ, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England",University of London; King's College London; University of Sheffield,"Marshall, B (corresponding author), Kings Coll London, London WC2R 2LS, England.",bethan.marshall@kcl.ac.uk,"MCKENNA, TARQUAM/E-3334-2019","MCKENNA, TARQUAM/0000-0002-4015-3453; Pahl, Kate/0000-0001-8840-1121",Arts and Humanities Research Council [AH/J011959/1] Funding Source: researchfish; AHRC [AH/J011959/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Arts and Humanities Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Arts & Humanities Research Council (AHRC)); AHRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Arts & Humanities Research Council (AHRC)),,,60,4,4,0,6,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1443-9883,1448-0980,,QUAL RES J,Qual.

The raw observations were recalibrated using a vicarious calibration technique for the AVHRR reflectance channels and an improved treatment of the nonlinearity of the three infrared emittance channels. State-of-the-art algorithms are used in the Pathfinder Atmosphere (PATMOS) project to process global AVHRR datasets into statistics of channel radiances, total cloud amount, components of the earth's radiation budget, and aerosol optical thickness over oceans. The radiances and earth radiation budget components are determined for clear-sky and all-sky conditions. The output products are generated on a quasi-equal-area grid with a spatial resolution of approximately 110 km, with twice-a-day temporal resolution, and averaged over 5-day (pentad) and monthly time periods. The quality of the products is assessed relative to independent surface or satellite observations of these parameters. This analysis shows that the PATMOS data are sufficiently accurate for studies of the interaction of clouds and aerosol with solar and terrestrial radiation, and of climatic phenomena with large signals, for example, the annual cycle, monsoons, and the four ENSOs and two major volcanic eruptions that occurred during the 19-yr PATMOS period. Analysis also indicates that smaller climate signals, such as those associated with longer-term trends in surface temperature, may be difficult to detect due to the presence of artifacts in the time series that result from the drift of each satellite's observation time over its mission. However, a simple statistical method is employed to remove much of the effect caused by orbital drift. The uncorrected PATMOS dataset is accessible electronically.","NOAA, NESDIS, WWBG, Camp Springs, MD 20746 USA",National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Jacobowitz, H (corresponding author), NOAA, NESDIS, WWBG, E-RA1,RM712T,5200 Auth Rd, Camp Springs, MD 20746 USA.",Herbert.Jacobowitz@noaa.gov,"Ohring, George/F-5616-2010; Knapp, Kenneth R/E-9817-2011; Nalli, Nicholas R/F-6731-2010","Knapp, Kenneth R/0000-0001-5635-8755; Nalli, Nicholas R/0000-0002-6914-5537",,,,,34,78,79,0,8,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0894-8755,1520-0442,,J CLIMATE,J.

An alternative adaptation strategy for beech forests to improve drought tolerance and economic outcome consists in the admixtion of silver fir (Abies alba). To explore potentially suitable areas for mixing under future climate conditions, species distribution models (SDMs) represent a useful tool, but should be accompanied by economic analyses and uncertainty evaluations to serve as a solid decision basis for forest management. Therefore, in this study, we apply state-of-the-art SDMs, review uncertainties resulting from different modeling approaches, estimate the economic value of pure and mixed beech and fir stands, and discuss managerial implications of the results in Germany. Our model results projected widespread beech declines for Germany, while silver fir distributions remained largely constant. The degree of decline varied significantly between the investigated climate scenarios and resulted in associated economic losses between -180 and-4000 billion euros. With regard to the uncertain magnitude of climate change and the risk of high economic losses, we recommend an adaptation of beech forests in its projected hot spots of decline and find silver fir to be an environmentally suitable mixing species. The combination of ecological, economic, and uncertainty analyses used here represents a promising set of tools to evaluate climate change effects and assist in the regional adaptation of forests.","[Baumbach, Lukas; Yousefpour, Rasoul] Albert Ludwigs Univ Freiburg, Inst Forestry Econ & Forest Planning, Tennenbacherstr 4,Room 02096a, D-79108 Freiburg, Germany; [Niamir, Aidin; Hickler, Thomas] Senckenberg Biodivers & Climate Res Ctr BiK F, Senckenberganlage 25, D-60325 Frankfurt, Germany",University of Freiburg; Senckenberg Biodiversitat & Klima- Forschungszentrum (BiK-F); Senckenberg Gesellschaft fur Naturforschung (SGN),"Baumbach, L (corresponding author), Albert Ludwigs Univ Freiburg, Inst Forestry Econ & Forest Planning, Tennenbacherstr 4,Room 02096a, D-79108 Freiburg, Germany.",lukas.baumbach@ife.uni-freiburg.de; aidin.niamir@senckenberg.de; thomas.hickler@senckenberg.de; rasoul.yousefpour@ife.uni-freiburg.de,"Niamir, Aidin/G-5779-2011; Hickler, Thomas/S-6287-2016","Niamir, Aidin/0000-0003-4511-3407; Hickler, Thomas/0000-0002-4668-7552; Baumbach, Lukas/0000-0002-4719-2324",Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture (BMEL),Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture (BMEL),This work has been financially supported by the Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture (BMEL) as part of the project BuTaKli: Beech-Silver Fir Mixed Forests as an Adaptation of Commercial Forests to Climate Change Extreme Events.,,108,8,8,5,20,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1436-3798,1436-378X,,REG ENVIRON CHANGE,Reg.

However, despite the high level of interest and research in climate change risks on socioeconomic, urban and natural systems, studies that assess climate change impacts on urban cultural heritage and contribute to a holistic understanding on the subject present noticeable gaps in knowledge. A systematic review and meta-analysis was carried out to assess the state -of-the-art of cultural heritage risk assessment methodologies within urban systems in the context of climate change, specifically historic urban areas. For this purpose, a systematic search was applied using Web of Science and Scopus. The search identified and characterized existing methodologies on vulnerability and risk assessment for cultural heritage in a changing climate following the PRISMA protocol, and it synthesized knowledge gaps to be addressed in the near future. This study aims to bring risk assessment methodologies closer to urban planners for more efficient climate change adaptation policies. The research concluded that there is an unbalance between the amount of methodologies for the different climate change derived hazards and their impacts on historic urban areas. The amount of methodologies focused on flooding highlights that further research is needed for other relevant hazards, like heat and cold waves, that contribute to a holistic perspective.","[Quesada-Ganuza, Laura; Garmendia, Leire; Roji, Eduardo] Univ Basque Country, UPV EHU, Sch Engn Bilbao, Mech Engn Dept, Plaza Ingeniero Torres Quevedo S-N, Bilbao 48013, Spain; [Gandini, Alessandra] Basque Res & Technol Alliance BRTA, TECNALIA, Parque Tecnol Bizkaia,Edificio 700, Derio 48160, Spain",University of Basque Country,"Quesada-Ganuza, L (corresponding author), Univ Basque Country, UPV EHU, Sch Engn Bilbao, Mech Engn Dept, Plaza Ingeniero Torres Quevedo S-N, Bilbao 48013, Spain.",laura.quesada@ehu.eus; leire.garmendia@ehu.eus; eduardo.roji@ehu.eus; alessandra.gandini@tecnalia.com,"Garmendia, Leire/O-8006-2015; Gandini, Alessandra/ADO-3635-2022","Garmendia, Leire/0000-0002-3363-1015; Gandini, Alessandra/0000-0001-5872-5774; ROJI CHANDRO, EDUARDO/0000-0003-3322-5524; Quesada-Ganuza, Laura/0000-0001-8225-575X","European Commission through the SHELTER project [821282]; University of the Basque Country UPV/EHU [PPGA20/26, GIU19/029]; Basque Government [IT1314-19]; SAREN of the Faculty of Engineering in Bilbao",European Commission through the SHELTER project; University of the Basque Country UPV/EHU; Basque Government(Basque Government); SAREN of the Faculty of Engineering in Bilbao,"The authors wish to acknowledge funding from the European Commission through the SHELTER project (GA 821282) and from the University of the Basque Country UPV/EHU (PPGA20/26), as well as the support of research groups IT1314-19 of the Basque Government, GIU19/029 of the University of the Basque Country UPV/EHU and SAREN of the Faculty of Engineering in Bilbao.",,76,3,3,10,23,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-4209,,,INT J DISAST RISK RE,Int.

We employed the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model to assess UHI mitigation scenarios for the tropical city of Singapore during April 2016, including two heat wave periods. The local climate zones for Singapore were used as the land use/land cover data to account for the intra-urban variability. The simulations show that the canopy layer UHI intensity in Singapore can reach up to 5 degrees C in compact areas during nighttime. The results reveal that city-scale deployment of cool roofs can provide an overall reduction of 1.3 degrees C in the near-surface daytime air temperature in large lowrise areas. Increasing the thermostat set temperature to 25 degrees C from 21 degrees C in city-wide buildings can potentially reduce the air temperature due to less (similar to 20%) waste heat discharge from airconditioning units. A densification scenario considering an increase from approximately 7 841 people/km(2) (2016) to 9040-9,600 people/km(2) (2030) under the current climate leads to air temperature increase of 1.4 degrees C, which demonstrates the importance of limiting the densification of less compact areas in maintaining thermal comfort in the future.","[Mughal, M.

Compact city is one of the main constructions created in favor of sustainable cities around the world. Furthermore, compact forms usually are not naturally well ventilated. A vernacular urban form, which has been designed before the arrival of mechanical heating and cooling is chosen in Bushehr, Iran as a case study. This urbanism and architecture is consistent with strict climate of the region. Despite being a compact form, it is naturally well ventilated. The methodology adopted for this study is use of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis for modeling of selected urban space to obtain the amount of pressure and velocity of airflow in outdoor spaces.

Given it strategic importance, there is no shortage of research studies on sustainable building retrofit globally in particular the retrofit measures and technologies for different types of buildings. Despite that, sustainable building retrofit is climate and location specific, and decision-makers are still facing challenges to identify an optimum set of retrofit measures for different climatic conditions according to the trade-off between energy saving and retrofit cost. One reason for that is because of the lack of available information especially those related to the cost of sustainable building retrofit measures. This study aims to develop an integrated energy-cost model for selecting the optimal retrofit solutions for existing high-rise residential buildings in various climatic zones in China. Based on in-depth literature review and analysis of published reports, different alternative retrofit measures for wall, window, shading system, heating and cooling systems, and renewable energy technologies for buildings in different climate zones of China are identified. The retrofit costs related to the identified sustainable building retrofit measures are analyzed by referring to the local renovation techniques and cost in each zone through developing a set of equations. A total 28 practical sustainable building retrofit measures along with a set of retrofit options are identified. A deterministic decision framework is developed to facilitate decision-makers achieving a specific energy saving target and evaluating the associated costs based on the identified retrofit measures for high-rise residential buildings in the studied climatic zones. The practical implications of the deterministic decision framework are examined through the prototype buildings in climatic zones being studies. The findings not only actively support the selection of cost-effective sustainable retrofit measures for high-rise residential buildings in China, but the methodological framework and its implications are also equally applicable to other countries with diverse climatic characteristics and standards of living.","[He, Qiong] Nanjing Tech Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Nanjing 211816, Peoples R China; [Hossain, Md Uzzal] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Civil Engn, Pokfulam Rd, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Ng, S.

Most efforts to date have focused on reducing truncation errors due to discretization effects, whereas rounding errors due to the use of floating-point arithmetic have received little attention. However, there are increasing concerns about more frequent occurrences of rounding errors in larger parallel computing platforms (due to the conflicting needs of stability and accuracy vs. performance), and while this has not been the norm in climate and forecast models using double precision, this could change with some models that are now compiled with single precision, which raises questions about the validity of using such low precision in climate applications. For example, processes occurring over large time scales such as permafrost thawing are potentially more vulnerable to this issue. In this study we analyze the theoretical and experimental effects of using single and double precision on simulated deep soil temperature from the Canadian LAnd Surface Scheme (CLASS), a state-of-the-art land surface model. We found that reliable single precision temperatures are limited to depths of less than about 20-25 m while double precision shows no loss of accuracy to depths of at least several hundred meters. We also found that, for a given precision level, model accuracy deteriorates when using smaller time steps, further reducing the usefulness of single precision. There is thus a clear danger of using single precision in some climate model applications, in particular any scientifically meaningful study of deep soil permafrost must at least use double precision. In addition, climate modelling teams might well benefit from paying more attention to numerical precision and roundoff issues to offset the potentially more frequent numerical anomalies in future large-scale parallel climate applications.","[Harvey, Richard; Verseghy, Diana L.] Environm Canada, Div Climate Res, Climate Proc Sect, 4905 Dufferin St, Toronto, ON M3H 5T4, Canada; [Harvey, Richard] Ouranos Inc, Environm Canada, Ouranos Consortium, 550 Sherbrooke St West,19th Floor, Montreal, PQ H3A 1B9, Canada",Environment & Climate Change Canada; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Ouranos Consortium,"Harvey, R (corresponding author), Environm Canada, Div Climate Res, Climate Proc Sect, 4905 Dufferin St, Toronto, ON M3H 5T4, Canada.;Harvey, R (corresponding author), Ouranos Inc, Environm Canada, Ouranos Consortium, 550 Sherbrooke St West,19th Floor, Montreal, PQ H3A 1B9, Canada.",harvey.richard@ouranos.ca,,,,,,,42,6,6,0,2,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0930-7575,1432-0894,,CLIM DYNAM,Clim.

Therefore, the goal of this study is to evaluate the impact of climate change on the Megech streamflow and to calibrate and validate the Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. The baseline period (1976-2005) and the future period of the 2050s and 2080s were used. The widely accepted Global Circulation Models (GCM) were used to derive the climate data: Canadian Centre for Climate Modeling and Analysis (CanMES2), Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate (MIROC), Institute Pierre Simon Laplace (IPSL), Max Planck Institute for Meteorology (MPI). The dynamic downscaling and bias corrections were done for all the GCM data. The Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) values of 0.74 and 0.68 for calibration and validation periods show the capability of the SWAT model for simulation of the streamflow. The result of the models reveals a steady increase in temperature and decrease in precipitation at both time windows for both Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios. The result of the future scenarios depicted that the mean annual streamflow of the Megech river may rise by 5.9% and 6.5% for the 2050s and 2080s, respectively for the RCP 4.5 scenario, while for the RCP 8.5 scenario, the model shows an increase by 7.3 and 8.3% for 2050s and 2080s, respectively. The multi-model projections revealed that the Megech watershed is likely to become warmer and wetter during the summer season in the future, which in turn influences the environment. Additional works should be done to know the impact of land use and land cover alteration on the catchment towards sustainable development nowadays and in the future. Further studies should be done using other GCMs with state-of-the-art datasets to investigate the impact of climate change and land use-land cover on Megech hydrological process.","[Eshete, Daniel G.; Shinshaw, Berhanu G.; Belete, Abreham M.; Bayeh, Biniam A.] Univ Gondar, Inst Technol, Dept Hydraul & Water Resource Engn, POB 196, Gondar, Ethiopia; [Rigler, Genevieve] Univ Connecticut, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Storrs, CT 06268 USA",University of Gondar; University of Connecticut,"Eshete, DG (corresponding author), Univ Gondar, Inst Technol, Dept Hydraul & Water Resource Engn, POB 196, Gondar, Ethiopia.",geletawdaniel@gmail.com,,", Daniel/0000-0002-5969-695X",University of Gondar Institute of Technology [6223/2019],University of Gondar Institute of Technology,"This work was supported by the University of Gondar Institute of Technology under Grant Nr. 6223/2019.

Comprehensive CDF frameworks are explored for dryland dynamics, ecosystem services, and food security (FS), and current high-precision ecosystem observation networks are used to detect regional-level climate variability and identify hotspots. In addition, this review also examines challenges and uncertainties for CDF systems and effective agrarian innovations as a way forward. To bridge the gap from science to policy making in the CDF nexus, it is vital to enhance the impacts and feedbacks of ecohydrological processes on agrarian production, ecosystem service tradeoffs and their effects on livelihoods, and regional development and preservation by optimization of the ecological water security pattern.

Previous studies have characterized the main mode of interannual sea surface temperature (SST) variability in that region as a dipolar pattern of SST anomalies that cover subtropical and extratropical latitudes (the South Pacific Ocean Dipole, or SPOD), which is related to precipitation and temperature anomalies over several regions throughout the Southern Hemisphere. Using that relationship and the reported low predictive skill of precipitation anomalies over the Southern Hemisphere, this work explores the predictability and prediction skill of the SPOD in near-term climate hindcasts using a set of state-of-the-art forecast systems. Results show that predictability greatly benefits from initializing the hindcasts beyond the prescribed radiative forcing, and is modulated by known modes of climate variability, namely El Nino-Southern Oscillation and the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation. Furthermore, the models are capable of simulating the spatial pattern of the observed SPOD even without initialization, which suggests that the key dynamical processes are properly represented. However, the hindcast of the actual phase of the mode is only achieved when the forecast systems are initialized, pointing at SPOD variability to not be radiatively forced but probably internally generated. The comparison with the performance of an empirical prediction based on persistence suggests that initialization may provide skillful information for SST anomalies, outperforming damping processes, up to 2-3 years into the future.","[Saurral, Ramiro, I; Diaz, Leandro B.; Vera, Carolina S.] Univ Buenos Aires, Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Ctr Invest Mar & Atmosfera, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Saurral, Ramiro, I; Diaz, Leandro B.; Vera, Carolina S.] Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Ciencias Exactas & Nat, Dept Ciencias Atmosfera & Oceanos, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Saurral, Ramiro, I; Diaz, Leandro B.; Vera, Carolina S.] UMI IFAECI CNRS CONICET UBA, Unite Mixte Int, Inst Franco Argentin Estudes Climat & Ses Impact, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Garcia-Serrano, Javier] Univ Barcelona, Grp Meteorol, Barcelona, Spain; [Doblas-Reyes, Francisco J.] Barcelona Supercomp Ctr, Barcelona, Spain; [Doblas-Reyes, Francisco J.] ICREA, Barcelona, Spain",Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); University of Buenos Aires; University of Buenos Aires; University of Barcelona; Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya; Barcelona Supercomputer Center (BSC-CNS); ICREA,"Saurral, RI (corresponding author), Univ Buenos Aires, Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Ctr Invest Mar & Atmosfera, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.;Saurral, RI (corresponding author), Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Ciencias Exactas & Nat, Dept Ciencias Atmosfera & Oceanos, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.;Saurral, RI (corresponding author), UMI IFAECI CNRS CONICET UBA, Unite Mixte Int, Inst Franco Argentin Estudes Climat & Ses Impact, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",saurral@cima.fcen.uba.ar,"García-Serrano, Javier/I-5058-2015","García-Serrano, Javier/0000-0003-3913-0876; Vera, Carolina/0000-0003-4032-5232; Diaz, Leandro Baltasar/0000-0002-9237-6704; Saurral, Ramiro/0000-0002-8600-199X","University of Buenos Aires [UBACYT-20020100100803, UBACYT-2002170100428BA]; CONICET [PIP2009-00444]; ANPCyT [PICT07-00400, PICT2016-1898]; EU [776613, 641727]; CLIMAX Project [Belmont Forum/ANR-15-JCL/-0002-01]; Spanish Ramon y Cajal programme [RYC-2016-21181]",University of Buenos Aires(University of Buenos Aires); CONICET(Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET)); ANPCyT(ANPCyT); EU(European Commission); CLIMAX Project; Spanish Ramon y Cajal programme(Spanish Government),"The authors would like to thank the two anonymous reviewers, whose comments and suggestions led to a significant improvement of the manuscript.

This is dependent on the interplay between the atmosphere and the sea ice, which is critically dependent on the exchange of momentum, heat and moisture at the surface. In assessing the realism of climate change scenarios it is vital to know the quality by which these exchanges are modelled in climate simulations. Six state-of-the-art regional-climate models are run for one year in the western Arctic, on a common domain that encompasses the Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic Ocean (SHEBA) experiment ice-drift track. Surface variables, surface fluxes and the vertical structure of the lower troposphere are evaluated using data from the SHEBA experiment. All the models are driven by the same lateral boundary conditions, sea-ice fraction and sea and sea-ice surface temperatures. Surface pressure, near-surface air temperature, specific humidity and wind speed agree well with observations, with a falling degree of accuracy in that order. Wind speeds have systematic biases in some models, by as much as a few metres per second. The surface radiation fluxes are also surprisingly accurate, given the complexity of the problem. The turbulent momentum flux is acceptable, on average, in most models, but the turbulent heat fluxes are, however, mostly unreliable. Their correlation with observed fluxes is, in principle, insignificant, and they accumulate over a year to values an order of magnitude larger than observed. Typical instantaneous errors are easily of the same order of magnitude as the observed net atmospheric heat flux. In the light of the sensitivity of the atmosphere-ice interaction to errors in these fluxes, the ice-melt in climate change scenarios must be viewed with considerable caution.","Stockholm Univ, Dept Meteorol, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; Univ Colorado, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; Univ Colorado, Program Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; Alfred Wegener Inst Polar & Marine Res, Potsdam, Germany; Swedish Meteorol & Hydrol Inst, S-60176 Norrkoping, Sweden; Max Planck Inst Meteorol, Hamburg, Germany","Stockholm University; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; Helmholtz Association; Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar & Marine Research; Swedish Meteorological & Hydrological Institute; Max Planck Society","Tjernstrom, M (corresponding author), Stockholm Univ, Dept Meteorol, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",michaelt@misu.su.se,"Tjernström, Michael/AAF-3481-2020; Rinke, Annette/B-4922-2014; Semmler, Tido/AAH-4808-2020; Dethloff, Klaus/B-4879-2014; Semmler, Tido/B-7666-2017; Pfeifer, Susanne/O-1593-2017","Rinke, Annette/0000-0002-6685-9219; Semmler, Tido/0000-0002-2254-4901; Semmler, Tido/0000-0002-2254-4901; Pfeifer, Susanne/0000-0001-8518-1944; Tjernstrom, Michael/0000-0002-6908-7410",,,,,45,144,145,0,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0006-8314,1573-1472,,BOUND-LAY METEOROL,Bound.-Layer Meteor.,NOV,2005,2,,,,337,381,,10.1007/s10546-004-7954-z,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10546-004-7954-z,,,45,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,985HI,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000233367800007,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, state-of-the-art climate models still struggle in producing reliable climate predictions. An important cause of this low predictive skill is the sensitivity of climate models to different forcings. In this study, the mechanisms linking the WAM dynamics to the CO2 forcing are investigated, by comparing the effect of the CO2 direct radiative effect with its indirect effect mediated by the global sea surface warming. The July-to-September WAM variability is studied in climate simulations extracted from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 archive, driven by prescribed sea surface temperature (SST). The individual roles of global SST warming and CO2 atmospheric concentration increase are investigated through idealized experiments simulating a 4 K warmer SST and a quadrupled CO2 concentration, respectively. Results show opposite and competing responses in the WAM dynamics and precipitation. A dry response (-0.6 mm/day) to the SST warming is simulated in the Sahel, with dryer conditions over western Sahel (-0.8 mm/day). Conversely, the CO2 increase produces wet conditions (+0.5 mm/day) in the Sahel, with the strongest response over central-eastern Sahel (+0.7 mm/day). The associated responses in the atmospheric dynamics are also analysed, showing that the SST warming affects the Sahelian precipitation through modifications in the global tropical atmospheric dynamics, reducing the importance of the regional drivers, while the CO2 increase reinforces the coupling between precipitation and regional dynamics. A general agreement in model responses demonstrates the robustness of the identified mechanisms linking the WAM dynamics to the CO2 direct and indirect forcing, and indicates that these primary mechanisms are captured by climate models. Results also suggest that the spread in future projections may be caused by unbalanced model responses to the CO2 direct and indirect forcing.","[Gaetani, Marco; Flamant, Cyrille; Bastin, Sophie] Sorbonne Univ, UPMC Univ Paris 06, Lab Atmospheres Milieux Observat Spatiales LATMOS, UVSQ,CNRS, Paris, France; [Gaetani, Marco; Hourdin, Frederic; Bony, Sandrine] Sorbonne Univ, UPMC Univ Paris 06, Lab Meteorol Dynam, Ecole Polytech,CNRS,LMD IPSL,Ecole Normale Super, Paris, France; [Janicot, Serge] Sorbonne Univ, UPMC Univ Paris 06, Lab Oceanog & Climat Expt & Approches Numer, LOCEAN IPSL,IRD,MNHM,CNRS, Paris, France; [Lavaysse, Christophe] European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Ispra, Italy; [Braconnot, Pascale] CEA, Lab Sci Climat & Environm, UVSQ, CNRS,LSCE IPSL, Gif Sur Yvette, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Universite Paris Cite; Universite Paris Saclay; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Ecole des Ponts ParisTech; UDICE-French Research Universities; PSL Research University Paris; Ecole Normale Superieure (ENS); Sorbonne Universite; Universite Paris Cite; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle (MNHN); UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Universite Paris Cite; European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; CEA; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Gaetani, M (corresponding author), Sorbonne Univ, UPMC Univ Paris 06, Lab Atmospheres Milieux Observat Spatiales LATMOS, UVSQ,CNRS, Paris, France.;Gaetani, M (corresponding author), Sorbonne Univ, UPMC Univ Paris 06, Lab Meteorol Dynam, Ecole Polytech,CNRS,LMD IPSL,Ecole Normale Super, Paris, France.",marco.gaetani@latmos.ipsl.fr,"Lavaysse, Christophe/X-1650-2019; Gaetani, Marco/AAQ-7802-2020; Bony, Sandrine/AAG-5804-2019","Gaetani, Marco/0000-0003-2923-6773; Bony, Sandrine/0000-0002-4791-4438",Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) [ANR-10-LABX-18-01]; Laboratoire d'excellence Institut Pierre Simon Laplace (L-IPSL),Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)(French National Research Agency (ANR)); Laboratoire d'excellence Institut Pierre Simon Laplace (L-IPSL),"This work benefitted from the support of the Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) Grant ANR-10-LABX-18-01 of the national Programme Investissements d'Avenir.

The principal agents in rock surface weathering are precipitation and temperature; both are subject to significant changes at present. Results of this study indicate that the warm climate is accelerating weathering processes leading to the fast deterioration of the art.

There is a strong correlation among three indices: (1) model climate sensitivity, (2) mean cloud amount change due to global warming, and (3) the difference in cloud amount between the tropics and midlatitudes. In the simulation of the present-day current, models with high sensitivity produce smaller clouds amounts in the tropics and larger cloud amounts over midlatitude oceans than models with low sensitivity. The relative humidity in the tropics is smaller in models with high sensitivity than in models with low sensitivity. There is a similarity between vertical profiles of cloud amount and relative humidity under global warming and vertical profiles of the difference in these quantities averaged over the tropics and midlatitudes. Based on the correlations obtained and observations of cloud amount and relative humidity, an estimate is made of the sensitivity of a real climate system.","Russian Acad Sci, Inst Numer Math, Moscow 119991, Russia",Russian Academy of Sciences,"Volodin, EM (corresponding author), Russian Acad Sci, Inst Numer Math, Ul Gubkina 8, Moscow 119991, Russia.",volodin@inm.ras.ru,"\\volodin, Evgeny/F-9571-2013",,,,,,9,29,30,0,7,MAIK NAUKA/INTERPERIODICA/SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013-1578 USA",0001-4338,1555-628X,,IZV ATMOS OCEAN PHY+,Izv.

These changes are understood with much less certainty on a regional scale than on a global scale, but effects on ecosystems and society will occur at local and regional scales. Consequently, in order to study the true impacts of climate change, regional scenarios of future climate are needed. One of the most important sources of information for creating scenarios is the output from general circulation models (GCMs) of the climate system. However, current state-of-the-art GCMs are unable to simulate accurately even the current seasonal cycle of climate on a regional basis. Thus the simple technique of adding the difference between 2 x CO2 and 1 x CO2 GCM simulations to current climatic time series cannot produce scenarios with appropriate spatial and temporal details without corrections for model deficiencies. In this study a technique is developed to allow the information from GCM simulations to be used, while accommodating for the deficiencies. GCM output is combined with knowledge of the regional climate to produce scenarios of the equilibrium climate response to a doubling of the atmospheric CO2 concentration for three case study regions, China, Sub-Saharan Africa and Venezuela, for use in biological effects models. By combining the general climate change calculated with several GCMs with the observed patterns of interannual climate variability, reasonable scenarios of temperature and precipitation variations can be created. Generalizations of this procedure to other regions of the world are discussed.","UNIV LOS ANDES,FAC CIENCIAS,CTR INVEST ECOL ANDES TROP,MERIDA 5101A,VENEZUELA; PENN STATE UNIV,DEPT METEOROL,UNIV PK,PA 16802; INT CROPS RES INST SEMI ARID TROP,SAHELIAN CTR,NIAMEY,NIGER; UNIV MIAMI,ROSENSTIEL SCH MARINE & ATMOSPHER SCI,MIAMI,FL 33149; CHINESE ACAD SCI,INST BOT,BEIJING,PEOPLES R CHINA; UNIV CALIF LOS ANGELES,DEPT ATMOSPHER SCI,LOS ANGELES,CA 90024; UNIV LOS ANDES,FAC CIENCIAS,CTR ESTUDIOS AVANZADOS CLIMA TROP,MERIDA 5101A,VENEZUELA","University of Los Andes Venezuela; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; CGIAR; International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid-Tropics (ICRISAT); University of Miami; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Botany, CAS; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of Los Andes Venezuela","ROBOCK, A (corresponding author), UNIV MARYLAND,DEPT METEOROL,COLL PK,MD 20742, USA.",,"Robock, Alan/B-6385-2016","Sivakumar, Mannava/0000-0002-8154-2658; Robock, Alan/0000-0002-6319-5656",,,,,101,62,68,0,3,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

The education design, which adopted the Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, and Evaluation (ADDIE) model, was implemented in three stages. In the first stage, a framework plan was developed for the socioscientific issues (SSI) to generate concept cartoons. For each SSI in the framework plan the probable decisions (positive and negative), informal reasoning modes, and argument components (such as claim, evidence, counter argument and rebuttal) were determined. In the second stage, for argumentation based SSI teaching, the concept cartoons were generated and expert opinions were obtained. In the third phase the following issues were accomplished: teachers working at a SAC attended an inservice training program, a learning group was established, concept cartoons were exhibited on school corridors and simultaneously dialogic discussions were held in class. To collect data a questionnaire, interview forms, a rubric, and an observation form were utilized. Qualitative data were analyzed by means of descriptive analysis. Findings revealed that the framework plan was functional but the CCSSI needed some improvements. Based on the experts??? recommendations, the CCSSI was revised and then implemented. Observations showed that the teachers achieved the expected criteria at various levels ranging from monologic to dialogic. Thus, it is recommended that further studies are needed to enrich in-class dialogic discussions for teachers and students. Moreover, it is suggested that the framework plan can be used in other disciplines and grades.","[Atasoy, Sengul] Recep Tayyip Erdogan Univ, Fac Educ, Dept Math & Sci Educ, Rize, Turkey; [Tekbiyik, Ahmet] Kahramanmaras Sutcu Imam Univ, Fac Educ, Dept Math & Sci Educ, Kahramanmaras, Turkey; [Calik, Muammer] Trabzon Univ, Fac Educ, Dept Primary Educ, Trabzon, Turkey; [Tuzun, Ozgul Yilmaz] Middle East Tech Univ, Fac Educ, Dept Math & Sci Educ, Ankara, Turkey",Recep Tayyip Erdogan University; Kahramanmaras Sutcu Imam University; Trabzon University; Middle East Technical University,"Atasoy, S (corresponding author), Recep Tayyip Erdogan Univ, Fac Educ, Dept Math & Sci Educ, Rize, Turkey.",sengul.atasoy@erdogan.edu.tr; atekbiyik@gmail.com; muammercalik38@gmail.com; ozgul@metu.edu.tr,"CALIK, MUAMMER/AAA-1706-2019","CALIK, MUAMMER/0000-0001-8323-8783",Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey [117K137],Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey(Turkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Arastirma Kurumu (TUBITAK)),This study was funded by The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (Grant Number: 117K137).

However, climate change is expected to affect the species composition of forest ecosystems, lead to forest type transitions and trigger irrecoverable losses of habitat and biodiversity. Here, we investigate potential impacts of climate change on the environmental suitability of main plant functional types (PFTs) across Central America. Using a large database of occurrence records and physiological data, we classify tree species into trait-based groups and project their suitability under three representative concentration pathways (RCPs 2.6, 4.5 and 8.5) with an ensemble of state-of-the-art correlative modelling methods. Our results forecast transitions from wet towards generalist or dry forest PFTs for large parts of the study region. Moreover, suitable area for wet-adapted PFTs is projected to latitudinally diverge and lose connectivity, while expected upslope shifts of montane species point to high risks of mountaintop extinction. These findings underline the urgent need to safeguard the connectivity of habitats through biological corridors and extend protected areas in the identified transition hotspots. Baumbach et al. investigate impacts of climate change on tree species within tropical forest ecosystems in Central America. Their models suggest large transitions from wet to generalist or dry species, reduced connectivity for wet forest species, and upslope shifts of montane species, causing risk of extirpation.","[Baumbach, Lukas; Yousefpour, Rasoul; Hanewinkel, Marc] Univ Freiburg, Chair Forestry Econ & Forest Planning, Freiburg, Germany; [Warren, Dan L.] Okinawa Inst Sci & Technol, Biodivers & Biocomplex Unit, Okinawa, Japan",University of Freiburg; Okinawa Institute of Science & Technology Graduate University,"Baumbach, L (corresponding author), Univ Freiburg, Chair Forestry Econ & Forest Planning, Freiburg, Germany.",lukas.baumbach@ife.uni-freiburg.de,"Baumbach, Lukas/GPC-8341-2022; hanewinkel, marc/E-5639-2011","hanewinkel, marc/0000-0003-4081-6621","German Research Foundation (DFG) [416575874, HA5971/2-1]; National Science Foundation NSF [DEB 1147429, 1050857, 1110722]",German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); National Science Foundation NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This work has been financially supported by the German Research Foundation (DFG), 416575874, HA5971/2-1.

The values of simulated water balance components may vary due to different spatial and temporal aggregations, reference periods, and applied climate forcings, as well as due to the consideration of human water use, or the lack thereof. We analyzed these variations over the period 1901-2010 by forcing the global hydrological model WaterGAP 2.2 (ISIMIP2a) with five state-of-the-art climate data sets, including a homogenized version of the concatenated WFD/WFDEI data set. Absolute values and temporal variations of global water balance components are strongly affected by the uncertainty in the climate forcing, and no temporal trends of the global water balance components are detected for the four homogeneous climate forcings considered (except for human water abstractions). The calibration of WaterGAP against observed long-term average river discharge Q significantly reduces the impact of climate forcing uncertainty on estimated Q and renewable water resources. For the homogeneous forcings, Q of the calibrated and non-calibrated regions of the globe varies by 1.6 and 18.5 %, respectively, for 1971-2000. On the continental scale, most differences for long-term average precipitation P and Q estimates occur in Africa and, due to snow undercatch of rain gauges, also in the data-rich continents Europe and North America. Variations of Q at the grid-cell scale are large, except in a few grid cells upstream and downstream of calibration stations, with an average variation of 37 and 74% among the four homogeneous forcings in calibrated and non-calibrated regions, respectively. Considering only the forcings GSWP3 and WFDEI_hom, i.e., excluding the forcing without undercatch correction (PGFv2.1) and the one with a much lower shortwave downward radiation SWD than the others (WFD), Q variations are reduced to 16 and 31% in calibrated and non-calibrated regions, respectively. These simulation results support the need for extended Q measurements and data sharing for better constraining global water balance assessments. Over the 20th century, the human footprint on natural water resources has become larger. For 11-18% of the global land area, the change of Q between 19411970 and 1971-2000 was driven more strongly by change of human water use including dam construction than by change in precipitation, while this was true for only 9-13% of the land area from 1911-1940 to 1941-1970.","[Mueller Schmied, Hannes; Adam, Linda; Portmann, Felix Theodor; Reinecke, Robert; Riedel, Claudia; Song, Qi; Zhang, Jing; Doell, Petra] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Inst Phys Geog, Frankfurt, Germany; [Mueller Schmied, Hannes] Senckenberg Biodivers & Climate Res Ctr BiK F, Frankfurt, Germany; [Eisner, Stephanie; Fink, Gabriel; Floerke, Martina] Univ Kassel, CESR, Kassel, Germany; [Kim, Hyungjun; Oki, Taikan] Univ Tokyo, Inst Ind Sci, Tokyo, Japan",Goethe University Frankfurt; Senckenberg Biodiversitat & Klima- Forschungszentrum (BiK-F); Senckenberg Gesellschaft fur Naturforschung (SGN); Universitat Kassel; University of Tokyo,"Muller Schmied, H (corresponding author), Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Inst Phys Geog, Frankfurt, Germany.;Muller Schmied, H (corresponding author), Senckenberg Biodivers & Climate Res Ctr BiK F, Frankfurt, Germany.",hannes.mueller.schmied@em.uni-frankfurt.de,"Reinecke, Robert/K-3693-2019; Oki, Taikan/E-5778-2010; Döll, Petra/A-3784-2009; Schmied, Hannes Müller/K-6231-2013; Floerke, Martina/ABE-6288-2020; KIM, HYUNGJUN/I-5099-2014","Reinecke, Robert/0000-0001-5699-8584; Oki, Taikan/0000-0003-4067-4678; Döll, Petra/0000-0003-2238-4546; Schmied, Hannes Müller/0000-0001-5330-9923; KIM, HYUNGJUN/0000-0003-1083-8416; Eisner, Stephanie/0000-0002-0157-1636",,,,,53,118,118,4,25,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1027-5606,1607-7938,,HYDROL EARTH SYST SC,Hydrol.

The causes behind LUC are multiple, complex, interlinked, and change over time. This makes quantification uncertain and sensitive to many factors that can develop in different directions-including land use productivity, trade patterns, prices and elasticities, and use of by-products associated with biofuels production. Quantifications reported so far vary substantially and do not support the ranking of bioenergy options with regard to LUC and associated emissions. There are however several options for mitigating these emissions, which can be implemented despite the uncertainties. Long-rotation forest management is associated with carbon emissions and sequestration that are not in temporal balance with each other and this leads to mitigation trade-offs between biomass extraction for energy use and the alternative to leave the biomass in the forest. Bioenergy's contribution to climate change mitigation needs to reflect a balance between near-term targets and the long-term objective to hold the increase in global temperature below 2 degrees C (Copenhagen Accord). Although emissions from LUC can be significant in some circumstances, the reality of such emissions is not sufficient reason to exclude bioenergy from the list of worthwhile technologies for climate changemitigation. Policy measures to minimize the negative impacts of LUC should be based on a holistic perspective recognizing the multiple drivers and effects of LUC.

Supported by growing scientific evidence of anthropogenic climate change amplifying frequency, intensity and duration of climate-related hazards as well as observed increases in climate-related impacts and risks in many regions, the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage was established in 2013 and further supported through the Paris Agreement in 2015. Despite advances, the debate currently is broad, diffuse and somewhat confusing, while concepts, methods and tools, as well as directions for policy remain vague and often contested. This book, a joint effort of the Loss and Damage Network-a partnership effort by scientists and practitioners from around the globe-provides evidence-based insight into the L&D discourse by highlighting state-of-the-art research conducted across multiple disciplines, by showcasing applications in practice and by providing insight into policy contexts and salient policy options. This introductory chapter summarises key findings of the twenty-two book chapters in terms of five propositions. These propositions, each building on relevant findings linked to forward-looking suggestions for research, policy and practice, reflect the architecture of the book, whose sections proceed from setting the stage to critical issues, followed by a section on methods and tools, to chapters that provide geographic perspectives, and finally to a section that identifies potential policy options. The propositions comprise (1) Risk management can be an effective entry point for aligning perspectives and debates, if framed comprehensively, coupled with climate justice considerations and linked to established risk management and adaptation practice; (2) Attribution science is advancing rapidly and fundamental to informing actions to minimise, avert, and address losses and damages; (3) Climate change research, in addition to identifying physical/hard limits to adaptation, needs to more systematically examine soft limits to adaptation, for which we find some evidence across several geographies globally; (4) Climate risk insurance mechanisms can serve the prevention and cure aspects emphasised in the L&D debate but solidarity and accountability aspects need further attention, for which we find tentative indication in applications around the world; (5) Policy deliberations may need to overcome the perception that L&D constitutes a win-lose negotiation game by developing a more inclusive narrative that highlights collective ambition for tackling risks, mutual benefits and the role of transformation.","[Mechler, Reinhard; Calliari, Elisa; Bouwer, Laurens M.; Schinko, Thomas; Surminski, Swenja; Linnerooth-Bayer, JoAnne; Aerts, Jeroen; Botzen, Wouter; Boyd, Emily; Deckard, Natalie Delia; Fuglestvedt, Jan S.; Gonzalez-Eguino, Mikel; Haasnoot, Marjolijn; Handmer, John; Haque, Masroora; Heslin, Alison; Hochrainer-Stigler, Stefan; Huggel, Christian; Huq, Saleemul; James, Rachel; Jones, Richard G.; Juhola, Sirkku; Keating, Adriana; Kienberger, Stefan; Kreft, Soenke; Kuik, Onno; Landauer, Mia; Laurien, Finn; Lawrence, Judy; Lopez, Ana; Liu, Wei; Magnuszewski, Piotr; Markandya, Anil; Mayer, Benoit; McCallum, Ian; McQuistan, Colin; Meyer, Lukas; Mintz-Woo, Kian; Montero-Colbert, Arianna; Mysiak, Jaroslav; Nalau, Johanna; Noy, Ilan; Oakes, Robert; Otto, Friederike E.

Dairy farms produce milk by choosing herd size, diet, fertilization and land allocation between crops, as well as (discrete) manure storage and spreading technologies and the number of milking seasons. We show analytically that a critical radius emerges for the choice of land use between silage and cereal cultivation and fertilizer types (mineral and manure). Both privately and socially optimal manure application rates decrease with application distance. We characterize the optimal climate and water policy instruments for dairy farming. A detailed bioeconomic simulation model links farm management decisions with their impacts on climate and water quality. We numerically solve the social and private optima and the features of optimal climate and water policy instruments. We show that using only climate instruments provides considerable water co-benefits, and in the same vein, the use of water quality instruments provides considerable climate co-benefits. Climate policies lead to a reduction in herd size, as measures relating to manure management and spreading are relatively inefficient at reducing climate emissions. There is much more leeway for adapting to water policies than to climate policies, because dairy farms have multiple measures to reduce their nutrient loads.","[Lotjonen, Sanna; Temmes, Esa] Univ Helsinki, Dept Econ & Management, Helsinki, Finland; [Ollikainen, Markku] Univ Helsinki, Dept Econ & Management, Environm Econ, Helsinki, Finland",University of Helsinki; University of Helsinki,"Lotjonen, S (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Dept Econ & Management, Helsinki, Finland.",sanna.lotjonen@helsinki.fi,,"Ollikainen, Markku/0000-0003-3333-4683; Lotjonen, Sanna/0000-0003-4801-7533",EU; Denmark (the Innovation Fund); Estonia (Estonian Research Council ETAG); Finland (Academy of Finland) [291681]; Poland (NCBR); Sweden (FORMAS); Stockholm University Baltic SeaCenter - projectBalticEye; Strategic Research Council ofAcademy of Finland [312650]; KyostiHaataja Foundation,EU(European Commission); Denmark (the Innovation Fund); Estonia (Estonian Research Council ETAG); Finland (Academy of Finland); Poland (NCBR); Sweden (FORMAS)(Swedish Research Council Formas); Stockholm University Baltic SeaCenter - projectBalticEye; Strategic Research Council ofAcademy of Finland; KyostiHaataja Foundation,"Sanna Lotjonen is a doctoral candidate at theDepartment ofEconomics and Management, University of Helsinki.

These artworks provide the impetus for an article that moves between the local, national, and global, in order to connect visual culture, climate politics, and questions of citizenship and borders in a warming world. In the first section, I discuss how Blade-a wind turbine rotor blade repurposed as a public art installation-provides the opportunity to examine the role of large-scale renewable energy transition in addressing the deep regional economic inequalities in the UK. In the second section, I consider how artworks displayed as part of the 'Somewhere Becoming Sea' exhibition linked Hull's recent history to a global context of displacement and precarity, in the wake of the ongoing 'refugee crisis' within Europe and at its borders. In the final section, I seek to bring together a number of threads from the preceding discussion, in order to outline some alternative political horizons. I turn initially to Sean McAllister's documentary A Northern Soul (2018) and its powerful examination of how personal debt, the toxic fuel of neoliberalism, forecloses the future. In opposition to a future of deepening inequality and climate breakdown, I trace a renewed politics of public ownership and expanded social welfare in the UK, and its place in a prospective global renewable energy transition. This is a hopeful vision, given the current political climate, I argue, but it is also an eminently feasible one.","[White, Tom] Univ Oxford, Oxford, England",University of Oxford,"White, T (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Oxford, England.",thomas.white@ell.ox.ac.uk,,"White, Thomas/0000-0002-9155-5241",,,,,52,0,0,0,0,OPEN LIBRARY HUMANITIES,CAMBRIDGE,"SALISBURY HOUSE, STATION RD, CAMBRIDGE, CB1 2LA, ENGLAND",2056-6700,,,OPEN LIBR HUMANIT,Open Libr.

There is an increasing trend in urban energy studies to recognize the urban design variables and parameters associated with the energy performance of buildings. In this work, a novel approach is introduced to investigate the impacts of urban morphology on cooling load reduction and enhancing ventilation potential by studying a high-rise building (target building), surrounded by different urban configurations, during six warm months of the year in Tehran at four major sections including: (1) generating 1600 urban case studies considering three parameters (Urban Density, Urban Building Form, and Urban Pattern) and modelling the urban morphology of Tehran based on a technique namely Building Modular Cells, (2) validation study of CFD simulation of the wind flow around buildings, (3) calculating the average cooling load and wind flow at the rooftop of the target building, and (4) investigating sixteen best urban configurations with the lowest cooling load and highest ventilation potential. Results indicate that urban morphology has a notable impact on the energy consumption of buildings, decreasing cooling load and increasing ventilation potential more than 10% and 15% respectively, compared to the typical cases. This work also proposes design solutions for architects and urban designers, based on Top 100 configurations (out of 1600), for improved energy performance and better ventilation of buildings in urban areas.","[Javanroodi, Kavan; Mandavinejad, Mohammadjavad] Tarbiat Modares Univ, Fac Art & Architecture, Dept Architecture, Tehran, Iran; [Javanroodi, Kavan; Nik, Vahid M.] Lund Univ, Dept Bldg & Environm Technol, Div Bldg Phys, SE-22363 Lund, Sweden; [Nik, Vahid M.] Chalmers Univ Technol, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Div Bldg Technol, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Nik, Vahid M.] Queensland Univ Technol, Inst Future Environm, Garden Point Campus,2 George St, Brisbane, Qld 4000, Australia",Tarbiat Modares University; Lund University; Chalmers University of Technology; Queensland University of Technology (QUT),"Mandavinejad, M (corresponding author), Tarbiat Modares Univ, Fac Art & Architecture, Dept Architecture, Tehran, Iran.",kavan.javanrudi@modares.ac.ir; Mandavinejad@modares.ac.ir; vahid.nik@byggtek.lth.se,"Nik, Vahid M./K-2632-2016; Javanroodi, Kavan/AAG-5721-2019; Mahdavinejad, Mohammadjavad/H-8187-2017","Nik, Vahid M./0000-0002-1497-4813; Mahdavinejad, Mohammadjavad/0000-0002-6454-6518",,,,,130,64,67,9,55,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0306-2619,1872-9118,,APPL ENERG,Appl.
