J,"Paietta, E",,,,"Paietta, E",,,Comments on the 2001 WHO proposal for the classification of haematopoietic neoplasms,BEST PRACTICE & RESEARCH CLINICAL HAEMATOLOGY,,,English,Editorial Material,,,,,,WHO classification; prognostically relevant platforms,,"In the preface, the World Health Organization (WHO) classification vows to offer pathologists, oncologists and geneticists worldwide a system of classification for human neoplasms based on histopathological and genetic features. Standardization of nomenclature and agreed-upon criteria for definition of the various types of cancer are felt to be a prerequisite for progress in clinical oncology, multicentre therapy trials and comparative studies in different countries. In fact, the WHO effort represents the first worldwide comprehensive consensus classification of the haematological malignancies. Consensus was reached among a subgroup of investigators, carefully selected for their experience and contributions to existing classifications. In the present climate of daily new discoveries that yield a constant stream of fascinating insights into the biology of leukaemias and lymphomas and, above all, resulting in an explosion of potential therapeutic targets, the WHO system has taken the stand of compiling established classification approaches and providing order to known facts. This furnishes an essential skeleton upon which to build in the future. The WHO committee decided that sorting neoplasms according to prognosis was neither practical nor necessary and could be misleading. While justifiable at the present time, it is important to realize that the classifications of the haematological malignancies are a moving target and that the trend is to move away from currently accepted gold standards, such as morphological evaluations, in favour of genetic characterizations, especially those with therapeutic relevance. The goal of this chapter is to fill in some gaps that, as per the author's opinion, exist in the WHO classification, predominantly, where it concerns the role of immunophenotyping as a complementary discipline for genotyping through its potential to generate surrogate marker profiles for molecular lesions. By introducing some state-of-the-art classification modalities, some of which are still awaiting confirmation, this chapter also aims to spark excitement and provide a glimpse at the future.","New York Med Coll, Valhalla, NY 10595 USA",New York Medical College,"Paietta, E (corresponding author), New York Med Coll, Valhalla, NY 10595 USA.",epaietta@earthlink.net,,,,,,,111,1,1,0,1,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1521-6926,1532-1924,,BEST PRACT RES CL HA,Best Pract.

Here, we report poly(fluorenyl-co-aryl piperidinium) (PFAP)-based anhydrous cathode AEMWEs that exceed the state-of-the-art PEMWEs with respect to current density. In addition to a rational electrode design, PFAP-based AEMs with a high water diffusivity and ion conductivity are crucial for high-performance AEMWEs. Using platinum-group-metal (PGM) catalysts, the present AEMWEs achieved a new record current density of 7.68 A cm(-2) at 2.0 V with a 1 M KOH anode, which surpasses that of state-of-the-art PEMWEs (6 A cm(-2) at 2.0 V). PGM-free AEMWEs displayed an excellent current density of 1.62 A cm(-2) at 2.0 V. Importantly, PGM and PGM-free AEMWEs operated stably under a 0.5 A cm(-2) current density at 60 degrees C for more than 1000 h.

The eruption was characterized by several eruption phases of different duration and height summing up to a total eruption length of about 5.5 h. Resolving such complex eruption dynamics is required for precise volcanic plume dispersion forecasts. To address this issue, we coupled the atmospheric model system ICON-ART (ICOsahedral Nonhydrostatic with the Aerosols and Reactive Trace gases module) with the 1D plume model FPlume to calculate the eruption source parameters (ESPs) online. The main inputs are the plume heights for the different eruption phases that are geometrically derived from satellite data. An empirical relationship is used to derive the amount of very fine ash (particles < 32 mu m), which is relevant for long-range transport in the atmosphere. On the first day after the onset of the eruption, the modeled ash loading agrees very well with the ash loading estimated from AHI (Advanced Himawari Imager) observations due to the resolution of the eruption phases and the online treatment of the ESPs. In later hours, aerosol dynamical processes (nucleation, condensation, and coagulation) explain the loss of ash in the atmosphere in agreement with the observations. However, a direct comparison is partly hampered by water and ice clouds overlapping the ash cloud in the observations. We compared 6-hourly means of model and AHI data with respect to the structure, amplitude, and location (SAL method) to further validate the simulated dispersion of SO2 and ash. In the beginning, the structure and amplitude values for SO2 differed largely because the dense ash cloud leads to an underestimation of the SO2 amount in the satellite data. On the second and third day, the SAL values are close to zero for all parameters (except for the structure value of ash), indicating a very good agreement of the model and observations. Furthermore, we found a separation of the ash and SO2 plume after 1 d due to particle sedimentation, chemistry, and aerosol-radiation interaction. The results confirm that coupling the atmospheric model system and plume model enables detailed treatment of the plume dynamics (phases and ESPs) and leads to significant improvement of the ash and SO2 dispersion forecast. This approach can benefit the operational forecast of ash and SO2 especially in the case of complex and noncontinuous volcanic eruptions like that of Raikoke in 2019.","[Bruckert, Julia; Hoshyaripour, Gholam Ali; Muser, Lukas O.; Hoose, Corinna; Vogel, Bernhard] Karlsruhe Inst Technol KIT, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Karlsruhe, Germany; [Horvath, Akos] Univ Hamburg, Meteorol Inst, Hamburg, Germany; [Prata, Fred J.] AIRES Pty Ltd, Mt Eliza, Vic, Australia",Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; University of Hamburg,"Bruckert, J (corresponding author), Karlsruhe Inst Technol KIT, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Karlsruhe, Germany.",julia.bruckert@kit.edu,"Horvath, Akos/A-2453-2008; Hoose, Corinna/A-4295-2009","Horvath, Akos/0000-0002-5860-2368; Hoose, Corinna/0000-0003-2827-5789","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [FOR2820, 398006378]",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"This research has been supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (FOR2820, grant no. 398006378).",,50,2,2,1,2,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1680-7316,1680-7324,,ATMOS CHEM PHYS,Atmos.

However, there are still no reliable ACPs possessing the desired performance and stability, which is a major challenge for developing alkaline energy systems. Herein, we highlight an anion-exchange membrane and ionomer based on quaternised poly-carbazole (QPC-TMA) with a rigid ether-free and curved backbone structure comprised of carbazole monomers. The developed ACP exhibits excellent ionic conductivity, as well as chemical and mechanical stability. Moreover, the AEMFC usingQPC-TMAshows excellent performance (1.61 W cm(-2)) compared with the other best-performing AEMFCs. In addition, the AEMWE usingQPC-TMAdemonstrates outstanding stability and state-of-the-art performance (3.5 A cm(-2)at 1.9 V), which is the first report of an AEMWE that outperforms the best-performing proton-exchange membrane water electrolysers.","[Cha, Min Suc; Han, Seung-Hui; Shin, Sang-Hun; Yang, Seok Hwan; Kim, Tae-Ho; Yu, Duk Man; So, Soonyong; Hong, Young Taik; Yoon, Sang Jun; Lee, Jang Yong] Korea Res Inst Chem Technol KRICT, Energy Mat Res Ctr, Daejeon 34114, South Korea; [Park, Ji Eun; Kim, Sungjun; Kang, Sun Young; Sung, Yung-Eun; Cho, Yong-Hun] Inst Basic Sci IBS, Ctr Nanoparticle Res, Seoul 08826, South Korea; [Park, Ji Eun; Kim, Sungjun; Kang, Sun Young; Sung, Yung-Eun] Seoul Natl Univ, Sch Chem & Biol Engn, Seoul 08826, South Korea; [Park, Ji Eun; Kim, Sungjun; Kang, Sun Young; Sung, Yung-Eun] Seoul Natl Univ, Inst Chem Proc ICP, Seoul 08826, South Korea; [Yang, Seok Hwan; Oh, Seong-Geun] Hanyang Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Seoul 04763, South Korea; [Kim, Ok-Hee] Republ Korea Naval Acad, Dept Sci, Chang Won 51704, South Korea; [Park, Hyun S.] Korea Inst Sci & Technol KIST, Fuel Cell Res Ctr, Seoul 02792, South Korea; [Bae, Byungchan] Korea Inst Energy Res KIER, Fuel Cell Lab, Daejeon 34129, South Korea; [Cho, Yong-Hun] Kangwon Natl Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Samcheok 24341, South Korea",Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology (KRICT); Institute for Basic Science - Korea (IBS); Seoul National University (SNU); Seoul National University (SNU); Hanyang University; Korea Institute of Science & Technology (KIST); Korea Institute of Energy Research (KIER); Kangwon National University,"Lee, JY (corresponding author), Korea Res Inst Chem Technol KRICT, Energy Mat Res Ctr, Daejeon 34114, South Korea.;Sung, YE; Cho, YH (corresponding author), Inst Basic Sci IBS, Ctr Nanoparticle Res, Seoul 08826, South Korea.;Sung, YE (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, Sch Chem & Biol Engn, Seoul 08826, South Korea.;Sung, YE (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, Inst Chem Proc ICP, Seoul 08826, South Korea.;Cho, YH (corresponding author), Kangwon Natl Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Samcheok 24341, South Korea.",ysung@snu.ac.kr; yhun00@kangwon.ac.kr; ljylee@krict.re.kr,"Park, Ji Eun/AAK-5240-2021; Park, Hyun S/GWZ-8571-2022","Park, Hyun S/0000-0002-7960-9729; Kim, Tae-Ho/0000-0002-2130-9184; Park, Ji Eun/0000-0002-3109-0518; Kim, Sungjun/0000-0002-3005-6094; Yu, Duk Man/0000-0003-0682-0870; So, Soonyong/0000-0001-8677-7731; Cha, Min Suc/0000-0002-8646-7140","Technology Development Program to Solve Climate Changes of the National Research Foundation - Ministry of Science and ICT [NRF-2018M1A2A2063165, NRF-2018M1A2A2063172]; Institute for Basic Science of the Republic of Korea [IBS-R006-A2]; R&D Collaboration Programs of Hanwha Solutions Company; KRICT Core Research Program - Korea Research Council for Industrial Science and Technology [KS2022-20]",Technology Development Program to Solve Climate Changes of the National Research Foundation - Ministry of Science and ICT; Institute for Basic Science of the Republic of Korea; R&D Collaboration Programs of Hanwha Solutions Company; KRICT Core Research Program - Korea Research Council for Industrial Science and Technology,This work was supported by the Technology Development Program to Solve Climate Changes of the National Research Foundation funded by the Ministry of Science and ICT (NRF-2018M1A2A2063165 and NRF-2018M1A2A2063172) and by the Institute for Basic Science (IBS-R006-A2) of the Republic of Korea.

It is capable of moving among the geosphere, cryosphere, atmosphere, biosphere and hydrosphere. This flow of carbon is referred to as the Earth's carbon cycle. It is also intimately linked to the cycling of other elements and compounds. The ocean plays a fundamental role in Earth's carbon cycle, helping to regulate atmospheric CO2 concentration. The ocean biological carbon pump (OBCP), defined as a set of processes that transfer organic carbon from the surface to the deep ocean, is at the heart of the ocean carbon cycle. Monitoring the OBCP is critical to understanding how the Earth's carbon cycle is changing. At present, satellite remote sensing is the only tool available for viewing the entire surface ocean at high temporal and spatial scales. In this paper, we review methods for monitoring the OBCP with a focus on satellites. We begin by providing an overview of the OBCP, defining and describing the pools of carbon in the ocean, and the processes controlling fluxes of carbon between the pools, from the surface to the deep ocean, and among ocean, land and atmosphere. We then examine how field measurements, from ship and autonomous platforms, complement satellite observations, provide validation points for satellite products and lead to a more complete view of the OBCP than would be possible from satellite observations alone. A thorough analysis is then provided on methods used for monitoring the OBCP from satellite platforms, covering current capabilities, concepts and gaps, and the requirement for uncertainties in satellite products. We finish by discussing the potential for producing a satellite-based carbon budget for the oceans, the advantages of integrating satellite-based observations with ecosystem models and field measurements, and future opportunities in space, all with a view towards bringing satellite observations into the limelight of ocean carbon research.","[Brewin, Robert J.

Therefore, to better understand soil erosion studies in Morocco, a country with diverse physiography and climatic variations we undertook an analysis of national data of several soil erosion modeling and fingerprinting. The approach used for this research is a review of scientific articles, conference papers and thesis on soil erosion, focusing more on categorization of the different soil erosion models and other methods applied. The results reveal very interesting information as follows: (i) the distribution and frequency level of modeling and fingerprinting applications; the focus was on the north of the country: (Rif 32.89%, High Atlas 32.89%, Occidental Meseta 18.43% and Middle Atlas 10.53%), (ii) The (R) USLE models remain the most widely used models (51,32%) in Morocco, (iii) The support practice factor was severely lacking across the country, (iv) the highest erosion rate is concentrated in the Atlas and Rif mountains; and (v) a positive relationship between erosion rate and geological features, slope, climate, land use and cover, plus other environmental characteristics, as well as measurement and modeling conditions, and a negative relationship with the study areas size and scale. Even though the overall results show a high degree of variability, which cannot be explained by this combination of factors, but is at a minimum partly related to the experimental conditions. This overview research and database are designed to assist in the future assessment of soil erosion and to help define priorities for soil erosion research by providing a state of art for future focused and comprehensive analyses to address this issue of soil erosion in Morocco.","[Lamane, Houda; Mouhir, Latifa] Univ Hassan 2, Lab Proc Engn & Environm, Mohammadia, Morocco; [Lamane, Houda; Moussadek, Rachid; Zouahri, Abdelmjid] Natl Inst Agr Res, Res Unit Environm & Conservat Nat Resources, Rabat, Morocco; [Moussadek, Rachid] Int Ctr Agr Res Dry Areas ICARDA, Rabat, Morocco; [Baghdad, Bouamar; Laghlimi, Meriem] Hassan II Agron & Vet Inst, Dept Nat Resources & Environm, Georesources & Environm Lab, Rabat, Morocco; [Briak, Hamza] Mohammed VI Polytech Univ UM6P, Ctr Excellence Soil & Fertilizer Res Afr CESFRA, AgroBioSciences AgBS, Ben Guerir 43150, Morocco",Hassan II University of Casablanca; CGIAR; International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA); Mohammed VI Polytechnic University,"Lamane, H (corresponding author), Univ Hassan 2, Lab Proc Engn & Environm, Mohammadia, Morocco.",lamanehoudageo@gmail.com,,"LAMANE, Houda/0000-0002-9326-3525",,,,,113,0,0,3,3,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",,2405-8440,,HELIYON,Heliyon,AUG,2022,8,,,,,,e10209,10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e10209,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e10209,,,10,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,4F7IZ,36046543,"gold, Green Published",,,12/21/22,WOS:000848684900020,View Full Record in Web of Science

The research on the field is getting increasing attention due to climate change problems and their possible attenuation with the use of renewable energy. Mathematical models of the converters are being used to optimize several aspects of their operation. This article is dedicated to optimizing (through the mathematical model and an evolutionary algorithm) the operation of a state-of-the-art converter. The converter, which is composed of two parts or phases, is controlled by pulse width modulation with two switching signals (one for each phase). The converter provides by itself low switching ripple in both the output voltage and the input current, which is beneficial for renewable energy applications. In the traditional operation, one of the switching signals has an algebraic dependence on the other one. This article proposes a new way to select the duty cycle for both signals. In the proposed method, duty cycles of both phases are considered independent of each other; this provides an extra degree of freedom; on the other hand, this produce that the possible combinations of duty cycles which produce a certain voltage gain is infinite, it becomes a problem with infinite possible solutions. The proposed method utilizes the a linear success-history based adaptive differential evolution with linear population reduction, also called L-SHADE algorithm for simplicity, to find the two duty cycles that achieve the desired voltage gain and to minimize the converters switching ripple. The obtained results are compared with the former operation of the converter; the proposed operation achieves a lower output voltage ripple while achieving the desired operation (voltage gain).","[Rodriguez, Alma; Cuevas, Erik] Univ Guadalajara, Dept Elect, CUCEI, Av Revoluc 1500, Guadalajara 44430, Jalisco, Mexico; [Rodriguez, Alma; Alejo-Reyes, Avelina; Robles-Campos, Hector R.; Rosas-Caro, Julio C.] Univ Panamer, Fac Ingn, Alvaro Portillo 49, Zapopan 45010, Jalisco, Mexico",Universidad de Guadalajara; Universidad Panamericana - Ciudad de Mexico; Universidad Panamericana - Guadalajara,"Robles-Campos, HR; Rosas-Caro, JC (corresponding author), Univ Panamer, Fac Ingn, Alvaro Portillo 49, Zapopan 45010, Jalisco, Mexico.",alma.rvazquez@academicos.udg.mx; aalejo@up.edu.mx; erik.cuevas@cucei.udg.mx; hrobles@up.edu.mx; crosas@up.edu.mx,"Robles-Campos, Héctor R./GPW-8416-2022; Rosas-caro, Julio/R-6224-2018","Rodriguez Vazquez, Alma Nayeli/0000-0002-8391-3117; Cuevas, Erik/0000-0002-0358-6049; Rosas-caro, Julio/0000-0003-0161-0575","Universidad Panamericana, through the program Fomento a la Investigacion UP 2020; Universidad Panamericana, through the project Analisis de convertidores duales dobles [UP-CI-2020-GDL-01-ING]","Universidad Panamericana, through the program Fomento a la Investigacion UP 2020; Universidad Panamericana, through the project Analisis de convertidores duales dobles","Rosas-Caro would like to thank the support of the Universidad Panamericana, through the program Fomento a la Investigacion UP 2020, and project Analisis de convertidores duales dobles UP-CI-2020-GDL-01-ING.",,25,2,2,0,0,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2227-7390,,MATHEMATICS-BASEL,Mathematics,NOV,2020,11,,,,,,1911,10.3390/math8111911,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/math8111911,,,20,Mathematics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Mathematics,OY1RI,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000594029700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Enhanced observational capabilities are expected to foster deeper insight than ever before on key issues relevant for air quality, stratospheric ozone, solar radiation, and climate. A major potential strength of the Sentinel observations lies in the exploitation of complementary information that originates from simultaneous and independent satellite measurements of the same air mass. The core purpose of the AURORA (Advanced Ultraviolet Radiation and Ozone Retrieval for Applications) project is to investigate this exploitation from a novel approach for merging data acquired in different spectral regions from on board the GEO and LEO platforms. A data processing chain is implemented and tested on synthetic observations. A new data algorithm combines the ultraviolet, visible and thermal infrared ozone products into S-4 and S-5(P) fused profiles. These fused products are then ingested into state-of-the-art data assimilation systems to obtain a unique ozone profile in analyses and forecasts mode. A comparative evaluation and validation of fused products assimilation versus the assimilation of the operational products will seek to demonstrate the improvements achieved by the proposed approach. This contribution provides a first general overview of the project, and discusses both the challenges of developing a technological infrastructure for implementing the AURORA concept, and the potential for applications of AURORA derived products, such as tropospheric ozone and UV surface radiation, in sectors such as air quality monitoring and health.","[Cortesi, Ugo; Ceccherini, Simone; Del Bianco, Samuele; Gai, Marco; Tirelli, Cecilia; Zoppetti, Nicola; Barbara, Flavio] Consiglio Nazl Ric IFAC CNR, Ist Fis Appl Nello Carrara, I-50019 Sesto Fiorentino, Italy; [Bonazountas, Marc; Argyridis, Argyros] Epsilon Int SA, GR-15125 Maroussi, Greece; [Bos, Andre; Loenen, Edo] Sci & Technol BV, NL-2616 LR Delft, Netherlands; [Arola, Antti; Lipponen, Antti; Nyamsi, William Wandji] Finnish Meteorol Inst, Kuopio 70211, Finland; [Kujanpaa, Jukka] Finnish Meteorol Inst, FIN-00101 Helsinki, Finland; [van der A, Ronald; van Peet, Jacob; Tuinder, Olaf] Royal Netherlands Meteorol Inst, NL-3731 GA De Bilt, Netherlands; [Farruggia, Vincenzo; Masini, Andrea; Simeone, Emilio] Flyby Srl, I-57128 Livorno, Italy; [Dragani, Rossana] European Ctr Medium Range Weather Forecasts ECMWF, Reading RG2 9AX, Berks, England; [Keppens, Arno; Lambert, Jean-Christopher; van Roozendael, Michel; Lerot, Christophe; Yu, Huan] Royal Belgian Inst Space Aeron BIRA IASB, B-1180 Brussels, Belgium; [Verberne, Koen] Datacraft, NL-3025 AE Rotterdam, Netherlands",Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Fisica Applicata Nello Carrara (IFAC-CNR); Istituto di Fisiologia Clinica (IFC-CNR); Finnish Meteorological Institute; Finnish Meteorological Institute; Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute; European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF),"Cortesi, U (corresponding author), Consiglio Nazl Ric IFAC CNR, Ist Fis Appl Nello Carrara, I-50019 Sesto Fiorentino, Italy.",u.cortesi@ifac.cnr.it; s.ceccherini@ifac.cnr.it; s.delbianco@ifac.cnr.it; m.gai@ifac.cnr.it; c.tirelli@ifac.cnr.it; n.zoppetti@ifac.cnr.it; f.barbara@ifac.cnr.it; bonazountas@epsilon.gr; arargyridis@gmail.com; bos@stcorp.nl; loenen@stcorp.nl; antti.arola@fmi.fi; jukka.kujanpaa@fmi.fi; antti.lipponen@fmi.fi; william.wandji@fmi.fi; avander@knmi.nl; peet@knmi.nl; tuinder@knmi.nl; vincenzo.farruggia@flyby.it; andrea.masini@flyby.it; emilio.simeone@flyby.it; rossana.dragani@ecmwf.int; arno.keppens@aeronomie.be; J-C.Lambert@aeronomie.be; michel.vanroozendael@aeronomie.be; Christophe.Lerot@aeronomie.be; Yu.Huan@oma.be; koen@datacraft.nl,"Ceccherini, Simone/AAA-9297-2019; Zoppetti, Nicola/AAJ-7819-2021; Del Bianco, Samuele/AAX-5829-2020; Del Bianco, Samuele/J-8072-2014; Lipponen, Antti/AAL-1445-2021; Cortesi, Ugo/D-2704-2012; Arola, Antti/S-8917-2019","Del Bianco, Samuele/0000-0003-2689-6629; Del Bianco, Samuele/0000-0003-2689-6629; Lipponen, Antti/0000-0002-6902-9974; Cortesi, Ugo/0000-0002-2827-5239; Arola, Antti/0000-0002-9220-0194; Tirelli, Cecilia/0000-0003-4681-4977; van Peet, J.C.A./0000-0002-8979-5000; CECCHERINI, SIMONE/0000-0002-8902-2040; Argyridis, Argyros/0000-0003-1715-1406; Wandji, William/0000-0003-0048-292X; Lerot, Christophe/0000-0002-0540-187X",Horizon 2020 research and innovation program of the European Union [687428],Horizon 2020 research and innovation program of the European Union,The AURORA project is supported by the Horizon 2020 research and innovation program of the European Union (Call: H2020-EO-2015; Topic: EO-2-2015) under Grant Agreement No. 687428.,,58,10,10,0,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2073-4433,,,ATMOSPHERE-BASEL,Atmosphere,NOV,2018,11,,,,,,454,10.3390/atmos9110454,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos9110454,,,15,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,HB8AW,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,12/21/22,WOS:000451306900041,View Full Record in Web of Science

The ecology and evolutionary history of two of these regions, the Cape Floristic Region and the Mediterranean Basin, have been extensively investigated, but there have been few studies aimed at understanding the historical relationships between them. Here, we examine the biogeographic and diversification processes that shaped the evolution of plant diversity in the Cape and the Mediterranean Basin using a large plastid data set for the geophyte family Hyacinthaceae (comprising ca. 25% of the total diversity of the group), a group found mainly throughout Africa and Eurasia. Hyacinthaceae is a predominant group in the Cape and the Mediterranean Basin both in terms of number of species and their morphological and ecological variability. Using state-of-the-art methods in biogeography and diversification, we found that the Old World members of the family originated in sub-Saharan Africa at the Paleocene-Eocene boundary and that the two Mediterranean regions both have high diversification rates, but contrasting biogeographic histories. While the Cape diversity has been greatly influenced by its relationship with sub-Saharan Africa throughout the history of the family, the Mediterranean Basin had no connection with the latter after the onset of the Mediterranean climate in the region and the aridification of the Sahara. The Mediterranean Basin subsequently contributed significantly to the diversity of neighbouring areas, especially Northern Europe and the Middle East, whereas the Cape can be seen as a biogeographical cul-de-sac, with only a few dispersals toward sub-Saharan Africa. The understanding of the evolutionary history of these two important repositories of biodiversity would benefit from the application of the framework developed here to other groups of plants present in the two regions.","[Buerki, Sven; Jose, Sarah; Forest, Felix] Royal Bot Gardens, Jodrell Lab, Richmond, Surrey, England; [Yadav, Shrirang R.] Shivaji Univ, Dept Bot, Kolhapur, Maharashtra, India; [Goldblatt, Peter] Missouri Bot Garden, St Louis, MO 63166 USA; [Manning, John C.] S African Natl Biodivers Inst, Kirstenbosch Res Ctr, Compton Herbarium, Claremont, South Africa","Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew; Shivaji University; Missouri Botanical Gardens; South African National Biodiversity Institute","Buerki, S (corresponding author), Royal Bot Gardens, Jodrell Lab, Richmond, Surrey, England.",s.buerki@kew.org; f.forest@kew.org,"Buerki, Sven/A-8305-2012","Jose, Sarah/0000-0003-2737-6473; Buerki, Sven/0000-0002-8299-6539","Marie Curie Intra-European Fellowship (CRADLE) [253866]; Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew","Marie Curie Intra-European Fellowship (CRADLE); Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew","This project was funded by a Marie Curie Intra-European Fellowship (CRADLE; no 253866) to SB and FF and the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew.

State of the art techniques for its synthesis are typically functionally dependent on surface temperature, vapour pressure and some representation of cloudiness. Here we show that existing functional forms for downward long-wave synthesis underutilise information in these key predictor variables, and that in fact cloudiness variables may be redundant. By using an empirical model at a range of sites globally, we examine the contribution of each of the predictor variables and conclude that an extremely simple empirical model may provide more defensible prediction where no a priori knowledge of site behavior exists.

However, land cover monitoring in this tropical forest is a challenge because it covers such a large area and the land cover change often occurs quickly, and sometimes cyclically. Here we adapt a method which eliminates the need to collect new training data samples for each update of an existing land cover map. We use the state-of-the-art probabilistic classifier Import Vector Machines and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) scenes of the area surrounding Novo Progresso, northern Brazil, to create an initial land cover map for 2013 with associated classification probabilities. We then conduct spectral change detection between 2013 and 2015 using a pair of Landsat images in order to identify the areas where land cover has changed between the two dates, and then reclassify these areas using a supervised classification algorithm, using pixels from the unchanged areas of the map as training data. In this study, we use the pixels with the highest classification probabilities to train the classifier for 2015 and compare the results to those obtained when pixels are chosen randomly. The use of probabilities in the selection of training samples improves the results compared to a random selection, with the highest overall accuracy achieved when 250 training samples with high probabilities are used. For training sample sizes greater than 1000, the differences in overall accuracy between the two approaches to training sample selection are reduced. The final updated 2015 map has an overall accuracy of 80.1%, compared to an overall accuracy of 82.5% for the 2013 map. The results show that this probabilistic method has potential to efficiently map the dynamic land cover change in the Amazon with limited training data, although some challenges remain.","[Crowson, Merry; Hagensieker, Ron] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Geog Sci, Malteserstr 74-100, D-12249 Berlin, Germany; [Waske, Bjoern] Osnabruck Univ, Inst Comp Sci, Remote Sensing Grp, Wachsbleiche 27, D-49090 Osnabruck, Germany",Free University of Berlin; University Osnabruck,"Crowson, M (corresponding author), Zool Soc London, Inst Zool, Regents Pk, London NW1 4RY, England.",merry.crowson@ioz.ac.uk,,,research project SenseCarbon (FKZ) - German Space Agency (DLR) [50 EE 1255]; Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi),research project SenseCarbon (FKZ) - German Space Agency (DLR); Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi)(Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi)),"This study was partly funded by the research project SenseCarbon (FKZ, 50 EE 1255), funded by the German Space Agency (DLR) and the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi).",,50,8,9,2,27,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0303-2434,,,INT J APPL EARTH OBS,Int.

The formation of marine fog, for example, can be sensitive to small changes in SST at a scale of a few kilometres. As a contribution to understanding processes at the interface between air and sea, this article discusses results from a state-of-the-art fully coupled regional atmosphere-land-ocean-wave prediction system for the UK at km scale. This study focuses on the impact of the changes in surface forcing resulting from coupling SST in the marine boundary layer and formation of summertime coastal fog over the North Sea. A study from July 2013 provided a good case to evaluate the role of SST in fog evolution. The benefit of an evolving SST in the coupled simulation is shown in capturing a warming trend in observed SST over the five-day case study period, with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) against in situ observations of 1.1K. In contrast, in uncoupled atmosphere-only simulations, the initial-condition SST is persisted for the duration of the case, as is more typical in current operational numerical weather prediction (NWP). In the uncoupled simulations, a cold bias develops over the modelling period and the RMSE against observed SST is 2.4K. The impact of coupling is shown to propagate into the overlying marine boundary layer and therefore affect the formation of coastal fog. Increased heat flux from a relatively warmer sea surface in the coupled simulations led to near-surface atmospheric instability, hampering stratus lowering and destroying the fog-promoting inversion layer. This significantly reduced fog fractions in selected regions. The value of model coupling was assessed by comparing coupled and uncoupled simulations initialized at different times ahead of fog development.","[Fallmann, Joachim] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Mainz, Germany; [Fallmann, Joachim; Lewis, Huw; Sanchez, Juan Castillo; Lock, Adrian] Met Off, Exeter, Devon, England",Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz; Met Office - UK,"Fallmann, J (corresponding author), Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Inst Atmospher Phys, Becherweg 21, D-55128 Mainz, Germany.",jfallman@uni-mainz.de,"Fallmann, Joachim/AAE-2470-2021","Fallmann, Joachim/0000-0002-3099-0266",UK Environmental Prediction,UK Environmental Prediction,"This research has been carried out under national capability funding as part of a directed effort on UK Environmental Prediction, in collaboration between the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH), the Met Office, National Oceanography Centre (NOC) and Plymouth Marine Laboratory (PML).

NCEP-NCAR reanalysis data sets are created by assimilating climate observations from different sources, including ships, satellites, ground stations, radiosonde observations and radar. The general purpose of conducting reanalyses is to produce multi-year global state-of-the-art gridded representations of atmospheric states, generated by a constant model and a constant data-assimilation system. The trends of the mean extreme air temperatures were evaluated, using the Mann-Kendall criterion, and, in the process, factor analysis was applied to both the stations' and the NCEP-NCAR grid points time series. Regarding the mean maximum air temperature, the first main factor, which explains a high percentage of the total variance, presents a statistically significant (CL = 95%) negative trend only during the winter. The first main factor of the mean minimum air temperature manifests a statistically significant (CL = 95%) positive trend during the summer and the year, and a statistically significant (CL = 95%) negative trend in autumn and winter. These findings were compared to the respective ones of the NCEP-NCAR reanalysis data and significant differences in the spatial distribution and temporal variability of the extracted new factors were found. These differences between the two examined data sets could be attributed to topographical factors such orography and land-sea distribution, which could not be represented properly by the reanalysis model.","[Nastos, P.

It combined two complementary approaches - engineering and geomorphological. The first one is represented by the wave power values along the cliff face. For that purpose, the deep-water wave climate is statistically characterized, and high-energy sea states are numerically propagated to the cliff with a state-of-the-art model. The variations in wave power at the cliff face are controlled by the varying cliff orientation and by the irregular morphology, which influences wave propagation through refraction and shoaling processes. Based on wave power, four engineering exposure levels, from low to extreme, are defined and mapped onto the cliff. The geomorphological approach is based on an index developed ad hoc for this work, the Cliff Stability (CS) index, which takes into account the cliff geometry, lithology, structure and degradation state, as well as the hydrological conditions. Based on the CS index, four geomorphological exposure levels are defined and mapped, from low to extreme. The combined approach is shown through the application to a study site in NW Spain. The two perspectives, engineering and geomorphological, are found to yield similar results in some sections of the study area, but not all. It may be inferred that, despite the importance of wave action in shaping the cliff, the additional elements included in the CS index also play a significant role. In practical terms, the significance of these results is that the two approaches, engineering and geomorphological, should be combined to properly characterize coastal cliffs. This combined approach represents a multidisciplinary tool to define and characterize the exposure levels and, thus, prevent damages in cliff environments across the world.","[Bergillos, Rafael J.] Univ Politecn Valencia, Res Inst Water & Environm Engn IIAMA, Camino Vera S-N, Valencia 46022, Spain; [Rodriguez-Delgado, Cristobal; Iglesias, Gregorio] Univ Plymouth, Sch Engn, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England; [Rodriguez-Delgado, Cristobal] PROES Consultores, Calle San German 39, Madrid 28020, Spain; [Medina, Luis; Fernandez-Ruiz, Jesus] Univ A Coruna, Sch Civil Engn, Dept Geotech Engn, Elvina Campus, La Coruna 15071, Spain; [Rodriguez-Ortiz, Jose M.] Univ Politecn Madrid, Sch Architecture, Dept Geotech Engn, Ave Juan Herrera 4, Madrid 28040, Spain; [Iglesias, Gregorio] Univ Coll Cork, Environm Res Inst, MaREI, Cork, Ireland; [Iglesias, Gregorio] Univ Coll Cork, Sch Engn, Cork, Ireland",Universitat Politecnica de Valencia; University of Plymouth; Universidade da Coruna; Universidad Politecnica de Madrid; University College Cork; University College Cork,"Bergillos, RJ (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Valencia, Res Inst Water & Environm Engn IIAMA, Camino Vera S-N, Valencia 46022, Spain.",rbermec@upv.es,"Bergillos, Rafael J./K-3376-2017","Bergillos, Rafael J./0000-0001-8674-5043",Xunta the Galicia (Spain); European Union; MCIN/AEI through Juan de la Cierva program [IJC2019-038848I]; University of Plymouth (United Kingdom),Xunta the Galicia (Spain); European Union(European Commission); MCIN/AEI through Juan de la Cierva program; University of Plymouth (United Kingdom),"This work was carried out in the framework of the project Study to establish the current geomorphological and geotechnical situation of the natural monument Catedrales beach and its possible evolution in time, which was funded by the Xunta the Galicia (Spain) and the European Union.

However, TSF prediction has received little attention because a thunderstorm event is a combination of intricate and unique weather scenarios with high instability, making it difficult to predict. To close this gap, we proposed two novel hybrid machine learning models through hybridization of data pre-processing ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) with two state-of-arts models, namely artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine for TSF prediction at three categories over Bangladesh. We have demarcated the yearly TSF datasets into three categories for the period 1981-2016 recorded at 28 sites; high (March-June), moderate (July-October), and low (November-February) TSF months. The performance of the proposed EEMD-ANN and EEMD-SVM hybrid models was compared with classical ANN, SVM, and autoregressive integrated moving average. EEMD-ANN and EEMD-SVM hybrid models showed 8.02-22.48% higher performance precision in terms of root mean square error compared to other models at high-, moderate-, and low-frequency categories. Eleven out of 21 input parameters were selected based on the random forest variable importance analysis. The sensitivity analysis results showed that each input parameter was positively contributed to building the best model of each category, and thunderstorm days are the most contributing parameters influencing TSF prediction. The proposed hybrid models outperformed the conventional models where EEMD-ANN is the most skillful for high TSF prediction, and EEMD-SVM is for moderate and low TSF prediction. The findings indicate the potential of hybridization of EEMD with the conventional models for improving prediction precision. The hybrid models developed in this work can be adopted for TSF prediction in Bangladesh as well as different parts of the world.","[Azad, Md. Abul Kalam; Islam, Abu Reza Md. Towfiqul; Rahman, Md.

RICS Guidance note shows the stages producing the most carbon dioxide is the operational stage and the second significant area is the production stage. Recent studies have investigated reducing the operational emissions, however there is limited research on the embodied carbon. To achieve climate targets by 2050, all operational emissions need to be phased out along with reductions in embodied carbon. This paper aims to analyze the carbon life cycle (LCA) of the case study building in the UK. Further implementing low carbon & clean technologies have been considered to reduce the embodied and operational carbon. Current state of the art carbon assessment is utilized incorporating methodologies such as `Cradle to grave' from `British standards' in conjunction with `RICS Guidance note' and `RICS Professional statement.' To measure the embodied and operational carbon using the `cradle to grave' process, requires selecting a case study building and collecting related input data to process calculations such as construction materials and energy consumption. Results conclude that the operational stage is the largest CO2 contributor of the whole lifecycle, therefore PV Solar panels were chosen to reduce CO2 emissions. The product stage was the second most significant CO2 contributor therefore low carbon strategies, such as use of recycled steel, light weight brick, and SCM's for mortar and concrete, were selected. Re-calculation of the embodied and operational carbon of the building after implementing the low carbon strategies and clean technology comparing to initial results show reductions in CO2 emissions by 22% creating a low carbon building. Therefore, this paper brings awareness and guidance globally to clients, building designers, and the government to design sustainably using suitable low carbon solutions in all construction projects, leading to a low carbon future.","[Brooks, Maria; Abdellatif, Mawada; Alkhaddar, Rafid] Liverpool John Moores Univ, Fac Engn & Technol, Liverpool, Merseyside, England",Liverpool John Moores University,"Abdellatif, M (corresponding author), Liverpool John Moores Univ, Fac Engn & Technol, Liverpool, Merseyside, England.",m.e.abdellatif@ljmu.ac.uk,,,,,,,51,6,6,7,58,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1543-5075,1543-5083,,INT J GREEN ENERGY,Int.

However unconventional water source can contain micropollutants like endocrine disruptors and pharmaceuticals due to their persistence after the most common wastewater treatments. Rice is the staple food of more than half of the world's population which requires high volumes of water to achieve optimal yields. For this reason also low micropollutants concentration can represent a serious problem due to the stack in the trophic chain. At the state of art, the effects of these compounds on crops yield and quality remain largely unknown. To fill this gap, the aim of this work was to determine the effects of caffeine and ibuprofen on the growth of Oryza sativa (L.) and their presence in the grain. We also investigated the possible interactions of biofertilizer based on arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) with the pollutants to evaluate if their use affected the grain pollutants content due to irrigation with polluted water. The results show that the polluted solution has caused an increase in rice yield (+51 %) and growth. The interaction between the polluting treatment and the mycorrhizal fungi has caused an increase in photochemical efficiency values compared to the control (+2.63 %). Instead, only with AMF treatment an inhibitory effect on the growth (-42 %) and photochemical efficiency (-5.4 %) have been observed. An ibuprofen (119.3 ng g(-1)) and caffeine (from 52 to 1060 ng g(-1)) translocation in rice grain has been observed. As far as we know, this is the first study reporting the presence of exogenous caffeine, and ibuprofen in rice grain suggesting further evaluations about the possible agronomical, environmental and human health risks effects of these pollutants.","[Barbera, Antonio Carlo; Leonardi, Giovanni] Univ Catania, Dept Agr Food & Environm Di3A, Via Valdisavoia 5, I-95123 Catania, CT, Italy; [Ferrante, Margherita; Zuccarello, Pietro] Univ Catania, Dept Med Surg & Adv Technol GF Ingrassia, Via Santa Sofia 87, I-95123 Catania, CT, Italy; [Maucieri, Carmelo] Univ Padua, Dept Agron Food Nat Resources Anim & Environm DAF, Agripolis Campus,Viale Univ 16, I-35020 Legnaro, PD, Italy",University of Catania; University of Catania; University of Padua,"Barbera, AC (corresponding author), Univ Catania, Dept Agr Food & Environm Di3A, Via Valdisavoia 5, I-95123 Catania, CT, Italy.",ac.barbera@unict.it,"Maucieri, Carmelo/ABF-4069-2020; Ferrante, Margherita/B-2781-2011; Leonardi, Giovanni/J-3901-2013","Maucieri, Carmelo/0000-0003-4004-6612; Ferrante, Margherita/0000-0001-7596-2464; Leonardi, Giovanni/0000-0002-6359-4489; BARBERA, Antonio Carlo/0000-0002-7963-5150; ZUCCARELLO, Pietro/0000-0002-7425-0032",Valorizzazione della risorsa idrica in ambiente mediterraneo -ACQUA project - University of Catania,Valorizzazione della risorsa idrica in ambiente mediterraneo -ACQUA project - University of Catania,This paper was supported by the Valorizzazione della risorsa idrica in ambiente mediterraneo -ACQUA project financed by the University of Catania.

In both Clement Greenberg's formalism and the technological and sociological experiments of the avant-garde - especially Lazlo Moholy-Nagy and Vladimir Tatlin - transparency, the capacity to see through a work and view it from multiple perspectives, binds aesthetic taste to ideologies of belonging. And yet the realities of border militarization and forced displacement means these transparent forms are more readily located in the architecture of border fences and camps. Kosovar Flaka Haliti and Burundian Serge Alain Nitegeka create abstract sculptures that directly confront the reality of constrained mobility. Haliti's Speculating on the Blue examines Kosovo's post-conflict agency as constructed by the EU and NATO, where its exclusion extends to refugees entering Europe through the Balkans. And Nitegeka's site-specific installations, informed by his experiences of forced displacement, evoke border fences and improvized shelters common to refugee camps. Rather than the universal schema of Greenbergian transparency, Haliti and Nitegeka evince an opacity, theorized by Martiniquais poet/critic edouard Glissant as a wilful resistance to universal legibility, asserting an irreducible individual agency. Declaring a right to opacity, both artists consider how the particular histories of conflict, displacement, and humanitarian intervention relate to other contexts through a recognition of difference. Following Glissant's theory of relation, Haliti and Nitegeka propose new conceptions of commonality where the utopian becomes concrete. Haliti considers the possibility of dissolving partition, as Nitegeka's 100 Stools addresses the need for hospitality and dignity for immigrants in South Africa's xenophobic climate.","[Hennlich, Andrew J.] Western Michigan Univ, Gwen Frost Sch Art, Kalamazoo, MI 49008 USA; [Hennlich, Andrew J.] Univ Johannesburg, Visual Ident Art & Design Res Ctr, Johannesburg, South Africa",Western Michigan University; University of Johannesburg,"Hennlich, AJ (corresponding author), Western Michigan Univ, Gwen Frost Sch Art, Kalamazoo, MI 49008 USA.;Hennlich, AJ (corresponding author), Univ Johannesburg, Visual Ident Art & Design Res Ctr, Johannesburg, South Africa.",andrew.hennlich@wmich.edu,,,,,,,39,0,0,0,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-801X,1469-929X,,INTERVENTIONS-UK,Interventions,4-Jul,2021,5,,SI,,790,810,,10.1080/1369801X.2021.1885474,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1369801X.2021.1885474,,21-Feb,21,Cultural Studies; History,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;HCI),Cultural Studies; History,TC0YY,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000624719600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The new consciousness of library professionalism, and scientific approaches to classification and library organization, led to new ideas on library design and functioning in the major Australian public libraries, building upon a consideration of local conditions and requirements. These developments coincided fruitfully with the Federation period, when the separate Australian colonies joined to form the Australian nation. Librarians sought to modernize their institutions in a positively charged climate of national progress, self-awareness, and pride. However, the transition to progressive practices was not uniform across the major Australian libraries. Conflicts between moral and technological values meant that some librarians rejected progressive practice and maintained older approaches, particularly in the area of classification. The Tasmanian Public Library, led by Chief Librarian Alfred J. Taylor, was an example of this. This paper examines Taylor's approach in the wider context of changing attitudes to professionalism and library economy, his own paternalistic and humanistic approach to library organization, and the specific needs of the Tasmanian community.",,,"Gaunt, H (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Ian Potter Museum Art, Acad Programs Res, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",,,,,,,,46,0,0,0,91,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIV PRESS,BALTIMORE,"JOURNALS PUBLISHING DIVISION, 2715 NORTH CHARLES ST, BALTIMORE, MD 21218-4363 USA",0024-2594,1559-0682,,LIBR TRENDS,Libr.

Multifaceted studies by a wide range of scientists on the possibilities of the acoustic effect in fire extinguishing are noted. The analysis of literary sources showed the negative impact of both the fires themselves and the majority of fire extinguishing agents on the environment. Variants of the use of the acoustic died for the prevention and elimination of fires of various combustible substances are considered. The influence of the frequency of acoustic waves, scanning speed, power, and other acoustic parameters on flame extinguishing is noted. The possibilities of using a deep neural network for flame detection have been studied. The limitations and advantages of acoustic technology and further prospects for its development as an element of environmental technologies are shown.","[Loboichenko, Valentyna; Shevchenko, Roman; Strelets, Victor; Levterov, Alexander; Soshinskiy, Alexander; Antoshkin, Oleksii] Natl Univ Civil Def Ukraine, 94 Chernyshevska Str, Kharkiv, Ukraine; [Wilk-Jakubowski, Jacek] Kielce Univ Technol, 7 Tysiaclecia Panstwa Polskiego Ave, PL-25314 Kielce, Poland; [Wilk-Jakubowski, Grzegorz; Harabin, Radoslaw] Old Polish Univ Appl Sci, 49 Ponurego Piwnika Str, PL-25666 Kielce, Poland; [Wilk-Jakubowski, Grzegorz; Harabin, Radoslaw] Inst Crisis Management & Comp Modelling, PL-28100 Busko Zdroj, Poland; [Tregub, Nataliia] Kharkiv State Acad Design & Arts, 8 Mystetstv Str, UA-61002 Kharkiv, Ukraine",National University of Civil Defence of Ukraine; Kielce University of Technology,"Wilk-Jakubowski, J (corresponding author), Kielce Univ Technol, 7 Tysiaclecia Panstwa Polskiego Ave, PL-25314 Kielce, Poland.",j.wilk@tu.kielce.pl,"Loboichenko, Valentyna/H-1681-2018; Wilk-Jakubowski, Jacek/F-6285-2015; Shevchenko, Roman/AHA-0398-2022","Loboichenko, Valentyna/0000-0001-5188-6479; Wilk-Jakubowski, Jacek/0000-0003-1275-948X; Shevchenko, Roman/0000-0002-7528-6184; Strelets, Viktor/0000-0001-5992-1195",National Science Center (Narodowe Centrum Nauki),National Science Center (Narodowe Centrum Nauki),"It is the intention of authors to include this work in the support provided by National Science Center (Narodowe Centrum Nauki), under the Miniatura grant entitled Environmentally friendly methods for extinguishing flames on the basis of the acoustic method (Przyjazne dla srodowiska metody gaszenia plomieni na przykladzie metody akustycznej), in the framework of the conducted research.",,91,1,1,2,2,SCIENDO,WARSAW,"BOGUMILA ZUGA 32A, WARSAW, MAZOVIA, POLAND",1691-5208,2255-8837,,ENVIRON CLIM TECHNOL,Environ.

The work conducts an aerosols aware modelling and technoeconomic assessment by considering possible aerosols effects on the solar field's reflected irradiance; an effect that is typically ignored in the literature. Aerosols effect inclusion's modifies the thermal input to the solar field and this, in turn, provides a more accurate assessment. A parametric analysis has been performed using a 50 MW model by varying the Thermal Energy Storage and Solar Multiple based on three aerosols temporal resolutions: a typical year's average, daily and no-aerosols schemes. Further, water consumption is examined over four different condenser scenarios: dry, wet and two hybrid set ups. The assessment performed in Kuwait reveals that the wet-cooled condenser scenario with a 16h of storage and a solar multiple of 3.2 yields the lowest Levelized Cost of Energy of 12.06 $/kWh when the no-aerosols scheme is considered. This increases to 12.87 $/kWh when the daily aerosols are considered as the generated energy decreases by 6.7%. Besides, both hybrid condenser scenarios offer a trade-off as they result in a 55.1-68.7% of water saving for only 2.1-2.3% less energy generation.","[Alfailakawi, Mohammed S.; Michailos, Stavros; Ingham, Derek B.; Hughes, Kevin J.; Ma, Lin; Pourkashanian, Mohamed] Univ Sheffield, Fac Engn, Dept Mech Engn, Energy 2050, Sheffield S3 7RD, S Yorkshire, England; [Alfailakawi, Mohammed S.] Kuwait Minist Def, POB 1170, Safat 13012, Kuwait",University of Sheffield,"Alfailakawi, MS (corresponding author), Univ Sheffield, Fac Engn, Dept Mech Engn, Energy 2050, Sheffield S3 7RD, S Yorkshire, England.;Alfailakawi, MS (corresponding author), Kuwait Minist Def, POB 1170, Safat 13012, Kuwait.",malfailakawi2@sheffield.ac.uk,,"Pourkashanian, Mohammed/0000-0002-8399-5351; Ma, Lin/0000-0002-3731-8464",Kuwait Ministry of Defense,Kuwait Ministry of Defense,"The authors would like to acknowledge the Kuwait Ministry of Defense for their valuable financial support.

To evaluate the Brix on the height measurement of the stalk, three groups of sugarcane samples were compared. The groups consisted in different growth conditions under Portuguese mainland climate: (i) growth in a constructed wetland filled with clay brick fragments used to treat secondary wastewater; (ii) growth in a deactivated but irrigated constructed wetland filled with clay lightweight aggregate; (iii) growth in soil with irrigation. Some descriptive statistics were obtained for the three groups and 95% confidence intervals (also including bootstrap BCa procedure) were computed and compared. The one-way ANOVA demonstrates that different growth conditions do not affect the relative height position of the stalk average Brix representative internode. A simple linear regression was adjusted to model the relationship between the relative Brix with the relative measurement height and might be used to predict the sugarcane juice sugar content.","[Mateus, Dina M.

The effort to increase the transient thermomechanical reliability of the interacting fuel cell components and the associated fuel cell system requires a comprehensive understanding of the complex multiphysics, occurring within the system. State of the art dynamic fuel cell system modelling comprises sub-models of the assembly, or is based on empirical nature. The present study introduces a transient, coupled 3D computational fluid dynamics/computational solid mechanics model of a complete solid oxide fuel cell system and its experimental validation. The model includes all system components; namely the fuel cell stack, afterburner, pre-reformer, air pre-heater and the auxiliary components. All components are presented in their real geometrical resolution. The capabilities of the 3D system level model are demonstrated by simulating the heating-up process and the critical system locations susceptible to thermomechanically induced stress, over time.

Climate conditions in the Mediterranean region and the depositional and post-depositional dynamics involved in the formation processes of open-air sites cause, in many cases, poor conservation of archaeobotanical remains, especially in the case of pollen, affected by oxidation and other taphonomic agents. However, more stable temperature and humidity, as found in cave and rock-shelter sites, provide optimum conditions for the preservation of vegetal remains. This study presents integrated archaeobotanical data from several NE Iberian sites, with occupations from the Middle Palaeolithic to the Bronze Age. On the one hand, the diachronic study of the pollen record in archaeological stratigraphies reconstructs vegetation evolution and abrupt climate changes during the Pleistocene and the Holocene. On the other hand, archaeopalynology reveals the need to consider different taphonomic agents in the interpretation of pollen records in archaeological cave and rock-shelter sites, especially the anthropogenic input of plants to the archaeological contexts. The study of anthracological remains offers a picture of the surrounding wooded landscape, and provides data to characterise vegetal resource management and to verify which plants were brought to the cave. Finally. the carpological record shows the presence of edible wild fruits from bushes and trees in the Pleistocene and beginnings of the Holocene, and cultivated and synanthropic plants from the Middle Holocene onwards.

The area is an important place for Alpine archaeology because it has thousands rock-art carvings whose age cannot be directly assessed. Our new record confirms the occurrence of distinct land use phases (7,450-7,150, 6,200-4,900, and 4,250-3,700 calbp), as suggested by earlier studies of rock art typology. Moreover, the vegetation reconstruction from macrofossils, with co-dominance ofPinusandBetula, suggests that early Holocene conditions were moister than in drier inner Alpine valleys, whereLarix deciduaplayed a more important role, both in the past as well as in modern timberline forests. After 8,000 calbp, the timberline shifted upwards and mixedAbies albaandPinus cembrastands established around the study site. These fire sensitive trees were finally replaced during the Bronze Age (around 4,000 calbp) byL. decidua, which still dominates the subalpine woodlands in the area today. Our study supports the notion that while the range ofA. albahas been reduced at the colder end of its natural distribution, that ofL. deciduahas been widened by land use changes and fire disturbances to create high alpine wood pastures.","[Finsinger, Walter] Univ Montpellier, CNRS, EPHE, ISEM,IRD, Montpellier, France; [Vanel, Quentin] Agence Nord Ouest, Ecosphere, 28 Rue Moulin, F-60490 Cuvilly, France; [Ribolini, Adriano] Univ Pisa, Dipartimento Sci Terra, I-56126 Pisa, Italy; [Tinner, Willy] Univ Bern, Oeschger Ctr Climate Change Res, Altenbergrain 21, CH-3013 Bern, Switzerland; [Tinner, Willy] Univ Bern, Inst Plant Sci, Altenbergrain 21, CH-3013 Bern, Switzerland",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite de Montpellier; UDICE-French Research Universities; PSL Research University Paris; Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes (EPHE); University of Pisa; University of Bern; University of Bern,"Finsinger, W (corresponding author), Univ Montpellier, CNRS, EPHE, ISEM,IRD, Montpellier, France.",walter.finsinger@umontpellier.fr,"Ribolini, Adriano/B-8330-2018; Tinner, Willy/F-6727-2013; Finsinger, Walter/A-7937-2011","Ribolini, Adriano/0000-0001-5851-8775; Tinner, Willy/0000-0001-7352-0144; Finsinger, Walter/0000-0002-8297-0574",national programme ARTEMIS; University of Bern; Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes,national programme ARTEMIS; University of Bern; Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes,"We are thankful to B.

In addition to cooling the actual space, urban green spaces are also able to influence the surrounding area, and this phenomenon is called the urban green space cooling effect. The most important issues with regard to the cooling effects of urban green spaces are the intensity and density of the cooling, which can play a major role for urban designers and planners in dealing with urban heat island. This article reviews the latest studies that have examined the cooling effects of urban green spaces in recent years. Based on the method of evaluation of their samples, the studies are divided into three groups. The first category consists of research into a set of urban green spaces in one part of or in an entire city, mainly conducted through remote sensing and satellite maps. The second category investigates city parks or several urban parks with recognizable shapes and locations. In this section, information was mainly gathered by virtue of field observations. The third category relates to studies in which a part of urban space according to different scenarios of green space placement was modeled by simulation. The results of the present study illustrate that the highest cooling effect distance and cooling effect intensity are for large urban parks with an area of more than 10 ha; however, in addition to the area, the natural elements and qualities of the urban green spaces, as well as climate characteristics, highly inform the urban green space cooling effect.","[Aram, Farshid; Higueras Garcia, Ester] Univ Politecn Madrid, Escuela Tecn Super Arquitectura, E-28040 Madrid, Spain; [Solgi, Ebrahim] Griffith Univ, Sch Engn & Built Environm, Nathan, Qld, Australia; [Mansournia, Soran] Univ Art, Fac Architecture & Urbanism, Tehran, Iran",Universidad Politecnica de Madrid; ETS de Arquitectura; Griffith University,"Solgi, E (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Sch Engn & Built Environm, Nathan, Qld, Australia.",ebrahim.solgi@griffithuni.edu.au,"Aram, Farshid/AAE-5647-2019; Higueras, Ester/P-8937-2014; GARCIA, ESTER HIGUERAS/AAM-8179-2020; Solgi, Ebrahim/S-2177-2017","Aram, Farshid/0000-0002-5793-0116; Higueras, Ester/0000-0002-0182-8884; GARCIA, ESTER HIGUERAS/0000-0002-0182-8884; Solgi, Ebrahim/0000-0003-4385-3524",,,,,103,139,143,70,221,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",,2405-8440,,HELIYON,Heliyon,APR,2019,4,,,,,,e01339,10.1016/j.heliyon.2019.e01339,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2019.e01339,,,31,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,HW8VZ,31008380,"Green Published, Green Accepted, gold",Y,N,12/21/22,WOS:000466970300113,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, there is a lack of knowledge in this field in Mediterranean countries. Current Spanish building regulations establish ventilation rates based on ideal airtight envelopes, causing problems of over-ventilation and substantial energy losses. The aim of this paper is to develop a methodology that allows the characterization of the envelope of the housing stock in Spain in order to adjust ventilation rates taking into consideration air leakage. A methodology that is easily applicable to other countries that consider studying the airtightness of the envelope and its energetic behaviour improvement is proposed. A statistical sampling method has been established to determine the dwellings to be tested, considering relevant variables concerning airtightness: climate zone, year of construction, and typology. The air leakage rate is determined using a standardized building pressurization technique according to European Standard EN 13829. A representative case study has been presented as an example of the implementation of the designed methodology and results are compared to preliminary values obtained from the database.","[Jesus, Feijo-Munoz; Irene, Poza-Casado; Miguel Angel, Padilla-Marcos; Meiss, Alberto] Univ Valladolid, RG Architecture & Energy, Valladolid 47014, Spain; [Roberto Alonso, Gonzalez-Lezcano] Univ CEU San Pablo, Dept Architecture & Design, Madrid 28668, Spain; [Cristina, Pardal] Univ Politecn Cataluna, Dept Architectural Technol, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain; [Victor, Echarri] Univ Alicante, Architectural Construct Dept, Alicante 03690, Spain; [de larriva Rafael, Assiego] Univ Malaga, Art & Architecture Dept, E-29071 Malaga, Spain; [Jesica, Fernandez-Aguera] CSIC, Inst Ciencias Construcc Eduardo Torroja, Madrid 28033, Spain; [Maria Jesus, Dios-Vieitez] Univ A Coruna, Architectural Construct Dept, La Coruna 15008, Spain; [Victor Jose, del Campo-Diaz] Univ Basque Country, UPV EHU, Dept Thermal Engines & Machines, Bilbao 48013, Spain; [Calderin Manuel, Montesdeoca] Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Architectural Construct Dept, Las Palmas Gran Canaria 35017, Spain",Universidad de Valladolid; San Pablo CEU University; Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya; Universitat d'Alacant; Universidad de Malaga; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Instituto de Ciencias de la Construccion Eduardo Torroja (IETCC); Universidade da Coruna; University of Basque Country; Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria,"Irene, PC (corresponding author), Univ Valladolid, RG Architecture & Energy, Valladolid 47014, Spain.",feijo@arq.uva.es; irene.poza@uva.es; rgonzalezcano@ceu.es; cristina.pardal@upc.edu; victor.echarri@ua.es; rassiegodl@uma.es; jfernandezaguera@us.es; mjdios@udc.es; victor.delcampo@ehu.es; manuel.montesdeoca@ulpgc.es; miguelangel.padilla@uva.es; meiss@arq.uva.es,"Poza-Casado, Irene/D-2061-2016; Echarri-Iribarren, Víctor/AAA-4274-2019; Gonzalez Lezcano, Roberto Alonso/K-5670-2014; PARDAL, CRISTINA/J-9276-2017; Meiss, Alberto/M-1438-2014","Poza-Casado, Irene/0000-0002-6692-5917; Echarri-Iribarren, Víctor/0000-0002-3117-7904; Gonzalez Lezcano, Roberto Alonso/0000-0002-6185-4929; FERNANDEZ-AGUERA, JESICA/0000-0002-0082-3627; Assiego de Larriva, Rafael/0000-0003-0507-4247; DEL CAMPO DIAZ, VICTOR JOSE/0000-0001-9691-5368; PARDAL, CRISTINA/0000-0002-7912-1192; Padilla Marcos, Miguel Angel/0000-0001-5920-0793; Meiss, Alberto/0000-0001-8422-2003",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [BIA2015-64321-R],Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government),"This paper presented the methodology under the research project INFILES: Repercusion energetica de la permeabilidad al aire de los edificios residenciales en Espana: estudio y caracterizacion de sus infiltraciones, funded by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (ref.

However, few works from the North Atlantic mid-latitudes document both the GS-1 onset and its termination, which are often considered as single abrupt transition events. Here, we present a direct comparison between marine (alkenone-based sea surface temperatures) and terrestrial (pollen) data, at very high resolution (28 years mean), from the southwestern Iberian shelf record D13882. Our results reveal a rather complex climatic period with internally changing conditions. The GS-1 onset (GS-1a: 12890-12720 yr BP) is marked by a progressive cooling and drying; GS-1b (12720-12390 yr BP) is the coldest and driest phase; GS-1c (12390-12030 yr BP) is marked by a progressive warming and increase in moisture conditions; GS-1 termination (GS-1d: 12030-11770 yr BP) is marked by rapid switches between cool wet, cold dry and cool wet conditions. Although hydroclimate response was very unsteady throughout the GS-1 and in particular during its termination phase, the persistence of an open temperate and Mediterranean forest in southwestern Iberia during the entire episode suggests that at least some moisture was delivered via the Westerlies. We propose coupled ocean and atmospheric mechanisms to reproduce these scenario. Changes in the strength of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) as well as variations in the North Atlantic sea-ice growth have favoured the displacement of the polar jet stream's latitudinal position and contributed to a complex spatial pattern and strength of the Westerlies across western Europe.

Cusp auroral precipitation provides a direct source of energy for the high-latitude dayside upper atmosphere, contributing to chemical composition change and global climate variability. Previous studies have indicated that magnetic reconnection allows solar energetic protons to cross the magnetopause and enter the cusp region, producing cusp auroral precipitation. However, energetic protons are easily trapped in the cusp region due to a minimum magnetic field existing there. Hence, the mechanism of cusp proton aurora has remained a significant challenge for tens of years. Based on the satellite data and calculations of diffusion equation, we demonstrate that EMIC waves can yield the trapped proton scattering that causes cusp proton aurora. This moves forward a step toward identifying the generation mechanism of cusp proton aurora.","[Xiao, Fuliang; Yang, Chang; Gao, Zhonglei] Changsha Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Phys & Elect Sci, Changsha 410004, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Zong, Qiugang; Wang, Yongfu] Peking Univ, Sch Earth & Space Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Su, Zhenpeng] Univ Sci & Technol China, Chinese Acad Sci Key Lab Basic Plasma Phys, Hefei 230026, Peoples R China; [He, Zhaoguo] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Space Sci & Appl Res, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China","Changsha University of Science & Technology; Peking University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Science & Technology of China, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences","Xiao, FL (corresponding author), Changsha Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Phys & Elect Sci, Changsha 410004, Hunan, Peoples R China.",flxiao@126.com; qgzong@pku.edu.cn,"Su, Zhenpeng/K-4790-2019; Zong, Qiugang/L-1920-2018; Xiao, Fuliang/B-9245-2011; Su, Zhenpeng/E-1641-2011","Su, Zhenpeng/0000-0001-5577-4538; Zong, Qiugang/0000-0002-6414-3794; Xiao, Fuliang/0000-0003-1487-6620; Su, Zhenpeng/0000-0001-5577-4538; Gao, Zhonglei/0000-0001-7397-930X","973 Program [2012CB825603]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [40931053, 40925014]; Aid Program for Science and Technology Innovative Research Team in Higher Educational Institutions of Hunan Province; Construct Program of the Key Discipline in Hunan Province",973 Program(National Basic Research Program of China); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Aid Program for Science and Technology Innovative Research Team in Higher Educational Institutions of Hunan Province; Construct Program of the Key Discipline in Hunan Province,"This work was supported by 973 Program 2012CB825603, the National Natural Science Foundation of China grants 40931053, 40925014, the Aid Program for Science and Technology Innovative Research Team in Higher Educational Institutions of Hunan Province, and the Construct Program of the Key Discipline in Hunan Province.",,18,19,20,0,13,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2045-2322,,,SCI REP-UK,Sci Rep,11-Apr,2013,,,,,,,1654,10.1038/srep01654,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep01654,,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,122RQ,23575366,"gold, Green Published",,,12/21/22,WOS:000317335900004,View Full Record in Web of Science

A partial equilibrium model simulates the agricultural and the biogas sector interactions, estimating market clearing prices and quantities at the intersection of supply and demand. The optimal number, size and location of biogas plants are derived at the equilibrium. Considering the case study of Lubelskie region, we tested alternative incentive schemes for agricultural biogas development. Results indicate that limiting the use of energy crops in favour of other substrates, such as livestock, manure and agro-industrial waste, is decisive to preserve biogas profitability under all policy scenarios tested.

Although SSB was not a good predictor of R, adding interaction with SSB significantly improved the model, hence the effect of the two environmental variables on R was modulated by SSB. While temporal changes in the environment-R relationship were generally gradual, several abrupt changes were evident in the strength of these relationships. In addition, nonstationary, linear and nonlinear relationships were observed.","[Ojaveer, Henn] Univ Tartu, Parnu Coll, Ringi 35, EE-80012 Parnu, Estonia; [Ojaveer, Henn] Tech Univ Denmark, Natl Inst Aquat Resources, Kemitorvet Bldg 201, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark; [Klais-Peets, Riina] EcoStat Ltd, Ladva 6, EE-50705 Tartu, Estonia; [Einberg, Heli] Univ Tartu, Estonian Marine Inst, Maealuse 14, EE-12618 Tallinn, Estonia; [Rubene, Gunta] Inst Food Safety Anim Hlth & Environm, Fish Resources Res Dept, Daugavgr 8, LV-1048 Riga, Latvia","University of Tartu; Technical University of Denmark; University of Tartu; Estonian Marine Institute; Institute of Food Safety, Animal Health & Environment BIOR","Ojaveer, H (corresponding author), Univ Tartu, Parnu Coll, Ringi 35, EE-80012 Parnu, Estonia.;Ojaveer, H (corresponding author), Tech Univ Denmark, Natl Inst Aquat Resources, Kemitorvet Bldg 201, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark.",henn.ojaveer@ut.ee,"Ojaveer, Henn/K-2160-2016","Ojaveer, Henn/0000-0003-2742-6063; Einberg, Heli/0000-0002-4045-5101",BONUS (Art 185) - European Union; BONUS (Art 185) - Estonian Research Council and Innovation Fund for Denmark,BONUS (Art 185) - European Union; BONUS (Art 185) - Estonian Research Council and Innovation Fund for Denmark,"This work resulted from the Joint Baltic Sea Research and Development Programme (BONUS) project Taking stock of Baltic Sea food webs: synthesis for sustainable use of ecosystem goods and services, XWEBS, which was supported by BONUS (Art 185), funded jointly by the European Union, Estonian Research Council and Innovation Fund for Denmark.

Habitat-forming and ecologically dominant mytilid mussels exhibit decreasing growth when salinity < 11; however, the mechanisms underlying reduced calcification rates in dilute seawater are not fully understood. Both [HCO3-;] and [Ca2+] also decrease with salinity, challenging calcifying organisms through CaCO3 undersaturation (Omega <= 1) and unfavourable ratios of calcification substrates ([Ca2+] and [HCO3-]) to the inhibitor (H+), expressed as the extended substrate-inhibitor ratio (ESIR). This study combined in situ monitoring of three southwest Baltic mussel reefs with two laboratory experiments to assess how various environmental conditions and isolated abiotic factors (salinity, [Ca2+], [HCO3-] and pH) impact calcification in mytilid mussels along the Baltic salinity gradient. Laboratory experiments rearing juvenile Baltic Mytilus at a range of salinities (6, 11 and 16), HCO3- concentrations (300-2100 mu mol kg(-1)) and Ca2+ concentrations (0.5-4 mmol kg(-1)) reveal that as individual factors, low [HCO3-], pH and salinity cannot explain low calcification rates in the Baltic Sea. Calcification rates are impeded when Omega(aragonite )<= 1 or ESIR <= 0.7 primarily due to [Ca2+] limitation which becomes relevant at a salinity of ca. 11 in the Baltic Sea. Field monitoring of carbonate chemistry and calcification rates suggest increased food availability may be able to mask the negative impacts of periodic sub-optimal carbonate chemistry, but not when seawater conditions are permanently adverse, as observed in two Baltic reefs at salinities < 11. Regional climate models predict a rapid desalination of the southwest and central Baltic over the next century and potentially a reduction in [Ca2+] which may shift the distribution of marine calcifiers westward. It is therefore vital to understand the mechanisms by which the ionic composition of seawater impacts bivalve calcification for better predicting the future of benthic Baltic ecosystems.","[Sanders, Trystan; Thomsen, Jorn; Melzner, Frank] Helmholtz Ctr Ocean Res GEOMAR, Marine Ecol, Kiel, Germany; [Mueller, Jens Daniel] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Biogeochem & Pollutant Dynam, Environm Phys, Zurich, Switzerland; [Mueller, Jens Daniel; Rehder, Gregor] Leibniz Inst Baltic Sea Res, Dept Marine Chem, Warnemunde, Germany; [Sanders, Trystan] Univ Southampton, Natl Oceanog Ctr Southampton, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci, Southampton, Hants, England",Helmholtz Association; GEOMAR Helmholtz Center for Ocean Research Kiel; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Leibniz Institut fur Ostseeforschung Warnemunde; NERC National Oceanography Centre; University of Southampton,"Sanders, T (corresponding author), Helmholtz Ctr Ocean Res GEOMAR, Marine Ecol, Kiel, Germany.;Sanders, T (corresponding author), Univ Southampton, Natl Oceanog Ctr Southampton, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci, Southampton, Hants, England.",t.b.sanders@soton.ac.uk,"Melzner, Frank/X-4339-2018","Melzner, Frank/0000-0002-5884-1318; Muller, Jens Daniel/0000-0003-3137-0883; Sanders, Trystan/0000-0002-7605-0747; Rehder, Gregor/0000-0002-0597-9989","Marie Curie ITN network CACHE (Calcium in a Changing Environment) European Union Seventh Framework Programme [605051]; BONUS, the joint Baltic Sea research and development programme (Art 185); European Union's Seventh Programme for research, technological development and demonstration [03F0689A, 03F0773A]; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research [03F0689A, 03F0773A]","Marie Curie ITN network CACHE (Calcium in a Changing Environment) European Union Seventh Framework Programme; BONUS, the joint Baltic Sea research and development programme (Art 185); European Union's Seventh Programme for research, technological development and demonstration; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF))","This research was supported by the Marie Curie ITN network CACHE (Calcium in a Changing Environment) European Union Seventh Framework Programme under grant agreement no. 605051.

This skill increase is primarily attributed to variability over the North Atlantic with an enhanced connection between the AO and the El Nio and Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The relationship between ENSO and AO depends primarily on low-frequency variability in the North Pacific driven by the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation, as represented by the Hawaiian sea level pressure (SLPHI) index. When the sign of the SLPHI index and that of the NINO3.4 index are out-of-phase (in-phase) with the variability center of ENSO shifted to the central Pacific (eastern Pacific), more intense (weaker) ENSO-AO teleconnection results. Linear barotropic model experiments with prescribed ENSO forcing and differing phase and intensity of SLPHI support the observed relationship in La Nia years, highlighting the important and independent role of the SLPHI variability as a modulator of the ENSO teleconnection to higher latitudes.","[Kang, Daehyun; Lee, Myong-In] Ulsan Natl Inst Sci & Technol, Sch Urban & Environm Engn, 50 UNIST Gil, Ulsan 44919, South Korea",Ulsan National Institute of Science & Technology (UNIST),"Lee, MI (corresponding author), Ulsan Natl Inst Sci & Technol, Sch Urban & Environm Engn, 50 UNIST Gil, Ulsan 44919, South Korea.",milee@unist.ac.kr,"Lee, Myong-In/F-3578-2010; Kang, Daehyun/AAC-9961-2020","Lee, Myong-In/0000-0001-8983-8624; Kang, Daehyun/0000-0003-3284-1245",Korea Meteorological Administration Research and Development Program [KMIPA 2016-6010]; National Junior Research Fellowship of the National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2014H1A8A1022342],Korea Meteorological Administration Research and Development Program(Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA)); National Junior Research Fellowship of the National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea),"This study was supported by the Korea Meteorological Administration Research and Development Program, Grant KMIPA 2016-6010.

However, eco-aesthetics in urban green infrastructure is apparently inadequate in developing countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), coupled with the high vulnerability of cities in the region to the impacts of climate change and environmental disasters. This creates fragile urban environments that undermine the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in SSA. The need to build more resilient cites in SSA with capabilities to survive and thrive amidst environmental problems is vital to ensure sustainable development. Literature review is used to explore the fundamental theories of eco-aesthetics and its possible contributions towards building resilient cities, with references to the case of a typical developing country in SSA, Ghana. Through discussions, this paper demonstrates how urban planning strategies directed towards eco-aesthetics will help cities, especially in SSA, achieve socio-ecological resilience and the SDGs. In order to successfully realise future proposals for eco-aesthetics in Ghana, three main factors likely to limit the implementation of eco-aesthetics are identified as financial, lack of awareness and land acquisition barriers. Recommendations for overcoming these barriers have been outlined to help promote eco-aesthetics and build socio-ecological resilient cities in Ghana and SSA in general.","[Haruna, Ayisha Ida; Oppong, Rexford Assasie; Marful, Alexander Boakye] Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Architecture, Coll Art & Built Environm, Kumasi, Ghana; Istanbul Tech Univ, Istanbul, Turkey",Kwame Nkrumah University Science & Technology; Istanbul Technical University,"Haruna, AI (corresponding author), Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Architecture, Coll Art & Built Environm, Kumasi, Ghana.",idakaada@gmail.com; roppongassasie.cap@knust.edu.gh; amarful@yahoo.com,,"Baffoe-Ashun, PhD, Ayisha Ida/0000-0002-1457-5716",,,,,89,7,8,4,35,TAYLOR & FRANCIS AS,OSLO,"KARL JOHANS GATE 5, NO-0154 OSLO, NORWAY",2331-1886,,,COGENT SOC SCI,Cogent Soc.

The present study quantifies the environmental performance of nectarine orchards irrigation using treated municipal wastewater (TMW) and surface water using a unique dataset based on field experimental data. Climate change, toxicity (for human and freshwater), eutrophication (marine and freshwater) and acidification impacts were analysed using the impact assessment method suggested by the International Reference Life Cycle Data System (ILCD). The water footprint associated to the life cycles of each system has been estimated using the Available WAter REmaining (AWARE) method. Monte Carlo simulation was used to assess data uncertainty. The irrigation of nectarine orchards using TMW performs better than the irrigation using surface water for eutrophication impact categories. Compared with surface water resources, the potential impacts of TMW reuse in agriculture on climate change and toxicity are affected by the wastewater treatment phase (WWT). Only eutrophication and acidification burdens are generated by in-field substitution of surface water with TMW. Considering human and ecosystem water demand, the irrigation with TMW increases water consumption of 19.12m(3) per kg of nectarine produced. Whereas, it shows a positive contribution to water stress (-0.19 m(3)) if only human water demand is considered. This study provides important results that allow for a better understanding of the potential environmental consequences of TMW reuse in agriculture. It suggests that embracing the type of WWTs, the replacement of fertilizers, the effects on water scarcity and ecosystem quality might be useful to redefine water reuse regulations and increase public acceptance for the reuse of TMW in agriculture. Moreover, this study reveals the need for developing consensus and standardized guidance for life cycle analysis of water reuse applications. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Extracting road region from high-resolution remote sensing imagery is challenging due to complicated background such as buildings, trees shadows, pedestrians and vehicles and rural road networks that have heterogeneous forms with low interclass and high intraclass differences. Recently, deep learning-based techniques have presented a notable enhancement in the image segmentation results, however, most of them still cannot preserve boundary information and obtain high-resolution road segmentation map when processing the remote sensing imagery. In the present study, we introduce a new deep learning-based convolutional network called VNet model to produce a high-resolution road segmentation map. Moreover, a new dual loss function called cross-entropy-dice-loss (CEDL) is defined that synthesize cross-entropy (CE) and dice loss (DL) and consider both local information (CE) and global information (DL) to decrease the class imbalance influence and improve the road extraction results. The proposed VNet+CEDL model is implemented on two various road datasets called Massachusetts and Ottawa datasets. The suggested VNet+CEDL approach achieved an average F1 accuracy of 90.64% for Massachusetts dataset and 92.41% for Ottawa dataset. When compared to other state-of-the-art deep learning-based frameworks like FCN, Segnet and Unet, the proposed approach could improve the results to 1.09%, 2.45% and 0.39%, for Massachusetts dataset and 7.21%, 1.86% and 2.68%, for Ottawa dataset. Also, we compared the proposed method with the state-of-the-art road extraction techniques, and the results proved that the proposed technique outperformed other deep learning-based techniques in road extraction.","[Abdollahi, Abolfazl; Pradhan, Biswajeet] Univ Technol Sydney, Fac Engn & IT, Ctr Adv Modelling & Geospatial Informat Syst CAMG, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia; [Pradhan, Biswajeet] Sejong Univ, Dept Energy & Mineral Resources Engn, Seoul 05006, South Korea; [Pradhan, Biswajeet] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Earth Observat Ctr, Inst Climate Change, Bangi 43600, Malaysia; [Alamri, Abdullah] King Saud Univ, Coll Sci, Dept Geol & Geophys, Riyadh 11451, Saudi Arabia",University of Technology Sydney; Sejong University; Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia; King Saud University,"Pradhan, B (corresponding author), Univ Technol Sydney, Fac Engn & IT, Ctr Adv Modelling & Geospatial Informat Syst CAMG, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia.;Pradhan, B (corresponding author), Sejong Univ, Dept Energy & Mineral Resources Engn, Seoul 05006, South Korea.;Pradhan, B (corresponding author), Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Earth Observat Ctr, Inst Climate Change, Bangi 43600, Malaysia.",biswajeet.pradhan@uts.edu.au,"Abdollahi, Abolfazl/U-4187-2019; Pradhan, Biswajeet/E-8226-2010","Abdollahi, Abolfazl/0000-0002-1704-4670; Pradhan, Biswajeet/0000-0001-9863-2054","Centre for Advanced Modelling and Geospatial Information Systems (CAMGIS), Faculty of Engineering and IT, University of Technology Sydney (UTS); King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia [RSP-2020/14]","Centre for Advanced Modelling and Geospatial Information Systems (CAMGIS), Faculty of Engineering and IT, University of Technology Sydney (UTS); King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia(King Saud University)","This work was supported in part by the Centre for Advanced Modelling and Geospatial Information Systems (CAMGIS), Faculty of Engineering and IT, University of Technology Sydney (UTS), and in part by the King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, through the Researchers Supporting Project, under Grant RSP-2020/14.",,49,32,33,9,38,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2020,,,,,179424,179436,,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3026658,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3026658,,,13,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,OC0TD,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,12/21/22,WOS:000578875300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In particular, probabilistic forecasts of surface precipitation and maximum temperature in Spain are analyzed using a high-resolution observation gridded dataset (Spain02). To this aim, a simple statistical test based on the observed and predicted tercile anomalies is used. First, the whole period 1960-2000 is considered and it is shown that the only significant skill is found for dry events in autumn. Then, the influence of ENSO events as a potential source of conditional predictability is studied and the validation to strong La Nina or El Nino periods is restricted. Skillful seasonal predictions are found in partial agreement with the observed teleconnections derived from the historical records. On the one hand, predictability is found in spring related to El Nino events for dry events over the south and the Mediterranean coast and for hot events in the southeast areas. In contrast, La Nina drives predictability in winter for dry events over the western part and for hot events in summer over the south and the Mediterranean coast. This study considers both the direct model outputs and the postprocessed predictions obtained using a statistical downscaling method based on analogs. In general, the use of the downscaling method outperforms the direct output for precipitation, whereas in the case of the temperature no improvement is obtained.","[Frias, M. D.; Cofino, A.

In this study, first the physical properties of straw bale such as apparent density, thermal conductivity, short-term water absorption and compressive strength are measured through laboratory tests. Based on experimental data, Inventory of Carbon & Energy (ICE) database and using EnergyPlus software, the energy performance and carbon emissions of three different types of straw bale buildings in four climatic regions of Iran are evaluated, and the results are compared to that of a conventional building in the same climates. The results show that using straw bale as a construction material, the energy consumption of buildings will reduce up to about 83.12%. Additionally, it was observed that the straw bale buildings, can decrease embodied carbon up to 76% compared to the conventional buildings. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Following the ideas from the non-linear iterative partial least squares (NIPALS) method, we propose a novel algorithm that identifies a low-dimensional subspace aiming at the following two objectives: (i) the projections of the source domain samples are informative w.r.t. the output variable and (ii) the projected domain-specific input samples have a small covariance difference. In particular, the latent variable vectors that span this subspace are derived in closed-form by solving a constrained optimization problem for each subspace dimension adding flexibility for balancing the two objectives. We demonstrate the superiority of our approach over several state-of-the-art (SoA) methods on different DA scenarios involving unsupervised adaptation of multivariate calibration models between different process lines in Melamine production and equality to SoA on two well-known benchmark datasets from analytical chemistry involving (unsupervised) model adaptation between different spectrometers.

Therefore, the mathematical models, used to predict the heating and cooling loads in buildings, are necessary to be created. However, there is a considerable amount of energy consumed in the China's residential buildings, whose heating and cooling loads are characterized by climate sensitivity. In this work, the residential buildings situated in China were regarded as the study buildings. The principal research contents are shown as follows: (1) by creating a digital meshing system for China, the hierarchy system of residential building area at country scale was established; (2) via inputting air temperature data into the digital meshing system, the hierarchy system of air temperature was created; (3) the quantitative correlation between air temperature and thermal load intensity of the residential building was explored, to construct the hierarchy system of thermal load intensity; (4) Combining the above three hierarchy systems, the mesh-based mathematical models for predicting the total day-round heating and cooling load in the near future at country scale was created. The mesh-based mathematical models is expected to perform a scientific evaluation for the heating and cooling load of the residential buildings, aiming at reducing energy waste by planning and preparing the right amount of energy supply in advance.","[Chi, Fang'ai; Xu, Liming; Tao, Yekang; Peng, Changhai] Southeast Univ, Sch Architecture, Nanjing 210096, Peoples R China; [Chi, Fang'ai; Xu, Liming; Tao, Yekang; Peng, Changhai] Southeast Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Urban & Architectural Heritage Conservat, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Pan, Jiajie; Wang, Ruonan] Hebei Univ Engn, Sch Architecture & Art, Handan 056038, Peoples R China; [Guo, Yuang] Univ Kitakyushu, Fac Environm Engn, Kitakyushu, Fukuoka 8080135, Japan",Southeast University - China; Southeast University - China; Hebei University of Engineering; University of Kitakyushu,"Peng, CH (corresponding author), Southeast Univ, Sch Architecture, Nanjing 210096, Peoples R China.",pengchanghai@foxmail.com,,,Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2242020R20008]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2020M671295]; Jiangsu Planned Projects for Postdoctoral Research Funds [2020Z085]; Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China (Key Projects of Technological Innovation for Green Livable Village) [2019YFD1100805],Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); Jiangsu Planned Projects for Postdoctoral Research Funds; Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China (Key Projects of Technological Innovation for Green Livable Village),"The research is supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (Grant No. 2242020R20008), and China Postdoctoral Science Foundation funded project (Grant No. 2020M671295), and Jiangsu Planned Projects for Postdoctoral Research Funds (Grant No. 2020Z085).

Such technology can be considered as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), i.e., as a negative-emission technology (NET). In this research, porous polymeric beads (PPBs) with a practical working capacity above atmospheric pressure and cyclic performance were developed to be used for biogas upgrading by pressure swing adsorption (PSA) without the need for vacuum. The CO2 and CH4 equilibrium isotherms of PPBs were measured in the temperature range of 0-70 degrees C and in the pressure range of 0-10 bar. The dynamic breakthrough curves of 40:60 (vol%) CO2/CH4 gas mixture were measured at 2 bar and 10 bar. These isotherms and breakthrough curves were used as inputs in a dynamic PSA simulation model to predict the performance of a twin double-bed PSA biogas upgrading process. The model indicated that biomethane with 91% CH4 recovery can be produced and a stream of >90% CO2 purity from the tail gas, suitable for geological storage, can be separated. It should be highlighted that unlike current state-of-the-art PSA units, the proposed process using PPBs can upgrade biogas with minimal energy consumption for regeneration of adsorbents. The proposed selective tail gas separation scheme can be used to produce carbon-negative biomethane.","[Golmakani, Ayub; Nabavi, Seyed Ali; Manovic, Vasilije] Cranfield Univ, Ctr Climate & Environm Protect, Bedford MK43 0AL, Beds, England",Cranfield University,"Manovic, V (corresponding author), Cranfield Univ, Ctr Climate & Environm Protect, Bedford MK43 0AL, Beds, England.",v.manovic@cranfield.ac.uk,,"Manovic, Vasilije/0000-0002-8377-7717; Nabavi, Seyed Ali/0000-0002-3346-0754","CoERCe II - Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS), UK [EEF 5084]; Cambridge Engineering and Analysis Design (CEAD)","CoERCe II - Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS), UK; Cambridge Engineering and Analysis Design (CEAD)","The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support for this work by CoERCe II granted by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS), UK, BEIS Reference: EEF 5084, and Cambridge Engineering and Analysis Design (CEAD).

The city experienced a variety of approaches since the 1970s to repairs of exposed decorative elements and the envelope, whose condition is exacerbated by inappropriate interventions and climate change. Design/methodology/approach The debate is framed in practice in Western Europe where economy, administration and conservation cultures have been similar since the 1970s: property manager (Glasgow), role of housing agency (Venice), Monumentenwacht's periodical inspections for subscribers (Flanders), tax incentives (France, Italy, Spain), linking management and procurement (Libretto Casa, Rome) and the emerging concept of preventive conservation. Findings Edinburgh has a holistic and technically rich management experience, with a strong educational focus, which shows the immense volume of work required, hampered by the fragmentation of ownership and the small size of the repair industry. Practice can improve in Edinburgh and Europe through increased awareness, tax incentives, regular inspections, legal recognition of the need for maintenance and stepping-up the debate at national, European and political level, towards preventive conservation approaches. Research limitations/implications The study profited from direct knowledge of the approach in Edinburgh and other areas, but little has been published on each area outside the local level, so appraisal depended on language knowledge. Originality/value This first reading of practice at the European level may be of value to the national agencies referred to, for policy development or European initiatives.","[Theodossopoulos, Dimitris] Univ Edinburgh, Edinburgh Coll Art, ESALA, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland",Edinburgh College of Art; University of Edinburgh,"Theodossopoulos, D (corresponding author), Univ Edinburgh, Edinburgh Coll Art, ESALA, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland.",d.theodossopoulos@ed.ac.uk,"Theodossopoulos, Dimitris/AAH-5059-2020",,,,,,28,3,3,0,4,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",2044-1266,2044-1274,,J CULT HERIT MANAG S,J.

It has known that technological opportunities are available for human beings to get out of these predicaments, solving the interconnections between food-water-energy-climate nexus, and achieving agricultural transformation from traditional to digital. The aim of this review is to gain holistic solutions in a systematic view, based on water-energy-food resources to agricultural digital transformation that will play role in sustainable development. The transition from primitive to digital is given with road maps covering agricultural and industrial revolutions at four stages on timeline. Digital agriculture combined under precision agriculture and Agriculture 4.0 are handled based on domains covering monitoring, control, prediction, and logistics. Digital technologies are explained with application examples such as the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, big data, artificial intelligence, decision support systems, etc. Wearable sensor technologies, real-time monitoring systems tracking whole conditions of animals in livestock, the IoT-based irrigation and fertilization systems that help enhance the efficiency of irrigation processes and minimize water and fertilizer losses in agricultural fields and greenhouses, blockchain-based electronic agriculture, and solutions based on drones and robotics that reduce herbicide and pesticide use are handled systematically. Moreover, renewable energy technologies to be provided synergy between technologies such as agrivoltaics and aquavoltaics combining food and energy production in rural are explained, besides solar-powered pivot and drip irrigation systems and environmental monitoring systems. As a result, for a sustainable future, technological innovations that increase crop productivity and improve crop quality, protect the environment, provide efficient resource use and decrease input costs can help us facing in agriculture of today overwhelm many the economic, social, and environmental challenges.","[Dayioglu, Mehmet Ali; Turker, Ufuk] Ankara Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Agr Machinery & Technol Engn, TR-06130 Ankara, Turkey",Ankara University,"Dayioglu, MA (corresponding author), Ankara Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Agr Machinery & Technol Engn, TR-06130 Ankara, Turkey.",dayioglu@agri.ankara.edu.tr,"DAYIOĞLU, MEHMET ALİ/A-3300-2016",,,,,,154,8,8,77,163,"ANKARA UNIV, FAC AGR",DISKAPI,"PUBL DEPT, DISKAPI, ANKARA 06110, TURKEY",,2148-9297,,J AGR SCI-TARIM BILI,J.

However, uncertainties are inevitably larger (by unknown amounts) for emission estimates at regional and monthly scales, or for developing countries. Given recent international efforts to establish emission reduction targets, independent determination and verification of regional and national scale fossil fuel CO2 emissions are likely to become increasingly important. Here, we take advantage of the fact that precise measurements of C-14 in CO2 provide a largely unbiased tracer for recently added fossil-fuel-derived CO2 in the atmosphere and present an atmospheric inversion technique to jointly assimilate observations of CO2 and (CO2)-C-14 in order to simultaneously estimate fossil fuel emissions and biospheric exchange fluxes of CO2. Using this method in a set of Observation System Simulation Experiments (OSSEs), we show that given the coverage of (CO2)-C-14 measurements available in 2010 (969 over North America, 1063 globally), we can recover the US national total fossil fuel emission to better than 1aEuro-% for the year and to within 5aEuro-% for most months. Increasing the number of (CO2)-C-14 observations to similar to 5000 per year over North America, as recently recommended by the National Academy of Science (NAS) (Pacala et al., 2010), we recover monthly emissions to within 5aEuro-% for all months for the US as a whole and also for smaller, highly emissive regions over which the specified data coverage is relatively dense, such as for the New England states or the NY-NJ-PA tri-state area. This result suggests that, given continued improvement in state-of-the art transport models, a measurement program similar in scale to that recommended by the NAS can provide for independent verification of bottom-up inventories of fossil fuel CO2 at the regional and national scale. In addition, we show that the dual tracer inversion framework can detect and minimize biases in estimates of the biospheric flux that would otherwise arise in a traditional CO2-only inversion when prescribing fixed but inaccurate fossil fuel fluxes.","[Basu, Sourish; Miller, John Bharat] NOAA, Global Monitoring Div, Earth Syst Res Lab, Boulder, CO USA; [Basu, Sourish; Miller, John Bharat] Univ Colorado, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Lehman, Scott] Univ Colorado, Inst Arctic & Alpine Res, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Basu, S (corresponding author), NOAA, Global Monitoring Div, Earth Syst Res Lab, Boulder, CO USA.;Basu, S (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",sourish.basu@noaa.gov,"Miller, John B./AAE-7714-2019","Miller, John B./0000-0001-8630-1610; BASU, SOURISH/0000-0001-8605-5894",NOAA Climate Programs Office (CPO) [NA13OAR4310075],NOAA Climate Programs Office (CPO),"We would like to thank Colm Sweeney for providing aircraft-based measurements of SF<INF>6</INF> and Ed Dlugokencky and Andrew Crotwell for marine boundary layer measurements of SF<INF>6</INF>, Colin Lindsay for homogenizing global neutron monitor data and oceanic <SUP>14</SUP>CO<INF>2</INF> data from multiple sources, and Nicolas Bousserez for useful discussions on uncertainty quantification.

These gradients modulate the spatial structure of glacier retreat and are correlated with other physical and biochemical variability along the shelf, but their structure and dynamics remain poorly understood. Here, the magnitude, spatial structure, seasonal-to-interannual variability, and driving mechanisms of along-shore exchange are investigated using the output of a high-resolution numerical model and with hydrographic data collected in Palmer Deep. The analyses reveal a pronounced seasonal cycle of along-shore transport, with a net flux (7.0 x 10(5) m(3)/s) of cold water toward the central WAP (cWAP) in winter, which reverses in summer with a net flow (5.2 x 10(5) m(3)/s) of Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) and modified CDW (mCDW) toward Bransfield Strait. Significant interannual variability is found as the pathway of a coastal current transporting Weddell-sourced water along the WAP shelf is modulated by wind forcing. When the Southern Annual Mode (SAM) is positive during winter, stronger upwelling-favorable winds dominate in Bransfield Strait, leading to offshore advection of the Weddell-sourced water. Negative SAM leads to weaker upwelling- or downwelling-favorable winds and enhanced flooding of the cWAP with cold water from Bransfield Strait. This process can result in significant (0.5 degrees C below 200 m) cooling of the continental shelf around Palmer Station, highlighting that along-shore exchange is critical in modulating the hydrographic properties along the WAP. Plain Language Summary The melting of glaciers and the structure of ecosystems along the West Antarctic Peninsula have been influenced by the local temperature and salinity patterns. Our understanding of what controls the spatial structure and temporal variability of these gradients is limited. In this study, we analyze output from a state-of-the-art numerical model and find that there is strongly seasonal and interannual variability in the along-shore exchange processes that control those gradients. The interannual variability of the along-shore exchange is related to the local winds. As the wind conditions vary in response to hemispheric-scale climate processes, the amount of cold water flowing into the central West Antarctic Peninsula from Bransfield Strait varies interannually. We show this is a key process in the evolution of ocean properties in the West Antarctic Peninsula continental shelf.","[Wang, Xin; Moffat, Carlos; Aguiar-Gonzalez, Borja] Univ Delaware, Coll Earth Ocean & Environm, Newark, DE 19716 USA; [Dinniman, Michael S.; Klinck, John M.] Old Dominion Univ, Ctr Coastal Phys Oceanog, Norfolk, VA USA; [Sutherland, David A.] Univ Oregon, Dept Earth Sci, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Aguiar-Gonzalez, Borja] Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Dept Fis, Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Spain",University of Delaware; Old Dominion University; University of Oregon; Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria,"Wang, X (corresponding author), Univ Delaware, Coll Earth Ocean & Environm, Newark, DE 19716 USA.",xinwang@udel.edu,"; Moffat, Carlos/B-3565-2015","Dinniman, Michael/0000-0001-7519-9278; Klinck, John/0000-0003-4312-5201; Moffat, Carlos/0000-0002-7768-8275; WANG, XIN/0000-0002-0224-8419","National Science Foundation (NSF) Division of Polar Programs [1703310, 1543018, 1543012]",National Science Foundation (NSF) Division of Polar Programs(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)),"The authors would like to thank Dr. Jennifer Graham for her contributions to the setup of the high-resolution ROMS model.

Due to its southwesternmost cul-de-sac position and eco-geographical diversity, Paleolithic Iberia was the stage of cyclical cultural/technological changes, linked to fluctuations in climate and environments, human demographics, and the size, extension, and type of social exchange networks. Such dynamics are particularly evident during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) timeframe, with a series of innovations emerging in the archaeological record, marking the transitions between the traditionally defined Gravettian, Proto-Solutrean, Solutrean, and Magdalenian technocomplexes. Stemming from a workshop organized in Erlangen in 2019 on ?The Last Glacial Maximum in Europe - state of knowledge in Geosciences and Archaeology?, this paper presents, in the first part, an updated review on the paleoenvironments and human adaptations across four macro-regions (Northern, Inland, Mediterranean, and Western Atlantic Fa?ade) in Iberia during the LGM; and, in a second part, a discussion on the pronounced interregional variability, unresolved research questions, and the most promising research topics for future studies.","[Cascalheira, Joao] Univ Algarve, ICArEHB, Faro, Portugal; [Alcaraz-Castano, Manuel; Alcolea-Gonzalez, Javier; Andres-Herrero, Maria de] Univ Alcala, Dept Hist & Filosofia, Area Prehist, Alcala De Henares, Spain; [Arrizabalaga, Alvaro; Garcia-Ibaibarriaga, Naroa; Iriarte-Chiapusso, Maria-Jose] Univ Basque Country, Dept Geog Prehist & Arqueol, UPV EHU, IT 1223 19, Bilbao, Spain; [Tortosa, J.

Contexts for prototyping innovative products and services in Lapland could include outdoor leisure-activities, tourism and sports. A particularly salient focus in this work is to identify the appropriate strategies for re-thinking and designing in ways that address simultaneously the social, economic and environmental aspects of sustainability. The designing-in of ecological considerations throughout production cycles is a prerequisite to uncompromising value-added products that support the environmentally conscious behaviour of end-users.

Through mapping a visual and affective constellation of affects and materialities that leap and jump across time and bodies, this article explores the multiple and layered discourses at work in this moment to explore what they do: How race and racism are (re)produced through everyday practices, as well as how they crack and stutter and become differently.

Here, we present planktonic delta(18)O and Mg/Ca records from the western subtropical gyre of the North Pacific spanning the last 30 kyrs. The results indicate that subtropical SSTs were approximately 3 degrees C lower during the last glacial than in the Holocene interglacial, indicating that glacial cooling occurred uniformly in the low to mid-latitudes of the western North Pacific. A decrease in intermediate depth temperatures at the late glacial suggests that the formation and/or advection of the subtropical mode water was enhanced due to a strong East Asian winter monsoon. The results suggest that the change in the thermal structure of the subtropical gyre was related to changes in East Asian monsoon activity. Citation: Sagawa, T., Y. Yokoyama, M. Ikehara, and M.

This review focuses on how optimal operating rules can be derived and represented. Advantages and drawbacks of each approach are discussed. Major approaches to derive optimal operating rules include direct optimization of reservoir operation, embedding conditional operating rules in simulation-optimization frameworks, and inferring rules from optimization results. Suggestions on which approach to use depend on context. Parametrization-simulation-optimization or rule inference using heuristics are promising approaches.

The favorable optical; electronic, and energetic properties of PBDTTPD-HT with respect to ITIC achieved panchromatic photon-to-current conversion with a remarkably low energy loss (0.59 eV).","[Hadmojo, Wisnu Tantyo; Wibowo, Febrian Tri Adhi; Jung, In Hwan; Jang, Sung-Yeon] Kookmin Univ, Dept Chem, 77 Jeongneung Ro, Seoul 02707, South Korea; [Ryu, Du Yeol] Yonsei Univ, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, 50 Yonsei Ro, Seoul 03722, South Korea",Kookmin University; Yonsei University,"Jung, IH; Jang, SY (corresponding author), Kookmin Univ, Dept Chem, 77 Jeongneung Ro, Seoul 02707, South Korea.",ihjung@kookmin.ac.kr; syjang@kookmin.ac.kr,"JUNG, IN HWAN/B-4543-2018","JUNG, IN HWAN/0000-0002-8133-1041; Jang, Sung-Yeon/0000-0002-4225-3167","New and Renewable Energy Core Technology Program of the Korea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation and Planning (KETEP); Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, Republic of Korea [20163030013960]; Technology Development Program to Solve Climate Changes of the National Research Foundation (NRF) - Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning [NRF-2016M1A2A2940912]; National Research Foundation (NRF) grant - Korean Government [2016R1A5A1012966, 2017R1A2B2009178, 2017R1C1B2010694]; Global Scholarship Program for Foreign Graduate Students at Kookmin University in Korea","New and Renewable Energy Core Technology Program of the Korea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation and Planning (KETEP); Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, Republic of Korea; Technology Development Program to Solve Climate Changes of the National Research Foundation (NRF) - Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning; National Research Foundation (NRF) grant - Korean Government; Global Scholarship Program for Foreign Graduate Students at Kookmin University in Korea","The authors gratefully acknowledge the support from the New and Renewable Energy Core Technology Program of the Korea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation and Planning (KETEP); the granted financial resources from the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, Republic of Korea (no. 20163030013960); the Technology Development Program to Solve Climate Changes of the National Research Foundation (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning (NRF-2016M1A2A2940912); the National Research Foundation (NRF) grant funded by the Korean Government (2016R1A5A1012966, 2017R1A2B2009178, and 2017R1C1B2010694); and the Global Scholarship Program for Foreign Graduate Students at Kookmin University in Korea.",,54,42,42,1,57,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1944-8244,1944-8252,,ACS APPL MATER INTER,ACS Appl.

Potential connections between water discharge in the Yellow River Basin and El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) were also examined by the cross wavelet and wavelet coherence methods. CWT results show that the periodic oscillations in water discharges had occurred at the temporal scales of 1-, 2- to 4-, 6- to 8- and 10- to 22-year. It was also found that at the annual timescale (1-year) the phase relations between water discharge and ENSO were indistinct probably due to the strong influence by human disturbances. However, over the longer time scales, the phase relation becomes much clearer with an anti-phase relation being found mainly at inter-annual scale (2- to 8-year) and in-phase relation at decadal scale (16- to 22-year). According to the MK test results water discharge at most stations except Tangnaihai have decreased significantly and the abrupt change occurred in the mid-1980s or the early 1990s. The changes in water discharge were found to be influenced by both climate changes and human activities. Before 1970 the change in water discharge was positively related to precipitation variations in the river basin, but after 1970 the decrease in water discharge has been largely caused by various human activities including constructions of reservoirs, water abstraction and water-soil conservation with water abstraction being the main cause.","[Liu Feng; Chen Shenliang; Peng Jun] E China Normal Univ, State Key Lab Estuarine & Coastal Res, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China; [Dong Ping] Univ Dundee, Coll Art Sci & Engn, Sch Engn Phys & Math, Div Civil Engn, Dundee DD1 4HN, Scotland",East China Normal University; University of Dundee,"Liu, F (corresponding author), E China Normal Univ, State Key Lab Estuarine & Coastal Res, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China.",liufeng198625@126.com,,,Major National Scientific Research Programs [2010CB951202]; Special Expenses Program of Scientific Research in Marine Commonweal Industry [200805063],Major National Scientific Research Programs; Special Expenses Program of Scientific Research in Marine Commonweal Industry,"Major National Scientific Research Programs, No.2010CB951202; Special Expenses Program of Scientific Research in Marine Commonweal Industry, No.200805063",,58,38,46,5,69,SCIENCE PRESS,BEIJING,"16 DONGHUANGCHENGGEN NORTH ST, BEIJING 100717, PEOPLES R CHINA",1009-637X,1861-9568,,J GEOGR SCI,J.

A systematic review aiming to understand the ecological importance of ascidians as efficient filter-feeders [What?]; their potential contribution as extractive species [How?]; and to set the benchmark for their nutritional value and potential added value to the aquaculture industry [For what?] is a timely contribution to advance the state of the art on these largely overlooked bioresources. In the last two decades, there has been an overall increase in publications addressing ascidians in aquaculture, namely, their negative impacts through biofouling, as well as their role in IMTA, environmental status, and microbiology. While Ciona intestinalis, a solitary ascidian, has been the most studied species, overall, most ascidians present high filtration and fast-growth rates. As ascidians perform well under IMTA, competition for resources and space with other filter-feeders might occur, which may require additional management actions to optimize production. Studies addressing their bioactive products show that ascidians hold great potential as premium ingredients for aquafeed formulations, as well as dietary supplements (e.g., amino acids, fatty acids). Further research on the potential use of ascidians in IMTA frameworks should focus on systems carrying capacity.","[Marques, Luisa; Calado, Ricardo; Lillebo, Ana Isabel] Univ Aveiro, CESAM Ctr Environm & Marine Studies, Dept Biol, ECOMARE, Aveiro, Portugal",Universidade de Aveiro,"Marques, L; Lillebo, AI (corresponding author), Univ Aveiro, CESAM Ctr Environm & Marine Studies, Dept Biol, ECOMARE, Aveiro, Portugal.",luisa.marques@ua.pt; lillebo@ua.pt,,,Integrated Program of SR&TD Smart Valorization of Endogenous Marine Biological Resources Under a Changing Climate [Centro-01-0145-FEDER-000018]; FCT (Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology) [PD/BD/127918/2016]; FCT/MEC [UIDP/50017/2020 + UIDB/50017/2020],Integrated Program of SR&TD Smart Valorization of Endogenous Marine Biological Resources Under a Changing Climate; FCT (Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology)(Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology); FCT/MEC(Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology),We are thankful to the Integrated Program of SR&TD Smart Valorization of Endogenous Marine Biological Resources Under a Changing Climate (reference Centro-01-0145-FEDER-000018) and to FCT (Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology) for the financial support through a Ph.D. grant attributed to LM (PD/BD/127918/2016).

In the 1960s, X disease of ponderosa pines within the San Bernardino Mountains was likewise determined to be due to O-3. Nearly 50 years of research have followed. Foliar O-3 symptoms have been verified under controlled chamber conditions. Studies have demonstrated negative growth effects on forest tree seedlings due to seasonlong O-3 exposures, but due to complex interactions within forest stands, evidence of similar losses within mature tree canopies remains elusive. Investigations on tree growth, O-3 flux, and stand productivity are being conducted along natural O-3 gradients and in open-air exposure systems to better understand O-3 effects on forest ecosystems.

Thus, feature selection is used to discard redundant features for improving classification. Nonetheless, there is not a single feature selection method which could deal with all datasets. Thus, this paper proposes an automatic hybrid feature selection incorporating both filter and wrapper methods called Extended Mutual Congestion-Discrete Weighted Evolution Strategy (EMC-DWES). First, Extended Mutual Con-gestion (EMC) is proposed as a frequency-based filter ranker to discard irrelevant and redundant features using intrinsic statistics of features. Second, Discrete Weighted Evolution Strategy (DWES) is applied on the remaining features selected by EMC to perform the final automatic feature selection within a wrapper method. DWES clusters the features and applies mutation both to select the most relevant feature in each cluster at a time and to avoid selecting redundant features simultaneously through assigning greater weights to most informative clusters. The performance of EMC-DWES (in maximizing classification accuracy and minimizing the selected subset length) is investigated using benchmark high dimensional medical datasets including Covid-19. Likewise, the superiority of EMC-DWES in comparison with state-of-the-art is also evaluated in all datasets.

Previously reported environmental records indicating more open vegetation during the LGM have been interpreted in terms of aridity, but such changes can be explained by alternative mechanisms. To provide new evidence concerning the region's Quaternary precipitation history, we examine temporal changes in large mammal richness at four south-west Australian fossil sites: Devil's Lair, Tunnel Cave, Witchcliffe Rock Shelter and Rainbow Cave. Large mammal richness is correlated strongly with mean annual precipitation across 53 modern Australian communities. Extending this relationship to the fossil record, a steady increase in richness from the LGM to the onset of the Holocene at both Devil's Lair and Tunnel Cave is consistent with increased precipitation through time. This supports previous interpretations of a more arid LGM and implies regional heterogeneity in the position of the southern hemisphere westerlies. A reduction in richness during the last similar to 1000 years is unlikely to be the result of precipitation change and may be related to more frequent burning of the landscape by hunter-gatherers in an effort to increase availability of large prey.

This study aims to provide more accurate and precise fields of TOA SW radiances reflected from clouds over ocean by introducing a novel semiphysical model predicting radiances per narrow sun-observer geometry. This model was statistically trained using CERES-measured radiances paired with MODIS-retrieved cloud parameters as well as reanalysis-based geophysical parameters. By using radiative transfer approximations as a framework to ingest the above parameters, the new approach incorporates cloud-top effective radius and above-cloud water vapor in addition to traditionally used cloud optical depth, cloud fraction, cloud phase, and surface wind speed. A two-stream cloud albedo - serving to statistically incorporate cloud optical thickness and cloud-top effective radius - and Cox-Munk ocean reflectance were used to describe an albedo over each CERES footprint. Effective-radius-dependent asymmetry parameters were obtained empirically and separately for each viewing-illumination geometry. A simple equation of radiative transfer, with this albedo and attenuating above-cloud water vapor as inputs, was used in its log-linear form to allow for statistical optimization. We identified the two-stream functional form that minimized radiance residuals calculated against CERES observations and outperformed the state-of-the-art approach for most observer geometries outside the sun-glint and solar zenith angles between 20 and 70 degrees, reducing the median SD of radiance residuals per solar geometry by up to 13.2 % for liquid clouds, 1.9 % for ice clouds, and 35.8 % for footprints containing both cloud phases. Geometries affected by sun glint (constituting between 10 % and 1 % of the discretized upward hemisphere for solar zenith angles of 20 and 70 degrees, respectively), however, often showed weaker performance when handled with the new approach and had increased residuals by as much as 60 % compared to the state-of-the-art approach. Overall, uncertainties were reduced for liquid-phase and mixed-phase footprints by 5.76 % and 10.81 %, respectively, while uncertainties for ice-phase footprints increased by 0.34 %. Tested for a variety of scenes, we further demonstrated the plausibility of scene-wise predicted radiance fields. This new approach may prove useful when employed in angular distribution models and may result in improved flux estimates, in particular dealing with clouds characterized by small or large droplet/crystal sizes.","[Tornow, Florian; Preusker, Rene; Fischer, Juergen] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Space Sci, Berlin, Germany; [Tornow, Florian] Columbia Univ, Earth Inst, Ctr Climate Syst Res, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Tornow, Florian] NASA, Goddard Inst Space Studies, New York, NY 10025 USA; [Domenech, Carlos] GMV, Madrid, Spain; [Barker, Howard W.] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Toronto, ON, Canada",Free University of Berlin; Columbia University; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; Environment & Climate Change Canada,"Tornow, F (corresponding author), Free Univ Berlin, Inst Space Sci, Berlin, Germany.;Tornow, F (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Earth Inst, Ctr Climate Syst Res, New York, NY 10027 USA.;Tornow, F (corresponding author), NASA, Goddard Inst Space Studies, New York, NY 10025 USA.",florian.tornow@fu-berlin.de,"Tornow, Florian/AAA-9434-2020; Keyes, Dennis/AAZ-9285-2021","Tornow, Florian/0000-0002-3664-6933; ",European Space Agency [4000112019/14/NL/CT],European Space Agency(European Space AgencyEuropean Commission),This research has been supported by the European Space Agency (grant no. 4000112019/14/NL/CT).,,40,2,2,0,1,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1867-1381,1867-8548,,ATMOS MEAS TECH,Atmos.

It also provides a unique opportunity to develop and test land surface parameterizations at the global scale, using multi-year off-line simulations that are not affected by the systematic errors found in atmospheric models. Nevertheless, the accuracy and reliability of the 10-year GSWP-2 atmospheric forcing remain questionable. A first comparison using the high-resolution Rhone-AGGregation (Rhone-AGG) database reveals that the baseline GSWP-2 precipitation forcing is drastically overestimated over the Rhone river basin. Hydrological simulations driven with each dataset and using the ISBA land surface model and the MODCOU river routing model are also compared. The simulated river discharges are validated against a dense network of river gauges and are generally less realistic when using the GSWP-2 instead of the Rhone-AGG precipitation forcing. Secondly, the GSWP-2 precipitation forcing is compared with three alternative data sets (GPCP-2, CRU-2, CMAP) at the global scale. Moreover, the results of a global sensitivity study to the precipitation forcing conducted with six land surface models are shown. The TRIP river routing model is used to convert daily runoff from all models into river discharges, which are compared at 80 gauging stations distributed over the globe. In agreement with the regional evaluation, the results reveal that the baseline GSWP-2 precipitation forcing is generally overestimated over the mid and high latitudes, which implies systematic errors in the simulated discharges. This study reveals that the empirical wind corrections applied to the GSWP-2 precipitation forcing are exaggerated, whereas the GPCP satellite adjustments seem to be useful for simulating realistic annual mean river discharges over the East Siberian river basins.","CETP, IPSL, CNRS, F-78140 Velizy Villacoublay, France; Meteo France, CNRM, GMGEC, UDC, F-31057 Toulouse, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Meteo France,"Decharme, B (corresponding author), CETP, IPSL, CNRS, 10 Ave Europe, F-78140 Velizy Villacoublay, France.",bertrand.decharme@cetp.ipsl.fr; herve.douville@meteo.fr,"Decharme, Bertrand/Z-4563-2019","Decharme, Bertrand/0000-0002-8661-1464",,,,,65,67,67,3,18,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0930-7575,1432-0894,,CLIM DYNAM,Clim.

We prove that the satisfiable travel demand objective exhibits restricted supermodularity over forests, and utilize this property to design an iterative algorithm based on maximizing successive modular lower bounds for the objective that finds better solutions than a baseline greedy approach. We also propose an extremely fast heuristic for maximizing modular functions subject to knapsack and graph matroid constraints that can be used as a subroutine in the iterative algorithm, or as a standalone method that matches the greedy baseline in terms of quality but is orders of magnitude faster.

It has become a mainstream architectural design aim in recent years as a result of global environmental concerns. In light of global climate change, sustainable development is imperative to consider during architectural designs of the buildings and mega infrastructural projects. All the nations are developing assembly building tools widely to speed up the construction, but the material and design impact a lot, while we calculate the environmental factors such as carbon emissions. Assembly building component automation system is often used to complete components processing and to deliver the best project, which considers environmental concerns. The construction processing involves many factors such as carbon emission, energy consumption, waste management, and solar-based energy generation to make the overall project sustainable for energy. Therefore, this paper proposes a BIM-based (Building Information Modeling) assembly building component automation system targeted at adopting sustainability principles in the construction sector, which can consider various factors for maintaining eco-friendly environment. The BIM model of the assembled building components is designed and tested in a simulated environment. The system test result shows that the error rate of component design in this system is lower than that of the other two automation systems taken up for the comparative study and the proposed process is more stable, faster, and eco- friendly. Therefore, the design result of the assembly building component automation system based on BIM technology is scientific and effective for sustainable development.","[Wang, Wenjing] Shandong Univ Technol, Sch Civil & Architectural Engn, Zibo, Peoples R China; [Wang, Wenjing] Hebei Univ Technol, Sch Civil & Transportat Engn, Tianjin, Peoples R China",Shandong University of Technology; Hebei University of Technology,"Wang, WJ (corresponding author), Shandong Univ Technol, Sch Civil & Architectural Engn, Zibo, Peoples R China.;Wang, WJ (corresponding author), Hebei Univ Technol, Sch Civil & Transportat Engn, Tianjin, Peoples R China.",wangwenjing@mjwhedu.cn,,,,,,,20,0,0,4,4,HINDAWI LTD,LONDON,"ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND",1024-123X,1563-5147,,MATH PROBL ENG,Math.

It consists largely of mineral particles with a small fraction of organic matter constituted mainly of remains of micro-organisms that participated in degrading plant debris before their own decay. Some micro-organisms have been shown to be much better ice nuclei than the most efficient soil mineral. Yet, current aerosol schemes in global climate models do not consider a difference between soil dust and mineral dust in terms of ice nucleation activity. Here, we show that particles from the clay and silt size fraction of four different soils naturally associated with 0.7 to 11.8% organic carbon (w/w) can have up to four orders of magnitude more ice nucleation sites per unit mass active in the immersion freezing mode at -12 degrees C than montmorillonite, the nucleation properties of which are often used to represent those of mineral dusts in modelling studies. Most of this activity was lost after heat treatment. Removal of biological residues reduced ice nucleation activity to, or below that of montmorillonite. Desert soils, inherently low in organic content, are a large natural source of dust in the atmosphere. In contrast, agricultural land use is concentrated on fertile soils with much larger organic matter contents than found in deserts. It is currently estimated that the contribution of agricultural soils to the global dust burden is less than 20 %. Yet, these disturbed soils can contribute ice nuclei to the atmosphere of a very different and much more potent kind than mineral dusts.","[Conen, F.; Alewell, C.] Univ Basel, Inst Environm Geosci, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland; [Morris, C.

Pollen exposure is related to allergic diseases, which makes its prediction a valuable tool to assess the risk level to aeroallergens. However, airborne pollen concentrations are difficult to predict due to the inherent complexity of the relationships among both biotic and environmental variables. In this work, a stochastic approach based on supervised machine learning algorithms was performed to forecast the daily Olea pollen concentrations in the Community of Madrid, central Spain, from 1993 to 2018. Firstly, individual Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) and artificial neural network (ANN) models were applied to predict the day of the year (DOY) when the peak of the pollen season occurs, resulting the estimated average peak date 149.1 +/- 9.3 and 150.1 +/- 10.8 DOY for LightGBM and ANN, respectively, close to the observed value (148.8 +/- 9.8). Secondly, the daily pollen concentrations during the entire pollen season have been calculated using an ensemble of two-step GAM followed by LightGBM and ANN. The results of the prediction of daily pollen concentrations showed a coefficient of determination (r(2)) above 0.75 (goodness of the model following cross-validation). The predictors included in the ensemble models were meteorological variables, phenological metrics, specific site-characteristics, and preceding pollen concentrations. The models are state-of-the-art in machine learning and their potential has been shown to be used and deployed to understand and to predict the pollen risk levels during the main olive pollen season.","[Cordero, Jose Maria; Narros, Adolfo; Borge, Rafael] Univ Politecn Madrid UPM, ETSII UPM, Jose Gutierrez Abascal 2, Madrid 28006, Spain; [Rojo, J.] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Inst Environm Sci Bot, Avda Carlos III S-N, E-45071 Toledo, Spain; [Gutierrez-Bustillo, A.

Steven; Wiese, David N.",,,The Impact of Atmospheric Modeling Errors on GRACE Estimates of Mass Loss in Greenland and Antarctica,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH,,,English,Article,,,,,,,ACCELERATION; REANALYSIS; VARIABILITY; PROGRAM; BALANCE,"Systematic errors in Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) monthly mass estimates over the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets can originate from low-frequency biases in the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Operational Analysis model, the atmospheric component of the Atmospheric and Ocean Dealising Level-1B (AOD1B) product used to forward model atmospheric and ocean gravity signals in GRACE processing. These biases are revealed in differences in surface pressure between the ECMWF Operational Analysis model, state-of-the-art reanalyses, and in situ surface pressure measurements. While some of these errors are attributable to well-understood discrete model changes and have published corrections, we examine errors these corrections do not address. We compare multiple models and in situ data in Antarctica and Greenland to determine which models have the most skill relative to monthly averages of the dealiasing model. We also evaluate linear combinations of these models and synthetic pressure fields generated from direct interpolation of pressure observations. These models consistently reveal drifts in the dealiasing model that cause the acceleration of Antarctica's mass loss between April 2002 and August 2016 to be underestimated by approximately 4Gtyr(-2). We find similar results after attempting to solve the inverse problem, recovering pressure biases directly from the GRACE Jet Propulsion Laboratory RL05.1 M mascon solutions. Over Greenland, we find a 2Gt yr(-1) bias in mass trend. While our analysis focuses on errors in Release 05 of AOD1B, we also evaluate the new AOD1B RL06 product. We find that this new product mitigates some of the aforementioned biases. Plain Language Summary The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites measure changes in gravity over Greenland and Antarctica, allowing estimation of recent mass loss in both ice sheets. GRACE senses gravity signals from sources of mass change other than ice, including the atmosphere. The model used to remove atmospheric signals from GRACE is operational in nature, and errors in this model can introduce biases to estimates of mass change in Greenland and Antarctica. We estimate the biases in the operational model by comparing its predictions of surface pressure (the local weight of the atmosphere) to measurements from automatic weather stations in Greenland and Antarctica. We also compare this operational model to better, more physically, and observationally consistent reanalyses. Over Antarctica, our analysis consistently reveals that the magnitude of the acceleration of ice mass loss is underestimated by approximately 4Gtyr(-2), 40% more than previous estimates. Over Greenland, we find that atmospheric errors add noise to estimates of month-to-month variation in ice mass. Finally, we demonstrate that it is possible to observe these pressure errors with GRACE, highlighting the possibility of using satellite gravity as a meteorological measurement.","[Hardy, Ryan A.; Nerem, R.

They are obtained from the state-of-the-art Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Response Experiment (COARE) bulk algorithm (version 3.0). Using the exchange coefficients from this bulk scheme, C-D, C-L, and C-s are then expressed as simple polynomial functions of air-sea temperature difference (T-a - T-s)-where air temperature (T-a) is at 10 m, wind speed (V-a) is at 10 m, and relative humidity (RH) is at the air-sea interface-to parameterize stability. The advantage of using polynomial-based exchange coefficients is that they do not require any iterations for stability. In addition, they agree with results from the COARE algorithm but at approximate to 5 times lower computation cost, an advantage that is particularly needed for ocean general circulation models (OGCMs) and climate models running at high horizontal resolution and short time steps. The effects of any water vapor flux in calculating the exchange coefficients are taken into account in the polynomial functions, a feature that is especially important at low wind speeds (e.g., V-a < 5 m s(-1)) because air-sea mixing ratio difference can have a major effect on the stability, particularly in tropical regions. Analyses of exchange coefficients demonstrate the fact that water vapor can have substantial impact on air-sea exchange coefficients at low wind speeds. An example application of the exchange coefficients from the polynomial approach is the recalculation of climatological mean wind stress magnitude from 40-yr European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Re-Analysis (ERA-40) data in the North Pacific Ocean over 1979-2002. Using ECMWF 10-m winds and the authors' methodology provides accurate surface stresses while largely eliminating the orographically induced Gibb's waves found in the original ERA-40 surface wind stresses. These can have a large amplitude near mountainous regions and can extend far into the ocean interior. This study introduces exchange coefficients of air-sea fluxes, which are applicable to the wide range of conditions occurring over the global ocean, including the air-sea stability differences across the Gulf Stream and Kuroshio, regions which have been the subject of many climate model studies. This versatility results because CD, C, and C. are determined for V, values of 1 to 40 m s(-1), (T-a - T-s), intervals of -8 degrees to 7 degrees C, and RH values of 0% to 100%. Exchange coefficients presented here are called the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) Air-Sea Exchange Coefficients (NASEC) and they are suitable for a wide range of air-sea interaction studies and model applications.","USN, Res Lab, Stennis Space Ctr, Stennis Space Ctr, MS 39529 USA",National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); United States Department of Defense; United States Navy; Naval Research Laboratory,"Kara, AB (corresponding author), USN, Res Lab, Stennis Space Ctr, Code 7320,Bldg 1009, Stennis Space Ctr, MS 39529 USA.",kara@nrlssc.navy.mil,,,,,,,29,93,96,1,16,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0739-0572,,,J ATMOS OCEAN TECH,J.

A linear relationship between the initial root-mean-square difference of analog pairs and the time taken for the error to reach a certain limit value is used to extrapolate the predictability with initial errors considerably smaller than those in the present database. The relationship, first used in predictability experiments with the NMC numerical weather prediction (NWP) model, conforms to the experimental data in that the error growth depends not only on the magnitude of the error but also, to a lesser extent, on the initial error. Despite the fact that earlier error growth studies did not reflect this dependence on the initial error predictability results with two state-of-the-art numerical models using different analysis methods, and those derived here by the linear relationship mentioned above from circulation analogs are gratifying similar. These estimates indicate that given the present observational error (about 12 m rms) and spatial resolution of the data, in the NH winter, the atmosphere seems to have 17-18 days of predictability before the initial difference reaches 95% of the saturation level (random error). In present models, the forecast error reaches the same 95% level at around ten and a half days. Since the climate mean as a forecast has considerably less error than a random forecast, from a forecaster's point of view it is more appropriate to use the climate error as a reference level (71% of the saturation level). With the same conditions as above and using this alternative error reference level, the atmosphere might have a predictability of nine days, while the two models considered currently exhaust predictability at close to six days, leaving considerable room for improvement. Note that these atmospheric predictability estimates were obtained without considering a possible enhancement of predictability due to interactions with the slowly changing ocean and other geospheres. Hence, these estimates can be considered as lower limits to atmospheric predictability. Comparing the predictability estimates gained from twin model experiments to those from observational data is a special, complex method of model verification. Keeping in mind the uncertainties in the observational studies, one can ascertain that the models produce quite similar error growth characteristics to those of the real atmosphere. Hence, the NWP models are quite good on the time and spatial scales for which they were designed. However, there are some indications that they probably could not be reliably used to answer the theoretical questions regarding the gain in predictability with very small initial errors or with very high spatial resolution. Some kind of dynamic-empirical approach based on the interactions between different scales of motion is required to enhance current knowledge on these topics.","UNIV COLORADO,NOAA,COOPERAT INST RES ENVIRONM SCI,BOULDER,CO 80309",National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,,,"Toth, Zoltan/I-6624-2015","Toth, Zoltan/0000-0002-9635-9194",,,,,12,26,32,0,5,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693",0027-0644,,,MON WEATHER REV,Mon.

However, the reasons for this specific interannual variability have not yet been identified unequivocally from the observations. Among these, the possibility of SEIO SST-driven variability in the monsoon-ENSO system is investigated here by inserting positive/nega-tive SEIO temperature anomalies in the February's restart files of a state-of-the-art coupled General Circulation Model (GCM) for 49 years of a control simulation. For each year of the control simulation, the model was then integrated for a 1-year period in fully coupled mode. These experiments show that Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) and tropical Indian Ocean Dipole Mode (IODM) events are significantly influenced by the SEIO temperature perturbations inserted in the mixed layer of the coupled GCM several months before. A warm SEIO perturbation, inserted in late boreal winter, slowly propagates northward during the following seasons, implies enhanced ISM rainfall and finally triggers a negative IODM pattern during boreal fall in agreement with observations. A reversed evolution is simulated for a cold SEIO perturbation. It is shown that the life cycle of the simulated SEIO signal is driven by the positive wind-evaporation-SST, coastal upwelling and wind-thermocline-SST feedbacks. Further diagnosis of the sensitivity experiments suggests that stronger ISM and IODM variabilities are generated by excluding the El Nino years of the control simulation or when the initial background state in the SEIO is warmer. This finding confirms that IODM events may be triggered by multiple factors, other than ENSO, including subtropical SEIO SST anomalies. However, the ENSO mode does not react significantly to the SEIO temperature perturbation in the perturbed runs even though the simulated Pacific pattern agrees with the observations during boreal fall. These discrepancies with the observations may be linked to model biases in the Pacific and to the too strong ENSO simulated by this coupled GCM. These modeling evidences confirm that subtropical Indian Ocean SST anomalies generated by Mascarene high pulses during austral summer are a significant precursor of both ISM and IODM events occuring several months later.","Univ Paris 06, LOCEAN, IPSL, F-75252 Paris 05, France; Univ Paris 07, Paris, France; Meteo France, CNRM, GMGEC, UDC, Toulouse, France",Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle (MNHN); UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Universite Paris Cite; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Cite; Meteo France,"Terray, P (corresponding author), Univ Paris 06, LOCEAN, IPSL, BP 100,4 Pl Jussieu, F-75252 Paris 05, France.",terray@lodyc.jussieu.fr,,"terray, Pascal/0000-0002-3982-6630",,,,,82,33,34,1,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0930-7575,1432-0894,,CLIM DYNAM,Clim.

It relates the stage of scientific, technologic and innovation development relate to the actions of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to ensure the reduction of the global warming due to anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) into the atmosphere. The yearly monitoring of actions is presented, focusing on scientific, technologic and innovation from governments and companies acting within various countries in an attempt to mitigate the effects of global climate change. The mapping of the capture technologies was focused on absorption, adsorption, membranes, cryogenic, enzymatic and hybrid. The capture technologies are also mapped according to the CO2 capture process (post-combustion, pre-combustion and oxy-combustion). The results are analyzed in terms of priority date, annual evolution of the patents portifolia, technology owners (country, continent, sector of society, companies, (R&D institutions), inventors and their countries, authors of scientific articles, article copyright owners, institutions and countries where the scientific research reported in the articles was performed, patent type (process, method, prototype, product, etc.), patents classification codes showing technologic trends and fields, type of gas source where CO2 is captured, type of processes and type of gas outputs after CO2 capture, details of the components and of the processes for each method capture, among other trends. The results are contextualized in terms of methods of CO2 capture processes, focusing on technology for IPCC, roadmaps, and government programs and strategies for reducing CO2 emissions into the atmosphere. All the capture technologies are growing yearly, both in patent applications and in articles. Absorption and adsorption are the most used capture technologies, post-combustion is the most used capture process, and most of the patents refer to CO2 separation and removal. Most of the copyrights belong to Elsevier and American Physical Society, USA detains 52% of the patent applications and 31% of the articles published. The other patent applications belong mainly to Germany, France, Japan and United Kingdom. The countries with more aggressive appropriation policies are France, Norway, Germany, USA and Netherland. There is a strong correlation between countries of the technology owners and clear CCS government policies.

Sensors can be dropped randomly in the ocean and thus self-calibrate in terms of geographic location such that geo-tagged observations of water quality can be made without the need for costly and energy consuming GPS-hardware. The strategy is based on nodes with an accurate clock and light sensors that can regularly sample the level of light intensity. The measurements are fitted into a celestial model of the earth motion around the sun. By identifying the trajectory of the sun across the skies one can accurately determine sunrise and sunset times, and thus extract the longitude and latitude of the sensor.

Here, we present a geo-chronological data set useful for testing hypotheses of global sea level and refining ice sheet configuration through this interval. Data (n = 735) span the entire MIS 3 interval and consist of C-14 determinations (n = 651), cosmogenic exposure ages (n = 52), and optically stimulated luminescence dates (n = 32). On that basis, we hypothesize that the central region of the LIS underwent a dramatic reduction in ice from ca. 52 to 40 ka. Key to this hypothesis are geological records at sites in the Hudson Bay Lowlands (east central Canada) that suggest a marine incursion and development of terrestrial landscapes. We show that these landscapes are consistent with recently published glacial isostatic adjustment predictions that include widespread deglaciation of the eastern (Labrador) sector of the LIS with ice buildup over the western (Keewatin) sector at 42 ka. Ice growth from this minimum toward the LGM is likely to have been rapid. The agreement between this data set and modeling predictions prompts the reassessment of key Late Pleistocene records, including Heinrich events, loess deposition in the continental United States, and sedimentological records from the Gulf of Mexico.","[Dalton, April S.; Finkelstein, Sarah A.] Univ Toronto, Dept Earth Sci, Toronto, ON M5S 3B1, Canada; [Dalton, April S.] Univ Durham, Dept Geog, Durham DH1 3LE, England; [Forman, Steven L.] Baylor Univ, Dept Geosci, Waco, TX 76798 USA; [Barnett, Peter J.] Laurentian Univ, Harquail Sch Earth Sci, Sudbury, ON P3E 2C6, Canada; [Pico, Tamara; Mitrovica, Jerry X.] Harvard Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, 20 Oxford St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Toronto; Durham University; Baylor University; Laurentian University; Harvard University,"Dalton, AS (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Earth Sci, Toronto, ON M5S 3B1, Canada.;Dalton, AS (corresponding author), Univ Durham, Dept Geog, Durham DH1 3LE, England.",,"Forman, Steven/ABD-7720-2021; Finkelstein, Sarah/K-8202-2012","Finkelstein, Sarah/0000-0002-8239-399X; Dalton, April Sue/0000-0002-0725-1385",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (Canada); Ontario Geological Survey; Northern Scientific Training Program (Canada); University of Toronto Centre for Global Change Science; Ontario Graduate Scholarship; U.S. National Science Foundation; Harvard University,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (Canada)(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); Ontario Geological Survey; Northern Scientific Training Program (Canada); University of Toronto Centre for Global Change Science; Ontario Graduate Scholarship(Ontario Graduate Scholarship); U.S. National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Harvard University,"This research was funded by grants to Finkelstein from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (Canada) and the Ontario Geological Survey; and to Dalton from the Northern Scientific Training Program (Canada), the University of Toronto Centre for Global Change Science, and the Ontario Graduate Scholarship.

Regarding its final disposal, several criteria should be met to avoid the dissemination of the included micropollutants in the environment. Hence, an adequate treatment prior to SS disposal is highly required. Solar drying is being acknowledged as a sustainable process of SS treatment, yet it is still unclear to what extent this technique is efficient. This review aimed to assess the impact of solar drying on the composition of SS from environmental and agronomic standpoints. Herein, we present the state-of-the-art with regard to solar drying efficiency in terms of water content reduction, DM increase, agronomic parameters evolvement, and micropollutant stabilization including pathogens, heavy metals (HMs), and organic micropollutants. The reviewed literature is mostly focused on two drying cycles: summer and winter, thus addressing the extreme conditions met within a year with respect to temperature. Under different climatic conditions, more than 80% of dry matter is reached during summer. In winter, the efficiency decreases to an average of 50% of DM. Negatively correlated to DM content, pathogen concentration in SS significantly decreased, while DM increased. Thus, more efficiency in terms of pathogen abatement is reported in summer than in winter (e.g., 96% against 60% during summer and winter, respectively, under semi-arid climate). The high reliance of solar drying efficiency on weather has been deduced in terms of DM content increase and pathogen removal. Where climatic conditions are not favorable for solar drying, hybrid design and liming are the highly recommended methods to remove pathogens from SS. A few studies on the fate of HMs in SS during solar drying concluded that solar drying does not involve any removal mechanisms. Changes in HM speciation in solar-dried sludge were reported highlighting a decrease in their mobility. As for organic micropollutants (PAHs and antibiotics), only their occurrence in SS is reported in the literature, and their behavior during the solar drying process is still not addressed. This review allowed concluding the following: 1) solar drying is a sustainable, relevant process for SS handing in terms of volume reduction and pathogen removal, particularly in semi-arid regions; 2) solar drying does not lower the SS agronomic value and does not remove HMs, but under semi-arid climate, it changes HM speciation and reduces their mobility. The gap in research regarding organic micropollutant and heavy metal behavior during SS solar drying has been emphasized as a way forward for research within this topic. Hence, more research is required to help stakeholders decide on the feasibility of an agricultural disposal of solar-dried sludge.","[An-nori, Amal; El Mejahed, Khalil; El Gharous, Mohamed] Mohammed VI Polytech Univ, Agr Innovat & Technol Transfer Ctr AITTC, Marrakech, Morocco; [An-nori, Amal; El Fels, Loubna; Hafidi, Mohamed] Cadi Ayyad Univ, Lab Microbial Biotechnol Agrosci & Environm BioMA, Labelled Res Unit URL 4, Fac Sci Semlalia, Marrakech, Morocco; [Ezzariai, Amine] Mohammed VI Polytech Univ, African Sustainable Agr Res Inst, Laayoune, Morocco; [Hafidi, Mohamed] Univ Mohammed VI Polytech UM6P, Agrobiosci Program, Ben Guenrir, Morocco",Mohammed VI Polytechnic University; Cadi Ayyad University of Marrakech; Mohammed VI Polytechnic University; Mohammed VI Polytechnic University,"Hafidi, M (corresponding author), Cadi Ayyad Univ, Lab Microbial Biotechnol Agrosci & Environm BioMA, Labelled Res Unit URL 4, Fac Sci Semlalia, Marrakech, Morocco.;Hafidi, M (corresponding author), Univ Mohammed VI Polytech UM6P, Agrobiosci Program, Ben Guenrir, Morocco.",Hafidi@uca.ac.ma,"HAFIDI, Mohamed/AAA-9508-2019","HAFIDI, Mohamed/0000-0001-6049-8398",,,,,145,1,1,12,14,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-665X,,FRONT ENV SCI-SWITZ,Front.

Despite recent progress in the understanding of Antarctic surface hydrology, potential influences on ice shelf stability as well as links to environmental drivers remain poorly constrained. In this study, we employ state-of-the-art machine learning on Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical Sentinel-2 satellite imagery to provide new insight into the inter-annual and intra-annual evolution of surface hydrological features across six major Antarctic Peninsula and East Antarctic ice shelves. For the first time, we produce a high-resolution record of supraglacial lake extent dynamics for the period 2015-2021 at unprecedented 10m spatial resolution and bi-weekly temporal scale. Through synergetic use of optical and SAR data, we obtain a more complete mapping record also enabling the delineation of buried lakes. Our results for Antarctic Peninsula ice shelves reveal below-average meltwater ponding during most of melting seasons 2015-2018 and above-average meltwater ponding throughout summer 2019-2020 and early 2020-2021 considering years 2015-2021 as a reference period. Meltwater ponding on investigated East Antarctic ice shelves was far more variable, with above-average lake extents during most 2016-2019 melting seasons and below-average lake extents during 2020-2021, considering the reference interval 2016-2021. This study is the first to investigate relationships with climate drivers both spatially and temporally including time lag analysis. The results indicate that supraglacial lake formation in 2015-2021 is coupled to the complex interplay of local, regional and large-scale environmental drivers with similar driving factors over both ice sheet regions. In particular, varying air temperature, solar radiation and wind conditions influenced supraglacial lake formation over all six ice shelves despite strong local to regional discrepancies, as revealed through pixel-based correlation analysis. Furthermore, regional climatic conditions were shown to be influenced by Southern Hemisphere atmospheric modes showing large-scale impacts on the spatio-temporal evolution of supraglacial lakes as well as on above- or below-average meltwater ponding with respect to the period 2015-2021. Finally, the local glaciological setting, including melt-albedo feedbacks and the firn air content, was revealed to strongly influence supraglacial lake distribution. Recent increases in Antarctic Peninsula surface ponding point towards a further reduction in the firn air content, implying an increased risk for ponding and hydrofracture. In addition, lateral meltwater transport was observed over both Antarctic regions with similar implications for future ice shelf stability.","[Dirscherl, Mariel C.; Dietz, Andreas J.; Kuenzer, Claudia] German Aerosp Ctr DLR, German Remote Sensing Data Ctr DFD, Munchener Str 20, D-82234 Wassling, Germany; [Kuenzer, Claudia] Univ Wurzburg, Inst Geog & Geol, D-97074 Wurzburg, Germany",Helmholtz Association; German Aerospace Centre (DLR); University of Wurzburg,"Dirscherl, MC (corresponding author), German Aerosp Ctr DLR, German Remote Sensing Data Ctr DFD, Munchener Str 20, D-82234 Wassling, Germany.",mariel.dirscherl@dlr.de,,"Dirscherl, Mariel/0000-0002-3324-7646; Dietz, Andreas/0000-0002-5733-7136",,,,,93,4,4,5,12,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1994-0416,1994-0424,,CRYOSPHERE,Cryosphere,25-Nov,2021,11,,,,5205,5226,,10.5194/tc-15-5205-2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-5205-2021,,,22,"Geography, Physical; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Physical Geography; Geology,XD9RI,,"gold, Green Accepted",,,12/21/22,WOS:000723036600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this paper, we fit a series of DBNs with different hidden variable structures to a system known to have undergone a major structural change, i.e. the Baltic Sea food web.

In this paper, we collected 180 soil samples from soil depths of 1 m (0-20, 20-40, 40-60, 60-80, 80-100 cm) in the farmland and neighbor shelterbelts in Songnen Plain, northeastern China. The sample plots covered six regions in the study area. SOC concentration and respiration decomposition rate, Q(10) (temperature sensitivity), H-s (humidity sensitivity) were determined in the laboratory cultivation. Soil properties (N, P, K, electrical conductivity-EC, pH) and geographic-climate factors (multiple-year mean annual temperature and precipitation, MAT & MAP; temperature and precipitation during sampling month, MT &MP) were used to reveal the underlying reason for the changes in soil carbon sequestration. The results showed no significant difference in SOC respirational decomposition rate between farmland and shelterbelt forests but a 15.8% higher SOC concentration in shelterbelt forests (p < 0.05). The poplar shelterbelts reduced the Q(10) value by 15.4% (p < 0.05), with deeper soils a more significant reduction in Q(10). With soil moisture increases, both shelterbelt forests and farmland showed an obvious respiration pattern of first-increasing-then-decreasing. No significant H-s (linear gradients) differences were found in farmland and shelterbelt forests. Partitioning of the RDA ordination-based variation showed that SOC stability (H-s and Q(10)) of farmland was more affected by geo-climate. In contrast, the SOC stability of shelterbelt forests was greatly influenced by soil properties. Our findings manifest that the above-mentioned SOC changes can improve shelterbelt forest carbon sequestration function by prolonging the SOC lifespan in soil by at least 7% and SOC concentration by >15%. This should be included in the future to assess the underground soil carbon impact of Three-North shelterbelts in China and provide data supports for the estimation of similar forest stands in other parts of the world.","[Zhang, Xiting; Chen, Shengxian; Yang, Yanbo; Zhou, Zhiqiang; Wang, Huimei; Wang, Wenjie] Northeast Forestry Univ, Coll Chem, Heilongjiang Prov Key Lab Ecol Utilizat Forestry, Key Lab Forest Plant Ecol,Minist Educ, Harbin 150040, Peoples R China; [Wang, Wenjie] Chinese Acad Sci, Northeast Inst Geog & Agroecol, Changchun 130102, Peoples R China; [Wang, Qiong] Jiangxi Agr Univ, Coll Forestry, Coll Art & Landscape, Nanchang 330045, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Wu, Yan] Guizhou Educ Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Guiyang 550018, Peoples R China","Northeast Forestry University - China; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Northeast Institute of Geography & Agroecology, CAS; Jiangxi Agricultural University; Guizhou Education University","Wang, HM (corresponding author), Northeast Forestry Univ, Coll Chem, Heilongjiang Prov Key Lab Ecol Utilizat Forestry, Key Lab Forest Plant Ecol,Minist Educ, Harbin 150040, Peoples R China.;Wang, WJ (corresponding author), Northeast Forestry Univ, Coll Chem Chem Engn & Resource Utilizat, Key Lab Forest Plant Ecol, Harbin 150040, Peoples R China.",whm0709@hotmail.com; wjwang225@hotmail.com,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [41730641, 41877324]; China's Ministry of Education [2572018AA19, 2572021DT03]; Heilongjiang Touyan Innovation Team Program for Forest Ecology and Conservation from Heilongjiang province; 111 project [B20088]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China's Ministry of Education(Ministry of Education, China); Heilongjiang Touyan Innovation Team Program for Forest Ecology and Conservation from Heilongjiang province; 111 project(Ministry of Education, China - 111 Project)","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41730641 to WWJ, and 41877324 to WHM), basic research funding for national universities from China's Ministry of Education (2572018AA19 to ZXT; 2572021DT03 to WWJ), and Heilongjiang Touyan Innovation Team Program for Forest Ecology and Conservation from Heilongjiang province and 111 project (B20088) to WWJ.",,90,2,2,25,49,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0048-9697,1879-1026,,SCI TOTAL ENVIRON,Sci.

This system is based on seven state-of-the art models developed and run in Europe (CHIMERE, EMEP, EURAD-IM, LOTOS-EUROS, MATCH, MOCAGE and SILAM). These models are used to calculate multi-model ensemble products. The paper gives an overall picture of its status at the end of MACCII (summer 2014) and analyses the performance of the multi-model ensemble. The MACC-II system provides daily 96 h forecasts with hourly outputs of 10 chemical species/aerosols (O-3, NO2, SO2, CO, PM10, PM2.5, NO, NH3, total NMVOCs (non-methane volatile organic compounds) and PAN + PAN precursors) over eight vertical levels from the surface to 5 km height. The hourly analysis at the surface is done a posteriori for the past day using a selection of representative air quality data from European monitoring stations. The performance of the system is assessed daily, weekly and every 3 months (seasonally) through statistical indicators calculated using the available representative air quality data from European monitoring stations. Results for a case study show the ability of the ensemble median to forecast regional ozone pollution events. The seasonal performances of the individual models and of the multi-model ensemble have been monitored since September 2009 for ozone, NO2 and PM10. The statistical indicators for ozone in summer 2014 show that the ensemble median gives on average the best performances compared to the seven models. There is very little degradation of the scores with the forecast day but there is a marked diurnal cycle, similarly to the individual models, that can be related partly to the prescribed diurnal variations of anthropogenic emissions in the models. During summer 2014, the diurnal ozone maximum is underestimated by the ensemble median by about 4 mu g m(-3) on average. Locally, during the studied ozone episodes, the maxima from the ensemble median are often lower than observations by 30-50 mu g m(-3). Overall, ozone scores are generally good with average values for the normalised indicators of 0.14 for the modified normalised mean bias and of 0.30 for the fractional gross error. Tests have also shown that the ensemble median is robust to reduction of ensemble size by one, that is, if predictions are unavailable from one model. Scores are also discussed for PM10 for winter 2013-1014. There is an underestimation of most models leading the ensemble median to a mean bias of 4.5 mu g m(-3). The ensemble median fractional gross error is larger for PM10 (similar to 0.52) than for ozone and the correlation is lower (similar to 0.35 for PM10 and similar to 0.54 for ozone). This is related to a larger spread of the seven model scores for PM10 than for ozone linked to different levels of complexity of aerosol representation in the individual models. In parallel, a scientific analysis of the results of the seven models and of the ensemble is also done over the Mediterranean area because of the specificity of its meteorology and emissions. The system is robust in terms of the production availability. Major efforts have been done in MACC-II towards the operationalisation of all its components. Foreseen developments and research for improving its performances are discussed in the conclusion.","[Marecal, V.; Arteta, J.; Cheroux, F.; Drouin, A.; Guth, J.; Joly, M.; Josse, B.; Kadygrov, N.; Parmentier, J.; Plu, M.; Queguiner, S.] CNRS Meteo France, Ctr Natl Rech Meteorol, Grp Etude Atmosphere Mereorol, UMR 3589, Toulouse, France; [Peuch, V. -H.; Engelen, R.

As well, the Government of the Republic of Cyprus is providing additional resources to support the establishment of the ERATOSTHENES Centre of Excellence (ECoE) in Cyprus. The ECoE seeks to fill the gap by assisting in the spaceborne Earth Observation activities in the Eastern Mediterranean and become a regional key player in the Earth Observation (EO) sector. There are distinct needs and opportunities that motivate the establishment of an Earth Observation Centre of Excellence in Cyprus, which are primarily related to the geostrategic location of the European Union member state of Cyprus to examine complex scientific problems and address user needs in the Eastern Mediterranean, Middle East and Northern Africa (EMMENA), as well as South-East Europe. An important objective of the ECoE is to be a Digital Innovation Hub and a Research Excellence Centre for EO in the EMMENA region, which will establish an ecosystem where state-of-the-art sensing technology, cutting-edge research, targeted education services, and entrepreneurship come together. It is based on the paradigm of Open Innovation 2.0 (OI2.0), which is founded on the Quadruple Helix Model, where Government, Industry, Academia and Society work together to drive change by taking full advantage of the cross-fertilization of ideas. The ECoE as a Digital Innovation Hub (DIH) adopts a two-axis model, where the vertical axis consists of three Thematic Clusters for sustained excellence in research of the ECoE in the domains of Atmosphere and Climate, Resilient Societies and Big Earth Data Management, while the horizontal axis is built around four functional areas, namely: Infrastructure, Research, Education, and Entrepreneurship. The ECoE will focus on five application areas, which include Climate Change Monitoring, Water Resource Management, Disaster Risk Reduction, Access to Energy and Big EO Data Analytics. This structure is expected to leverage the existing regional capacities and advance the excellence by creating new programs and research, thereby establishing the ECoE as a world-class centre capable of enabling innovation and research competence in Earth Observation, actively participating in Europe, the EMMENA region and the global Earth Observation arena. The partners of the EXCELSIOR consortium include the Cyprus University of Technology as the Coordinator, the German Aerospace Center (DLR), the Leibniz Institute for Tropospheric Research (TROPOS), the National Observatory of Athens (NOA) and the Department of Electronic Communications, Deputy Ministry of Research, Innovation and Digital Policy.","[Hadjimitsis, Diofantos; Themistocleous, Kyriacos; Neocleous, Kyriacos; Michaelides, Silas; Mamouri, Rodanthi; Melillos, George; Danezis, Christos; Nisantzi, Argyro; Mettas, Christodoulos; Papoutsa, Christiana; Tzouvaras, Marios; Evagorou, Evagoras; Agapiou, Athos; Miltiadou, Milto; Christofe, Andreas; Prodromou, Maria; Loulli, Eleni; Yfantidou, Anastasia; Alverti, Maroula; Lysandrou, Vasiliki; Polydorou, Thomaida; Kyriakidis, Phaedon; Kyriakides, Nicholas; Akylas, Evangelos] Cyprus Univ Technol, Fac Engn & Technol, Dept Civil Engn & Geomat, Limassol, Cyprus; [Hadjimitsis, Diofantos; Themistocleous, Kyriacos; Neocleous, Kyriacos; Michaelides, Silas; Mamouri, Rodanthi; Melillos, George; Danezis, Christos; Nisantzi, Argyro; Mettas, Christodoulos; Papoutsa, Christiana; Tzouvaras, Marios; Evagorou, Evagoras; Agapiou, Athos; Miltiadou, Milto; Christofe, Andreas; Prodromou, Maria; Loulli, Eleni; Yfantidou, Anastasia; Alverti, Maroula; Lysandrou, Vasiliki; Polydorou, Thomaida; Kyriakidis, Phaedon; Kyriakides, Nicholas; Akylas, Evangelos; Anayiotos, Andreas] ERATOSTHENES Ctr Excellence, Limassol, Cyprus; [Anayiotos, Andreas] Cyprus Univ Technol, Dept Mech Epgineering & Mat Sci & Engn, Limassol, Cyprus; [Schreier, Gunter; Schwarz, Egbert] German Aerosp Ctr, Cologne, Germany; [Kontoes, Haris; Papoutsis, Ioannis] Natl Observ Athens, Athens, Greece; [Ansmann, Albert; Buehl, Johannes] Leibniz Inst Tropospher Res, Leibniz, Germany; [Komodromos, George; Tziortzis, Stelios] Cyprus Govt, Dept Elect Commun, Deputy Minisof Res Innovat & Digital Policy, Nicosia, Cyprus; [Ambrosia, Vincent] NASA, Washington, DC 20546 USA; [Ambrosia, Vincent] Calif State Univ Monterey Bay, Monterey, CA USA; [Zeil, Peter] Spatial Serv GmbH, Salzburg, Austria; [Halounova, Lena] Czech Tech Univ, Prague, Czech Republic; [Cheli, Simonetta] ESA European Space Agcy, Paris, France",Cyprus University of Technology; Cyprus University of Technology; Helmholtz Association; German Aerospace Centre (DLR); National Observatory of Athens; Leibniz Institut fur Tropospharenforschung (TROPOS); National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); California State University System; California State University Monterey Bay; Czech Technical University Prague,"Melillos, G (corresponding author), Cyprus Univ Technol, Fac Engn & Technol, Dept Civil Engn & Geomat, Limassol, Cyprus.;Melillos, G (corresponding author), ERATOSTHENES Ctr Excellence, Limassol, Cyprus.",gmelillos@gmail.com,"Tzouvaras, Marios/AAC-6541-2020; Evagorou, Evagoras/AAC-6764-2020; Anayiotos, Andreas/AAE-9728-2022; YFANTIDOU, ANASTASIA/ABG-5444-2020; Melillos, George/L-1468-2019; Lysandrou, Vasiliki/AAV-5075-2021; Papoutsis, Ioannis/L-5072-2013; Anayiotos, Andreas/AFE-8497-2022; Agapiou, Athos/J-3960-2015; AKYLAS, EVANGELOS/E-4418-2016; Neocleous, Kyriacos/D-4006-2016","Tzouvaras, Marios/0000-0002-4543-3112; Evagorou, Evagoras/0000-0001-9441-3946; Anayiotos, Andreas/0000-0003-4471-7604; YFANTIDOU, ANASTASIA/0000-0001-5864-5088; Papoutsis, Ioannis/0000-0002-2845-9791; Anayiotos, Andreas/0000-0003-4471-7604; Agapiou, Athos/0000-0001-9106-6766; Themistocleous, Kyriacos/0000-0003-4149-8282; Lysandrou, Vasiliki/0000-0002-1448-7599; AKYLAS, EVANGELOS/0000-0002-2731-657X; Melillos, George/0000-0002-8292-1836; Nisantzi, Argyro/0000-0001-8159-248X; Neocleous, Kyriacos/0000-0002-2445-5814; Christofe, Andreas/0000-0003-2528-1024","European Union [857510]; Government of the Republic of Cyprus through the Directorate General for the European Programmes, Coordination and Development","European Union(European Commission); Government of the Republic of Cyprus through the Directorate General for the European Programmes, Coordination and Development","The authors acknowledge the 'EXCELSIOR' (ERATOSTHENES: E.cellence Research Centre for Earth Surveillance and Space-Based Monitoring of the Environment) project.

The state-of-the-art of these greenhouses is 10 to 50 acres under glass with productivities on the order of 300,000 pounds of tomatoes per acre per year which is achievable through computer controlled climate, hydroponic growing systems, supplemental carbon dioxide, and energy conserving structures and systems. While the greenhouse structures and growing systems are high tech and capital intensive, the combination of high productivity in the wintertime when the prices are highest and the relatively low cost for cogenerated heat result in economic attractiveness as a commercial venture. Furthermore, from an environmental perspective, these state-of-the-art systems can be designed for zero water releases to soil or surface waters and very efficient point application of both fertilizers and pesticides compared to field crop broadcast applications. The primary objective of this paper is to present an engineering systems analysis of how such systems can mitigate, through greenhouse photosynthesis, carbon dioxide releases from both from fossil-fuelled power production at the greenhouse site and from the avoidance of fossil energy for field crop production and distribution. A second objective is to propose the use of environmentally benign fuel cells as the power production technology of choice (200 to 500 kilowatts/acre) to not only produce electricity with high efficiency (40 to 50 percent or more as electricity) and cogenerate useful heat for greenhouse winter warming, but also ''trigenerate'' useful carbon dioxide in the form of exhaust. This exhaust, which is very low in NO(x) and SO(x) coming from the fuel cell, can be used directly in the airspace of the greenhouse for both heat and the value of the carbon dioxide as a fertilizer, which can further increase crop productivity by 10 to 20 percent. The third objective is to show that when greenhouse biomass residues, along with other locally available agricultural wastes, can be anaerobically digested to produce a biogas that fuels the fuel cell, the system can produce power and food with a net short term sequestering of carbon dioxide in the form of food. In summary, this linking of technologies can result in both ''sustainable power'' and ''sustainable agriculture,'' the combination of which might be called ''sustainable agri-power.'' Also to be briefly explored will be applications to crops other than vegetables, such as fruits, flowers, spices and forest products, supplemental lighting for increased productivity, summertime cooling and thermal energy systems, and even more novel applications such as wastewater treatment through constructed wetlands, short rotation tree crops for energy production and, even further along, biotechnology applications.",,,,,,,,,,,0,8,8,0,8,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0196-8904,,,ENERG CONVERS MANAGE,Energy Conv.

Therefore, as a clean-energy-generation technology, TE materials have received tremendous research efforts in both industrial and academic communities for applications in the recovery of ubiquitous low-grade waste heat. Achieving high efficiency in TE materials is an ongoing pursuit of the TE research community, considering approximately 90% of all waste heat in the USA comes from medium-temperature (e.g., from 573 to 873 K) heat sources. Hence, synergistic enhancements in the figures-of-merit (ZT) are still highly desired and remain a key task for improving commercial applications of TE materials. Over the past decades, by navigating the interplay between heat and electronic transport, different advanced paradigms in current state-of-the-art TE materials, as well as emerging TE materials, have been adopted to obtain high ZT values, especially for the average ZT (ZT(avg)), as the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of a TE device depends on the ZT(avg) over a wide temperature range. Yet, now there are few reviews or perspective reports on methods to synergistically boost both the peak ZT (ZT(peak)) and ZT(avg), Herein, our recently developed strategies for optimizing and designing high-performance TE materials through advanced multiphase nanocomposite paradigms and material design are presented. Multiphase composites with distributed nanostructures (e.g., nanoplates and/or nanoparticles) provide effective phonon scattering through the nanoscale secondary phases. On the basis of the physical mechanism (the charge carrier transfer, phonon transfer/scattering, phonon-charge carrier interaction, and interface phenomenon), one can derive the optimum direction for the improvement of ZT(peak) and ZT(avg) of TE semiconductors. In this Account, we summarize and discuss the recent advances and insights from our work in designing TE materials with both high ZT(peak) and ZT(avg) by combining precisely engineered doping and nanostructuring. This Account is organized as follows: First, we summarize the advances of representative state-of-the-art TE materials in chronological order, including the advancement of performance-improving mechanisms. Second, we highlight the application of our effective multiphase material design strategies to leading Pb-based (PbTe, PbSe, and PbS) TE materials, with an emphasis on ZT(avg) and SnSe-based TE materials. Third, we introduce Sb2Si2Te6, which possesses an ultralow thermal lattice conductivity, as a promising new TE material, which was enhanced through a cellular nanostructure strategy. Finally, we outline an entropy-driven paradigm to optimize current SnSe-based and MnTe-based materials, thereby improving their TE performances.","[Jia, Ning; Tan, Xian Yi; Yan, Qingyu] Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Singapore 639798, Singapore; [Tan, Xian Yi; Xu, Jianwei] Inst Mat Res & Engn, Singapore 138634, Singapore; [Kanatzidis, Mercouri G.] Northwestern Univ, Dept Chem, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Nanyang Technological University & National Institute of Education (NIE) Singapore; Nanyang Technological University; Agency for Science Technology & Research (A*STAR); A*STAR - Institute of Materials Research & Engineering (IMRE); Northwestern University,"Yan, QY (corresponding author), Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Singapore 639798, Singapore.;Xu, JW (corresponding author), Inst Mat Res & Engn, Singapore 138634, Singapore.;Kanatzidis, MG (corresponding author), Northwestern Univ, Dept Chem, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",jw-xu@imre.a-star.edu.sg; alexyan@ntu.edu.sg; m-kanatzidis@northwestern.edu,"Yan, Qingyu/A-2237-2011; yan, qing/GZN-2287-2022; Yu, Yan/GYV-4514-2022","Yan, Qingyu/0000-0003-0317-3225","Singapore MOE Tier 2 [MOE2018-T2-1-010]; Singapore A*STAR Pharos Program [SERC 1527200022]; A*STAR Career Development Award [KIMR210401cSERCDA]; Singapore A*STAR [A19D9a0096]; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science and Office of Basic Energy Sciences [DE-SC0014520]","Singapore MOE Tier 2(Ministry of Education, Singapore); Singapore A*STAR Pharos Program(Agency for Science Technology & Research (A*STAR)); A*STAR Career Development Award(Agency for Science Technology & Research (A*STAR)); Singapore A*STAR(Agency for Science Technology & Research (A*STAR)); U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science and Office of Basic Energy Sciences(United States Department of Energy (DOE))","We thank Dr. Jinfeng Dong, Dr. Ady Suwardi, Dr. Jing Cao, Dr. Yubo Luo, and Dr. Zhongzhen Luo for fruitful discussion and useful suggestions.

A combination with equal weights includes the case of a no-skill model, in which all weights equal zero, and the multi-model mean, in which all weights equal 1/M, where M is the number of models. The test is applied to seasonal hindcasts of 2 m temperature and precipitation generated by five state-of-the-art coupled atmosphereocean models. The hypothesis of equal weights could not be rejected over 75% the globe for temperature and 90% of the land for precipitation, implying that strategies for unequal weighting of forecasts may be of value only over a relatively small fraction of the globe. The fact that the test does not require pre-specifying a specific strategy for weighting forecasts suggests that it should be useful for exploring a wide range of multi-model strategies.

However, K and its spatial variability on Mars are thus far poorly constrained due to lack of accessibility. Using an innovative method based on surface drainage dissection patterns, which has been successfully tested in the Oregon Cascades on Earth, we estimated K in the Mare Tyrrhenum Quadrangle on Mars. The basic assumption is that under long-term dynamic equilibrium conditions, the overall dissection pattern in a watershed as reflected in drainage density is controlled by the interplay among surface runoff, groundwater flow, topography, and aquifer properties. K is calculated following a derivative of Darcy's Law under DuPuit-Forchheimer assumptions with drainage density D, valley depth d, recharge rate R, and aquifer thickness H as inputs. The results are consistent with the published K values and reveal spatial variability. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The ballast parameterization begins to be incorporated into global ocean biogeochemical models. However, parameters used in this parameterization such as those of calcium carbonate flux are not constrained enough and it has been difficult to evaluate quantitatively how much the ballast-induced flux affects nutrient concentration in deep ocean. In this study, we obtain optimized parameters of calcium carbonate flux by conducting 64 sensitivity simulations using export production estimated from satellite observation and an ocean circulation field simulated by a state-of-the-art ocean general circulation model. By comparing simulations with and without the ballast-induced flux with the optimized parameters, 6% of nutrient of the deep Pacific is estimated to be transported by the ballast-induced flux. Because this accounts for 30% of effects of the total biological pump, it indicates that the ability of the biological pump to carry nutrients to deep ocean significantly depends on the ballast-induced flux. Results of additional sensitivity simulations suggest that choice of model parameters associated with calcium carbonate flux strongly affects its estimation. Although the implementation of the ballast parameterization has potential ability to improve simulation of nutrient concentration, it is possible only when the model parameters of calcium carbonate flux are set appropriately.","[Oka, Akira; Kato, Seiya; Hasumi, Hiroyasu] Univ Tokyo, Ctr Climate Syst Res, Kashiwa, Chiba 2778568, Japan",University of Tokyo,"Oka, A (corresponding author), Univ Tokyo, Ctr Climate Syst Res, 5-1-5 Kashiwanoha, Kashiwa, Chiba 2778568, Japan.",akira@ccsr.u-tokyo.ac.jp,,,,,,,36,25,26,0,5,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",0886-6236,1944-9224,,GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEM CY,Glob.

Surface albedo retrievals have commonly been designed separately for each different spaceborne optical imager. Here, we introduce a novel type of processing framework that combines the data from two polar-orbiting optical imager families, the Advanced Very High-Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The goal of the paper is to demonstrate that multisensor albedo retrievals can provide a significant reduction in the sampling time required for a robust and comprehensive surface albedo retrieval, without a major degradation in retrieval accuracy, as compared to state-of-the-art single-sensor retrievals. We evaluated the multisensor retrievals against reference in situ albedo measurements and compare them with existing datasets. The results show that global land surface albedo retrievals with a sampling period of 10 days can offer near-complete spatial coverage, with a retrieval bias mostly comparable to existing single sensor datasets, except for bright surfaces (deserts and snow) where the retrieval framework shows degraded performance because of atmospheric correction design compromises. A level difference is found between the single sensor datasets and the demonstrator developed here, pointing towards a need for further work in the atmospheric correction, particularly over bright surfaces, and inter-sensor radiance homogenization. The introduced framework is expandable to include other sensors in the future.","[Riihela, Aku; Manninen, Terhikki] Finnish Meteorol Inst, Erik Palmenin Aukio 1, FI-00560 Helsinki, Finland; [Key, Jeffrey] NOAA, 1225 West Dayton St, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Sun, Qingsong; Schaaf, Crystal] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Environm, Boston, MA 02125 USA; [Sutterlin, Melanie] Univ Bern, Inst Geog, Hallerstr 12, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Lattanzio, Alessio] EUMETSAT, Eumetsat Allee 1, D-64295 Darmstadt, Germany",Finnish Meteorological Institute; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Boston; University of Bern; European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites,"Riihela, A (corresponding author), Finnish Meteorol Inst, Erik Palmenin Aukio 1, FI-00560 Helsinki, Finland.",aku.riihela@fmi.fi; Terhikki.manninen@fmi.fi; jeff.key@noaa.gov; qingsong.sun@umb.edu; Melanie.suetterlin@giub.unibe.ch; alessio.lattanzio@eumetsat.int; crystal.schaaf@umb.edu,"Key, Jeffrey R./AAB-7248-2020; Riihelä, Aku/D-2799-2013; Riihelä, Aku/R-1750-2019; Sun, Qingsong/I-9040-2016","Riihelä, Aku/0000-0001-6581-8792; Riihelä, Aku/0000-0001-6581-8792; Sun, Qingsong/0000-0002-7710-2123; /0000-0001-6109-3050; Lattanzio, Alessio/0000-0003-1730-8450",Satellite Application Facility on Climate Monitoring (CM SAF); Academy of Finland [287399]; NASA [NNX14AI73G],Satellite Application Facility on Climate Monitoring (CM SAF); Academy of Finland(Academy of Finland); NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)),"The work of AR has been financially supported by the Satellite Application Facility on Climate Monitoring (CM SAF), and by the Academy of Finland, decision 287399.

Seasonal periods of Harbin from 2014 to 2018 were defined using the difference in seasonal time division and duration characteristics by the method of climate temperature division, and the beginning time of each season in 2019 was deduced. Meanwhile, according to the NCS color value data of each species in different seasons and the length of each season, the seasonal color matching results of each landscape unit case were established. The results of seasonal color matching of each landscape unit case were evaluated by weighted method. The results showed that the richer the NCS color value of plant species ornamental traits in plant landscape, the more the color seasonal encounter of ornamental traits and the longer the duration, the better the matching results of plant seasonal color.

A 30-year hindcast of the climatic suitability for malaria transmission in India is presented, using meteorological variables from a state of the art seasonal forecast model to drive a process-based, dynamic disease model. Methods: The spatial distribution and seasonal cycles of temperature and precipitation from the forecast model are compared to three observationally-based meteorological datasets. These time series are then used to drive the disease model, producing a simulated forecast of malaria and three synthetic malaria time series that are qualitatively compared to contemporary and pre-intervention malaria estimates. The area under the Relative Operator Characteristic (ROC) curve is calculated as a quantitative metric of forecast skill, comparing the forecast to the meteorologically-driven synthetic malaria time series. Results and discussion: The forecast shows probabilistic skill in predicting the spatial distribution of Plasmodium falciparum incidence when compared to the simulated meteorologically-driven malaria time series, particularly where modelled incidence shows high seasonal and interannual variability such as in Orissa, West Bengal, and Jharkhand (North-east India), and Gujarat, Rajastan, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra (North-west India). Focusing on these two regions, the malaria forecast is able to distinguish between years of high, above average and low malaria incidence in the peak malaria transmission seasons, with more than 70% sensitivity and a statistically significant area under the ROC curve. These results are encouraging given that the three month forecast lead time used is well in excess of the target for early warning systems adopted by the World Health Organization. This approach could form the basis of an operational system to identify the probability of regional malaria epidemics, allowing advanced and targeted allocation of resources for combatting malaria in India.","[Lauderdale, Jonathan M.] MIT, Dept Earth Atmospher & Planetary Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Caminade, Cyril; Heath, Andrew E.; Jones, Anne E.; Morse, Andrew P.] Univ Liverpool, Sch Environm Sci, Liverpool L69 7ZT, Merseyside, England; [Caminade, Cyril] Univ Liverpool, Inst Infect & Global Hlth, Liverpool L69 7BE, Merseyside, England; [MacLeod, David A.] Univ Oxford, Dept Phys, Oxford OX1 3PU, England; [Gouda, Krushna C.; Goswami, Prashant] CSIR, Paradigm Inst 4, Bangalore 560037, Karnataka, India; [Murty, Upadhyayula Suryanarayana; Mutheneni, Srinivasa R.] Indian Inst Chem Technol, CSIR, Hyderabad 500607, Andhra Pradesh, India; [Morse, Andrew P.] Natl Inst Hlth Res, Hlth Protect Res Unit Emerging & Zoonot Infect, Liverpool L69 7BE, Merseyside, England",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); University of Liverpool; University of Liverpool; University of Oxford; Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India; CSIR - Fourth Paradigm Institute (CSIR 4PI); Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India; CSIR - Indian Institute of Chemical Technology (IICT); University of Liverpool,"Lauderdale, JM (corresponding author), MIT, Dept Earth Atmospher & Planetary Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",jml1@mit.edu,"GOUDA, KRUSHNA CHANDRA/G-4863-2012; Mutheneni, Srinivasa Rao/AAI-2262-2020; Lauderdale, Jonathan/AAU-5792-2020","GOUDA, KRUSHNA CHANDRA/0000-0003-2322-021X; MacLeod, Dave/0000-0001-5504-6450; Morse, Andrew/0000-0002-0413-2065; Lauderdale, Jonathan/0000-0002-2993-7484; Caminade, Cyril/0000-0002-3846-7082; Mutheneni, Srinivasa Rao/0000-0003-3263-3905",British Council UK India Education and Research Initiative (UKIERI) [UKUTP201100270]; EU - European Commission [243964],British Council UK India Education and Research Initiative (UKIERI); EU - European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre),This study was funded by the British Council UK India Education and Research Initiative (UKIERI) Indraas project (Integrating disease prediction with weather and climate models seamlessly) reference UKUTP201100270.

The article analyzes the historical and geographical data of the Khorezm region in the work of Abu al-Fida Taqwim al-Buldan during the Middle Ages, which are known from written sources. The article is also based on the materials of archaeological research and information from the works of other scientists of the Abu al-Fida era.A comprehensive study of the geography and social characteristics of the cities of the Khorezm region confirms information about a high civilization that arose in Central Asia at the junction of sedentary and nomadic traditions, its urban culture influenced the formation of modern states. The author, referring to the written sources of medieval researchers, describes the architecture of cities, geographical coordinates, nature and climate, arts and crafts, science and education, peculiarities of the population, etc. The study examined the main cities of Khorezm, such as: Kurkandzh, Dzhurdzhaniya, Kas, Zamakhshar, Khazarosb, Dar'an, Farabr and others. The article also analyzes such issues as the methods of using water resources and the development of the irrigation system in the Middle Ages Khorezm. Khorezm, whose territory since ancient times was formed at the crossroads of various historical events. He played a huge role in the formation of the Central Asian state as a whole. It is clear that the urban culture of medieval Khorezm influenced the modern traditions of the region. The work of Abul-Fida Takim al-Buldan is an important scientific heritage for the formation of the historical physical geography, economic and social geography of Khorezm. At the time of Abul-Fida, Khorezm was a rich and cultural region with developed agriculture, crafts and trade. The cities of the Khorezm region were formed along the rivers. Because they were important to the economy and life. Outside the cities, fortifications were built from high walls. Trade relations with neighboring countries have developed. Khorezm played an important role in the economy of Maurennahr, through which one of the northern branches of the Great Silk Road passed. The heritage of Khorezm architecture as a whole is known for its unique architectural monuments in the history of Central Asia, as well as for the great contribution of Khorezm architects to the construction and fine arts of Central Asia, which subsequently preserved and contributed to the development of architecture. Archaeological excavations confirm that the Khorezmians were engaged not only in trade and agriculture, but also in science. The Khorezmians mastered astronomy and mathematics. They invented angle measuring devices and used them in scientific research. Astronomy and many natural sciences developed in Ancient Khorezm.","[Zhuzbayeva, U. D.; Batyrkhan, B.

Here, we test the hypothesis that one driver of this cross-modal correspondence is the physical environment we live in. We focus on a prime example - the association of yellow with joy, - which conceivably arises because yellow is reminiscent of life-sustaining sunshine and pleasant weather. If so, this association should be especially strong in countries where sunny weather is a rare occurrence. We analysed yellow-joy associations of 6625 participants from 55 countries to investigate how yellow-joy associations varied geographically, climatologically, and seasonally. We assessed the distance to the equator, sunshine, precipitation, and daytime hours. Consistent with our hypotheses, participants who live further away from the equator and in rainier countries are more likely to associate yellow with joy. We did not find associations with seasonal variations. Our findings support a role for the physical environment in shaping the affective meaning of colour.","[Jonauskaite, Domicele; Abu-Akel, Ahmad; Antonietti, Jean-Philippe; Atitsogbe, Kokou Amenyona; Ciobanu, Teofil; Dael, Nele; Pouyan, Niloufar; Mohr, Christine] Univ Lausanne, Inst Psychol, Batiment Geopolis, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Abdel-Khalek, Ahmed M.; Hasan, Aya Ahmed] Alexandria Univ, Fac Arts, Dept Psychol, Alexandria, Egypt; [Al-Rasheed, Abdulrahman Saud] Univ King Saud, Dept Psychol, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; [Asgeirsson, Arni Gunnar] Univ Akureyri, Dept Psychol, Akureyri, Iceland; [Asgeirsson, Arni Gunnar] Aalborg Univ, Ctr Cognit Neurosci, Aalborg, Denmark; [Barma, Marodegueba] Univ Lome, Dept Appl Psychol, Lome, Togo; [Barratt, Daniel] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Management Soc & Commun, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Bogushevskaya, Victoria] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Dept Linguist Sci & Foreign Literatures, Brescia, Italy; [Meziane, Maliha Khadidja Bouayed] Natl Polytech Sch, Preparatory Sch, Algiers, Algeria; [Chamseddine, Amer] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Sch Comp & Commun Sci, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Charernboom, Thammanard] Thammasat Univ, Fac Med, Dept Clin Epidemiol, Pathum Thani, Thailand; [Charernboom, Thammanard] Thammasat Univ, Fac Med, Dept Psychiat, Pathum Thani, Thailand; [Chkonia, Eka] Tbilisi State Med Univ, Dept Psychiat, Tbilisi, Georgia; [Corona, Violeta] Univ Panamer, Business Management Dept, Zapopan, Mexico; [Corona, Violeta] Univ Politecn Valencia, Business Management Dept, Valencia, Spain; [Creed, Allison] Univ Melbourne, Fac Arts, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Dael, Nele] Univ Lausanne, Dept Org Behav, HEC Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Daouk, Hassan] Mar Elias St,Dar Elbayda Bldg, Bayrut, Lebanon; [Dimitrova, Nevena] Univ Appl Sci Social Work & Hlth Lausanne, Dept Social Work, HES SO, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Doorenbos, Cornelis B.] Univ Fribourg, Dept Phys, Fribourg, Switzerland; [Fomins, Sergejs] Univ Latvia, Dept Optometry & Vis Sci, Riga, Latvia; [Fonseca-Pedrero, Eduardo; Perez-Albeniz, Alicia] Univ La Rioja, Dept Educ Sci, Logrono, Spain; [Gaspar, Augusta] Catholic Univ Portugal, Sch Human Sci, Dept Psychol, Lisbon, Portugal; [Gaspar, Augusta] Catolica Res Ctr Psychol Family & Social Wellbein, Lisbon, Portugal; [Gaspar, Augusta] CIS IUL, Ctr Invest & Intervencao Social, Lisbon, Portugal; [Gizdic, Alena] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Clin & Hlth Psychol, Barcelona, Spain; [Griber, Yulia A.] Smolensk State Univ, Dept Sociol & Philosophy, Smolensk, Russia; [Grimshaw, Gina M.] Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Psychol, Wellington, New Zealand; [Havelka, Jelena] Univ Leeds, Sch Psychol, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Hirnstein, Marco; Marquardt, Lynn] Univ Bergen, Dept Biol & Med Psychol, Bergen, Norway; [Karlsson, Bodil S.

A concept for a new typology was developed by Mathias Harang in collaboration, as an entry to an open international ideas competition in 2007. A typical Norwegian valley was twisted to an urban melting pot for 5000 people, with sustainable potentials. The project was called the Village Building. It confronted the sometimes superficial environmental debate, by rearranging known built parameters and challenging low and widespread built fabric in the countryside. Connections between settlement patterns, building form and the use of resources are essential in the research on the Village Building, where the aim is to gain more knowledge about this development strategy, and to see if and to what degree this way of thinking could work. The project is investigated in a Norwegian context, but might be applicable to different areas and climates around the world. One of the investigations executed in the research involves a comparison of the compact strategy of the Village Building to the scattered settlement pattern of the Norwegian municipality of Hol, with about the same population. Sustainable development is used analytically through the tripartite understanding of the term into ecological, social and economical sustainability. Explicitly defined presuppositions of each category in relation to the Village Building are tested against the municipality of Hol.","[Sorlie, Britt] NTNU, Dept Architectural Design Hist & Technol, Fac Architecture & Fine Art, Trondheim, Norway",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Sorlie, B (corresponding author), NTNU, Dept Architectural Design Hist & Technol, Fac Architecture & Fine Art, Trondheim, Norway.",,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,1,CSAAR PRESS-CENTER STUDY ARCHITECTURE ARAB REGION,AMMAN,"PO BOX 3781, AMMAN, 11821, JORDAN",,,978-9957-8602-8-8,,,,2010,,,,,139,152,,,,,,14,Architecture; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Urban Studies,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Architecture; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Urban Studies,BH0DW,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000394684200010,View Full Record in Web of Science

The EOS TERRA spacecraft's launch provided a major contribution to the NASA Mission to Planet Earth program while incorporating many state of the art electrical power system technologies to achieve its mission goals. The EOS TERRA spacecraft was designed around five state-of-the-art scientific instrument packages designed to monitor key parameters associated with the earth's climate. The development focus of the TERRA electrical power system (EPS) resulted from a need for high power distribution to the EOS TERRA spacecraft subsystems and instruments and minimizing mass and parasitic losses. Also important as a design goal of the EPS was maintaining tight regulation on voltage and achieving low conducted bus noise characteristics. This paper outlines the major requirements for the EPS as well as the resulting hardware implementation approach adopted to meet the demands of the EOS TERRA low earth orbit mission. The selected orbit, based on scientific needs, to achieve the EOS TERRA mission goals is a sun-synchronous circular 98.2-degree inclination Low Earth Orbit (LEO) with a near circular average altitude of 705 kilometers. The nominal spacecraft orbit is approximately 99 minutes with an average eclipse period of about 34 minutes. The scientific goal of the selected orbit is to maintain a repeated 10:30 a.m. +/- 15 minute descending equatorial crossing which provides a fairly clear view of the earth's surface and relatively low cloud interference for the instrument observation measurements. The major EOS TERRA EPS design requirements are single fault tolerant, average orbit power delivery of 2,530 watts with a defined minimum lifetime of five years (EOL). To meet these mission requirements, while minimizing mass and parasitic power losses, the EOS TERRA project relies on 36, 096 high efficiency Gallium Arsenide (GaAs) on Germanium solar cells adhered to a deployable flexible solar array designed to provide over 5,000 watts of power at EOL. To meet the eclipse power demands of the spacecraft, EOS TERRA selected an application of two 54-cell series connected Individual Pressure Vessel (IPV) Nickel-Hydrogen (NiH2) 50 Ampere-Hour batteries. All of the spacecraft observatory electrical power is controlled via the TERRA Power Distribution Unit (PDU) which is designed to provide main bus regulation of 120 Vdc +/-4% at all load interfaces through the implementation of majority voter control of both the spacecraft's solar array sequential shunt unit (SSU) and the two battery bi-directional charge and discharge regulators.","NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Power Syst Branch, Elect Syst Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA",National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center,"Keys, DJ (corresponding author), NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Power Syst Branch, Elect Syst Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA.",,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,0,AMER INST AERONAUTICS & ASTRONAUTICS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, STE 500, RESTON, VA 20191-4344 USA",,,1-56347-375-5,,,,2000,,,,,197,206,,,,,,10,"Engineering, Aerospace",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Engineering,BQ77B,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000089466900028,View Full Record in Web of Science

Ultrafine particles, often minor contributors to atmospheric particulate mass, typically dominate aerosol particle number concentrations. We simulated the response of particle number concentrations over Europe to recent estimates of future emission reductions of aerosol particles and their precursors. We used the chemical transport model PMCAMx-UF, with novel updates including state-of-the-art descriptions of ammonia and dimethylamine new particle formation (NPF) pathways and the condensation of organic compounds onto particles. These processes had notable impacts on atmospheric particle number concentrations. All three emission scenarios (current legislation, optimized emissions, and maximum technically feasible reductions) resulted in substantial (10-50%) decreases in median particle number concentrations over Europe. Consistent reductions were predicted in Central Europe, while Northern Europe exhibited smaller reductions or even increased concentrations. Motivated by the improved NPF descriptions for ammonia and methylamines, we placed special focus on the potential to improve air quality by reducing agricultural emissions,, which are a major source of these species. Agricultural emission controls showed promise in reducing ultrafine particle number concentrations, although the change is nonlinear with particle size.","[Julin, Jan; Olenius, Tinja; Riipinen, Ilona] Stockholm Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Analyt Chem ACES, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Julin, Jan; Olenius, Tinja; Riipinen, Ilona] Stockholm Univ, Bolin Ctr Climate Res, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Julin, Jan] Univ Eastern Finland, Dept Appl Phys, FI-70211 Kuopio, Finland; [Murphy, Benjamin N.] US EPA, Natl Exposure Res Lab, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA; [Patoulias, David] Univ Patras, Dept Chem Engn, GR-26504 Patras, Greece; [Fountoukis, Christos] Hamad Bin Khalifa Univ, Qatar Fdn, Qatar Environm & Energy Res Inst, POB 5825, Doha, Qatar; [Pandis, Spyros N.] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Pandis, Spyros N.] Fdn Res & Technol, Inst Chem Engn Sci, GR-26504 Patras, Greece",Stockholm University; Stockholm University; University of Eastern Finland; United States Environmental Protection Agency; University of Patras; Qatar Foundation (QF); Hamad Bin Khalifa University-Qatar; Qatar Environment & Energy Research Institute; Carnegie Mellon University; Foundation for Research & Technology - Hellas (FORTH); Institute of Chemical Engineering Sciences (ICE-HT),"Riipinen, I (corresponding author), Stockholm Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Analyt Chem ACES, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.;Riipinen, I (corresponding author), Stockholm Univ, Bolin Ctr Climate Res, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",ilona.riipinen@aces.su.se,"Studies, Center for Atmospheric Particle/AAR-6731-2020; Riipinen, Ilona/ABD-5564-2021; Julin, Jan/P-6931-2015; Olenius, Tinja/GNP-2324-2022; Liu, Yifan/S-6217-2017; Pandis, Spyros/AAW-3089-2021","Julin, Jan/0000-0002-4845-1631; Pandis, Spyros/0000-0001-8085-9795",Swedish research council FORMAS [2015-749]; European Integrated Project PEGASOS [FP7-ENV-2010-265148],Swedish research council FORMAS(Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council Formas); European Integrated Project PEGASOS,The computational resources were provided by the National Supercomputing Centre (NSC).

In addition, aerosol altitude distribution is needed to address complex problems such as the radiative interaction of aerosols in the presence of clouds. With this objective, an extensive, multi-institutional and multi-platform field experiment (ICARB-Integrated Campaign for Aerosols, gases and Radiation Budget) was carried out under the Geosphere Biosphere Programme of the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO-GBP) over continental India and adjoining oceans during March to May 2006. Here, we present airborne LIDAR measurements carried out over the east Coast of the India during the ICARB field campaign. An increase in aerosol extinction (scattering + absorption) was observed from the surface upwards with a maximum around 2 to 4 km. Aerosol extinction at higher atmospheric layers (>2 km) was two to three times larger compared to that of the surface. A large fraction (75-85%) of aerosol column optical depth was contributed by aerosols located above 1 km. The aerosol layer heights (defined in this paper as the height at which the gradient in extinction coefficient changes sign) showed a gradual decrease with an increase in the offshore distance. A large fraction (60-75%) of aerosol was found located above clouds indicating enhanced aerosol absorption above clouds. Our study implies that a detailed statistical evaluation of the temporal frequency and spatial extent of elevated aerosol layers is necessary to assess their significance to the climate. This is feasible using data from space-borne lidars such as CALIPSO, which fly in formation with other satellites like MODIS AQUA and MISR, as part of the A-Train constellation.","[Satheesh, S.

Based on the results of corrosion fatigue tests and meteorological data in Seoul and Halifax, the corrosion fatigue life of lower arm was predicted. The satisfaction of 10-year and 300,000 km warranty was dominated by the climate of automobile driving.

Changes in four characteristics of SSWs are examined in 54 models: the SSW frequency, the seasonal distribution, stratosphere-troposphere coupling, and the persistency of the distorted or displaced polar vortex. The composite results show that none of these four aspects will change robustly. An insignificant (though positive) change in the SSW frequency from historical simulations to RCP45/SSP245 and then to RCP85/SSP585 is consistently projected by CMIP5 and CMIP6 multimodel ensembles in most wintertime months (December-March). This increase in the SSW frequency is most pronounced in mid- (late-) winter in CMIP6 (CMIP5). No shift in the seasonality of SSWs is simulated especially in the CMIP6 future scenarios. Both the reanalysis and CMIP5/6 historical simulations exhibit strong stratosphere-troposphere coupling during SSWs, and the coupling strength is nearly unchanged in the future scenario simulations. The near surface responds immediately after the onset of SSWs in both historical and future scenarios experiments, denoted by the deep downward propagation of zonal-mean easterly anomalies from the stratosphere to the troposphere. On average, the composite circumpolar easterly winds persist for 8 d in the reanalysis and CMIP5/6 historical experiments, which are projected to remain unchanged in both the moderate and strong emissions scenarios, implying the lifecycle of SSWs will not change.","[Rao, Jian] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster, Minist Educ KLME,Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast, Joint Int Res Lab Climate & Environm Change ILCEC, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China; [Rao, Jian; Garfinkel, Chaim, I] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Fredy & Nadine Herrmann Inst Earth Sci, Edmond J Safra Campus, IL-91904 Jerusalem, Israel",Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Hebrew University of Jerusalem,"Rao, J (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster, Minist Educ KLME,Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast, Joint Int Res Lab Climate & Environm Change ILCEC, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China.;Rao, J (corresponding author), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Fredy & Nadine Herrmann Inst Earth Sci, Edmond J Safra Campus, IL-91904 Jerusalem, Israel.",raojian@nuist.edu.cn,"garfinkel, chaim I/AAA-1134-2020; Rao, Jian/O-3392-2019","garfinkel, chaim I/0000-0001-7258-666X; Rao, Jian/0000-0001-5030-0288",National Key R&D Program of China [2016YFA0602104]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41705024]; ISF-NSFC [3259/19]; European Research Council under the European Union [677756],National Key R&D Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); ISF-NSFC; European Research Council under the European Union(European Research Council (ERC)),The authors thank the ESGF (https://esgf-node.llnl.gov/projects/esgf-llnl/) for their freely providing the CMIP5/6 simulations.

This paper presents the development of a durable greenhouse concept that is based on complex energy system integrating fuel cells and solar panels. Approaching this innovative concept encountered a major problem in terms of local implementation of this type of greenhouses because of the difficulty in providing electrical and thermal energy from conventional sources to ensure an optimal climate for plant growing.

Observed inefficiency is primarily a consequence of historical and organizational factors. An exorbitant amount of work on data and service standardization would be required to build more efficient information systems using state of the art technology. Emerging technologies in risk monitoring and management have a potential to speed up the necessary organizational and structural changes. But still, critical factors as having sensor network models available for setting up appropriate info-structure, rapid deployment of monitoring systems (sensors) and quality assured high speed collection of data will challenge our future development and form key measurable success factors in this domain. Model development and its realization are needed along the whole information processing chain, e. g. from the first automated data loggers to state of the art networks, including ad-hoc wireless sensor networks and collective intelligence of SensorWeb; including the plug-and-measure paradigm. Sensors Anywhere (SANY) is a very ambitious FP6 IST Integrated Project dealing with sensor networks for environmental and risk management applications. SANY aims to contribute to joint efforts of the European Commission (EC) and the European Space Agency (ESA) on Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) by improving the interoperability of in-situ sensors and sensor networks and taking up the challenges mentioned above. This means specifically: The SANY architecture and its applied Sensor Network Models shall allow quick and cost-efficient reuse of data and services from currently incompatible sources in future environmental risk management applications across organizational, administrative or regional boarders. In order to overcome these problems we follow the approach to develop and use as many as possible standard based applications. One of the most promising standardization efforts is currently happening within the ongoing Open Geospatial Consortium Sensor Web Enablement initiative (OGC-SWE). The goal of OGC-SWE model is to enable all types of Web and/or Internet-accessible sensors, instruments, and imaging devices to be accessible and, where applicable, controllable via the Web. The vision is to define and approve the standards foundation for plug-and-play Web-based sensor networks. For this purpose, OGC-SWE specifications include a standard model for representing and exchanging observation results (Observations and Measurements) and an information model and encodings that enable discovery and tasking of Web-resident sensors, and exploitation of sensor observations (SensorML). Of special interest for SANY, and therefore beside above mentioned challenges all SWE services, including the underlying models, for retrieving sensor data, for sensor planning tasks as well as for subscribing to specific alert types. Furthermore SANY demonstrates its results along three validation sub projects in the risk management domain (e. g. air pollution risks).","[Schimak, G.; Havlik, D.] Austrian Res Ctr GmbH ARC, A-1220 Vienna, Austria",Austrian Institute of Technology (AIT),"Schimak, G (corresponding author), Austrian Res Ctr GmbH ARC, Donau City Str 1, A-1220 Vienna, Austria.",gerald.schimak@arcs.ac.at,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,8,UNIV WESTERN AUSTRALIA,NEDLANDS,"NEDLANDS, WA, AUSTRALIA",,,978-0-9758400-7-8,,,,2009,,,,,987,987,,,,,,1,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics, Applied; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics,BUQ27,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000290045001005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Yusupov was a descendent of an aristocratic family, whose origins are traced to the elite of the Grand Nogay Horde. The Yusupovs were baptized in the end of the seventeenth century, having served for almost a century in the elite service of the Muscovite Tsardom. In the course of the eighteenth century, as the article shows, the Tatar origin of the family was not mentioned either by the Yusupovs themselves or by outside observers. However, at the beginning of the nineteenth century, a persistent image emerges of Nikolai Yusupov's Oriental (i.e. Tatar) origin. Since then, his identity as a Russian aristocrat becomes particularly intriguing as a subject of inquiry. The article analyzes the role of Yusupov's image in the forging of a new perception of the Russian elite by Europeans and Russians, and the reinvention of his Oriental roots by Nikolai Yusupov. The article situates this case of reinvented tradition in the intellectual climate of the late Enlightenment and early Romanticism; analyzes the representations of the Orient in visual arts, heraldic items, and architecture; and draws conclusions about the culture and languages of self-description of the Russian noble elite. The author discusses the Tatarization and self-Tatarization of Yusupov in the context of the emergence of a new understanding of the division of civilization between Europe and the Orient. The tendency to distance the Orient as the Other took interesting twists in the Russian cultural context. The article traces in details the changes in the outside perception of Yusupov's home in Moscow as an expression of his Tatarness; the interpretations of Yusupov's sexual behavior as oriental; the foreigners' projections of Tatarness as a synonym of barbaric civilization onto Russian nobility in general; and the evolution of the semantics of Tatarness vis-a-vis the developing Russian national ideal. A major portion of the article deconstructs cultural tropes of Yusupov's self-Tatarization and tries to find explanations for his active engagement in the creative rediscovering of his true identity. Here the author discusses the symbolism of Yusupov's coat-of-arms; his artistic imagining of the oriental family genealogy as reflected in the design of his home and the objects of art displayed there; and finally, the symbolic meaning for Yusupov commissioning the portrait of his son in an oriental costume by a Paris painter. Finally, the author proposes his vision of the Yusupov's estate Arkhangel'skoe as a cultural text of his synthetic European, Russian and partly Tatar identity.","[Bolenko, Constantine] Archangelskoe State Museum Estate, Div Rare Books Manuscripts & Photographs, Moscow, Russia",,"Bolenko, C (corresponding author), Archangelskoe State Museum Estate, Div Rare Books Manuscripts & Photographs, Moscow, Russia.",bolenko-liamina@comtv.ru,,,,,,,10,2,2,0,4,REDAKTSIYA ZHURNALA AB IMPERIO,KAZAN,"PO BOX 157, KAZAN, 420015, RUSSIA",2166-4072,2164-9731,,AB IMP,Ab Imp.,,2006,3,,,,161,216,,,,,,56,History,Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;HCI),History,V8L6P,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000421748600009,View Full Record in Web of Science

These hazards are not only potential risks for the effective storage capacity of the reservoir but also threats of the safety of the reservoir's Great Dam. The future changes of CREs' occurrence and intensity are analyzed by using the projection experiments from 20 models attending the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) under three different representative concentration pathways (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5). Spring and fall are focused on, during which CREs are most frequent. Considering a common overestimate of rainy days number in the state-of-the-art models, a new approach is developed to define CREs based on the percentile of rainfall distribution in observations. The approach yields a similar CREs climatology in models to that in observations and thus is used to identify CREs in models. The results based on multiple model ensemble (MME) and model spread comparison suggest a significant increase in spring and an overall decrease in fall in CREs' occurrence under all three scenarios. As for the intensity, it is projected to intensify in both spring and fall. Particularly, the higher the emission scenario, the greater the spring accumulated rainfall amount during a single CRE. These results imply an increasing risk of geological hazards in the TGR in the future.","[Zheng, Yanxin; Li, Shuanglin] China Univ Geosci, Dept Atmospher Sci, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Li, Shuanglin] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Li, Shuanglin] Chinese Acad Sci, Climate Change Res Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Li, Shuanglin] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Earth & Planetary Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Ullah, Kalim] COMSATS Univ Islamabad CUI, Dept Meteorol, Islamabad, Pakistan","China University of Geosciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; COMSATS University Islamabad (CUI)","Li, SL (corresponding author), China Univ Geosci, Dept Atmospher Sci, Wuhan, Peoples R China.;Li, SL (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Li, SL (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Climate Change Res Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Li, SL (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Earth & Planetary Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.",shuanglin.li@mail.iap.ac.cn,"ullah, kalim/I-5228-2015; Li, Shuanglin/D-5695-2013","ullah, kalim/0000-0002-8449-6319; Zheng, Yanxin/0000-0002-1534-7002; Li, Shuanglin/0000-0002-4891-8561","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41421004, 41731177]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"The authors thank two anonymous reviewers for constructive suggestions, which led to a significant improvement of the manuscript.

Integrated assessment models (IAMs) and other macro-economic transition (MET) models typically do not feature detailed financial markets and do not sufficiently consider financing barriers and opportunities for the transition to carbon neutrality. While progress has been made in the representation of financial markets in macro-models since the financial crisis of 2008 the focus has been on financial (in)stability of the financial sector, not its ability to finance investment projects in the energy transition. Hence, a crucial gap remains, preventing macro model-based analysis of financing barriers and policy interventions that may accelerate the energy transition. In this article we review how state-of-the-art macro-economic models consider the financial sector. From this review we identify what elements are still missing to adequately model the financial dynamics and challenges for the energy transition specifically. Based on a discussion of relevant parts of the finance literature, we then propose four steps to improve the representation of finance in global IAMs and MET models more generally.","[Sanders, Mark; Serebriakova, Alexandra; Polzin, Friedemann] Univ Utrecht, Sustainable Finance Lab, Sch Econ, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Sanders, Mark] Maastricht Univ, Sch Business & Econ, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Fragkos, Panagiotis] E3 Modelling, Athens, Greece; [Egli, Florian] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Energy & Technol Policy Grp, Zurich, Switzerland; [Egli, Florian] UCL, Inst Innovat & Publ Purpose, London, England; [Steffen, Bjarne] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Sci Technol & Policy, Zurich, Switzerland; [Steffen, Bjarne] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Climate Finance Policy Grp, Zurich, Switzerland; [Steffen, Bjarne] MIT, Ctr Energy & Environm Policy Res, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Utrecht University; Maastricht University; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; University of London; University College London; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Polzin, F (corresponding author), Univ Utrecht, Sustainable Finance Lab, Sch Econ, Utrecht, Netherlands.",f.h.j.polzin@uu.nl,"郭, 青霞/GZH-2618-2022","Steffen, Bjarne/0000-0003-2219-1402; Egli, Florian/0000-0001-8617-5175; Polzin, Friedemann/0000-0002-9768-8694; Fragkos, Panagiotis/0000-0003-3596-0661; Sanders, Mark/0000-0003-4901-3921","European Research Council [730403, 821124, 948220]",European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)European Commission),"The author team is grateful for financial support of the H2020 research projects INNOPATHS (Grant Agreement No. 730403), NAVIGATE (Grant Agreement No. 821124), and GREENFIN (European Research Council, Grant Agreement No. 948220).

However, in Asia, and China in particular, these trees still grow in natural habitats and rarely used for landscaping purposes. In this study, we examined differences in the ecological niches of two hornbeam species Carpinus viminea and C. londoniana, which are widely distributed in China and neighboring countries. On the basis of actual geographical coordinates, we used Maxent software to simulate distribution ranges of these two trees according to current suitable areas and used these data to predict their potential distributions in response to future climate change.

Stakeholder participation in the adoption of this concept will be important, and hence effective communication will be crucial. This study aimed to determine how urban metabolism has been communicated and interpreted, with attention to water. The approach included (i) literature review, (ii) structured international interviews and (iii) thematic analysis. We demonstrate how diverse language, metaphors, methods, visual imagery, data and information have been used to communicate this complex topic. Maps, Sankey diagrams, concept figures, spider diagrams, pictorial flow diagrams, art, and animation have all been used. We observe barriers to communication in order to understand the communication techniques which may be effective, and clarify issues relating to awareness and target audiences. We include a discussion of the themes that emerged from the research that are relevant for integrated water planning and the power of visual imagery. Inconsistent language is influenced by widely different overarching metaphors which range from 'organism' to 'ecosystem' metabolism. Fragmented data are a major gap for shared understanding.

Our research explored the perceived self-efficacy developed in an Australian University of the Third Age poetry class. We gathered data from one class session through observation, a focus group and paired interviews. Transcribed data identified participants' voices, and common themes were noted. We use Bandura's idea of perceived self-efficacy, through examining mastery experiences, modelling, social persuasion and a positive learning climate to understand the data. These sources of self-efficacy were pivotal for participants' positive self-efficacy. We offer this example of how older people can achieve mastery in a new field of creative endeavour at a time in their life-course often positioned as diminishing.

Current theory offers two possible mechanisms to account the for ENSO synchronization: frequency locking of ENSO to periodic forcing by the annual cycle, or the effect of the seasonally varying background state of the equatorial Pacific on ENSO's coupled stability. Using a parametric recharge oscillator (PRO) model of ENSO, the authors test which of these scenarios provides a better explanation of the observed ENSO synchronization. Analytical solutions of the PRO model show that the annual modulation of the growth rate parameter results directly in ENSO's seasonal variance, amplitude modulation, and 2:1 phase synchronization to the annual cycle. The solutions are shown to be applicable to the long-term behavior of the damped model excited by stochastic noise, which produces synchronization characteristics that agree with the observations and can account for the variety of ENSO synchronization behavior in state-of-the-art coupled general circulation models. The model also predicts spectral peaks at combination tones between ENSO and the annual cycle that exist in the observations and many coupled models. In contrast, the nonlinear frequency entrainment scenario predicts the existence of a spectral peak at the biennial frequency corresponding to the observed 2:1 phase synchronization. Such a peak does not exist in the observed ENSO spectrum. Hence, it can be concluded that the seasonal modulation of the coupled stability is responsible for the synchronization of ENSO events to the annual cycle.","[Stein, Karl] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Oceanog, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci & Technol, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Timmermann, Axel; Schneider, Niklas] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Int Pacific Res Ctr, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci & Technol, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Jin, Fei-Fei; Stuecker, Malte F.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Meteorol, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci & Technol, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA",University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa,"Stein, K (corresponding author), Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Oceanog, 1000 Pope Rd, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",kstein@hawaii.edu,"Stuecker, Malte Fabian/H-6304-2011; Schneider, Niklas/AAL-4773-2021; Timmermann, Axel/F-4977-2011; Timmermann, Axel/Y-2799-2019","Stuecker, Malte Fabian/0000-0001-8355-0662; Timmermann, Axel/0000-0003-0657-2969; Timmermann, Axel/0000-0003-0657-2969; Stein, Karl/0000-0002-2432-1867","Office of Science (BER), U.S. Department of Energy [DE-FG02-04ER63862, DE-FG02-07ER64469]; Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC) at the International Pacific Research Center; NASA [NNX07AG53G]; NOAA [NA17RJ1230]; Div Atmospheric & Geospace Sciences [1406601] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Office of Science (BER), U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC) at the International Pacific Research Center; NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); Div Atmospheric & Geospace Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO))","This research was supported by the Office of Science (BER), U.S. Department of Energy, Grants DE-FG02-04ER63862 and DE-FG02-07ER64469.

An important co-benefit would be the sequestration of carbon from atmospheric CO(2). Such a positive effect has been suggested based on data from field experiments though many studies were not designed to address the issue of carbon sequestration. The aim of our study was to examine published data in order to identify possible flaws such as missing a proper baseline, carbon mass measurements, or lack of a clear distinction between conventional and organic farming practices, thereby attributing effects of specific practices to organic farming, which are not uniquely organic. A total of 68 data sets were analyzed from 32 peer-reviewed publications aiming to compare conventional with organic farming. The analysis revealed that after conversion, soil C content (SOC) in organic systems increased annually by 2.2% on average, whereas in conventional systems SOC did not change significantly. The majority of publications reported SOC concentrations rather than amounts thus neglecting possible changes in soil bulk density. 34 out of 68 data sets missed a true control with well-defined starting conditions. In 37 out of 50 cases, the amount of organic fertilizer in the organic system exceeded that applied in the compared conventional system, and in half of the cases crop rotations differed between systems. In the few studies where crop rotation and organic fertilization were comparable in both systems no consistent difference in SOC was found. From this data analysis, we conclude that the claim for beneficial effects of organic farming on SOC is premature and that reported advantages of organic farming for SOC are largely determined by higher and often disproportionate application of organic fertilizer compared to conventional farming.","[Leifeld, Jens; Fuhrer, Juerg] Agroscope Reckenholz Tanikon Res Stn ART, Air Pollut Climate Grp, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Research Station Agroscope; Swiss Federal Research Station for Agroecology & Agriculture,"Leifeld, J (corresponding author), Agroscope Reckenholz Tanikon Res Stn ART, Air Pollut Climate Grp, Reckenholzstr 191, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland.",jens.leifeld@art.admin.ch; juerg.fuhrer@art.admin.ch,"Leifeld, Jens/A-3298-2014; Leifeld, Jens/GYR-0349-2022","Leifeld, Jens/0000-0002-7245-9852; Leifeld, Jens/0000-0002-7245-9852",,,,,61,91,93,8,106,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0044-7447,,,AMBIO,Ambio,DEC,2010,8,,,,585,599,,10.1007/s13280-010-0082-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13280-010-0082-8,,,15,"Engineering, Environmental; Environmental Sciences",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,671KF,21141778,Green Published,,,12/21/22,WOS:000283502300006,View Full Record in Web of Science

In particular, LS and EQM are applied to correct the high-resolution statistically downscaled dataset, NEX-GDDP, which comprises 21 state-of-the-art general circulation models (GCMs) from the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 (CMIP5). Raw and bias-corrected NEX-GDDP simulations are used to force the (previously calibrated and validated) HBV-light hydrological model to generate long-term (up to 2100) streamflow projections over the catchment.

Nevertheless, the application of LS and EQM solves these problems, yielding much more realistic and plausible streamflow projections for the XXI century.","[Usman, Muhammad; Ahmad, Burhan] Pakistan Meteorol Dept, Res & Dev Div, Pitras Bukhari Rd H-8-2, Islamabad 44000, Pakistan; [Manzanas, Rodrigo] Univ Cantabria, Dept Matemat Aplicada & Ciencias Computac MACC, Santander 39005, Spain; [Manzanas, Rodrigo] Univ Cantabria, CSIC, Unidad Asociada, Grp Meteorol & Computac, Santander 39005, Spain; [Ndehedehe, Christopher E.] Griffith Univ, Australian Rivers Inst, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia; [Ndehedehe, Christopher E.] Griffith Univ, Griffith Sch Environm & Sci, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia; [Adeyeri, Oluwafemi E.] City Univ Hong Kong, Guy Carpenter Asia Pacific Climate Impact Ctr, Sch Energy & Environm, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Dudzai, Cornelius] Univ Wollongong, Sch Hlth & Soc, Wollongong, NSW 2500, Australia",Universidad de Cantabria; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); Universidad de Cantabria; Griffith University; Griffith University; City University of Hong Kong; University of Wollongong,"Ndehedehe, CE (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Australian Rivers Inst, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia.;Ndehedehe, CE (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Griffith Sch Environm & Sci, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia.",c.ndehedehe@griffith.edu.au,"; Adeyeri, Oluwafemi/M-4924-2017","Ndehedehe, Christopher E./0000-0003-1906-9764; Manzanas, Rodrigo/0000-0002-0001-3448; Adeyeri, Oluwafemi/0000-0002-9735-0677",,,,,63,0,0,0,0,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2306-5338,,HYDROLOGY-BASEL,Hydrology,NOV,2022,11,,,,,,188,10.3390/hydrology9110188,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/hydrology9110188,,,17,Water Resources,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Water Resources,6B4MG,,"Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000881308300001,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Boleslawska-Lewandowska, B",,,,"Boleslawska-Lewandowska, Beata",,,Between Emotion and Intellect. On the Musical Language of Andrzej Panufnik (1914-1991),MUSICOLOGY TODAY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Andrzej Panufnik's (1914-1991) key objective as a composer was to achieve a balance between emotion and intellect. The composer very often emphasised the role of the relation between these two elements in his works. This topic is the leitmotiv of texts about his own music left behind by the composer. From those texts, it is clearly evident that symmetry (and in later years also geometry) played a central role in the composer's formal concepts. The impulse for the study of the possibility of using geometric shapes for the construction of musical forms came from his 1972 composition for the BBC television entitled Triangles for three flutes and three cellos. The geometricisation of the formal structures of Panufnik's works (frequently represented by means of sophisticated diagrams included in the scores) was correlated with a systematic reduction of musical language, based from 1968 on the three-note intervallic cell of E-F-B. In the course of the composition, this unit was submitted to a succession of symmetrical processes, such as transpositions and mirror reflections, superimposed on one another both on the melodic and harmonic levels, which was responsible for the specific sound climate of Panufnik's music. The fullest realisation of the composer's systematic thinking based on the principles of geometry can be found in his Symphony No. 5 -Sinfonia di Sfere (1974), in which every element was submitted to the principles of geometric symmetry represented in a diagram based on the perfect geometric figure of a circle. What is particularly important, this prominent constructivist current in Panufnik's works always coexisted, as the composer himself claimed, with powerful emotional expression in his music. Did he manage to achieve the intended ideal balance between emotion and intellect in his music? Everyone can judge by themselves. This paper discusses the principal qualities of Andrzej Panufnik's musical language.","[Boleslawska-Lewandowska, Beata] Inst Art Polish Acad Sci, Warsaw, Poland",,"Boleslawska-Lewandowska, B (corresponding author), Inst Art Polish Acad Sci, Warsaw, Poland.",bboleslawska@wp.pl,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,1,DE GRUYTER POLAND SP ZOO,WARSAW,"BOGUMILA ZUGA 32A STR., 01-811 WARSAW, POLAND",1734-1663,2353-5733,,MUSICOL TODAY,Musicol.

By assuming that vegetation optimises its root zone storage capacity to bridge critical dry periods, we were able to use state-of-the-art satellite-based evaporation data computed with independent energy balance equations to derive gridded root zone storage capacity at global scale. This approach does not require soil or vegetation information, is model independent, and is in principle scale independent. In contrast to a traditional look-up table approach, our method captures the variability in root zone storage capacity within land cover types, including in rainforests where direct measurements of root depths otherwise are scarce. Implementing the estimated root zone storage capacity in the global hydrological model STEAM (Simple Terrestrial Evaporation to Atmosphere Model) improved evaporation simulation overall, and in particular during the least evaporating months in sub-humid to humid regions with moderate to high seasonality. Our results suggest that several forest types are able to create a large storage to buffer for severe droughts (with a very long return period), in contrast to, for example, savannahs and woody savannahs (medium length return period), as well as grasslands, shrublands, and croplands (very short return period). The presented method to estimate root zone storage capacity eliminates the need for poor resolution soil and rooting depth data that form a limitation for achieving progress in the global land surface modelling community.","[Wang-Erlandsson, Lan; Keys, Patrick W.; Gordon, Line J.] Stockholm Univ, Stockholm Resilience Ctr, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Wang-Erlandsson, Lan; Bastiaanssen, Wim G.

Unlike other fuel treatments that remove this biomass, masticated biomass often remains on site, which increases total fuel loading and causes concern over how the masticated particles may burn if exposed to prescribed fire or wildfire. Central to the question of how these particles may burn is how the time since mastication affects the decomposition of the wood particles comprising the fuels. We conducted controlled laboratory experiments to investigate how the particles changed chemically over the time since they were masticated and how those chemical changes affected fire behavior characteristics. The objectives were (1) to quantify the chemical differences of masticated materials from different climates and different decomposition stages, (2) determine whether chemical changes occurred similarly in all fuel particles, and (3) describe the fire behavior characteristics exhibited by these fuels. Masticated materials came from mixed-conifer forests at fifteen different sites throughout the Rocky Mountains. Paired stands from these sites were of similar vegetation and forest stage. They represented wet and dry climates, different stages of wood decomposition, and variable piece sizes based on the type of machine used to masticate the biomass. Time since mastication and piece size affected the rate of chemical changes in the masticated particles. Fragmented particles had less heat value, N, and C than intact particles from the same site. C decreased and N increased with time since treatment. In most cases, cellulose decreased as decomposition occurred. Age of the particles, tree species, climate, and quantity of fuel load were all important factors influencing chemical change and burn characteristics. In the smoldering experiments, age was not a significant factor but soil substrate was. Soil surface temperatures in the smoldering tests differed significantly between dry sand and dry duff, and most of the smoldering burns in dry duff easily reached temperatures and durations at the surface between the fuel and the soil that would kill soil plants, microbes, and fauna and severely affect soil ecology. When planning prescribed burns in these treatments, managers need to consider not only the moisture of the fuels, air temperature, and wind, but also the dryness and type of soil, the amount of decomposition (time since mastication) of the fuel particles, fuel depths, fuel loads, and the spatial distribution of the fuel loads left by the masticator.","[Sikkink, Pamela G.; Jain, Theresa B.] US Forest Serv, USDA, Rocky Mt Res Stn, Forestry Sci Lab, 1221 South Main St, Moscow, ID 83843 USA; [Reardon, James; Heinsch, Faith Ann; Keane, Robert E.; Butler, Bret] US Forest Serv, USDA, Rocky Mt Res Stn, Fire Sci Lab, 5775 W US Highway 10, Missoula, MT 59808 USA; [Baggett, L.

However, a well-established response is a late-winter (January-March) signal in sea level pressure (SLP) consisting of a dipolar pattern that resembles the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Clarifying the relationship between this NAO-like ENSO signal and the actual NAO is the focus of this study. The ENSO-NAE teleconnection and NAO signature are diagnosed by means of linear regression onto the sea surface temperature (SST) Nino-3.4 index and an EOF-based NAO index, respectively, using long-term reanalysis data (NOAA-20CR, ERA-20CR). While the similarity in SLP is evident, the analysis of anomalous upper-tropospheric geopotential height, zonal wind, and transient-eddy momentum flux, as well as precipitation and meridional eddy heat flux, suggests that there is no dynamical link between the phenomena. The observational results are further confirmed by analyzing two 10-member ensembles of atmosphere-only simulations (using an intermediate-complexity and a state-of-the-art model) with prescribed SSTs over the twentieth century. The SST-forced variability in the Northern Hemisphere is dominated by the extratropical ENSO teleconnection, which provides modest but significant SLP skill in the NAE midlatitudes. The regional internally generated variability, estimated from residuals around the ensemble mean, corresponds to the NAO pattern. It is concluded that distinct dynamics are at play in the ENSO-NAE teleconnection and NAO variability, and caution is advised when interpreting the former in terms of the latter.","[Mezzina, Bianca; Garcia-Serrano, Javier] Barcelona Supercomp Ctr, Barcelona, Spain; [Garcia-Serrano, Javier; Blade, Ileana] Univ Barcelona, Grp Meteorol, Barcelona, Spain; [Kucharski, Fred] Abdus Salam Int Ctr Theoret Phys, Trieste, Italy",Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya; Barcelona Supercomputer Center (BSC-CNS); University of Barcelona; Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP),"Mezzina, B (corresponding author), Barcelona Supercomp Ctr, Barcelona, Spain.",bianca.mezzina@bsc.es,"Blade, Ileana/H-9348-2015; García-Serrano, Javier/I-5058-2015","Blade, Ileana/0000-0003-1842-1711; García-Serrano, Javier/0000-0003-3913-0876; Mezzina, Bianca/0000-0002-1264-815X",Spanish MINECO [CGL2015-68342-R]; Contratos Predoctorales para la Formacion de Doctores programme [BES-2016-076431]; Ramon y Cajal programme [RYC-2016-21181],Spanish MINECO(Spanish Government); Contratos Predoctorales para la Formacion de Doctores programme; Ramon y Cajal programme(Spanish Government),"This work received funding from the Spanish MINECO-funded DANAE project (CGL2015-68342-R).

In this context, particular attention should be given to historical buildings, which represent a large part of the Italian building stock. To improve the energy performance of them, adequate retrofit actions must be applied. Many studies and regulations have focused on identifying the best refurbishment measures. However, the selection of these measures is difficult due to restrictive regulations, which are dictated by the Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities, high retrofit costs, and variable climate zones. Thus, energy renovations in Italian buildings are not simple, and it is very difficult to find generic solutions that can be applied to buildings across the entire territory. In this paper, the authors investigated the most common retrofit solutions used in Italy, focusing in particular on the energy performance of historical building envelopes. First, energy performance analyses were conducted for two typical base cases in four different Italian cities using TRNSYS software, and some common retrofit measures were analysed. In some cases, the results showed Primary Energy saving of 44.6% (sample A) and 56.7% (sample B). Furthermore, these were used to identify different energy and economic impacts associated with the same refurbishment measures in different climatic contexts, highlighting the non-existence of a generic solution suitable for all regions or countries.

Of proportionate consequence, however, are the means by which societies and states act to deter and remove graffiti and how these efforts correspond with other projects to police a population, activism and dissidence, and public discourse. During and after the Gezi Park protests of 2013, Turkish authorities initiated on-the-ground anti-graffiti actions that resulted in a patchy assemblage of institutional beiges, greys, and other nondescript colours obscuring impacted surfaces, vertical and horizontal, throughout graffitied neighbourhoods. Conspicuous in its visual outcomes but otherwise conforming with the remediation standards of many states, officials went beyond these anticipated measures of removal to also suppress selectively reproductions and disseminations of graffiti imagery and verses. Beyond validating the transgressive potency of graffiti itself, these reactions illuminate further ongoing analyses of both the contestation of public places in and the political climate of present-day Turkey. In this study, I examine how, within these contexts, state authorities moved from painting over graffiti to situating purposefully dissident spaces both of expression and collective memory to align with the proscribed spaces of sedition and terrorism. Through this analysis, my study of the ongoing Gezi experience contributes to graffiti geographies as it reveals how regimes of policing can extend far beyond public spaces and defaced walls.","[Evered, Kyle T.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Geog Environm & Spatial Sci, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Michigan State University,"Evered, KT (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Geog Environm & Spatial Sci, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",ktevered@msu.edu,,"Evered, Kyle/0000-0002-1429-1158","Asian Studies Program (ASN); Center for the Advanced Study of International Development (CASID); Center for European, Russian, and Eurasian Studies (CERES); Muslim Studies Program (MSP); Department of Geography, Environment, and Spatial Sciences","Asian Studies Program (ASN); Center for the Advanced Study of International Development (CASID); Center for European, Russian, and Eurasian Studies (CERES); Muslim Studies Program (MSP); Department of Geography, Environment, and Spatial Sciences","Asian Studies Program (ASN); Center for the Advanced Study of International Development (CASID); Center for European, Russian, and Eurasian Studies (CERES); Muslim Studies Program (MSP); and Department of Geography, Environment, and Spatial Sciences",,79,5,5,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-0894,1475-4762,,AREA,Area,MAR,2019,1,,,,155,165,,10.1111/area.12439,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/area.12439,,,11,Geography,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Geography,HK4MS,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000457926700017,View Full Record in Web of Science

Problem complexity increases further by time-coupling constraints, e.g., due to storage systems. To still efficiently solve complex synthesis problems, we propose the rigorous synthesis method RiSES(3). RiSES(3) provides feasible solutions (upper bounds) with known quality (lower bounds). Lower bounds are obtained by two competitive approaches: linear-programming relaxation and relaxation based on time-series aggregation. To obtain a feasible design for the energy system, we use time-series aggregation and subsequently solve an operational problem yielding an upper bound. To tighten the bounds, we iteratively increase the resolution of the time-series aggregation and tighten the relaxation. RiSES(3) is applied to two industrial synthesis problems of energy systems with time-coupling constraints, storage systems and volatile prices. RiSES(3) shows fast convergence, outperforming a commercial state-of-the-art solver. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

We assessed the extent to which mega-herbivore species controlled plant community composition and nutrient cycling, relative to other factors during and after the Late Quaternary extinction event in Britain and Ireland, when two-thirds of the region's mega-herbivore species went extinct. Warmer temperatures, plant-soil and plant-plant interactions, and reduced burning contributed to the expansion of woody plants and declining nitrogen availability in our five study ecosystems. Shrub biomass was consistently one of the strongest predictors of ecosystem change, equalling or exceeding the effects of other biotic and abiotic factors. In contrast, there was relatively little evidence for mega-herbivore control on plant community composition and nitrogen availability. The ability of plants to determine the fate of terrestrial ecosystems during periods of global environmental change may therefore be greater than previously thought.","[Jeffers, Elizabeth S.; Willis, Katherine J.; Bonsall, Michael B.] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Oxford OX1 3PS, England; [Whitehouse, Nicki J.; Barratt, Phil] Univ Plymouth, Sch Geog Earth & Environm Sci, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England; [Lister, Adrian] Nat Hist Museum London, Dept Earth Sci, London SW7 5BD, England; [Plunkett, Gill; Smyth, Emma; Watson, Jenny E.] Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Nat & Built Environm, Belfast BT7 1NN, Antrim, North Ireland; [Lamb, Philip] Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, Oxford OX1 3QY, England; [Dee, Michael W.] Univ Oxford, Res Lab Archaeol & Hist Art, Oxford OX1 3QY, England; [Brooks, Stephen J.] Nat Hist Museum London, Dept Life Sci, London SW7 5BD, England; [Willis, Katherine J.] Royal Bot Gardens, Richmond TW9 3AE, Surrey, England; [Froyd, Cynthia A.] Swansea Univ, Dept Biosci, Swansea SA2 8PP, W Glam, Wales; [Smyth, Emma] Univ Ulster, Sch Geog & Environm Sci, Coleraine BT52 1SA, Londonderry, North Ireland; [Lamb, Philip] Univ East Anglia, Sch Biol Sci, Norwich Res Pk, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Dee, Michael W.] Univ Groningen, Fac Sci & Engn, Ctr Isotope Res, Groningen, Netherlands","University of Oxford; University of Plymouth; Natural History Museum London; Queens University Belfast; University of Oxford; University of Oxford; Natural History Museum London; Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew; Swansea University; Ulster University; University of East Anglia; University of Groningen","Jeffers, ES (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Oxford OX1 3PS, England.",elizabeth.jeffers@zoo.ox.ac.uk,"Froyd, Cynthia/A-8488-2012; Dee, M.W./AAU-3258-2020; Dee, Michael/ABA-4786-2020; Plunkett, Gill/F-3311-2010","Froyd, Cynthia/0000-0001-5291-9156; Dee, Michael/0000-0002-3116-453X; Willis, Katherine/0000-0002-6763-2489; Lister, Adrian/0000-0002-7985-138X; Jeffers, Elizabeth/0000-0001-9679-5909; Whitehouse, Nicola/0000-0002-7044-6492; Plunkett, Gill/0000-0003-1014-3454","NERC [NE/P002536/1, NE/G005982/1] Funding Source: UKRI",NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),,,61,13,13,1,42,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1461-023X,1461-0248,,ECOL LETT,Ecol.

As a consequence, a sound evaluation of system performance should be done through a dynamic test procedure. However, the complexity, the cost, and the time for such type of experimentation are obstacles to the diffusion of this test method. A new whole system test procedure was developed to reduce its potential failure. The test method considers the emulation of system components that cannot be installed in the laboratory, while the selection of short-yet significant test sequence is performed classifying the days of the year with clustering analysis. The procedure was applied to a solar-assisted heat pump system in four different European climates. The seasonal performance figures are extrapolated from the test results and compared with the numerical simulations of the entire heating and cooling system. In all test cases the seasonal performance factors are lower than the simulated ones by approximately 10%. The results obtained with dynamic tests confirm the necessity of their implementation, since they provide useful information to improve the system layout and control. In this way, the manufacturers can introduce more efficient products into the market.","[Menegon, Diego; Soppelsa, Anton; Fedrizzi, Roberto] EURAC Res, Inst Renewable Energy, Viale Druso 1, I-39100 Bolzano, Italy",European Academy of Bozen-Bolzano,"Menegon, D (corresponding author), EURAC Res, Inst Renewable Energy, Viale Druso 1, I-39100 Bolzano, Italy.",diego.menegon@eurac.edu,,"Fedrizzi, Roberto/0000-0001-8222-9965; Menegon, Diego/0000-0001-6267-2281; Soppelsa, Anton/0000-0002-8073-9045",,,,,47,12,12,0,10,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0306-2619,1872-9118,,APPL ENERG,Appl.

This emerging technology poses a potential threat to other aircraft in the airspace, as well as to human beings and other assets on the ground. In order to mitigate these risks, it is vital to know where an automated drone is, where it is allowed to fly and when. Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDI) can be used as a useful tool to standardize automated drone flight data and facilitate the integration of drones into an airspace in a safe manner. This paper proposes an extension to the Infrastructure for Spatial Information in the European Community (INSPIRE).

However, only few studies have examined whether students' perceptions of their teachers' interpersonal behaviour relates to students' subject-related attitudes across different school subjects. In this study, it was investigated to what extent the interpersonal behaviours of secondary school teachers are perceived differently by the students as a function of the school subject being taught and whether such perceptions coincide with students' attitudes towards the subject matter, after controlling for students' achievement. To address these research questions, 2305 adolescent students (47.1% males; M-age = 17.85; SD = 1.09) from grades 9 to 11 and their teachers (N = 42; 38.1% males; mean years of teaching = 14.2; SD = 1.25) from one urban high school in Turkey were surveyed. The students completed the Questionnaire on Teacher Interaction and attitude questions. Multilevel data analysis showed that Control related to positive attitudes among students in classes grouped under the science, and literature and language domains, but not in classes grouped under the arts and sports domain. Perceived Affiliation, on the other hand, was positively associated with all the four subject domains (science, social sciences, literature and language, and arts and sports). These results show the importance of taking a multidisciplinary perspective in in-service training programmes for secondary school science teachers as they emphasise the differential roles that control as an interpersonal behavioural style may play on students' attitudes in certain subject matters.","[Telli, Sibel] Canakkale Onsekiz Mart Univ, Dept Elementary Sci Educ, Fac Educ, Canakkale, Turkey",Canakkale Onsekiz Mart University,"Telli, S (corresponding author), Canakkale Onsekiz Mart Univ, Dept Elementary Sci Educ, Fac Educ, Canakkale, Turkey.",sibeltelli@comu.edu.tr,"Telli, Sibel/AAY-5600-2020","Telli, Sibel/0000-0002-0763-217X",,,,,66,6,6,0,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-0602,1470-1278,,TEACH TEACH,Teach.

The simulated storm surge is combined with probabilistic storm rates to create flood maps with various return periods. However, the map production requires enormous computational cost if state-of-the-art hydrodynamic models with high-resolution numerical grids are used; hence, optimal sampling (JPM-OS) with a small number of (similar to 100-200) optimal (representative) storms is preferred. This paper presents a significantly improved JPM-OS, where a small number of optimal storms are objectively selected, and simulated storm surge responses of tens of thousands of storms are accurately interpolated from those for the optimal storms using a highly efficient kriging surrogate model. This study focuses on Southwest Florida and considers similar to 150 optimal storms that are selected based on simulations using either the low fidelity (with low resolution and simple physics) SLOSH model or the high fidelity (with high resolution and comprehensive physics) CH3D model. Surge responses to the optimal storms are simulated using both SLOSH and CH3D, and the flood elevations are calculated using JPM-OS with highly efficient kriging interpolations. For verification, the probabilistic inundation maps are compared to those obtained by the traditional JPM and variations of JPM-OS that employ different interpolation schemes, and computed probabilistic water levels are compared to those calculated by historical storm methods. The inundation maps obtained with the JPM-OS differ less than 10% from those obtained with JPM for 20,625 storms, with only 4% of the computational time.","[Yang, Kun; Paramygin, Vladimir; Sheng, Y.

However, generating an ensemble with a good spread-error relationship is far from trivial, and a wide range of approaches to achieve this have been explored-chiefly in the context of numerical weather prediction models. Here, we aim to transform a deterministic neural network weather forecasting system into an ensemble forecasting system. We test four methods to generate the ensemble: random initial perturbations, retraining of the neural network, use of random dropout in the network, and the creation of initial perturbations with singular vector decomposition. The latter method is widely used in numerical weather prediction models, but is yet to be tested on neural networks. The ensemble mean forecasts obtained from these four approaches all beat the unperturbed neural network forecasts, with the retraining method yielding the highest improvement. However, the skill of the neural network forecasts is systematically lower than that of state-of-the-art numerical weather prediction models.","[Scher, Sebastian; Messori, Gabriele] Stockholm Univ, Dept Meteorol, Stockholm, Sweden; [Scher, Sebastian; Messori, Gabriele] Stockholm Univ, Bolin Ctr Climate Res, Stockholm, Sweden; [Messori, Gabriele] Uppsala Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Uppsala, Sweden; [Messori, Gabriele] Uppsala Univ, Ctr Nat Hazards & Disaster Sci CNDS, Uppsala, Sweden",Stockholm University; Uppsala University; Centre of Natural Hazards & Disaster Science (CNDS); Uppsala University,"Scher, S (corresponding author), Stockholm Univ, Dept Meteorol, Stockholm, Sweden.;Scher, S (corresponding author), Stockholm Univ, Bolin Ctr Climate Res, Stockholm, Sweden.",sebastian.scher@misu.su.se,,,Dept.

The code lacks high level aims and objectives, addressing the characteristics of Iranian buildings. As a consequence, the code has been revised and is not completely implemented in practice, and still remains inefficient. As with any energy coding system, this code has to identify the right balance between the different energy variables for the Iranian climate and way of life. In order to assist improvements to high level objectives of Code 19, this code is compared with ISO 9164, EN 832, German regulation, TS 825 of Turkey and China's GB 50189 to understand how these have adapted international standards to national features. In order to test the appropriateness of Code 19, five case study buildings in Iran are assessed against Code 19 as well as Turkish standard TS 825 and the results are compared. The results demonstrate that Code 19 is efficient in calculations of building envelope, but it needs improvements in the areas of ventilation, gains from internal and solar sources. The paper concludes by offering suggestions for improving the code. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The streets of the nation's capital have been flooded with people marching about a diversity of progressive issues, including women's rights, climate change, and gun violence. Although research has found that these events have mobilized a high proportion of repeat participants who come out again and again, limited research has focused on understanding differential participation in protest, especially during one cycle of contention. This article, accordingly, explores the patterns among the protest participants to understand differential participation and what we refer to as persistence in the Resistance. In it, we analyze a unique data set collected from surveys conducted with a field approximation of a random sample of protest participants at the largest protest events in Washington, DC, since the Resistance began at the 2017 Women's March. Our findings provide insights into repeat protesters during this cycle of contention. The article concludes by discussing how our findings contribute to the research on differential participation.","[Fisher, Dana R.] Univ Maryland, Dept Sociol, 2112 Parren Mitchell Art Sociol Bldg 3834 Campus, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Jasny, Lorien] Univ Exeter, Dept Polit, Exeter EX4 4SB, Devon, England",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; University of Exeter,"Fisher, DR (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Dept Sociol, 2112 Parren Mitchell Art Sociol Bldg 3834 Campus, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",drfisher@umd.edu; L.Jasny@Exeter.ac.uk,,"Fisher, Dana R/0000-0002-4273-4294",,,,,71,7,7,1,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0884-8971,1573-7861,,SOCIOL FORUM,Sociol.

Often, such long-term operational optimizations are solved by direct decomposing the problem into smaller subproblems. However, direct decomposition is not possible for problems with time-coupling constraints and variables. Such time-coupling is common in energy systems, e.g., due to peak power prices and (seasonal) energy storage. To efficiently solve coupled long-term operational optimization problems, we propose a time-series decomposition method. The proposed method calculates lower and upper bounds to obtain a feasible solution of the original problem with known quality. We compute lower bounds by the Branch-and-Cut algorithm. For the upper bound, we decompose complicating constraints and variables into smaller subproblems. The solution of these subproblems are recombined to obtain a feasible solution for the long-term operational optimization. To tighten the upper bound, we iteratively decrease the number of subproblems. In a case study for an industrial energy system, we show that the proposed time-series decomposition method converges fast, outperforming a commercial state-of-the-art solver.","[Baumgartner, Nils; Bahl, Bjorn; Hennen, Maike; Bardow, Andre] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Inst Tech Thermodynam, Aachen, Germany; [Shu, David; Bardow, Andre] Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Energy & Climate Res Energy Syst Engn IEK 10, Julich, Germany",RWTH Aachen University; Helmholtz Association; Research Center Julich,"Bardow, A (corresponding author), Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Inst Tech Thermodynam, Aachen, Germany.;Bardow, A (corresponding author), Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Energy & Climate Res Energy Syst Engn IEK 10, Julich, Germany.",andre.bardow@ltt.rwth-aachen.de,,"Shu, David Yang/0000-0003-4096-3883; Klinkenberg, Nils/0000-0003-3326-6748",,,,,17,1,1,1,2,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"SARA BURGERHARTSTRAAT 25, PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1570-7946,,978-0-12-819939-8; 978-0-12-819939-8,COMPUT-AIDED CHEM EN,,,2019,,,,,703,708,,10.1016/B978-0-12-818634-3.50118-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-818634-3.50118-1,,,6,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Engineering, Chemical",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Engineering,BO1FA,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000495447200118,View Full Record in Web of Science

The spread of heating and cooling with electrical energy and an increase of electric vehicles as well as the broad rollout of photovoltaic systems has a major impact on the peak power demand of modern households and the volatility smart grids have to face. Thus, besides the load impact of the growing population of electric vehicles, modern households are not only consumers of electrical power, but also power producers, so called prosumers. The rising number of prosumers and the limitations of grid capacities lead to an increasingly distributed system of heterogeneous components, which have to be managed and operated with locality and scalability in mind. Virtualisation technologies, particularly known as state of the art in data centre computing, can lead to a paradigm shift needed to meet the growing demands of this evolution. A key issue here is to forward data to the correct data sinks, where data are required in order to keep the grid balanced. This routing process has to be able to react on grid changes in a timely manner, i.e., it must be based on the instantaneous state of the grid. In this paper, we propose a solution based on virtualising the communication infrastructure in the low and medium voltage grid. We evaluate two different approaches. The first approach is based on SDN; an ONOS SDN controller is used to change the behaviour of the communication infrastructure according to information provided by components of the power grid. The second approach uses Coaty and a Mosquitto MQTT broker to deliver messages to the desired endpoint, again based on information from the power grid.","[Veichtlbauer, Armin] Univ Appl Sci Upper Austria, Campus Hagenberg, A-4232 Hagenberg, Austria; [Heinisch, Alexander] Siemens AG, Corp Technol, A-1210 Vienna, Austria; [von Tuellenburg, Ferdinand; Dorfinger, Peter] Salzburg Res Forschungsg MbH, Adv Networking Ctr, A-5020 Salzburg, Austria; [Langthaler, Oliver; Pache, Ulrich] Univ Appl Sci Salzburg, Ctr Secure Energy Informat, A-5412 Puch Salzburg, Austria",Siemens AG,"Veichtlbauer, A (corresponding author), Univ Appl Sci Upper Austria, Campus Hagenberg, A-4232 Hagenberg, Austria.",armin.veichtlbauer@fh-hagenberg.at; alexander.heinisch@siemens.com; ferdinand.tuellenburg@salzburgresearch.at; peter.dorfinger@salzburgresearch.at; oliver.langthaler@fh-salzburg.ac.at; ulrich.pache@fh-salzburg.ac.at,,"Veichtlbauer, Armin/0000-0002-9532-6577",Austrian Climate and Energy Fund (KLIEN) within the program e!MISSION [858873]; State of Upper Austria via the Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG) [881296],Austrian Climate and Energy Fund (KLIEN) within the program e!MISSION; State of Upper Austria via the Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG),"The presented work has mainly been conducted in the research project VirtueGrid, which was funded by the Austrian Climate and Energy Fund (KLIEN) within the program e!MISSION under the project number 858873.

Children were a major target audience of the examined public gardens, followed by adults, families, and youth. Public children's gardens tended to offer more programs overall compared with public gardens without children's gardens. In addition, there was a greater diversity of children's educational programs offered (classified into 10 topics and 11 activities) in public children's gardens. The most frequently offered topics were plants (39.1%), animals (22.0%), and art (10.5%). Observation was the most frequently offered activity (17.1%), followed by visual art (14.4%). However, the proportions of offered programs significantly differed across individual public children's gardens. The subjects (i.e., topics and activities) offered by children's education programs were more often directed toward younger children. Education coordinators and horticulture directors were asked about desired improvements to children's education programs. A large percentage of respondents (58.1%) indicated a need to develop programs with greater topical variety, revealing a desire to diversify programs. In conclusion, the results of this study indicate that it is important to diversify the natural environmental experiences of educational programs for children through developing children's gardens and age-specific education at public children's gardens in the United States.","[Kwon, Min Hyeong; Jang, Eu Jean] Korea Univ, Dept Biosyst & Biotechnol, Seoul 136713, South Korea; [Kim, Jongyun] Korea Univ, Div Biotechnol, Seoul 136713, South Korea; [Seo, Changwan] Natl Inst Ecol, Dept Climate & Ecol, Seocheon Gun 325813, South Korea; [Lee, Chiwon W.] N Dakota State Univ, Dept Plant Sci, Fargo, ND 58108 USA; [Lee, Woo-Kyun] Korea Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Ecol Engn, Seoul 136713, South Korea",Korea University; Korea University; National Institute of Ecology; North Dakota State University Fargo; Korea University,"Lee, WK (corresponding author), Korea Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Ecol Engn, Seoul 136713, South Korea.",leewk@korea.ac.kr,"Lee, Woo-Kyun/AAP-9837-2020; Kim, Jongyun/AAL-3586-2020","Lee, Woo-Kyun/0000-0002-2188-359X; Kim, Jongyun/0000-0001-8085-9592",,,,,61,1,1,1,32,AMER SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,ALEXANDRIA,"113 S WEST ST, STE 200, ALEXANDRIA, VA 22314-2851 USA",1063-0198,1943-7714,,HORTTECHNOLOGY,HortTechnology,FEB,2016,1,,,,70,82,,10.21273/HORTTECH.26.1.70,http://dx.doi.org/10.21273/HORTTECH.26.1.70,,,13,Horticulture,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture,DE8TK,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000370909400010,View Full Record in Web of Science

In the course of 14 and 15 October 2012 (Intensive Observation Period 13), intense convective events affected southern France, Corsica and several regions of Italy. Numerical simulations are performed with two state-of-the-art numerical weather prediction models (COSMO and MOLOCH), driven by the same initial and boundary data and operated on an identical domain. With this set-up, the sensitivity of the model results to horizontal grid spacing and terrain elevation is assessed. Furthermore, model outputs are compared with observations from rain-gauges, radars and radiosondes made during the campaign. Although the higher resolution runs show a higher correlation with observed precipitation, the influence of model grid spacing on total precipitation amount or timing is rather weak. Since the overall performance of both mesoscale models is fairly good, they are used together to investigate the physical processes characterizing IOP 13. In particular, the differences in the location and timing of convection between the simulations are used to identify and explore those processes that need to be well represented in order to reproduce the mechanisms initiating heavy precipitation in the Mediterranean region adequately.","[Barthlott, Christian] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res IMK TRO, Wolfgang Gaede Str 1, D-76131 Karlsruhe, Germany; [Davolio, Silvio] Inst Atmospher Sci & Climate CNR ISAC, Bologna, Italy",Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Scienze dell'Atmosfera e del Clima (ISAC-CNR),"Barthlott, C (corresponding author), Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res IMK TRO, Wolfgang Gaede Str 1, D-76131 Karlsruhe, Germany.",christian.barthlott@kit.edu,"Barthlott, Christian/A-9552-2013; davolio, silvio/C-8425-2017","Barthlott, Christian/0000-0003-2927-5051; davolio, silvio/0000-0001-8704-1814",MISTRALS/HyMeX; IODA-MED project [ANR-11-BS56-0005],MISTRALS/HyMeX; IODA-MED project,"This work is a contribution to the HyMeX international programme.

Coastal impact models can help determine the vulnerability of areas and populations to changes in sea level. Model outputs may be used to guide decisions about the location and design of future protected areas and development, and to prioritize adaptation of existing protected area investments. This paper reviews state-of-the-art coastal impact models that determine sea-level rise vulnerability and provides guidance to help managers and policy makers determine the appropriateness of various models at local, regional, and global scales. There are a variety of models, each with strengths and weaknesses, that are suited for different management objectives. We find important trade-offs exist regarding the cost and capacity needed to run and interpret the models, the range of impacts they cover, and regarding the spatial scale that each operates which may overstate impacts at one end and underestimate impacts at the other.

In this work, Spectralon, Diffusil, and Heraeus diffusers were exposed to exhaust gases and ultraviolet (UV) radiation in the ambient air conditions and their degradations were monitored by measuring changes in spectral reflectances. Spectralon is a state-of-the-art diffuser made of polytetra fluoroethylene, and Diffusil and Heraeus diffusers are made of fused silica with gas bubbles inside. Based on the contamination tests, Spectralon degrades faster than fused silica diffusers. For the samples exposed to contamination for 20 minutes, the 250 nm - 400 nm total diffuse spectral reflectance of Spectralon degraded 3-5 times more when exposed to petrol-like emission and 16-23 times more when exposed to diesel-like emission, compared with Diffusil. When the reflectance changes of Spectralon were compared with those of Heraeus, Spectralon degraded 3-4 times more when exposed to petrol-like emission for 20 minutes and 5-7 times more when exposed to diesel-like emission for 7.5 minutes. When the samples contaminated were exposed to UV radiation in the ambient air, their reflectance gradually restored back to the original level. In conclusion, fused silica diffusers are more resistant to hydrocarbon contaminants present in ground reference test sites, and thus more stable under UV radiation in the air.","[Vaskuri, Anna] Aalto Univ, Metrol Res Inst, POB 15500, Aalto 00076, Finland; [Vaskuri, Anna; Greenwell, Claire; Hessey, Isabel; Tompkins, Jordan; Woolliams, Emma] Natl Phys Lab, Teddington TW11 0LW, Middx, England",Aalto University; National Physical Laboratory - UK,"Vaskuri, A (corresponding author), Aalto Univ, Metrol Res Inst, POB 15500, Aalto 00076, Finland.;Vaskuri, A (corresponding author), Natl Phys Lab, Teddington TW11 0LW, Middx, England.",anna.vaskuri@aalto.fi,"Woolliams, Emma R/A-2404-2014","Woolliams, Emma R/0000-0003-3517-1486; Vaskuri, Anna/0000-0003-1246-4550",European Metrology Research Programme (EMRP) within the joint research project ENV53 European metrology for Earth observation and climate (MetEOC2); EMRP participating countries within EURAMET; European Union,European Metrology Research Programme (EMRP) within the joint research project ENV53 European metrology for Earth observation and climate (MetEOC2); EMRP participating countries within EURAMET; European Union(European Commission),This work has been supported by the European Metrology Research Programme (EMRP) within the joint research project ENV53 European metrology for Earth observation and climate (MetEOC2).

A change in the angle of solar radiation and the surface of the earth causes changes in the ambient temperature. Sometimes, these changes reduce climatic comfort of human beings. Climatic comfort is established when there is a balance between excreted and absorbed temperatures of the skin of the body. Orientation and extension rates of physics of squares relative to the geographical north influence the amount of received direct sunlight in different months. Relevant studies show that the squares of the city of Yazd reduce the climatic comfort of its citizens; moreover, the physics of Yazd's squares apply various extension rates, which led to high building costs to citizens and relevant organizations. This study, by using the correlation method and R software, measures different orientation and extension rates of physics of squares in Yazd. It analyzes two models with orientation and physical extension as variables and evaluates the shade and sunlight in the space. The results reveal significant differences between desirable and undesirable options. Considering the climatic comfort of space users and residents at the same time, a rectangle with an extension ratio of one to several and the north-south orientation, making the lowest facade face the south, is the most appropriate physic for city squares.","[Kheirabadi, Fouad] Islamic Azad Univ, Sanandaj Branch, Young Researchers & Elite Club, Sanandaj, Iran; [Alizadeh, Hooshmand] Univ Kurdistan, Fac Art & Architecture, Dept Urban Planning & Design, Pasdaran Blvd,POB 416, Sanandaj 6617715175, Iran; [Nourmohammadzad, Hossein] Yazd Univ, Arts & Architecture Sch, Mortaz House,Imam St, Yazd 36228833, Iran",Islamic Azad University; University of Kurdistan; University of Yazd,"Kheirabadi, F (corresponding author), Islamic Azad Univ, Sanandaj Branch, Young Researchers & Elite Club, Sanandaj, Iran.",kheirabadi.usk@gmail.com; h.alizadeh@uok.ac.ir; Nourm@yazd.ac.ir,"Alizadeh, Hooshmand/AFO-7088-2022; Alizadeh, Hooshmand/V-1336-2017","Alizadeh, Hooshmand/0000-0001-6441-8797",,,,,15,0,0,0,2,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",2345-7481,2345-752X,,CHIN J URBAN ENV STU,Chin.

However, conventional sensitivity analysis methods break down when applied to long-time averages of chaotic systems. This breakdown is a serious limitation because many aerospace applications involve physical phenomena that exhibit chaotic dynamics: most notably high-resolution large-eddy and direct numerical simulations of turbulent aerodynamic flows. A recently proposed methodology, called least-squares shadowing, avoids this breakdown and advances the state of the art in sensitivity analysis for chaotic flows. The first application of least-squares shadowing to a chaotic flow simulated with a large-scale computational fluid dynamics solver is presented. The least-squares shadowing sensitivity computed for this chaotic flow is verified and shown to be accurate, but the computational cost of the current least-squares shadowing implementation is high.","[Blonigan, Patrick J.; Wang, Qiqi] MIT, Aeronaut & Astronaut, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Nielsen, Eric J.] NASA, Computat AeroSci Branch, Langley Res Ctr, MS 128, Hampton, VA 23681 USA; [Diskin, Boris] Natl Inst Aerosp, Hampton, VA 23666 USA; [Blonigan, Patrick J.] NASA, Ames Res Ctr, Moffett Field, CA 94035 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Langley Research Center; National Institute for Aerospace; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Ames Research Center,"Blonigan, PJ (corresponding author), MIT, Aeronaut & Astronaut, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.;Blonigan, PJ (corresponding author), NASA, Ames Res Ctr, Moffett Field, CA 94035 USA.",,,,U.S. Government [FA9550-11-C-0028]; U.S. Department of Defense; U.S. Air Force Office of Scientific Research; National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate (NDSEG) Fellowship [32 CFR 168a]; U.S. Air Force Office of Scientific Research [FA9550-15-1-0072],U.S. Government; U.S. Department of Defense(United States Department of Defense); U.S. Air Force Office of Scientific Research(United States Department of DefenseAir Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR)); National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate (NDSEG) Fellowship; U.S. Air Force Office of Scientific Research(United States Department of DefenseAir Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR)),"Research for this paper was conducted with U.S. Government support under FA9550-11-C-0028 and awarded by the U.S. Department of Defense, U.S. Air Force Office of Scientific Research, and National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate (NDSEG) Fellowship, 32 CFR 168a.

This is the first study to provide information on the community characteristics and secondary production of macro- and meiofauna collected in the European sector of the Arctic Ocean, along a depth gradient, from shallow Svalbard fjords, the Barents Sea shelf and slope, to the deep Nansen Basin and the Yermak Plateau north off Svalbard. Our results show significant differences in benthic fauna community structure and productivity among fjords, shelf and northern deep stations. Density, biomass, and secondary production decreased significantly with depth, following the decrease in quantity and quality of organic matter reaching the sea floor. Macrofauna was dominated by polychaetes and bivalves, and meiofauna by nematodes. Nematode production was higher than that of macrofauna in areas where no or very limited fresh organic matter was available. We conclude that nematode production in the deep-sea sediments of the Arctic Ocean can be an important component of the benthic communities, and thus carbon cycling, but this relation will likely be influenced by ongoing climate change and related sea ice retreat and, therefore, changes in primary production patterns.","[Oleszczuk, Barbara; Grzelak, Katarzyna; Kedra, Monika] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Oceanol, Powstancow Warszawy 55, Sopot, Poland",Polish Academy of Sciences; Institute of Oceanology of the Polish Academy of Sciences,"Oleszczuk, B (corresponding author), Polish Acad Sci, Inst Oceanol, Powstancow Warszawy 55, Sopot, Poland.",oleszczuk@iopan.gda.pl,,"Grzelak, Katarzyna/0000-0002-8175-575X; Kedra, Monika/0000-0002-2223-5850","Research Council of Norway [228107]; National Science Centre, Poland [2015/19/B/NZ8/03945, 2016/20/S/NZ8/00432]; Leading National Research Centre (KNOW) by the Centre for Polar Studies;  [AWI_PS92_00]","Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway); National Science Centre, Poland(National Science Centre, Poland); Leading National Research Centre (KNOW) by the Centre for Polar Studies; ","The presented material was collected during the R/V Polarstern TRANSSIZ cruise (ARK XXIX/1; PS92), carried out under grant number AWI_PS92_00 and organized by Arctic in Rapid Transition (ART) and during R/V Helmer Hanssen ARCEx cruise 2016 (ARCEx - The Research Center for Arctic Petroleum Exploration), funded by the Research Council of Norway (project no. 228107), together with 10 academic and eight industry partners.

The study employs state-of-the-art analytical techniques to develop GHG emission inventory, its forecasting and preparing mitigation plan. The total carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO(2)e) emission was estimated at 41.26 million tonnes (Mt.) for the year 2014. The major contributors were power plants (46.8%), vehicles (29.7%), municipal solid waste burning (7.6%) and domestic cooking (6%). To achieve a continuous reduction, targets were set for two phases in the years, 2022 and 2030. The emissions were projected by considering growth in population, GDP, vehicles on the road and other activities; 63.64 (year 2022) and 79.19 (year 2030) Mt. tCO(2)e. The electricity consumption showed the highest increase followed by vehicles. Based on emission intensity (ratio of emission quantity to GDP), the target emission in the year 2030 was 54.74 Mt. tCO(2)e. The control-plan primarily comprised use of renewable sources, energy efficient devices and introduction of electric vehicles. Electricity generation by renewable sources (40% by 2030) could result in a reduction of 25.6 Mt. tCO(2)e (32% of tCO(2)e). It is shown systematic emission estimates and mitigation planning can achieve the target emission.","[Nagar, Pavan K.; Sharma, Mukesh; Gupta, Shubham; Singh, Dhirendra] Indian Inst Technol Kanpur, Ctr Environm Sci & Engn, Dept Civil Engn, Kanpur 208016, Uttar Pradesh, India",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Kanpur,"Sharma, M (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol Kanpur, Dept Civil Engn, Kanpur 208016, Uttar Pradesh, India.",mukesh@iitk.ac.in,"Nagar, Pavan K/AAS-2771-2020","Nagar, Pavan K/0000-0002-4519-748X",,,,,36,1,1,1,13,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-0955,,,URBAN CLIM,Urban CLim.,JUN,2019,,,,,,,100462,10.1016/j.uclim.2019.100462,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.uclim.2019.100462,,,11,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,IM1EA,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000477730100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Direct entrainment of silt, on the other hand, is thought to generate minimal quantities of dust. If so, loess landscapes should rarely be major sources of dust unless disturbed by human activity. To test the mechanisms by which loess can be eroded by the wind, we used the Portable In-Situ Wind Erosion Lab (PI-SWERL). PI-SWERL tests were conducted on benches that were carved into loess at field locations. Coarse to fine loess was also collected and tested in a controlled setting using (1) dry, unconsolidated loess and (2) crusted loess. Results indicate that in most cases, the threshold friction velocity for silt is less than that for sand and that most dust generation occurs by direct entrainment of dust. Saltation, even in coarse loess, was nonexistent to intermittent. In a few cases, saltation of sand or soil aggregates preceded dust generation or enhanced emissions after direct entrainment began. Emission fluxes of loess are potentially high in both proximal and distal settings, suggesting that loess is easily entrainable if vegetation density is low. We hypothesize that an arid and windy climate of the late Pleistocene, paired with lower vegetation density, facilitated large-scale erosion of Peoria Loess in Nebraska to generate wind-aligned ridges and troughs. More broadly, our results indicate that loess landscapes have the potential to be major sources as well as sinks of dust.","[Sweeney, Mark R.] Univ S Dakota, Dept Earth Sci, Vermillion, SD 57069 USA; [Mason, Joseph A.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Geog, Madison, WI 53706 USA",University of South Dakota; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Sweeney, MR (corresponding author), Univ S Dakota, Dept Earth Sci, 414 E Clark St, Vermillion, SD 57069 USA.",mark.sweeney@usd.edu,,"Mason, Joseph/0000-0003-2287-8247; Sweeney, Mark/0000-0002-4396-4438","National Science Foundation [EAR-0921312, EAR-0921915]",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This research was funded by National Science Foundation grants EAR-0921312 and EAR-0921915.

Postprocessing is particularly relevant in complex terrain, where even state-of-the-art high-resolution NWP systems cannot resolve many of the small-scale processes shaping local weather conditions. In addition, statistical postprocessing can also be used to combine forecasts from multiple NWP systems. Here we assess an ensemble model output statistics (EMOS) approach to produce seamless temperature forecasts based on a combination of short-term ensemble forecasts from a convection-permitting limited-area ensemble and a medium-range global ensemble forecasting model. We quantify the benefit of this approach compared to only postprocessing the high-resolution NWP. The multimodel EMOS approach (mixed EMOS) is able to improve forecasts by 30% with respect to direct model output from the high-resolution NWP. A detailed evaluation of mixed EMOS reveals that it outperforms either one of the single-model EMOS versions by 8%-12%. Temperature forecasts at valley locations profit in particular from the model combination. All forecast variants perform worst in winter (DJF); however, calibration and model combination improves forecast quality substantially. In addition to increasing skill as compared to single-model postprocessing, it also enables us to seamlessly combine multiple forecast sources with different time horizons (and horizontal resolutions) and thereby consolidates short-term to medium-range forecasting time horizons in one product without any user-relevant discontinuity.","[Keller, Regula; Rajczak, Jan; Bhend, Jonas; Spirig, Christoph; Hemri, Stephan; Liniger, Mark A.] MeteoSwiss, Fed Off Meteorol & Climatol, Zurich, Switzerland; [Keller, Regula] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Ctr Climate Syst Modelling, Zurich, Switzerland; [Keller, Regula; Wernli, Heini] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, Zurich, Switzerland",Federal Office of Meteorology & Climatology (MeteoSwiss); Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Keller, R (corresponding author), MeteoSwiss, Fed Off Meteorol & Climatol, Zurich, Switzerland.;Keller, R (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Ctr Climate Syst Modelling, Zurich, Switzerland.;Keller, R (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, Zurich, Switzerland.",regula.keller@meteoswiss.ch,"Wernli, Heini/F-1099-2016","Wernli, Heini/0000-0001-9674-4837",,,,,34,1,1,3,9,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0882-8156,1520-0434,,WEATHER FORECAST,Weather Forecast.,JUN,2021,3,,,,1031,1042,,10.1175/WAF-D-20-0141.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/WAF-D-20-0141.1,,,12,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,SU1IS,,"Green Submitted, Bronze",,,12/21/22,WOS:000662894800017,View Full Record in Web of Science

By applying the principles of sustainable architecture and modern methods of architecture in addition to the optimized use of sunlight in building, creating a comfortable space for life is possible and energy resources is maintained for future generations. One of the most important ways to use solar energy in the buildings is atriums or middle-forums. Before the atrium is one of the building components, it is the last human achievements and also is the result of his efforts during the history of building for recruiting and better use of sunlight. Atriums due to the physical and environmental factors have a changeable thermal performance that non-consideration of designers to them makes disturbing individual's comfort and waste of energy. Atriums also have proper capabilities of solar energy gaining and saving that. Energy can reduce 40% of the energy used to provide thermal comfort within the atrium.

Recent emphasis has been paid to optimizing wind and thermal comfort in older neighborhoods, following the urban renewal trend. This paper collected the geometries of 150 workers' villages. Pedestrian-level wind and Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) were calculated for workers' villages using validated simulation software. Seven machine learning (ML) algorithms were compared for modeling the nonlinear relationship between the building morphology and the outdoor environment of the workers' villages. The ensemble model, especially the Adaboost model, performs best when predicting static wind ratio and UTCI with R2 values of 0.89 and 0.99. The trained models were applied to es-timate the outdoor environment of 1118 workers' villages in East China. The result shows most workers' villages have static wind ratios over 0.7. Workers' villages in Jiangsu endure more extreme summer heat, whereas workers' villages in Zhejiang have a higher static wind ratio in winter and summer. The use of ML offers a quicker estimation of outdoor wind and thermal comfort in large-scale workers' villages than numerical simu-lations, therefore shedding light on the targeting of urban renewal.","[Zhang, Xingzhao; Yang, Luqiao; Luo, Ruizhe; Wu, Hsin-Yu; Xu, Jiaqi; Yao, Jiawei] Tongji Univ, Coll Architecture & Urban Planning, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China; [Huang, Chenyu] North China Univ Technol, Sch Architecture & Art, Beijing 100144, Peoples R China; [Ruan, Yingjun] Tongji Univ, Sch Mech Engn, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Xiaowei] Tongji Architectural Design Grp Co Ltd, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China; [Yao, Jiawei] Tongji Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Ecol & Energy Saving Study Dense Habitat, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China",Tongji University; North China University of Technology; Tongji University; Tongji University,"Yao, JW (corresponding author), Tongji Univ, Coll Architecture & Urban Planning, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China.",jiawei.yao@tongji.edu.cn,,"Huang, Chenyu/0000-0002-6360-638X",National Natural Science Foundation of China; Shanghai Municipal Science and Technology Major Project; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities;  [51908410];  [2021SHZDZX0100],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Shanghai Municipal Science and Technology Major Project; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); ; ,"Acknowledgments This research was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant NO. 51908410, the Shanghai Municipal Science and Technology Major Project under Grant NO. 2021SHZDZX0100, and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities.",,56,0,0,0,0,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0360-1323,1873-684X,,BUILD ENVIRON,Build.

However, OPV devices also require encapsulation by barrier films to reduce the degradation driven by extrinsic factors, which in turn limits their flexibility and leads to lower specific power values. In this work, fully solution-processed (including both electrodes) semitransparent organic solar cells (OSCs) with performance comparable with conventional indium tin oxide-based devices are processed directly onto different barrier films of varying thicknesses. Direct cell fabrication onto barrier films leads to the elimination of the additional polyethylene terephthalate substrate and one of the two adhesive layers in the final stack of an encapsulated OPV device by replacing the industrial state-of-the-art sandwich encapsulation with a top-only encapsulation process, which yields significantly thinner and lighter 'product-relevant' PV devices. In addition to the increase of the specific power to 0.38 W g(-1), which is more than four times higher than sandwich-encapsulated devices, these novel OSCs exhibit better flexibility and survive 5000 bending cycles with 4.5 mm bending radius. Moreover, the devices show comparable stability as conventionally encapsulated devices under constant illumination (1 sun) in ambient air for 1000 h. Finally, degradation under damp heat conditions (65 degrees C, 85% rh) was investigated and found to be determined by a combination of different factors, namely (UV) light soaking, intrinsic barrier properties, and potential damaging of the barriers during (laser) processing.","[Guler, Ezgi Nur; Distler, Andreas; Basu, Robin; Brabec, Christoph J.; Egelhaaf, Hans-Joachim] Friedrich Alexander Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Fac Engn, Dept Mat Sci Mat Elect & Energy Technol I MEET, Martensstr 7, D-91058 Erlangen, Germany; [Guler, Ezgi Nur; Distler, Andreas; Brabec, Christoph J.; Egelhaaf, Hans-Joachim] Bavarian Ctr Appl Energy Res ZAE Bayern, Solar Factory Future SFF, Further Str 250, D-90429 Nurnberg, Germany; [Brabec, Christoph J.; Egelhaaf, Hans-Joachim] Forschungszentrum Julich, Helmholtz Inst Erlangen Nurnberg Renewable Energy, Immerwahrstr 2, D-91058 Erlangen, Germany",University of Erlangen Nuremberg,"Guler, EN; Distler, A (corresponding author), Friedrich Alexander Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Fac Engn, Dept Mat Sci Mat Elect & Energy Technol I MEET, Martensstr 7, D-91058 Erlangen, Germany.;Guler, EN; Distler, A (corresponding author), Bavarian Ctr Appl Energy Res ZAE Bayern, Solar Factory Future SFF, Further Str 250, D-90429 Nurnberg, Germany.",ezgi.nur.gueler@fau.de; andreas.distler@fau.de,,"Basu, Robin/0000-0002-5577-2716; Distler, Andreas/0000-0003-3500-2180; Guler, Ezgi Nur/0000-0002-1009-3736; Egelhaaf, Hans-Joachim/0000-0002-8263-8125","Bavarian State Government [FKZ 20.2-3410.5-4-5]; Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action [FKZ 16KN098724]; European Union [952911, 101007084]",Bavarian State Government; Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action; European Union(European Commission),"The authors thank Mitsubishi Chemical for providing research samples of barrier foils.

Through the millennia of evolution, photosynthesis evolved to harvest solar energy and utilize it for the anabolism of caloric substances that are stored and used as biological fuels. Therefore, the photosynthetic systems are excellent paradigms for solar energy science and engineering. Mimicking photosynthesis provides a means not only to further the solar energy conversion science but also to test and elucidate key aspects of the biological light harvesting.

The growth of deep learning algorithms is closely related to an increasing demand for data that is not acceptable or available in many use cases. In this context, the incorporation of physical knowledge or a priori constraints has proven beneficial in many tasks. On the other hand, this collection of approaches is context-specific, and it is difficult to generalize them to new problems. In this paper, we experimentally compare some of the most commonly used theory-injection strategies to perform a systematic analysis of their advantages. Selected state-of-the-art algorithms were reproduced for different use cases to evaluate their effectiveness with smaller training data and to discuss how the underlined strategies can fit into new application contexts.","[Monaco, Simone; Apiletti, Daniele; Malnati, Giovanni] Politecn Torino, Dept Control & Comp Engn, I-10129 Turin, Italy",Polytechnic University of Turin,"Monaco, S (corresponding author), Politecn Torino, Dept Control & Comp Engn, I-10129 Turin, Italy.",simone.monaco@polito.it,,,Smart-Data@PoliTO center for Big Data and Machine Learning technologies,Smart-Data@PoliTO center for Big Data and Machine Learning technologies,The research leading to these results has been partially supported by the Smart-Data@PoliTO center for Big Data and Machine Learning technologies.,,32,0,0,1,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2079-9292,,ELECTRONICS-SWITZ,Electronics,SEP,2022,18,,,,,,2850,10.3390/electronics11182850,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/electronics11182850,,,11,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Physics, Applied",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Physics,4U1DC,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000858542400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

MODIS provides more extensive coverage, whereas MISR's multiangle retrievals include dust properties and fill in areas where glint precludes MODIS optical depth retrievals, increasing by up to 50% dust plume surface area coverage compared to MODIS-only observations. These results can be used to improve dust aerosol representations in climate, forecast, and transport models. Extensive comparison of MISR and MODIS AOT retrievals with Aerosol Robotic Network ( AERONET) observations in dusty regions show accuracies of about 20%; MISR Angstrom exponent is predominantly less than 1, in reasonably good agreement with AERONET. For four selected North African dust transport events, combined MISR and MODIS observations map systematic changes in retrieved plume surface area, on the basis of AOT contours; these reflect differences in aerosol dispersion and removal rates that must be reproduced by models. Within MISR retrieval uncertainties, Angstrom exponent and AOT fraction spherical are lower in the optically thicker parts of the plume by up to 30% and increase as the plume is transported across the ocean, as would be expected; retrieved single-scattering albedo values are similar to 0.98 for all stages of plume evolution. For the cases studied, AERONET shows similar property patterns at points on either side of the Atlantic and indicates similar to 15% decrease in aerosol coarse mode effective radius during transoceanic transport.","[Kalashnikova, Olga V.] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA 91109 USA; [Kahn, Ralph A.] NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA",California Institute of Technology; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL); National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center,"Kalashnikova, OV (corresponding author), CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, 4800 Oak Grove Dr, Pasadena, CA 91109 USA.",olga.v.kalashnikova@jpl.nasa.gov,"Kalashnikova, Olga V/E-6818-2019; Kahn, Ralph A/D-5371-2012","Kalashnikova, Olga V/0000-0002-1330-1529; Kahn, Ralph A/0000-0002-5234-6359",NASA Earth Sciences Division,NASA Earth Sciences Division,"We thank Michael Garay for creating tools for collocating MISR and MODIS aerosol retrievals; Amy Braverman, PI of AMAPS project, for her help in developing tools for obtaining and comparing MISR, MODIS, and AERONET data; and the AERONET project and the Saharan AERONET stations principal investigators for their efforts in establishing and maintaining the nine sites used in this investigation.

However, there is a lack of studies on the impact of manipulating courtyards geometry on the thermal sensation of occupants. This research investigates the impact of changing the courtyard geometry and the resulted shading on Mean Radiant Temperature (MRT) and Globe temperature (Tg). The latter represents the thermal perception of occupants and the former is the main effective factor on the thermal sensation of people in outdoor and semi-outdoor spaces. The research carried out simulation experiments to test 360 different courtyard configurations. The simulation experiments included using Envi-met and IES-VE simulation tools. The former was used to determine MRT and Tg, and the latter to determine shading levels. Baghdad was selected to represent an example of a hot city in which summer air temperature reaches around 50 degrees C. The results show that the difference in shading that results from changing the courtyard geometry can lead to a difference in MRT and Tg of up to 15 degrees C.","[Al-Hafith, Omar; Satish, B.

This paper also intends to answer the following question: To what extent does Biophilic perception become possible in El Gl Park, if at all To answer this question, we will discuss the concept of biophilia and the factors that affect its realization in urban green spaces to analyse the effective components in this approach. To this end, we will provide a review of the literature in the theoretical part to present a conceptual model. Then, in the field study part, we used random sampling to select 384 subjects as our study sample. The underlying research methodology is structural equation modelling (in particular, the finite element method abbreviated as FEM). Using IBM SPSS Statistics and EQS, we analysed the main areas of biophilic perception (including sensory perception, experiential reception and mental recognition) and the common areas (including cognition and perception, sensory-affective experience and cognitive experience) as the independent variables and biophilic perception in El Gl Park of Tabriz as the dependent variable. The results of the study indicate that the main areas of biophilic perception, with a standardized weighted load factor of 0.920.96, confirm the highly desirable intensity of the relationship of the conceptual model of biophilic perception. Also, the independent variables of the five senses, orientation systems, historical-cultural meanings, air and the perceptions derived from it, semantic systems, relaxation and psychological security, perception of complexity in nature, comfort and safety, perception of mysteriousness in nature and climate play the most effective role in obtaining the biophilic perception of the audience of El Gl Park of Tabriz.","[Tokhmehchian, Ali; Gharehbaglou, Minou] Tabriz Islamic Art Univ, Fac Architecture & Urbanism, Tabriz, Iran",,"Gharehbaglou, M (corresponding author), Tabriz Islamic Art Univ, Fac Architecture & Urbanism, Tabriz, Iran.",m.gharehbaglou@tabriziau.ac.ir,"Gharehbaglou, Minou/AAF-2806-2021","Gharehbaglou, Minou/0000-0003-2639-2906",,,,,50,0,0,4,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1226-5934,2161-6779,,INT J URBAN SCI,Int.

The experience of the 2005 food crisis in Niger,CAHIERS AGRICULTURES,,,French,Article,,,,,,information; avoidance; pastoralism; crisis; Sahel; agricultural policies,,"In the Sahel, the information systems built and improved since the 1980s have not allowed development policies and emergency actions to take into account some specific traits of the pastoral populations. This inadequacy goes back to historical background and partly addresses the limitations of the information systems, the lack of means or the weak coordination within and between national and regional politics. The administration struggles to cope with the common management of natural resources and the mobility of herds. Empirically grounded on a fieldwork following the 2005 food crisis in Niger and on 15 years of field enquiries in the Sahel, this article intends to demonstrate how pastoral populations have become invisible. On the one hand, the underpinning schemes in the information systems do not help the policies managing the specific traits at the core of the reproduction of the pastoral systems. On the other hand, the pastoral population's avoidance strategy, which has historically allowed them to escape from pressure exerted by the administration, currently hinders their ability to influence fundamental debates within their countries. The singular case of pastoralism should raise awareness of multidisciplinary research and politics concerned with the sustainable management of space, resources and living within a world confronted with deep economic and climate changes.","[Ancey, Veronique] CIRAD, UMR ART DEV, TA C 113 15, 73 Rue Jean Francois Breton, F-34398 Montpellier 5, France",CIRAD; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Paul-Valery; Universite Perpignan Via Domitia; Universite de Montpellier,"Ancey, V (corresponding author), CIRAD, UMR ART DEV, TA C 113 15, 73 Rue Jean Francois Breton, F-34398 Montpellier 5, France.",veronique.ancey@cirad.fr,,,,,,,46,1,1,2,5,EDP SCIENCES S A,LES ULIS CEDEX A,"17, AVE DU HOGGAR, PA COURTABOEUF, BP 112, F-91944 LES ULIS CEDEX A, FRANCE",1777-5949,,,CAH AGRIC,Cah.

By contrast, the Omushkegowuk Cree of the western James Bay region have asserted Aboriginal title to Akimiski Island. The Government of Canada by their action (or inaction) has reversed the onus of responsibility for proof of Aboriginal title from the Inuit to the Cree. In other words, the Government of Canada did not follow their own guidelines and the common-law test for proof of Aboriginal title. In this paper, we documented and employed Cree oral history as well as a sea-level retrodiction (based on state-of-the-art numerical modeling of past sea-level changes in James Bay), which incorporated a modified ICE-6G ice history and a 3-D model of Earth structure, to establish that criterion 2 of the test for Aboriginal title has now been fully met. In other words, Cree traditional use and occupancy of Akimiski Island was considered sufficiently factual at the time of assertion of sovereignty by European nations. As all the criteria of the common-law test for proof of Aboriginal title in Canada, with respect to Akimiski Island, have now been addressed, the Cree have sufficient basis to initiate the process of a formal land claim.","[Tsuji, Leonard J.

Recent developments in information sharing platforms (Environmental Virtual Observatories, EVOs) could make information provisioning more actionable. Here we present the results of a diagnostic study for the development of a hydro-climatic EVO that enables rice farmers in Northern Ghana to deal with climate variability and water shortage. The hydro-climatic EVO aims to combine data from scientific and indigenous forecast systems, facilitating information exchange using two-way interaction with stakeholders to co-produce knowledge. Data was collected through informal interviews with field practitioners, through focus group discussions with farmers and content analysis of documents. Results show that both the biophysical and socio-institutional circumstances need be taken into account for the development of the EVO. Existing govemance and information exchange arrangements and lack of collaboration between actors were found to limit current hydro-climatic information flow, interpretation, and use. Our study reveals existing models of information exchange and their limitations in the study area. We discuss the proposed design of a hydro-climatic EVO from a responsible innovation perspective, considering possible future eventualities in a process that aims to be anticipatory, inclusive, reflexive and responsive. We conclude that such a hydro-climatic EVO has a potential to contribute to rice farmers' adaptive decision-making in Northern Ghana, but there are challenges that need to be considered. The diagnostic study has helped to refine these challenges and offers concrete suggestions to improve both the design and implementation of the proposed platform in a responsible way.","[Nyadzi, Emmanuel; Werners, Saskia E.; Van Slobbe, Erik; Long, Hoang P.; Ludwig, Fulco] Wageningen Univ, Water Syst & Global Change Grp, POB 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; [Nyamekye, Andy B.; Biesbroek, Robbert G.; Dewulf, Art; Termeer, Catrien J.

A key factor in such techniques is the capitalisation on the cooling potential of natural heat sinks. The sky, one such sink, has essentially limitless cooling power. In addition, its temperature on fair nights is lower than that of other environmental sinks (ground and air). The sky's promise in that respect prompted this exploration of the potential of nocturnal radiation cooling. A review of the state of the art revealed that in all the radiative dissipators developed and tested to date the dissipation fluid (water) transferred heat indirectly to the heat sink (the sky) by circulating water inside solar collector pipes. The highest values reported for maximum dissipation power were on the order of 100 W/m(2). The present study aimed to asses night time dissipation power in a dual system in which water circulated either inside pipes or flowed down the outer surface of the collector. The two modes, one involving in-pipe circulation and the other outer surface downflow, were compared experimentally, for whereas the former has been analysed and assessed by earlier researchers, the latter has not. The empirical findings verified that downflow setups enhanced cooling, delivering up to five-fold the dissipation power obtained with the conventional arrangement.","[Guerrero Delgado, MCarmen; Pavon Moreno, MCarmen; Alvarez Dominguez, Servando] Univ Seville, Escuela Super Ingenieros, Grp Termotecnia, Camino Descubrimientos S-N, Seville 41092, Spain; [Sanchez Ramos, Jose] Escuela Super Ingn, Maquinas & Motores Term, Ave Univ Cadiz 10, Puerto Real 11519, Spain; [Tenorio Rios, Jose Antonio] CSIC, Inst Ciencias Construcc Eduardo Torroja, Serrano Galvache 4, Madrid 28033, Spain",University of Sevilla; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Instituto de Ciencias de la Construccion Eduardo Torroja (IETCC),"Delgado, MG (corresponding author), Univ Seville, Escuela Super Ingenieros, Grp Termotecnia, Camino Descubrimientos S-N, Seville 41092, Spain.",mgdelgado@us.es,"Sánchez Ramos, José/G-1941-2010; Guerrero Delgado, MCarmen/D-4750-2017","Sánchez Ramos, José/0000-0001-8958-7247; Tenorio, Jose A./0000-0002-0273-3414; Guerrero Delgado, MCarmen/0000-0002-6723-0463",Spanish Ministry of the Economy and Competitiveness under DACAR project [BIA2016-77431-C2-2-R]; ERDF under Urban Innovative Actions programme CartujaQanat project [UIA03-301]; University of Seville under Research Plan VI (VPPI-US),Spanish Ministry of the Economy and Competitiveness under DACAR project; ERDF under Urban Innovative Actions programme CartujaQanat project; University of Seville under Research Plan VI (VPPI-US),This study was funded by the Spanish Ministry of the Economy and Competitiveness under DACAR project 'Zero-Energy Balance Districts through Algorithms of Adaptive Comfort and Optimal Management of Energy Networks' (BIA2016-77431-C2-2-R); the ERDF under Urban Innovative Actions programme CartujaQanat project (UIA03-301) 'Recovering Street life in a Climate-Changing World'; and the University of Seville under Research Plan VI (VPPI-US).,,49,6,6,7,20,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0196-8904,1879-2227,,ENERG CONVERS MANAGE,Energy Conv.

We found that the abundance of 1-year-old spring spawning herring is statistically significantly determined by the number of post-flexion herring larvae in the Gulf of Riga (Baltic Sea). The abundance of consecutive developmental stages of larvae: yolk-sac, pre-flexion, flexion and post-flexion strongly correlated with each other, indicating that factors which already influence the yolk-sac stage are important in determining the abundance of post-flexion herring larvae. Winter air temperature before spawning determined the timing of maximum abundance of pre-flexion herring larvae, but not their main prey: copepod nauplii, implying that different mechanisms governing major preconditions for the formation of year-class strength. The abundance of post-flexion larvae displayed a potential dome-shaped relationship with sea surface temperature experienced after hatching. We suggest that increased summer temperatures, which exceed the physiological optimum negatively, affect the survival of post-flexion herring larvae. Overall, future climate warming poses an additional risk to larval herring survival and this may lead to a reduction in those herring stock which rely on recruitment from shallow coastal areas.","[Arula, T.; Ojaveer, H.] Univ Tartu, Estonian Marine Inst, Lootsi 2a, EE-80012 Parnu, Estonia; [Raid, T.; Simm, M.] Univ Tartu, Estonian Marine Inst, Maealuse 14, EE-12618 Tallinn, Estonia",University of Tartu; Estonian Marine Institute; University of Tartu; Estonian Marine Institute,"Arula, T (corresponding author), Univ Tartu, Estonian Marine Inst, Lootsi 2a, EE-80012 Parnu, Estonia.",timo.arula@ut.ee,"Ojaveer, Henn/K-2160-2016; arula, timo/G-8710-2017","Ojaveer, Henn/0000-0003-2742-6063; arula, timo/0000-0001-9621-1168",Estonian Ministry of Education and Research [SF0180005s10]; Estonian Research Council [IUT02-20]; Estonian Science Foundation [8747]; BONUS (INSPIRE and BIO-C3 projects); joint Baltic Sea research and development programme [185]; European Union; Estonian Research Council,"Estonian Ministry of Education and Research(Ministry of Education and Research, Estonia); Estonian Research Council(Estonian Research Council); Estonian Science Foundation; BONUS (INSPIRE and BIO-C3 projects); joint Baltic Sea research and development programme; European Union(European Commission); Estonian Research Council(Estonian Research Council)","The authors would like to thank two anonymous reviewers and the editor for their comments that helped to improve the quality of the article.

The environmental strengths and weaknesses of seasonal full-pasture and indoor feeding systems were compared. The indoor herd performed significantly better than the pasture herd in three of thirteen impact categories. In contrast, the pasture herd performed better in seven of thirteen impact categories. A considerable weakness in the pasture herd was its higher methane emissions per kilogram of energy-corrected milk and the one-and-a-half times greater land requirement per kilogram of energy-corrected milk. The indoor herd had its main weaknesses in deforestation, the phosphorous and potassium resource requirements and higher ecotoxicity. The main causes for poor performance in these categories were maize and soybean meal.","[Sutter, Michael; Thomet, Peter] Hsch Agrar Forst & Lebensmittelwissensch, CH-3052 Zollikofen, Switzerland; [Nemecek, Thomas] Forsch Anstalt Agroscope Reckenholz Tanikon ART, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Research Station Agroscope; Swiss Federal Research Station for Agroecology & Agriculture,"Sutter, M (corresponding author), Hsch Agrar Forst & Lebensmittelwissensch, CH-3052 Zollikofen, Switzerland.",michael.sutter@bfh.ch,,"Nemecek, Thomas/0000-0001-8249-1170",,,,,11,6,6,1,19,AGRARFORSCHUNG,POSIEUX,"AGROSCOPE LIEBEFELD-POSIEUX, POSIEUX, CH-1725, SWITZERLAND",1663-7852,1663-7909,,AGRARFORSCH SCHWEIZ+,Agrarforschung Schweiz,MAY,2013,5,,,,230,237,,,,,,8,"Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,AQ9TC,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000343198300004,View Full Record in Web of Science

A new plant functional type (PFT) representing Miscanthus is also presented. The Miscanthus PFT fits well with growth parameters observed at a site in Lincolnshire, UK; however, global observed yields of Miscanthus are far more variable than is captured by the model, primarily owing to the model's lack of representation of crop age and establishment time. Global expansion of bioenergy crop areas under a 2 degrees C emissions scenario and balanced greenhouse gas mitigation strategy from the IMAGE integrated assessment model (RCP2.6-SSP2) achieves a mean yield of 4.3 billion tonnes of dry matter per year over 2040-2099, around 30% higher than the biomass availability projected by IMAGE.

Urban building energy modelling (UBEM) draws increasing attention in the energy modelling field due to its inherent capacities for modelling entire cities or building stocks, and the potential of varying data inputs, approaches and applications. This review aims to identify best practices and improvements for UBEM applications by examining previous research, with a focus on the currently least established approaches. Different archetype development procedures are analysed for common problems, six main under-developed input approaches or parameters are identified, and applications for future scenario development are surveyed. By analysing previous studies in related fields, this paper provides an overview of gaps in the published research and possible additions to future UBEM projects that can help expanding the existing modelling procedures. Comprehensive human behaviour models with additional aspects beyond occupant presence are identified as a major point of interest. Further research on socio-economic parameters, such as household income and demographics, are also suggested to further improve modelling. This study also underlines the potential for utilising UBEM as a tool for evaluating future climate change scenarios. (c) 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

By comparing simulations from nine state-of-the-art atmospheric general circulation models (AGCMs) driven by historical forcing fields with both observational data and five reanalysis datasets, the authors found that the AGCMs are unable to reproduce the change in the SH flux over the TP. This deficiency arises because the observed decreasing trend in SH flux depends primarily on the change in surface wind speed according to the bulk formula, whereas in the models it is also influenced largely by changes in the land-air temperature difference related to the systematic cold bias. In addition, an obvious discrepancy exists in other aspects of the diabatic heating simulated by the models, suggesting that a significant improvement is required in the physical schemes associated with land surface processes and diabatic heating over the complicated topography.","[Duan An-Min; Xiao Zhi-Xiang; Hu Jun] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, State Key Lab Numer Modelling Atmospher Sci & Geo, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Xiao Zhi-Xiang; Hu Jun] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Duan An-Min] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Minist Educ, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology","Duan, AM (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, State Key Lab Numer Modelling Atmospher Sci & Geo, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.",amduan@lasg.iap.ac.cn,"Duan, Anmin/AAJ-5389-2020",,"Strategic Priority Research Program-Climate Change: Carbon Budget and Related Issues of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA-05110303]; Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology [2010CB951703]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41175070]; Special Fund for Public Welfare Industry (meteorology) [GYHY201406001]; Key Laboratory of Meteorological Disaster, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Ministry of Education [KLME1309]","Strategic Priority Research Program-Climate Change: Carbon Budget and Related Issues of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology(Ministry of Science and Technology, China); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Special Fund for Public Welfare Industry (meteorology); Key Laboratory of Meteorological Disaster, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Ministry of Education","This work was supported jointly by the Strategic Priority Research Program-Climate Change: Carbon Budget and Related Issues of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Grant No. XDA-05110303), the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology (Grant No. 2010CB951703), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41175070), Special Fund for Public Welfare Industry (meteorology) administered by the Chinese Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Science and Technology (Grant No. GYHY201406001), and Key Laboratory of Meteorological Disaster, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Ministry of Education (Grand No. KLME1309).",,27,4,5,0,4,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1674-2834,2376-6123,,ATMOS OCEAN SCI LETT,Atmos.

In light of the frequent ventilation issues in the Lingnan area, this research suggests a successful ventilation technique using Jiangmen's Yunshan Poetic Moon Island houses as an example. With its symmetrical architectural layout of townhouses and its primary courtyard villa product, the community typifies the Lingnan area. First off, we discovered that the district's average temperature is as high as 30.95 degrees C and its average humidity is as high as 83.592%RH using actual measurements and simulation of heat and humidity data. The district's buildings' issues with dampness, peeling walls, and substance mold are primarily caused by poor ventilation. Secondly, the PHOENICS program was used to provide efficient ventilation solutions for the following six aspects: external wind infusion organization, group orientation layout, planar grouping optimization, building facade combination, monolithic building openings, and indoor ventilation block. In order to determine if the technique is effective, the ventilation variables are compared before and after optimization using the Building Ventilation Effectiveness Test and Evaluation Criteria. The study concluded that the building's architectural characteristics and the local climate have an impact on natural ventilation's effectiveness.

Today's state-of-the art materials for application as EBCs are rare-earth (RE) silicates which, however, form amorphous phases upon rapid quenching from the melt. This makes their processing by thermal spray a challenge. Recently, high velocity oxygen fuel (HVOF) spraying was proposed as potential solution since the melting degree of the feedstock can be controlled effectively. This work studies the deposition of ytterbium disilicate (YbDS) at short stand-off distances and variant total feed rates and oxy-fuel ratios of the working gas. It was found that the overall degree of crystallinity could be kept at high level above 90%. The kinetic energy transferred by impinging particles was found to be an effective parameter to control the densification of the coatings. Porosities well below 10% were achieved while fully dense coatings were impeded due to the progressive accumulation of stresses in the coatings.","[Wolf, Markus; Mack, Daniel Emil; Mauer, Georg; Guillon, Olivier; Vassen, Robert] Forschungszentrum Julich GmbH, Inst Energy & Climate Res Mat Synth & Proc IEK 1, D-52425 Julich, Germany; [Wolf, Markus; Vassen, Robert] Ruhr Univ Bochum, Inst Werkstoffe, Bochum, Germany; [Guillon, Olivier] Julich Aachen Res Alliance JARA Energy, Julich, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Research Center Julich; Ruhr University Bochum,"Mack, DE (corresponding author), Forschungszentrum Julich GmbH, Inst Energy & Climate Res Mat Synth & Proc IEK 1, D-52425 Julich, Germany.",d.e.mack@fz-juelich.de,,"Mauer, Georg/0000-0002-0840-8006",MTU Aero Engines AG [Z0609.21.18],MTU Aero Engines AG,The authors acknowledge financial support from MTU Aero Engines AG under contract Z0609.21.18.,,22,1,1,3,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1546-542X,1744-7402,,INT J APPL CERAM TEC,Int.

In order to further elucidate regional patterns in parasitic infection in the Roman empire, we looked for evidence for parasites in sites from Anatolia and the Balkans. Sediment samples from drains as well as coprolites were studied to find evidence for intestinal parasites in the Roman cities of Viminacium (Serbia) and Sardis (Turkey), and results were combined with previous work in these regions. Each sample was tested for preserved helminth (worm) eggs using microscopy and for intestinal protozoa that cause diarrhea, using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Our analysis revealed a predominance of species spread by the contamination of food and water by human feces, namely roundworm and whipworm. The identification of these parasites (which are linked to sanitation and hygiene) in Roman cities in Anatolia and the Balkans is contrasted with the range of zoonotic species found elsewhere in the empire. It appears that variations in cooking practices, diet, urbanization, and climate throughout the empire may have contributed to differences in gastrointestinal diseases in different regions.(1)","[Ledger, Marissa L.; Mitchell, Piers D.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Archaeol, Henry Wellcome Bldg,Fitzwilliam St, Cambridge CB2 1QH, England; [Rowan, Erica] Royal Holloway Univ London, Dept Class, Egham, Surrey, England; [Marques, Frances Gallart] Harvard Art Museums, Cambridge, MA USA; [Sigmier, John H.] Univ Penn, Art & Archaeol Mediterranean World Grad Grp, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Sarkic, Natasa] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Biol, Madrid, Spain; [Redzic, Sasa] Inst Archaeol, Belgrade, Serbia; [Cahill, Nicholas D.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Art Hist, Madison, WI USA",University of Cambridge; University of London; Royal Holloway University London; Harvard University; University of Pennsylvania; Autonomous University of Madrid; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Ledger, ML (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Archaeol, Henry Wellcome Bldg,Fitzwilliam St, Cambridge CB2 1QH, England.",,,,"Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada Doctoral Award [752-2016-285]; Tidmarsh Cambridge Scholarship from The Cambridge Commonwealth, European and International Trust; Trinity Hall College, University of Cambridge","Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada Doctoral Award; Tidmarsh Cambridge Scholarship from The Cambridge Commonwealth, European and International Trust; Trinity Hall College, University of Cambridge","We would like to thank TechLab, Inc., for donation of the ELISA kits used in this study.

This study addresses three challenges in nutrient modeling for rivers in China: (1) difficulties in transferring modeling results across biophysical and administrative scales, (2) poor representation of the locations of point sources, and (3) limited incorporation of the direct discharge of manure to rivers. The objective of this study is, therefore, to quantify inputs of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) to Chinese rivers from different sources at multiple scales. We developed a novel multi-scale modeling approach including a detailed, state-of-the-art representation of point sources of nutrients in rivers. The model results show that the river pollution and source attributions differ among spatial scales. Point sources accounted for 75% of the total dissolved phosphorus (TDP) inputs to rivers in China in 2012, and diffuse sources accounted for 72% of the total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) inputs. One-third of the sub-basins accounted for more than half of the pollution. Downscaling to the smallest scale (polygons) reveals that 14% and 9% of the area contribute to more than half of the calculated TDN and TDP pollution, respectively. Sources of pollution vary considerably among and within counties. Clearly, multi-scale modeling may help to develop effective policies for water pollution.","[Chen, Xi; Bai, Zhaohai; Ma, Lin] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Agr Resources Res, Inst Genet & Dev Biol, Key Lab Agr Water Resources,Hebei Key Lab Soil Ec, 286 Huaizhong Rd, Shijiazhuang 050021, Hebei, Peoples R China; [Chen, Xi; Strokal, Maryna; Van Vliet, Michelle T.

The understanding and assessment of the failure time and thus the reliability becomes more and more important as the dimensions in the printed circuit boards decrease and the applied voltages increase. Once the epoxy/glass fiber interface is degraded in the printed circuit board, the additional time to form either Conducting Anodic Filaments (CAF) or dendrites depends also on the electric field. This electric field, as the main driving force, was computed on virtually constructed rough surfaces to take the real copper/prepreg interface into account before the onset of corrosion. It was shown, that roughness peaks increase the local maximum electric field, which follows a E = U/d0.63-relation that is underestimated in the state-of-the-art approach. Furthermore, it was found that the material dependent parameters can be related to the tortuosity of the possible short circuit path and the ion mobility in the material. The enhanced model for the determination of the failure time will facilitate the fitting and interpretation of future testing procedures.","[Reiss, Georg; Kosednar-Legenstein, Barbara; Riedler, Johann; Essl, Werner] Mat Ctr Leoben Forsch GmbH, Roseggerstr 12, A-8700 Leoben, Austria",Materials Center Leoben Forschungs GmbH,"Reiss, G (corresponding author), Mat Ctr Leoben Forsch GmbH, Roseggerstr 12, A-8700 Leoben, Austria.",georg.reiss@mcl.at,"Reiss, Georg/O-9742-2015; Eßl, Werner/B-5458-2013","Reiss, Georg/0000-0001-5058-4225; ","COMET program within the K2 Center Integrated Computational Material, Process and Product Engineering (IC-MPPE) [859480]; Austrian Federal Ministries for Climate Action, Environment, Energy, Mobility, Innovationand Technology (BMK); Digital and Economic Affairs (BMDW) by the Austrian research funding association (FFG); federal state of Styria; federal state of Upper Austria; federal state of Tyrol","COMET program within the K2 Center Integrated Computational Material, Process and Product Engineering (IC-MPPE); Austrian Federal Ministries for Climate Action, Environment, Energy, Mobility, Innovationand Technology (BMK); Digital and Economic Affairs (BMDW) by the Austrian research funding association (FFG); federal state of Styria; federal state of Upper Austria; federal state of Tyrol","The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support under the scope of the COMET program within the K2 Center Integrated Computational Material, Process and Product Engineering (IC-MPPE) (Project No 859480).

However, programming and configuring robots is time and resource consuming while being also accompanied by high costs that are especially challenging for small- and medium-sized enterprises. The current way of programming industrial robots by using teach-in control devices and/or using vendor-specific programming languages is in general a complex activity that requires extensive knowledge in the robotics domain. It is therefore important to offer new practical methods for the programming of industrial robots that provide flexibility and versatility in order to achieve feasible robotics solutions for small lot size productions. This paper focuses on the development of a knowledge-driven framework, which should overcome the limitations of state-of-the-art robotics solutions and enhance the agility and autonomy of industrial robotics systems using ontologies as a knowledge-source. The framework includes reasoning and perception abilities as well as the ability to generate plans, select appropriate actions, and finally execute these actions. In this context, a challenge is the fusion of vision system information with the decision-making component, which can use this information for generating the assembly tasks and executable programs. The introduced product model in the form of an ontology enables that the framework can semantically link perception data to product models to consequently derive handling operations and required tools. Besides, the framework enables an easier adaption of robot-based production systems for individualized production, which requires swift configuration and efficient planning. The presented approach is demonstrated in a laboratory environment with an industrial pilot test case. Our application shows the potential to reduce the efforts needed to program robots in an automated production environment. In this context, the benefits as well as shortcomings of the approach are also discussed in the paper.","[Hoebert, Timon; Lepuschitz, Wilfried; Merdan, Munir] Pract Robot Inst Austria, Vienna, Austria; [Vincze, Markus] Vienna Univ Technol, Automat & Control Inst, Vision4Robot Grp, Vienna, Austria",Technische Universitat Wien,"Merdan, M (corresponding author), Pract Robot Inst Austria, Vienna, Austria.",merdan@pria.at,,,"Production of the Future program of the Austrian Ministry for Climate Action, Environment, Energy, Mobility, Innovation and Technology [FFG 858707]; netidee program of the Internet Foundation Austria [4647]","Production of the Future program of the Austrian Ministry for Climate Action, Environment, Energy, Mobility, Innovation and Technology; netidee program of the Internet Foundation Austria","The authors acknowledge the financial support from the Production of the Future program of the Austrian Ministry for Climate Action, Environment, Energy, Mobility, Innovation and Technology under contract FFG 858707 as well as from the netidee program of the Internet Foundation Austria under contract no. 4647.

Our electrocatalyst was evaluated for the OER in a single electrolysis cell, and it showed an improvement in electrocatalytic performance over time, reaching the current density of commercial IrO2 after 500 h of the stability test, despite half the catalyst loading. Our innovative synthesis approach provides the flexibility to tailor and improve the aerogel structures for other electrochemical devices as well, for example, photoelectrolysis, sensors, and more.

The initial distribution of soil organic matter between these pools influences the simulations. Like many other soil organic carbon models, the DAYCENT model is initialised by assuming equilibrium at the beginning of the simulation. However, as we show here, the initial distribution of soil organic matter between the different pools has an appreciable influence on simulations, and the appropriate distribution is dependent on the climate and management at the site before the onset of a simulated experiment. If the soil is not in equilibrium, the only way to initialise the model is to simulate the pre-experimental period of the site. Most often, the site history, in terms of land use and land management is often poorly defined at site level, and entirely unknown at regional level. Our objective was to identify a method that can be applied to initialise a model when the soil is not in equilibrium and historic data are not available, and which quantifies the uncertainty associated with initial soil carbon distribution. We demonstrate a method that uses Bayesian calibration by means of the Accept-Reject algorithm, and use this method to calibrate the initial distribution of soil organic carbon pools against observed soil respiration measurements. It was shown that, even in short-term simulations, model initialisation can have a major influence on the simulated results. The Bayesian calibration method quantified and reduced the uncertainties in initial carbon distribution. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Sensitivity Analysis (SA) provides an essential means for understanding the role and importance of these factors in producing model responses. However, conventional approaches to SA suffer from (1) an ambiguous characterization of sensitivity, and (2) poor computational efficiency, particularly as the problem dimension grows. Here, we present a new and general sensitivity analysis framework (called VARS), based on an analogy to variogram analysis,'' that provides an intuitive and comprehensive characterization of sensitivity across the full spectrum of scales in the factor space. We prove, theoretically, that Morris (derivative-based) and Sobol (variance-based) methods and their extensions are special cases of VARS, and that their SA indices can be computed as by-products of the VARS framework. Synthetic functions that resemble actual model response surfaces are used to illustrate the concepts, and show VARS to be as much as two orders of magnitude more computationally efficient than the state-of-the-art Sobol approach. In a companion paper, we propose a practical implementation strategy, and demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, and reliability (robustness) of the VARS framework on real-data case studies.","[Razavi, Saman] Univ Saskatchewan, Global Inst Water Secur, Saskatoon, SK, Canada; [Razavi, Saman] Univ Saskatchewan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, Saskatoon, SK, Canada; [Razavi, Saman] Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Civil & Geol Engn, Saskatoon, SK, Canada; [Gupta, Hoshin V.] Univ Arizona, Dept Hydrol & Water Resources, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA",University of Saskatchewan; Global Institute for Water Security; University of Saskatchewan; University of Saskatchewan; University of Arizona,"Razavi, S (corresponding author), Univ Saskatchewan, Global Inst Water Secur, Saskatoon, SK, Canada.;Razavi, S (corresponding author), Univ Saskatchewan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, Saskatoon, SK, Canada.;Razavi, S (corresponding author), Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Civil & Geol Engn, Saskatoon, SK, Canada.",saman.razavi@usask.ca,"Gupta, Hoshin V/D-1642-2010; Razavi, Saman S/L-3725-2013; Gupta, Hoshin V/CAG-5323-2022","Gupta, Hoshin V/0000-0001-9855-2839; Razavi, Saman S/0000-0003-1870-5810; Gupta, Hoshin V/0000-0001-9855-2839",University of Saskatchewan's Global Institute for Water Security and Howard Wheater; Canada Excellence Research Chair in Water Security; Australian Research Council through the Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science [CE110001028]; EU [294947],University of Saskatchewan's Global Institute for Water Security and Howard Wheater; Canada Excellence Research Chair in Water Security; Australian Research Council through the Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science(Australian Research Council); EU(European Commission),"The first author is thankful to the University of Saskatchewan's Global Institute for Water Security and Howard Wheater, the Canada Excellence Research Chair in Water Security, for encouragement and support.

These technologies include solid oxide cells (SOCs), which can be operated as electrolyzers to generate hydrogen or syngas and/or for power supply in fuel cell mode and demonstrate the highest electrical efficiency among electrochemical converters. However, SOCs like other energy technologies contain significant amounts of critical raw materials, which should be preserved appropriately. Therefore, the development of economically viable recycling strategies is required even at an early market entry stage. In this paper, potential recycling routes for SOC stack components are discussed. Based on state-of-the-art materials and cell designs, the future challenges related to SOC recycling are outlined, and possible recycling pathways for all SOC components are presented with an emphasis on the ceramic fractions. Their economic and environmental potentials are evaluated, showing the significant advantages offered by recycling.","[Sarner, Stephan; Menzler, Norbert H.; Guillon, Olivier] Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Energy & Climate Res IEK, IEK 1 Mat Synth & Proc, Wilhelm Johnen Str, D-52425 Julich, Germany; [Sarner, Stephan; Menzler, Norbert H.; Guillon, Olivier] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Inst Mineral Engn GHI, Forckenbeckstr 33, D-52074 Aachen, Germany; [Schreiber, Andrea] Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Energy & Climate Res IEK, IEK STE Syst Anal & Technol Evaluat, Wilhelm Johnen Str, D-52425 Julich, Germany; [Guillon, Olivier] JARA Julich Aachen Res Alliance, D-52428 Julich, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Research Center Julich; RWTH Aachen University; Helmholtz Association; Research Center Julich,"Menzler, NH (corresponding author), Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Energy & Climate Res IEK, IEK 1 Mat Synth & Proc, Wilhelm Johnen Str, D-52425 Julich, Germany.;Menzler, NH (corresponding author), Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Inst Mineral Engn GHI, Forckenbeckstr 33, D-52074 Aachen, Germany.",n.h.menzler@fz-juelich.de,,,German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) via the Helmholtz Association; project ReNaRe as part of the technology platform H2Giga - BMBF [03HY111J]; German Research Foundation (DFG) [491111487]; Projekt DEAL,German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) via the Helmholtz Association(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); project ReNaRe as part of the technology platform H2Giga - BMBF(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Projekt DEAL,"The authors are grateful for the basic funding provided by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) via the Helmholtz Association.

This chapter presents some historical background to the concept, with particular attention paid to its assumed opposite, the 'linear' or growth economy. While the origins of the circular economy concept are to be found in 1960s environmentalism, the chapter draws attention to the influence of the then 'new' sciences of ecology and 'cybernetics' in shaping the public environmental discourse of the period. It also draws attention to the background of the present linear economy in postwar policies that encouraged reconstruction and a social and economic democratisation across the West, including an expansion of mass-consumption. It emphasises the role of the 1960s counterculture in generating a popular reaction against this expansionary growth-based agenda, and its influence in shaping subsequent environmentalism, including the 'metabolic' and ecological economic understanding of the environmental crisis that informs the concept of the circular economy. Reflecting upon this historical preamble, the chapter concludes that more attention should be paid to the economic, cultural and social contexts of consumption, now more clearly the main driver of our global environmental crisis. Without now engaging more directly with the 'consumption problem', the chapter argues, it seems unlikely that the goals of the circular economy can be met.","[Crocker, Robert] Univ South Australia, Sch Art Architecture & Design, China Australia Ctr Sustainable Urban Dev, Adelaide, SA, Australia",University of South Australia,"Crocker, R (corresponding author), Univ South Australia, Sch Art Architecture & Design, China Australia Ctr Sustainable Urban Dev, Adelaide, SA, Australia.",,"Crocker, Robert/B-2004-2012","Crocker, Robert/0000-0003-3497-9934",,,,,145,3,3,0,3,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY, W YORKSHIRE BD16 1WA, ENGLAND",,,978-1-78714-619-8; 978-1-78714-620-4,,,,2018,,,,,13,33,,10.1108/978-1-78714-619-820181003,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/978-1-78714-619-820181003,,,21,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Book Citation Index – Social Sciences & Humanities (BKCI-SSH); Book Citation Index – Science (BKCI-S),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BP8RZ,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000566844800003,View Full Record in Web of Science

The main goal is to reveal the principles of personal wellbeing through observing and analyzing traditional Nenets fur coat and footwear together with the actual experiences of making and using clothing items. For that, we draw from the existing pool of research on functional parameters tested and evaluated in a lab and our empirical data (interviews and participant observations 2013-2016), to eventually come up with two interwoven concepts of clothing based on bio- and cultural mimesis. On the one hand, traditional fur clothing is the result of the biomimetic appropriation of natural abilities of reindeer to withstand severe climates. On the other, it is the embodiment of knowledge on the environment and skills acquired through the dynamic relationship between tools, materials, and personal identities of makers and wearers. This conceptualization, we argue, provides insights into how to both support the very existence in the extreme/severe environment and contribute to personal wellbeing. We conclude by proposing directions for further research towards developing design standards for the emerging multicultural community of Arctic newcomers.","[Usenyuk-Kravchuk, Svetlana; Garin, Nikolai; Trofimenko, Alexandra] Ural State Univ Architecture & Art, Arctic Design Sch, 23 K Liebknecht St, Ekaterinburg 620075, Russia; [Kukanov, Denis] RAS, Peter Great Museum Anthropol & Ethnog Kunstkamera, 3 Univ Emb, St Petersburg 199034, Russia",Ural State University of Architecture & Art; Russian Academy of Sciences; The Kunstkamera,"Usenyuk-Kravchuk, S (corresponding author), Ural State Univ Architecture & Art, Arctic Design Sch, 23 K Liebknecht St, Ekaterinburg 620075, Russia.",svetlana.usenyuk@gmail.com,"Usenyuk-Kravchuk, Svetlana/F-1659-2017; Kukanov, Denis/AAN-3292-2020","Usenyuk-Kravchuk, Svetlana/0000-0002-9239-817X; Kukanov, Denis/0000-0002-7219-4145; Garin, Nikolai/0000-0003-2274-9250","Ella ja Georg Ehrnroothin saatio, Finland; Russian Science Foundation [14-18-01882, 17-78-20047]","Ella ja Georg Ehrnroothin saatio, Finland; Russian Science Foundation(Russian Science Foundation (RSF))","This work was funded in two steps, as follows: funding for the fieldwork stage came from the Ella ja Georg Ehrnroothin saatio, Finland (project Visualizing Arctic Mobility, funding decision 12.05.2012), and the Russian Science Foundation (project Mobility in the Arctic: Ethnic Traditions and Technological Innovations, grant 14-18-01882).

These models are: (1) a composite model system consisting of SWAN implemented within WAVEWATCHIII((R)) (the latter is hereafter, WW3) on a nested system of traditional structured grids, (2) an unstructured grid finite-volume wave model denoted SWAVE, using SWAN physics, and (3) an unstructured grid finite element wind wave model denoted as WWM (for wind wave model) which uses WW3 physics. Models are implemented on grid systems that include relatively large domains to capture the wave energy generated by the storms, as well as including fine-resolution nearshore regions of the southern Gulf of Maine with resolution on the scale of 25 m to simulate areas where inundation and coastal damage have occurred, due to the storms. Storm cases include three intense midlatitude cases: a spring Nor'easter storm in May 2005, the Patriot's Day storm in 2007, and the Boxing Day storm in 2010. Although these wave model systems have comparable overall properties in terms of their performance and skill, it is found that there are differences.

In this work, this dataset is evaluated using the wind kinetic energy spectrum. Seasonal climatologies are generated for 30 degrees latitudinal bands in the Northern Hemisphere (periodic domain) and over the North Atlantic area (limited-area domain). The spectra are also assessed to determine the effective resolution of the reanalysis. The results present notable differences between the latitudinal domains, indicating that ERA5 is properly capturing the synoptic conditions. The seasonal variability is adequate too, being winter the most energetic, and summer the least energetic season. The limited area domain results introduce a larger energy density and range. Despite the good results for the synoptic scales, the reanalysis' spectra are not able to properly reproduce the dissipation rates at mesoscale. This is a source of uncertainties which needs to be taken into account when using the dataset. Finally, a cyclone tropical transition is presented as a case study. The spectrum generated shows a clear difference in energy density at every wavelength, as expected for a highly-energetic status of the atmosphere.","[Bolgiani, P.; Diaz-Fernandez, J.; Quitian-Hernandez, L.; Sastre, M.; Gonzalez-Aleman, J.

Its realization is caught in the field of tension between the economical and socio-political framework. Under the heading Merit Order Netz-Ausbau 2030 (Merit Order Network-Expansion 2030 - MONA 2030), a comparison of measures and technologies for grid optimization is currently carried out, especially concerning the increased feed-in of renewable energies and the additional existence of new loads (such as electric vehicles) in the transmission and distribution grids. Previous studies have shown that voltage problems in distribution grids only occur in a few hours per year. However, the grids have to be dimensioned for those few hours and therefore; an expensive construction of lines, controllable local grid transformers and other components is taking place at the moment. An intelligent charge management of electric vehicles that would only be necessary for a few hours, would not only reduce the constructional effort, but could also reduce costs. Additional positive effects of electric mobility in comparison to other grid optimizing measures can reside in the increased acceptance among society and positive ecological impacts. The aim is to compare the different state-of-the-art options in a clearly arranged and striking manner. Especially for grid operators, but also for (local) energy suppliers and systems providers, alternatives regarding an useful added value to the grid planning should be demonstrated. This paper provides an overview on currently existing grid optimizing measures. Additionally a classification of all grid optimizing measures concerning more than 60 relevant criteria have been performed by applying jj the morphological box method by Fritz Zwicky. An analysis of electric mobility as a grid optimizing measure helps to understand the concept of the proposed holistic comparison.","[Samweber, Florian; Fattler, Steffen; Koppl, Simon] Res Ctr Energy Econ FfE, Munich, Germany",,"Samweber, F (corresponding author), Res Ctr Energy Econ FfE, Munich, Germany.",,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,1,SPRINGER VS/SPRINGER FACHMEDIEN,WIESBADEN,"ABRAHAM-LINCOLN-STRASSE 46, WIESBADEN, 65189, GERMANY",2198-7432,2198-7440,978-3-658-15443-1; 978-3-658-15442-4,PROC-SPR VIEWEG,,,2017,,,,,269,286,,10.1007/978-3-658-15443-1_22,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-658-15443-1_22,,,18,"Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Engineering, Civil; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Transportation Science & Technology",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Engineering; Transportation,BM4WC,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000464092100019,View Full Record in Web of Science

At the western range margin of D.torquatus, these changes were characterized by a series of local extinctions and recolonizations. However, it is unclear whether this pattern represents a local phenomenon, possibly driven by ecological edge effects, or a global phenomenon that took place across large geographical scales. To address this, we explored the palaeogenetic history of the collared lemming using a next-generation sequencing approach for pooled mitochondrial DNA amplicons. Sequences were obtained from over 300 fossil remains sampled across Eurasia and two sites in North America. We identified five mitochondrial lineages of D.torquatus that succeeded each other through time across Europe and western Russia, indicating a history of repeated population extinctions and recolonizations, most likely from eastern Russia, during the last 50000years. The observation of repeated extinctions across such a vast geographical range indicates large-scale changes in the steppe-tundra environment in western Eurasia during the last glaciation. AllHolocene samples, from across the species' entire range, belonged to only one of the five mitochondrial lineages. Thus, extant D.torquatus populations only harbour a small fraction of the total genetic diversity that existed across different stages of the Late Pleistocene. In North American samples, haplotypes belonging to both D.groenlandicus and D.richardsoni were recovered from a Late Pleistocene site in south-western Canada. This suggests that D.groenlandicus had a more southern and D.richardsoni a more northern glacial distribution than previously thought. This study provides significant insights into the population dynamics of a small mammal at a large geographical scale and reveals a rather complex demographical history, which could have had bottom-up effects in the Late Pleistocene steppe-tundra ecosystem.","[Palkopoulou, Eleftheria; Nystroem, Johanna; Ersmark, Erik; Dalen, Love] Swedish Museum Nat Hist, Dept Bioinformat & Genet, S-10405 Stockholm, Sweden; [Palkopoulou, Eleftheria; Ersmark, Erik] Stockholm Univ, Dept Zool, S-10405 Stockholm, Sweden; [Baca, Mateusz] Univ Warsaw, Ctr Precolumbian Studies, Krakowskie Przedmiescie 26-28, PL-00927 Warsaw, Poland; [Abramson, Natalia I.; Sablin, Mikhail] Russian Acad Sci, Inst Zool, St Petersburg 199034, Russia; [Socha, Pawel] Univ Wroclaw, Dept Palaeozool, Inst Environm Biol, Sienkiewicza Str 21, PL-50335 Wroclaw, Poland; [Nadachowski, Adam] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Systemat & Evolut Animals, Slawkowska Str 17, PL-31016 Krakow, Poland; [Prost, Stefan] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Prost, Stefan] Univ Otago, Dept Anat & Struct Biol, Allan Wilson Ctr Mol Ecol & Evolut, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand; [Germonpre, Mietje] Royal Belgian Inst Nat Sci, Operat Direct Earth & Hist Life, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium; [Kosintsev, Pavel; Smirnov, Nickolay G.] Russian Acad Sci, Inst Plant & Anim Ecol, 202 8 Marta St, Ekaterinburg 620144, Russia; [Vartanyan, Sergey] Russian Acad Sci, Northeast Interdisciplinary Res Inst, Far East Branch, Magadan 685000, Russia; [Ponomarev, Dmitry] Russian Acad Sci, Lab Paleontol, Inst Geol, Komi Sci Ctr, 54 Pervomayskaya St, Syktyvkar 167982, Russia; [Nikolskiy, Pavel] Russian Acad Sci, Inst Geol, Pyzhevsky Pereulok 7, Moscow 119017, Russia; [Jass, Christopher N.] Royal Alberta Museum, 12845 102 Ave, Edmonton, AB T5N 0M6, Canada; [Litvinov, Yuriy N.] Russian Acad Sci, Inst Systemat & Ecol Anim, Siberian Branch, Frunze Str 11, Novosibirsk 630091, Russia; [Kalthoff, Daniela C.] Swedish Museum Nat Hist, Dept Zool, S-10405 Stockholm, Sweden; [Grigoriev, Semyon] North Eastern Fed Univ, Mammoth Museum, Inst Appl Ecol North, 48 Kulakovskogo St, Yakutsk 677000, Russia; [Fadeeva, Tatyana] Russian Acad Sci, Min Inst, 78A Sibirskaya St, Perm 614007, Russia; [Douka, Aikaterini; Higham, Thomas F.

In this paper, we propose a decomposition method for synthesis problems using time-series aggregation. To initialize the method, the time series is aggregated to one time step. A lower bound is obtained by relaxing the energy balances and underestimating the energy demands leading to a relaxed synthesis problem, which is efficiently solvable. An upper bound is obtained by restricting the original problem with the full time series to an operation problem with a fixed structure obtained from the lower bound solution. If the bounds do not satisfy the specified optimality gap, the resolution of the time-series aggregation is iteratively increased. The decomposition method is applied to two real-world synthesis problems. The results show the fast convergence of the decomposition method outperforming commercial state-of-the-art optimization software. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Polyhydroxyalkanoates are synthesized in bacteria in response to stress conditions. Thus, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of medium-chain-length polyhydroxyalkanoates (mcl-PHA) in transgenic flax Linum usitatissimum L. on plant growth, physiology and resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses. Flax is a valuable crop plant cultivated in a temperate climate. The subjects of this study were flax plants obtained via overexpression of the medium-chain-length polyhydroxyalkanoate (mcl-PHA) synthase gene from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Modified flax plants grown in salt stress conditions showed higher biomass in comparison to wild-type plants. Salt stress did not cause the degradation of chlorophylls and carotenoids in transgenic flax plants in comparison to wild-type plants. The tested engineered plants also showed twofold higher resistance to diseases caused by Fusarium oxysporum, the main flax pathogen. Synthesis of mcl-PHA influenced amino acids profile, thus reduced the contents of glutamate and slightly elevated proline and arginine level were determined especially in a selected line (#11), exhibiting the highest mcl-PHA level and the highest measured resistance to pathogenic fungi and salinity. Performed biochemical analyses did not indicate the statistically important changes in the level of metabolites with antioxidant properties as flavonoids and phenolic compounds. Finally, synthesis of mcl-PHAs, and accompanying enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging ability caused improvement of salt tolerance and fungal resistance in genetically modified flax plants. Because soil salinization remains a real problem in many areas of the world and Fusarium is the main pathogen for flax, the analyzed flax plants with overexpression of mcl-PHA synthase have high potential for agriculture, especially from an economic point of view. Key message mcl-PHA synthesis improved tolerance of flax to salinity and fungal resistance. The direct reason for higher plant resistance to the stresses may be improved anti-oxidative potential and presence of polymers.","[Wrobel-Kwiatkowska, Magdalena; Rymowicz, Waldemar] Wroclaw Univ Environm & Life Sci, Dept Biotechnol & Food Microbiol, Wroclaw, Poland; [Slupczynska, Maja] Wroclaw Univ Environm & Life Sci, Dept Anim Nutr & Feed Sci, Wroclaw, Poland",Wroclaw University of Environmental & Life Sciences; Wroclaw University of Environmental & Life Sciences,"Wrobel-Kwiatkowska, M (corresponding author), Wroclaw Univ Environm & Life Sci, Dept Biotechnol & Food Microbiol, Wroclaw, Poland.",magdalena.wrobel-kwiatkowska@upwr.edu.pl,"Wróbel-Kwiatkowska, Magdalena/AAE-3629-2019","Wróbel-Kwiatkowska, Magdalena/0000-0002-9511-1381",Leading Research Groups support project,Leading Research Groups support project,"The publication is financed under the Leading Research Groups support project from the subsidy increased for the period 2020-2025 in the amount of 2% of the subsidy referred to in Art. 387 (3) of the Law of 20 July 2018 on Higher Education and Science, obtained in 2019.

Drought effect on vegetation Gross Primary Production (GPP) is usually modeled as a function of Vapor Pressure Deficit (VPD) and/or soil moisture. Climate projections suggest a strong likelihood of increasing trend in VPD, while regional changes in precipitation are less certain. This difference in projections between VPD and precipitation can cause considerable discrepancies in the predictions of vegetation behavior depending on how ecosystem models represent the drought effect. In this study, we scrutinized the model responses to drought using the 30-year record of Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS) 3g Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) dataset. A diagnostic ecosystem model, Terrestrial Observation and Prediction System (TOPS), was used to estimate global GPP from 1982 to 2009 under nine different experimental simulations. The control run of global GPP increased until 2000, but stayed constant after 2000. Among the simulations with single climate constraint (temperature, VPD, rainfall and solar radiation), only the VPD-driven simulation showed a decrease in 2000s, while the other scenarios simulated an increase in GPP. The diverging responses in 2000s can be attributed to the difference in the representation of the impact of water stress on vegetation in models, i.e., using VPD and/or precipitation. Spatial map of trend in simulated GPP using GIMMS 3g data is consistent with the GPP driven by soil moisture than the GPP driven by VPD, confirming the need for a soil moisture constraint in modeling global GPP.","[Hashimoto, Hirofumi; Wang, Weile; Milesi, Cristina] Calif State Univ Monterey Bay, Div Sci & Environm Policy, Seaside, CA 93955 USA; [Hashimoto, Hirofumi; Wang, Weile; Milesi, Cristina; Xiong, Jun; Ganguly, Sangram; Nemani, Ramakrishna R.] NASA, Ames Res Ctr, Moffett Field, CA 94035 USA; [Ganguly, Sangram] Bay Area Environm Res Inst, Sonoma, CA 95476 USA; [Zhu, Zaichun] Boston Univ, Dept Earth & Environm, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Zhu, Zaichun] Beijing Normal Univ, Coll Resources Sci & Technol, State Key Lab Earth Proc & Resource Ecol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China",California State University System; California State University Monterey Bay; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Ames Research Center; Boston University; Beijing Normal University,"Hashimoto, H (corresponding author), Calif State Univ Monterey Bay, Div Sci & Environm Policy, Seaside, CA 93955 USA.",hirofumi.hashimoto@gmail.com; weile.wang@gmail.com; sangramganguly@gmail.com; zhu.zaichum@gmail.com; rama.nemani@nasa.gov,"Zhu, Zaichun/ABD-2040-2021; ganguly, sangram/B-5108-2010; Zhu, Zaichun/I-5374-2014","Zhu, Zaichun/0000-0001-5235-5194; Zhu, Zaichun/0000-0001-5235-5194; Hashimoto, Hirofumi/0000-0001-7706-1854",NASA,NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)),"We wish to thank Compton J.

These models typically rely on high-quality data for rainfall and surface characteristics of the catchment area as model input. While recent research in urban drainage has been focusing on providing spatially detailed rainfall data, the technological advances in remote sensing that ease the acquisition of detailed land-use information are less prominently discussed within the community. The relevance of such methods increases as in many parts of the globe, accurate land-use information is generally lacking, because detailed image data are often unavailable. Modern unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) allow one to acquire high-resolution images on a local level at comparably lower cost, performing on-demand repetitive measurements and obtaining a degree of detail tailored for the purpose of the study. In this study, we investigate for the first time the possibility of deriving high-resolution imperviousness maps for urban areas from UAV imagery and of using this information as input for urban drainage models. To do so, an automatic processing pipeline with a modern classification method is proposed and evaluated in a state-of-the-art urban drainage modelling exercise. In a real-life case study (Lucerne, Switzerland), we compare imperviousness maps generated using a fixed-wing consumer micro-UAV and standard large-format aerial images acquired by the Swiss national mapping agency (swisstopo). After assessing their overall accuracy, we perform an end-to-end comparison, in which they are used as an input for an urban drainage model. Then, we evaluate the influence which different image data sources and their processing methods have on hydrological and hydraulic model performance. We analyse the surface runoff of the 307 individual subcatchments regarding relevant attributes, such as peak runoff and runoff volume. Finally, we evaluate the model's channel flow prediction performance through a cross-comparison with reference flow measured at the catchment outlet. We show that imperviousness maps generated from UAV images processed with modern classification methods achieve an accuracy comparable to standard, off-the-shelf aerial imagery. In the examined case study, we find that the different imperviousness maps only have a limited influence on predicted surface runoff and pipe flows, when traditional workflows are used. We expect that they will have a substantial influence when more detailed modelling approaches are employed to characterize land use and to predict surface runoff. We conclude that UAV imagery represents a valuable alternative data source for urban drainage model applications due to the possibility of flexibly acquiring up-to-date aerial images at a quality compared with off-the-shelf image products and a competitive price at the same time. We believe that in the future, urban drainage models representing a higher degree of spatial detail will fully benefit from the strengths of UAV imagery.","[Tokarczyk, P.; Schindler, K.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Geodesy & Photogrammetry, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Leitao, J.

Tokat Province, Turkey, is a suitable habitat for extended tick activity with its moderate climate and vegetation. In the present study, we surveyed humans visiting health centers to determine the species diversity, geographical distribution, and seasonal activity of ixodid ticks infesting them. Out of 5,999 adult ticks collected from humans from April to September, 2008, 800 ticks were identified to species, while the remaining were identified to genus according to their distinct morphological characteristics. Hyalomma marginatum, Hyalomma detritum, Rhipicephalus bursa, Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) annulatus, Haemaphysalis punctata, Dermacentor marginatus, and Ixodes laguri were the most prevalent tick species among 24 ixodid tick species infesting humans in the region. One of these tick species, Hyalomma isacii was identified as a new record for the ixodid tick fauna of Turkey. Hyalomma species were the most abundant in summer, while Dermacentor and Ixodes species displayed the lowest frequency. Hyalomma aegyptium infestation was very common on humans in the province.

It is possible that a variety of ixodid tick species may contribute to the spread of tick-borne diseases such as Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV), which is endemic in the region.

Surprisingly, operational dust transport models were unable to forecast the event. This study details the reasons for this failure and presents simulations of the event at convection-permitting resolution using the modelling system ICON-ART. The results allow for an in-depth analysis of the influence of the synoptic situation, the complex interaction of multiple driving atmospheric systems and the mineral dust radiative effect on the dust event. A comparison of the results with observations reveals the quality of the simulation results with respect to structure and timing of the dust transport. The forecast of the dust event is improved decisively. The event is triggered by the unusually early occurrence of an active Red Sea trough situation with an easterly axis over Mesopotamia. The connected sustained organized mesoscale convection produces multiple cold-pool outflows responsible for intense dust emissions. Complexity is added by the interaction with an intense heat low, the inland-penetrating Eastern Mediterranean sea breeze and the widespread occurrence of supercritical flow conditions and subsequent hydraulic jumps in the vicinity of the Dead Sea Rift Valley. The newly implemented mineral dust radiation interaction leads to systematically more intense and faster propagating cold-pool outflows.","[Gasch, Philipp; Rieger, Daniel; Walter, Carolin; Knippertz, Peter; Vogel, Bernhard] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Karlsruhe, Germany; [Khain, Pavel; Levi, Yoav] Israel Meteorol Serv, Bet Dagan, Israel; [Rieger, Daniel] Deutsch Wetterdienst, Frankfurter Str 135, D-63067 Offenbach, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; Deutscher Wetterdienst,"Gasch, P (corresponding author), Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Karlsruhe, Germany.",philipp.gasch@kit.edu,"Vogel, Bernhard/A-9558-2013; Knippertz, Peter/D-5861-2016; Yoav, Levi/AAR-4399-2020","Vogel, Bernhard/0000-0002-8894-0165; Knippertz, Peter/0000-0001-9856-619X; Levi, Yoav/0000-0003-2459-2023",,,,,74,18,18,0,7,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1680-7316,1680-7324,,ATMOS CHEM PHYS,Atmos.

Situated at the interface between the Mediterranean Westerlies and African Monsoonal climate systems, the Nefud lies at the centre of the arid zone crossed by Homo sapiens dispersing into Eurasia and the edges of the southernmost known extent of the Neanderthal range. In 2013, the Palaeodeserts Project conducted an intensive survey of the western Nefud, to: (1) evaluate Pleistocene population dynamics in this important region of the Saharo-Arabian belt and (2) contribute towards understanding early modern human range expansions and interactions between different hominin species. Thirteen Lower and Middle Palaeolithic sites were discovered in association with palaeolake basins. One of the sites, T'is al Ghadah, may feature the earliest Middle Palaeolithic assemblage of Arabia. Preliminary analyses show that the Lower and Middle Palaeolithic sites discovered display diverse technological characteristics, indicating that the Nefud was important for population turnovers and exchanges throughout the Pleistocene. Periodic environmental amelioration appears to have attracted hominin incursions into the region, and subsequent ephemeral occupations structured around lakes and, to a lesser extent, raw material sources. However, differences between the Lower and Middle Palaeolithic sites are indicative of greater mobility during the later Pleistocene. A rarity of formal tools, but strong similarities in lithic production techniques, are also suggestive of demographic affinities across the Nefud during the Pleistocene, and perhaps beyond. These preliminary results support the view that the Arabian Peninsula was a critically important region of southwest Asia during the Late Pleistocene, in which demographic responses to climatic amelioration may have structured connectivity across the Saharo-Arabian belt, the Levant and as far as India.

However, this tends to be considered a problem principally for the southern regions in the UK, only becoming a serious issue in the north of England in the medium-term and in the long-term for Scotland. This notion tends to be largely predicated upon climate change predictions, differences in latitude and summer air temperatures. This paper describes the results from Building Performance Evaluation (BPE) studies over a two-year period from 26 occupied new-build homes across Scotland which demonstrated incidences of overheating. Results suggest that low-energy buildings are susceptible to overheating despite northerly latitudes, with 54% of houses studied overheating for more than six months annually, and 27% of homes overheating for less than 10% of the year. Evidence indicated that commonly used prediction tools do not appear to anticipate overheating adequately. This paper maps common overheating causes due to design and the role of occupants, identifying the risks due to the regulatory system, prediction and procurement processes, and design and construction. A common finding was that design and occupancy factors appear to have a greater impact on overheating more than location and climatic factors.","[Morgan, C.; Foster, J. A.; Poston, A.; Sharpe, T.

Indeed, further research and several technical advances are still required to expand the use of these bioresources to a larger and more sustainable scale. Here, we describe the state of the art of culture systems already available to farm these organisms throughout the different stages of their life cycle and provide an overview of the potential applications of jellyfish aquaculture for food, feed, as source of bioactive compounds for pharmaceutical and other biotechnological applications, as well as to supply the marine aquarium trade.

The uncertain future response of arctic glaciers and ice caps to climate change motivates the use of paleodata to evaluate the sensitivity of glaciers to past warm intervals and to constrain mechanisms that drive glacier change. We review the key patterns and chronologies of latest Pleistocene and Holocene glaciation on Baffin Island. The deglaciation by the Laurentide Ice Sheet occurred generally slowly and steadily throughout the Holocene to its present margin (Barnes Ice Cap) except for two periods of rapid retreat: An early interval similar to 12 to 10 ka when outlet glaciers retreated rapidly through deep fiords and sounds, and a later interval similar to 7 ka when ice over Foxe Basin collapsed. In coastal settings. alpine glaciers were smaller during the Younger Dryas period than during the Little Ice Age. At least some alpine glaciers apparently survived the early Holocene thermal maximum, which was several degrees warmer than today, although data on glacier extent during the early Holocene is extremely sparse. Following the early Holocene thermal maximum, glaciers advanced during Neoglaciation, beginning in some places as early as similar to 6 ka, although most sites do not record near-Little Ice Age positions until similar to 3.5 to 2.5 ka. Alpine glaciers reached their largest Holocene extents during the Little Ice Age, when temperatures were similar to 1-1.5 degrees C cooler than during the late 20th century. Synchronous advances across Baffin Island throughout Neoglaciation indicate sub-Milankovitch controls on glaciation that could involve major volcanic eruptions and solar variability. Future work should further elucidate the state of glaciers and ice caps during the early Holocene thermal maximum and glacier response to climate forcing mechanisms. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The adopted storm cluster consisting of seven storms was established by analysing the observed winter storms from December 2013 to January 2014. No individual storm occurred during this period is regarded as exceptionally intense, whereas the occurrence of such a cluster of seven events is very unusual. 1D models were setup at a number of highly dynamic cross-shore locations. After initial calibration of the model parameters against available post-storm profile data, the models were used to reproduce beach/dune evolution due to the storm clustering effects. The final predicted post-storm profile of the previous storm was used as the initial profile configuration of the subsequent storm. The predicted evolution during each storm was influenced by the preceding storms in the cluster. Due to the clustering effect, the erosion volume was not proportional to the storm power of the cluster, as expected an individual storm case. The clustering effect on morphology dominates at Formby Point and north therein while decreasing to south. The predicted profile evolution is useful to interpret the morphodynamic processes of beach/dune systems during a storm cluster to develop sustainable coastal management tools.","[Dissanayake, Pushpa; Karunarathna, Harshinie] Swansea Univ, Energy & Environm Res Grp, Coll Engn, Swansea, W Glam, Wales",Swansea University,"Dissanayake, P (corresponding author), Swansea Univ, Energy & Environm Res Grp, Coll Engn, Swansea, W Glam, Wales.",p.k.dissanayake@swansea.ac.uk; h.u.karunarathna@swansea.ac.uk,"Dissanayake, Pushpa/AAY-3616-2021","Dissanayake, Pushpa/0000-0003-2159-9940",Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [EP/K013513/1]; Ensemble Estimation of Flood Risk in a Changing Climate project - British Council through their Global Innovation Initiative,Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Ensemble Estimation of Flood Risk in a Changing Climate project - British Council through their Global Innovation Initiative,"The work presented in this paper was carried out under the project 'FloodMEMORY (Multi-Event Modelling Of Risk and recoverY)' funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) under the grant number: EP/K013513/1.

We critically review the various methods, identifying state-of-the-art practices and propose simple guidelines, particularly focusing on consistency between data sources and models, which is intended to help dynamic CGE modelers build their own baselines.","[Foure, Jean] French Ctr Etud Prospect & Informat Int, TSA 10726, F-75334 Paris 07, France; [Aguiar, Angel] Purdue Univ, Ctr Global Trade Anal, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Bibas, Ruben; Chateau, Jean] Org Econ Cooperat & Dev, 2 Rue Andre Pascal, F-75775 Paris, France; [Fujimori, Shinichiro] Kyoto Univ, Nishikyo Ku, 361,C1-3,Katsura Campus, Kyoto 6158540, Japan; [Lefevre, Julien] Ctr Int Rech Environm & Dev, Campus Jardin Tropical,45 Bis,Ave Belle Gabrielle, F-94736 Nogentsur Marne, France; [Leimbach, Marian] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Telegraphenberg A 56,POB 60 12 03, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany; [Rey-Los-Santos, Luis] European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr JRC, Directorate Econ Climate Change Energy & Transpor, C Inca Garcilaso 3, Seville 41092, Spain; [Valin, Hugo] IIASA, Schlosspl 1, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria",Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD); Kyoto University; Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA),"Foure, J (corresponding author), French Ctr Etud Prospect & Informat Int, TSA 10726, F-75334 Paris 07, France.",jean.foure@cepii.fr; aaguiar@purdue.edu; ruben.bibas@oecd.org; jean.chateau@oecd.org; sfujimori@athehost.env.kyoto-u.ac.jp; jlefevre@centre-cired.fr; leimbach@pik-potsdam.de; luis.rey-los-santos@ec.europa.eu; valin@iiasa.ac.at,"Fujimori, Shinichiro/A-1288-2015","Fujimori, Shinichiro/0000-0001-7897-1796; LEFEVRE, Julien/0000-0001-9702-7266",,,,,72,11,11,2,2,CENTER GLOBAL TRADE ANALYSIS,WEST LAFAYETTE,"DEPT AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS, PURDUE UNIV, 403 W STATE ST, WEST LAFAYETTE, IN 47907-2056 USA",2377-2999,,,J GLOB ECON ANAL,J.

In this study, a phytoplankton particle is assumed to be a sphere, a sphere with a core, or a randomly distorted hexahedron with or without a core. The single-scattering properties of the nonspherical/inhomogeneous particles are computed using appropriate state-of-the-art light-scattering computational capabilities.

Understanding the hydro-mechanical interaction of free-surface flow and saturated soil is, therefore, essential for designing geotechnical infrastructure in the upcoming decades. Such interaction phenomena exhibit challenging complexities not only mechanically but also from the numerical point of view. In the current work, the Material Point Method (MPM) is chosen as the numerical method to simulate the multiphase fluid-soil coupled problems. Even though the original formulation of the MPM, which assumes explicit dynamic time integration, has been proven to be successful in simulating many large-deformation problems, the method still suffers several drawbacks in efficiency accuracy. The semi-implicit version of MPM has been developed to circumvent these issues, which reduces pressure oscillations and increases the allowable time step size. Incorporating this technique to model two layers of materials, that is, the immiscible solid skeleton and the fluid phase, the proposed method can produce a significantly accurate coupling, yet easy implementation for advanced material models to tackle the problems of interest. Practical examples of this approach are limitless, which include fluidization, erosion, sedimentation, and seepage flow, as well as many other offshore applications.","[Chandra, Bodhinanda; Kularathna, Shyamini; Soga, Kenichi] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Zhao, Tianchi] Tongji Univ, Coll Civil Engn, Dept Geotech Engn, Shanghai, Peoples R China",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Tongji University,"Chandra, B (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",bchandra@berkeley.edu; ztc@tongji.edu.cn; kshyamini@berkeley.edu; soga@berkeley.edu,,,,,,,14,0,0,3,4,AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,NEW YORK,"UNITED ENGINEERING CENTER, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017-2398 USA",0895-0563,,978-0-7844-8403-6,GEOTECH SP,,,2022,,,,,573,579,,,,,,7,"Engineering, Civil; Engineering, Geological",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Engineering,BS8RF,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000775850000057,View Full Record in Web of Science

Rather than telling a story about the world as it is or as the photographer wants it to appear, the focus is on communicating with the world, and with the viewer. The photograph is seen as a creative medium that can be used to reflect how we experience and make sense of the world, or how we are and dwell in the world. In this paper, I introduce the theme of poetic storytelling in the context of contemporary photography in Iceland and other Nordic Countries. Poetic storytelling is a term I have been developing to describe a certain lyrical way to use a photograph as a narrative medium in reaction to the climate crisis and to a general lack of relation to oneself and to the world in times of increased acceleration in the society. In my article I analyze works by a few leading Icelandic photographers (Katrin Elvarsdottir, Heioa Helgadottir and Hallgerour Hallgrimsdottir) and put them in context with works by artists from Denmark (Joakim Eskildsen, Christina Capetillo and Astrid Kruse Jensen), Sweden (Helene Schmitz) and Finland (Hertta Kiiski) artists within the frame of poetic storytelling. Poetic storytelling is about a way to use a photograph as a narrative medium in an attempt to grasp a reality which is neither fully objective nor subjective, but rather a bit of both.","[Siguroardottir, Sigrun Alba] Iceland Univ Arts, Sch Architecture Design & Fine Art, IS-105 Reykjavik, Iceland",,"Sigurdardottir, SA (corresponding author), Iceland Univ Arts, Sch Architecture Design & Fine Art, IS-105 Reykjavik, Iceland.",sigrunalba@lhi.is,,"Sigurdardottir, Sigrun Alba/0000-0001-8979-2929",,,,,63,1,1,0,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-0752,,ARTS,Arts,DEC,2020,4,,,,,,129,10.3390/arts9040129,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/arts9040129,,,19,"Humanities, Multidisciplinary",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Arts & Humanities - Other Topics,PI9YE,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000601436400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Traditional dwellings of Dai contain the concepts of architecture, physics, ecology, and sustainability in space planning, building materials, and construction methods. At a time when the global climate environment is deteriorating and energy saving, emission reduction, and low-carbon life are advocated, Dai dwellings should be studied from the perspective of sustainable development, from which we can draw lessons and inspiration. This paper investigated plane layout, space structure, and materials of Dai dwellings, and found that traditional Dai dwellings are wooden frame structures with wood and bamboo; the roof has two layers and long overhang eaves, which is good for diverting rain water, shading and shelter, and integrating the building with the natural landscape as well.

Our interactions with such environments encourage us to recognize that we are neither superior to nor entirely separate from the objects and living beings that surround us. Accordingly, dark ecological art explores interpenetrations of human bodies and human psychologies with elements of our environments, including the products of human hands. But it sees no cause for celebration in such insights: rather, it delivers them in a consistently 'dark,' pessimistic tone. In this essay I argue that Morton's ideas can enrich our understanding of the Hesiodic Works and Days, which places emphasis on the difficulty of interacting with the environments of the Greek world. And while some passages seem to accord a privileged status to humans, many others stress the interpenetration of the human and the nonhuman, doing so in the sort of pessimistic tone that Morton associates with his dark ecological aesthetic.","[Brockliss, William] Univ Wisconsin, Class, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Brockliss, William] Univ Cambridge, Yale Class Studies, Cambridge, England",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Cambridge,"Brockliss, W (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Class, Madison, WI 53706 USA.;Brockliss, W (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Yale Class Studies, Cambridge, England.",,,,,,,,67,3,3,0,1,TEXAS TECH UNIV PRESS,LUBBOCK,"2903 FOURTH STREET,  SUITE 201, BOX 41037, LUBBOCK, TX 79409-1037 USA",0160-0923,1935-0228,,HELIOS,Helios,SPR,2018,1,,,,1,36,,,,,,36,Classics,Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;HCI),Classics,GY2PE,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000448384300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

For this purpose, a regional aerosol model coupled online with meteorology (COSMO-ART) is applied over Greece during late summer 2007. Fire risk model results proved to be adequate in reproducing the highly destructive event, which supports further applications for national meteorological forecasts and early warning systems for fire prevention. Columnar aerosol loading field predictions are consistent with satellite maps, which further allows for the correlation of this wildfire event to the atmospheric chemistry and the radiative forcing. Gaseous chemistry resembles that in urban environments and led to nitrogen dioxide and ozone exceedances in several cities in proximity to and downwind the fire spots, respectively. Influence in Athens is found significant from the Euboean plume (45% of total surface PM10) and small (5%) from the fires in Peloponnese. Fire events are indicated by sharp increases in organic to elemental carbon (6), together with sharp decreases in secondary to total organic components (0.1), in comparison to their values during the pre- and post-fire period over Athens (1 and 0.6, respectively). The change in the radiative budget induced by the fire plume is found negative (3-day-average value up to -10 W m(-2)). Direct heat input is found negligible, thus the net temperature effect is also negative over land (-0.5 K). Nevertheless, positive temperature changes are found overseas (hourly value up to +2 K), due to the amplified radiation absorption by aged soot, coupled to the intense stabilization of the atmosphere above the sea surface.

In this study, we report the electrochemical synthesis of nanoporous tungsten carbide and its application as a reduction catalyst in PEC cells, namely, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) and PEC water splitting cells, for the first time. The method employed in this study involves the anodization of tungsten foil followed by post heat treatment in a CO atmosphere to produce highly crystalline tungsten carbide film with an interconnected nanostructure. This exhibited high catalytic activity for the reduction of cobalt bipyridine species, which represent state-of-the-art redox couples for DSCs. The performance of tungsten carbide even surpassed that of Pt, and a substantial increase (similar to 25%) in energy conversion efficiency was achieved when Pt was substituted by tungsten carbide film as the counter electrode. In addition, tungsten carbide displayed decent activity as a catalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction, suggesting the high feasibility for its utilization as a cathode material for PEC water splitting cells, which was also verified in a two-electrode water photoelectrolyzer.","[Kang, Jin Soo; Kim, Jin; Lee, Myeong Jae; Son, Yoon Jun; Jeong, Juwon; Chung, Dong Young; Sung, Yung-Eun] Inst for Basic Sci Korea, Ctr Nanoparticle Res, Seoul 08826, South Korea; [Kang, Jin Soo; Kim, Jin; Lee, Myeong Jae; Son, Yoon Jun; Jeong, Juwon; Chung, Dong Young; Lim, Ahyoun; Sung, Yung-Eun] Seoul Natl Univ, Sch Chem & Biol Engn, Seoul 08826, South Korea; [Lim, Ahyoun; Park, Hyun S.] Korea Inst Sci & Technol, Fuel Cell Res Ctr, Seoul 02792, South Korea; [Choe, Heeman] Kookmin Univ, Sch Adv Mat Engn, Seoul 02707, South Korea",Institute for Basic Science - Korea (IBS); Seoul National University (SNU); Korea Institute of Science & Technology (KIST); Kookmin University,"Sung, YE (corresponding author), Inst for Basic Sci Korea, Ctr Nanoparticle Res, Seoul 08826, South Korea.;Sung, YE (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, Sch Chem & Biol Engn, Seoul 08826, South Korea.;Park, HS (corresponding author), Korea Inst Sci & Technol, Fuel Cell Res Ctr, Seoul 02792, South Korea.",hspark@kist.re.kr; ysung@snu.ac.kr,"Park, Hyun S/GWZ-8571-2022; Choe, Heeman/J-4053-2013","Park, Hyun S/0000-0002-7960-9729; Choe, Heeman/0000-0002-5908-577X; Kang, Jin Soo/0000-0001-8894-2630; Son, Yoon Jun/0000-0003-1704-2314","Institute for Basic Science (IBS) in the Republic of Korea [IBS-R006-G1]; National Research Foundation of Korea [2016 M3D1A1021142]; echnology Development Program to Solve Climate Changes of NRF - Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning of Korea [2015 M1A2A2074688]; Basic Science Research Program through National Research Foundation (NRF) of Korea [2014R1A2A1A11052513]","Institute for Basic Science (IBS) in the Republic of Korea; National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea); echnology Development Program to Solve Climate Changes of NRF - Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning of Korea; Basic Science Research Program through National Research Foundation (NRF) of Korea","Y.-E.S. acknowledges that this work was supported by the Institute for Basic Science (IBS) in the Republic of Korea (Project Code: IBS-R006-G1).

This concern is heightened in the wildland-urban interface where social and ecological effects converge. Mega-fires', conflagrations', extreme' and catastrophic' are descriptors interchangeably used increasingly to describe fires in recent decades in the US and globally. It is necessary to have consistent, meaningful and quantitative metrics to define these perceived extreme' fires, given studies predict an increased frequency of large and intense wildfires in many ecosystems as a response to climate change. Using the Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity dataset, we identified both widespread fire years and individual fires as potentially extreme during the period 1984-2009 across a 91.2x10(6)-ha area in the north-western United States. The metrics included distributions of fire size, fire duration, burn severity and distance to the wildland-urban interface. Widespread fire years for the study region included 1988, 2000, 2006 and 2007. When considering the intersection of all four metrics using distributions at the 90th percentile, less than 1.5% of all fires were identified as potentially extreme fires. At the more stringent 95th and 99th percentiles, the percentage reduced to <0.5% and 0.05%. Correlations between area burnt and climatic measures (Palmer drought severity index, temperature, energy release component, duff moisture code and potential evapotranspiration) were observed. We discuss additional biophysical and social metrics that could be included and recommend both the need for enhanced visualisation approaches and to weigh the relative strength or importance of each metric.","[Lannom, Karen O.; Tinkham, Wade T.; Smith, Alistair M.

Although the material has unique properties, further efficiency improvement by increasing the temperature is limited due to its maximum temperature capability of about 1200 degrees C. Above this temperature the deposited metastable tetragonal (t ') phase undergoes a detrimental phase transformation as well as enhanced sintering. Both processes promote the failure of the coatings at elevated temperatures and this early failure has been frequently observed in gradient tests. In this paper, we now experimentally shown for the first time that under typical cycling conditions not the time at elevated temperatures leads to the reduced lifetime but the transient cooling rates. If cooling rates were reduced to 10K/s, TBC systems could be operated in a burner rig at a surface temperature well above 1500 degrees C without showing a lifetime reduction. The explanation of these astonishing findings is given by the evaluation of energy release rate peaks during fast transient cooling in combination with the phase evolution during cooling with the used cooling rates.","[Vassen, Robert; Mack, Daniel Emil; Tandler, Martin; Sohn, Yoo Jung; Sebold, Doris; Guillon, Olivier] Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Energy & Climate Res Mat Synth & Proc IEK 1, Julich, Germany; [Vassen, Robert] Ruhr Univ Bochum, Inst Werkstoffe, Bochum, Germany; [Guillon, Olivier] JARA Energy, Julich Aachen Res Alliance, Julich, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Research Center Julich; Ruhr University Bochum,"Vassen, R (corresponding author), Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Energy & Climate Res Mat Synth & Proc IEK 1, Julich, Germany.",r.vassen@fz-juelich.de,,"Sohn, Yoo Jung/0000-0002-7994-7269",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; Helmholtz Association,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Helmholtz Association(Helmholtz Association),Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; Helmholtz Association,,27,8,9,5,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-7820,1551-2916,,J AM CERAM SOC,J.

The focus of the last years was the development of cells with high power density, reduced degradation of SOFC stacks, and the introduction of industrial-applicable manufacturing technologies. Typical anode-supported cells (ASCs) were manufactured by tape casting the support and screen printing of the functional layers. At IEK-1 a new manufacturing technology was introduced. The complete half-cell was tape cast, but in reverse order. This means that firstly the electrolyte is cast, then the anode is cast on the electrolyte dried and afterwards the substrate is cast on the double layer system. The half-cell is then cut in green state and sintered. By adapting carefully the powders used for the functional layers and the substrate also the flattening procedure e can be omitted. Thus, the complete cell is producible by casting the electrolyte the anode and the substrate on each other cutting, sintering to electrolyte gas-tightness and afterwards cathode coating by screen printing followed by a final sintering step. Manufacturing of such cells for single cell and stack testing revealed appropriate electrochemical results Due to relatively thick electrolyte and anode (similar to 20 mu m each) the power densities are reduced by approx. 10-20% in comparison to state-of-the-art ASCs.","[Menzler, Norbert H.; Schafbauer, Wolfgang; Muecke, Robert; Kauert, Ralf; Buechler, Oliver; Buchkremer, Hans Peter; Stoever, Detlev] Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Energy & Climate Res, IEK 1, D-52425 Julich, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Research Center Julich,"Menzler, NH (corresponding author), Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Energy & Climate Res, IEK 1, D-52425 Julich, Germany.",,,"Menzler, Norbert H./0000-0001-7091-0980",,,,,14,3,3,0,5,AMER CERAMIC SOC,WESTERVILLE,"735 CERAMIC PLACE, WESTERVILLE, OH 43081-8720 USA",0196-6219,,978-1-118-09524-9,CERAM ENG SCI PROC,,,2011,,,,,149,160,,,,,,12,"Electrochemistry; Energy & Fuels; Materials Science, Ceramics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Electrochemistry; Energy & Fuels; Materials Science,BFF71,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000319672300014,View Full Record in Web of Science

Two uncoupled atmospheric models used for deterministic forecasting in the short to medium range as well as eight fully coupled atmosphere-land-ocean forecast models used for monthly and seasonal forecasting are examined and compared. For the short to medium range, the level of forecast skill for the two indices is higher than that for the entire Northern Hemisphere extratropical flow. The forecast skill of the PNA is higher than that of the NAO. The forecast skill increases with the magnitude of the NAO and PNA indices, but the relationship is not pronounced. The probability density function (PDF) of the NAO and PNA indices is negatively skewed, in agreement with the distribution of skewness of the geopotential field. The models maintain approximately the observed PDF, including the negative skewness, for the first week. Extreme negative NAO/PNA events have larger absolute values than positive extremes in agreement with the negative skewness of the two indices. Recent large extreme events are generally well forecasted by the models. On the intraseasonal time scale it is found that both NAO and PNA have lingering forecast skill, in contrast to the Northern Hemisphere extratropical flow as a whole. This fact offers some hope for extended range forecasting, even though the skill is quite low. No conclusive positive benefit is seen from using higher horizontal resolution or coupling to the oceans. On the monthly and seasonal time scales, the level of forecast skill for the two indices is generally quite low, with the exception of winter predictions at short lead times.","NOAA, NWS, DOC, Natl Ctr Environm Predict,SAIC,Environm Modeling, Camp Springs, MD 20746 USA",National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC),"Johansson, A (corresponding author), NOAA, NWS, DOC, Natl Ctr Environm Predict,SAIC,Environm Modeling, 5200 Auth Rd, Camp Springs, MD 20746 USA.",ake.johansson@noaa.gov,,,,,,,41,73,73,0,17,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0894-8755,,,J CLIMATE,J.

The ultimate objective of this field is to develop cost-effective, stable, and high-performance photovoltaic modules fabricated on large-area flexible plastic substrates via high-volume/throughput roll-to-roll printing processing and thus achieve the practical implementation of OSCs. Recently, intensive research efforts into the development of organic materials, processing techniques, interface engineering, and device architectures have led to a remarkable improvement in power conversion efficiencies, exceeding 11%, which has finally brought OSCs close to commercialization. Current research interests are expanding from academic to industrial viewpoints to improve device stability and compatibility with large-scale printing processes, which must be addressed to realize viable applications. Here, both academic and industrial issues are reviewed by highlighting historically monumental research results and recent state-of-the-art progress in OSCs.

The purpose of this study is to analyze the infill structure indicators in this region in terms of economic sustainability. Design/methodology/approach First, based on related literature reviews and approaches, the indicators that should be considered in the creation of infill structures in historical contexts were collected. Later, by considering the vicinity zone of Tabriz Historic Bazaar, the effect of each indicator on the economic sustainability of the building was gathered by means of AHP questionnaires and in-person interviews with experts and analyzed by the Expert Choice software. Findings The findings present a guideline which indicates that the type of materials being used is the most important factor in order to create an economically sustainable infill structure in this setting. Accordance with the Climate of the region ranks second place and the Cultural land-use as the Suitable land use for this site goes for the third. The mentioned guideline includes 25 indicators and can help designers with a clear path. Originality/value This paper clarifies the order of indicators' importance for enhancing the design and consequently function of infill structures, being built in this historic context, with the aim of economic sustainability.

Meeting this challenge will create new opportunities for producers to provide a broader range of ecosystem services, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions (and sequestering more carbon) in their production systems. To meet these new objectives, land managers will need new decision tools and performance metrics. The COMET-Farm system was designed to fill this need by incorporating state-of-the-art greenhouse gas quantification methods into a web-based tool that can be used by farmers, ranchers, land managers and others. The system is capable of doing a full greenhouse gas assessment for CO2, CH4, and N2O, from all major on-farm emission sources (and CO2 removal into biomass and soil sinks), including land management of annual and perennial crops, pasture, range and agroforestry systems, as well as emissions from livestock and on-farm energy use. The system uses a fully spatial mapping and menu-driven graphical user interface (GUI) to facilitate data entry and evaluation of user-defined conservation practices. In this paper we provide an overview of the system and a description of the user interface and integrated databases in the system. We follow this with a brief description of the models and data requirements for the major emission source categories in the system. We illustrate the application of the system using examples of emission reductions from adoption of different conservation management practices and discuss how the tool can help meet needs for different policy-and market-driven greenhouse gas reduction efforts.","[Paustian, Keith; Brown, Kevin; Huber, Adriane; Layer, Mark; Sutton, Ben; Verlayudhan, Sobha] Colorado State Univ, Dept Soil & Crop Sci, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Paustian, Keith; Easter, Mark; Marx, Ernie; Stermer, Matt; Swan, Amy; Toureene, Crystal; Williams, Steve] Colorado State Univ, Nat Resource Ecol Lab, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Chambers, Adam] NRCS, USDA, West Natl Technol Support Ctr, 1201 NE Lloyd Blvd, Portland, OR 97232 USA; [Eve, Marlen] ARS, USDA, Nat Resources & Sustainable Agr Syst, 5601 Sunnyside Ave, Beltsville, MD 20705 USA",Colorado State University; Colorado State University; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Paustian, K (corresponding author), Colorado State Univ, Dept Soil & Crop Sci, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.;Paustian, K (corresponding author), Colorado State Univ, Nat Resource Ecol Lab, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",keithp@nrel.colostate.edu,,,USDA Natural Resource Conservation Service (under USDA CESU AGREEMENT) [68-7482-15-507]; USDA's Climate Change Program Office (under USDA) [GS23F8182H]; California Department of Food and Agriculture [SC14061A],USDA Natural Resource Conservation Service (under USDA CESU AGREEMENT); USDA's Climate Change Program Office (under USDA); California Department of Food and Agriculture,"We would like to thank the system testers in the 'Cave' for their diligence and hard work and the many COMET-Farm users who have supplied valuable feedback and suggestions on how to improve the system.

A realistic representation of RWPs is essential for a skillful prediction of the day-to-day weather and its extremes. Using an objective RWP tracking technique, this study verifies the representation of RWPs for all models in the Subseasonal to Seasonal (S2S) Prediction Project Database. Consistent with reanalyses, the reforecasts show one RWP every 4 days. The three models with the coarsest grid spacing tend to overestimate the propagation distance due to a negative RWP decay frequency bias over the Atlantic-European sector. A verification of atmospheric blocking suggests that this bias is related to a negative blocking frequency bias in the same region. The biases are reduced in models with finer grid spacing. However, that this bias reduction is not only dependent on the grid spacing highlights the effect of the different representation of key physical processes on RWPs and blocking. Plain Language Summary Equatorward and poleward perturbations propagating eastward along the fast flowing air currents in the upper troposphere are commonly referred to as Rossby wave packets (RWPs). These packets have been linked to extreme weather events such as intense low-pressure systems, extreme temperatures, and precipitation. Hence, an adequate representation of RWPs in state-of-the-art weather prediction models is desirable to better predict these events. This study is the first to verify the representation of RWPs in a large set of weather prediction models on time scales of up to 28 days. It is shown that fundamental properties such as their climatological frequency of occurrence, their life time, and their mean propagation distance are represented reasonably well. However, models-especially those with a rather coarse horizontal grid spacing-struggle to adequately represent the decay of these waves in the Atlantic/European sector.

Natural attractions, bio-diversity, rich historical and cultural heritage, climate, gastronomic and oenological offer, and the level of security are certainly a significant potential of Croatian tourism, attracting more and more tourists every year. Cyclotourism, as one of the forms of selective tourism, both in Europe and in the World is one of the tourism products with the greatest prospect of development. Its rich historical and cultural heritage, attractive and diverse natural environment, favourable climate, the security of the country, a large number of roads with lower intensity of motor traffic and other paths suitable for cycling provide Slavonia and Baranja with numerous comparative advantages for the development of cyclotourism. Since Slavonia and Baranja, according to statistical data of the Ministry of Tourism, is a region with the lowest number of tourists and overnight stays in the Republic of Croatia, the primary objective of this paper is to set guidelines and define the steps for cyclotourism development in its area, i.e. key activities that will lead to increased consumption and increased number of overnight stays in the seasons from 2018 to 2020, and increased number of cyclotouristic arrivals by generating demand through the development and promotion of new products and services. The research methodology is based on the secondary, desk research, as well as on the primary research through an online survey.

Sun Zhongshan was credited for initiating the idea of the Zhongshan suit. This series of designs retain the characteristics of collar, top fly, and pockets of the Zhongshan suit but use comfortable cotton and linen materials. The detachable aspects of the coat make it suited for multi-wear to accommodate for changes in climate. The reflective strip allows a person to be recognized easily at night and thus serves as a safety feature. Anti-theft pockets ensure financial security. The coat is designed with a combination of bags that can store objects and cell phones. In addition, the transparent, mesh pockets can be used to store drugs for speedy identification in an emergency.

Observational products provide independent estimates of crucial budget terms, including oceanic heat transport from unique mooring-derived data, radiative fluxes from satellites, and sea ice volume from merged satellite data. Results show that the time averages of independent estimates of radiative, atmospheric, and oceanic energy fluxes into the Arctic Ocean domain are remarkably consistent in the sense that their sum closely matches the observed rate of regional long-term oceanic heat accumulation of similar to 1 W m(-2). Atmospheric and oceanic heat transports are found to be stronger compared to earlier assessments (similar to 100 and similar to 16 W m(-2), respectively). Data inconsistencies are larger when considering the mean annual cycle of the coupled energy budget, with RMS values of the monthly budget residual between 7 and 15 W m(-2), depending on the employed datasets. This nevertheless represents an average reduction of similar to 72% of the residual compared to earlier work and demonstrates the progress made in data quality and diagnostic techniques. Finally, the budget residual is eliminated using a variational approach to provide a best estimate of the mean annual cycle. The largest remaining sources of uncertainty are ocean heat content and latent heat associated with sea ice melt and freeze, which both suffer from the lack of observational constraints. More ocean in situ observations and reliable sea ice thickness observations and their routinely assimilation into reanalyses are needed to further reduce uncertainty.","[Mayer, Michael; Tietsche, Steffen; Zuo, Hao] European Ctr Medium Range Weather Forecasts, Reading, Berks, England; [Mayer, Michael; Haimberger, Leopold; Mayer, Johannes] Univ Vienna, Dept Meteorol & Geophys, Vienna, Austria; [Tsubouchi, Takamasa] Univ Bergen, Geophys Inst, Bergen, Norway",European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF); University of Vienna; University of Bergen,"Mayer, M (corresponding author), European Ctr Medium Range Weather Forecasts, Reading, Berks, England.;Mayer, M (corresponding author), Univ Vienna, Dept Meteorol & Geophys, Vienna, Austria.",michael.mayer@ecmwf.int,"Keyes, Dennis/AAZ-9285-2021; Tietsche, Steffen/F-7633-2015","Tietsche, Steffen/0000-0002-2961-0289","European Union [633211, 640161]; Austrian Science Fund [P28818]; EU [652757]",European Union(European Commission); Austrian Science Fund(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)); EU(European Commission),"The authors thank Ron Kwok for helpful discussion on ICESat data, Robert Ricker for clarifications concerning CS2SMOS data, Norman Loeb for comments on our uncertainty estimates of CERESEBAFfluxes, and Simon Witter for helpwith Fig. 10.

In this regard, the use of thermal insulation to reduce energy demand has been proposed as an important solution. Production of thermal insulation made from chemicals consumes high energy and their disposal has high environmental effects. Therefore, the use of agricultural waste due to their abundance in Iran, low energy consumption for production and high renewability rate, seems to be justified as an alternative to chemical-based insulation. Due to the importance of the above issues, in the present work for the first time with the aim of investigating the phenomenon of thermal bridges in traditional buildings of Iran, the ZUB ARGOS software is used to evaluate the effect of 10 different agricultural wastes (cork, cellulose fiber, meadow grass, flax, sheep wool, straw, hemp, cotton, grain granules, and cattail) as thermal insulation on the inside face of the wall, find the optimal thickness of common waste (straw) to remove the phenomenon of thermal bridges and evaluate the effect of the horizontal or vertical direction of straw fibers to the heat transfer path in the city of Yazd located in the hot and dry climate of Iran. The results of the current situation simulations showed that the thermal bridge phenomenon occurs in the building under study and the most critical connection with f = 0.48 is related to the wall-to-wall connection. Among the agricultural wastes, cork is the most suitable insulation with f(min) = 0.76. The results of the 10 wastes investigation also showed that the wall-to-wall connection and the window lintel connection are according to the order the most critical and safest connections for creating a thermal bridge in the building under study. Due to the abundance of straw waste in the studied climate, this insulation was selected to optimize the current situation. The results showed that the placement of straw fibers perpendicular to the heat flow compared to its horizontal direction has a maximum advantage of 4.35%. The results showed that the optimal thickness for straw insulation is 3 cm, which means that no thermal bridge in connections occurs and cork is the most suitable insulation among the agricultural wastes studied.

It is implemented to a much lesser extent in cool and humid climates of Europe, mainly due to a lack of knowledge about agronomic and ecological impacts. This study was conducted in light- to medium-textured soils in the Swiss midlands from 1995 to 2000. The aim was to determine whether tillage intensity impacted wheat yield and measure the effects of the preceding crop and the level of N fertilisation. Conventional tillage (CT) with ploughing, minimum tillage (MT) with a chisel, and no-tillage (NT) were studied in the following crop rotation: winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.)-winter wheat-maize (Zea mays L.). Winter wheat was grown at either 0 kg N ha(-1) (N0) or at the recommended N supply (N1). Harvest residues of all the crops were left on the field. In the early stages wheat development under NT was slightly slower than under CT and MT, but at maturity the shoot biomass was 2% higher under NT than under the other tillages. The grain yield decreased by 3% under NT compared to CT and MT, mainly due to fewer ears per area and a significantly lower thousand-kernel weight. Wheat planted after oilseed rape had significantly higher shoot biomass and grain yield than wheat planted after maize. At the beginning of the vegetation season there were small but significant differences in the soil mineral N content among the tillage treatments. Accordingly, the level of N fertiliser applied was adjusted to ensure similar N availability in all tillage systems.

We analyse a heat pump transition in two contrasting case studies: Finland and the United Kingdom, utilizing original data from interviews, document analysis, and archival online data. Finland has an almost completed transition, while the United Kingdom can be considered a stalled one. Building on previous research that has highlighted the importance of context, policy and users in transitions, we explore various user roles within low-carbon transitions, and how they shape processes of niche construction and regime destabilisation. Our findings show that the role of users is one key explanatory element of the different heat pump transitions. We also find that specific characteristics of a transition context can influence the types of users that emerge. We conclude that instead of just providing incentives, policy should also aim to mobilise users.","[Martiskainen, Mari; Schot, Johan; Sovacool, Benjamin K.] Univ Sussex, Sch Business, Sci Policy Res Unit SPRU, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Schot, Johan] Univ Utrecht, Utrecht Ctr Global Challenges, Dept Hist & Art Hist, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Schot, Johan; Sovacool, Benjamin K.] Univ Aarhus, Ctr Energy Technol, Dept Business Dev & Technol, Aarhus, Denmark",University of Sussex; Utrecht University; Aarhus University,"Schot, J (corresponding author), Univ Sussex, Sch Business, Sci Policy Res Unit SPRU, Brighton, E Sussex, England.;Schot, J (corresponding author), Univ Utrecht, Utrecht Ctr Global Challenges, Dept Hist & Art Hist, Utrecht, Netherlands.;Schot, J (corresponding author), Univ Aarhus, Ctr Energy Technol, Dept Business Dev & Technol, Aarhus, Denmark.",j.w.schot@uu.nl,"Martiskainen, Mari/ABA-7139-2021","Martiskainen, Mari/0000-0002-3503-9197",European Union [730403],European Union(European Commission),"This work was supported by the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 730403 Innovation pathways, strategies and policies for the LowCarbon Transition in Europe (INNOPATHS) .

Through their metabolism and behaviour, benthic animals affect biogeochemical fluxes between the sediment and water column. Mechanistic models that quantify these benthic-pelagic links are imperative to understand the functioning of coastal ecosystems. In this study, we develop a dynamic model of benthic macrofauna to quantify the relationship between organic matter input and benthic macrofaunal biomass in the coastal zone. The model simulates the carbon dynamics of three functional groups of benthic macrofauna and their sediment food sources and is forced by a hydrodynamic-biogeochemical model simulating pelagic physical and biological dynamics. The model reproduces measured time-series of macrofaunal biomass from two coastal sites with contrasting sedimentation in the Baltic Sea in 1993-2005 with comparatively high accuracy, including a major increase at one of the sites dominated by the bivalve Limecola (Macoma) balthica. This shift in community composition suggests altered pathways of organic matter degradation: 39% of simulated sedimentation was mineralised by macrofauna in 2005 compared to 10% in 1995. From the early 2000s onward macrofaunal biomass seems to be food-limited, as ca 80% of organic carbon sedimentation was processed by the deposit-feeding macrofauna at both sites. This model is a first step to help quantify the role of macrofauna in marine coastal ecosystem functioning and biogeochemical cycles and build predictive capacity of the effects of anthropogenic stressors, such as eutrophication and climate change, on coastal ecosystems.","[Ehrnsten, Eva; Norkko, Alf; Gustafsson, Bo G.] Univ Helsinki, Tvarminne Zool Stn, JA Palmens Vag 260, Hango 10900, Finland; [Ehrnsten, Eva; Norkko, Alf; Gustafsson, Bo G.] Stockholm Univ, Baltic Sea Ctr, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Timmermann, Karen] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, Frederiksborgvej 399, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark",University of Helsinki; Stockholm University; Aarhus University,"Ehrnsten, E (corresponding author), Stockholm Univ, Baltic Sea Ctr, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",eva.ehrnsten@su.se; alf.norkko@helsinki.fl; bo.gustafsson@su.se,"Norkko, Alf/L-8736-2019; Ehrnsten, Eva/GWU-7048-2022; Gustafsson, Bo/GQH-3048-2022","Norkko, Alf/0000-0002-9741-4458; Ehrnsten, Eva/0000-0002-8960-8252; Timmermann, Karen/0000-0001-5989-4692",EU; Academy of Finland [294853]; Swedish Research Council Formas through BONUS; Baltic Sea research and development programme (Art 185) as part of the BONUS BALTICAPP project (Well-being from the Baltic Sea-applications combining natural science and economics) [294853]; Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management through their grant 1:11-Measures for marine and water environment,EU(European Commission); Academy of Finland(Academy of Finland); Swedish Research Council Formas through BONUS; Baltic Sea research and development programme (Art 185) as part of the BONUS BALTICAPP project (Well-being from the Baltic Sea-applications combining natural science and economics); Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management through their grant 1:11-Measures for marine and water environment,"We thank Laura Kauppi and Caroline Raymond for help with managing zoobenthos monitoring data, Oleg Savchuk and Barbara Bauer for valuable advice in model development and Anna Villnas and four anonymous reviewers for comments significantly improving earlier versions of this manuscript.

It took place in an inner-city neighbourhood of Dublin 8 between 2019 and 2020 and was funded by the Irish Environmental Protection Agency. This article outlines the methodological approach taken to develop a communityled greening strategy that is both inclusive and planning-policy relevant. The first phase of the project involved scientifically mapping the span and territories of trees and greenspace across Dublin 8, identifying their location and quality, greenspace deficits, and future needs. Phase two included a series of curated events from March to August 2020 to map out a proposed process for co-creating urban greening solutions focusing more on local identity and the possibilities for future creation. The scientific data was presented to communities in a way that opened up a creative and supportive space for dialogue on the wider role of trees and greening in enhancing urban resilience. Such a co-created greening plan ensures that interventions respond to neighbourhood needs, have high social and cultural value within the community, and maximise opportunities for community wellbeing. The final phase of the project identified specific areas for focused greening interventions. An important output from this action research project is a co-creation process to enable communities, local authorities, and policymakers to engage with and develop a new governance arrangement for more inclusive and appropriate urban greening strategies.","[Clavin, Alma; Moore-Cherry, Niamh; Mills, Gerald] Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Geog, Dublin, Ireland",University College Dublin,"Clavin, A (corresponding author), Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Geog, Dublin, Ireland.",alma.clavin@ucd.ie; niamh.moore@ucd.ie; gerald.mills@ucd.ie,"mills, gerald/N-4244-2017","mills, gerald/0000-0003-2186-8936; Moore-Cherry, Niamh/0000-0003-0372-8809","Irish Environmental Protection Agency Research Programme; Irish Environmental Protection Agency Research Programme - Department of the Environment, Climate, and Communications; Connect the Dots","Irish Environmental Protection Agency Research Programme; Irish Environmental Protection Agency Research Programme - Department of the Environment, Climate, and Communications; Connect the Dots","This project is funded under the Irish Environmental Protection Agency Research Programme 2021-2030.

In one of the most effective variants of this technology, a so called volumetric air receiver is used to convert concentrated radiation into heat. This component consists of a high temperature resistant cellular material which absorbs radiation and transfers the heat to an air flow which is fed from the ambient and from recirculated air. It is called volumetric, because the radiation may penetrate into the volume of the receiver through the open, permeable cells of the material. In this way a larger amount of heat transfer surface supports the solid to gaseous heat transfer in comparison to a tubular closed receiver. Finally the heated air is directed to the steam generator of a conventional steam turbine system. In this study an advanced cellular metal honeycomb structure has been designed, manufactured and tested for use as an open volumetric receiver. It consists of winded pairs of flat and corrugated metal foils. The technology is based on a one which has been primarily developed for the treatment of combustion engine exhaust gases. A number of variations of the pure linear honeycomb structure have been introduced to increase local turbulence and radial flow. Firstly, a set of samples has been tested in laboratory scale experiments to determine effective properties and the solar-to-thermal efficiency. After that, results have been compared with theoretical predictions. Finally, the three most promising materials have been used for a 500 kW test on the research platform of the Solar Tower Julich. Air outlet temperatures of more than 800 degrees C have been achieved with efficiencies of about 80%, which is about 5% more than the state-of-the-art technology, which is currently used at the main receiver of the Solar Tower. Next to this, lifetime models will be developed to increase the overall reliability of the technology. (C)2017 Elsevier Ltd.

We divided the industrial carbon footprint of textiles into two parts: direct emissions which were caused by combustion of fossil fuel such as coal, oil and gas etc and indirect emissions which were caused by the consumption of secondary energy. And we proposed system boundary, composition, assessment methods of industrial carbon footprint in textile industry.

A green roof model is dynamically coupled with a building thermal model to assess its energy performance that takes into account the indoor air temperature dynamic changes. Under the climate conditions in Antananarivo, we compared green and conventional roofs. The present study shows that green roofs protect the roof structure under extreme temperature and large temperature fluctuations. For the case of Antananarivo, the amplitude of the temperature fluctuations at the top face of the support is reduced by 28 degrees C when using green roof. The impact of the green roof on indoor air temperature and energy demand is investigated. The vegetation decreases the maximum indoor air temperature and improves the building thermal comfort during summer days. It has no effect on the minimum indoor air temperature, but additional soil thickness can increase it. In addition, a global sensitivity analysis, which is carried out on the proposed model without considering any specific weather data, allows us to identify the most influential parameters on the energy demand. It has been found that green roofs have almost insignificant thermal impact in insulated buildings; however, their potential prevails over the building envelope and weather characteristics in the case of non-insulated building.","[Rakotondramiarana, Hery Tiana; Ranaivoarisoa, Tojo Fanomezana] Univ Antananarivo, IME, Antananarivo 101, Madagascar; [Morau, Dominique] Univ La Reunion, Res Unit Piment, 117 Rue Gen, F-97430 Ailleret, La Tampon Reuni, France",University Antananarivo; University of La Reunion,"Morau, D (corresponding author), Univ La Reunion, Res Unit Piment, 117 Rue Gen, F-97430 Ailleret, La Tampon Reuni, France.",rktmiarana@yahoo.fr; tjworkspace@yahoo.fr; dominique.morau@univ-reunion.fr,,,,,,,39,20,20,0,6,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2075-5309,,,BUILDINGS,Buildings,JUN,2015,2,,,,497,520,,10.3390/buildings5020497,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/buildings5020497,,,24,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Civil",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Construction & Building Technology; Engineering,V25RM,,"Green Published, gold, Green Submitted",,,12/21/22,WOS:000215241700011,View Full Record in Web of Science

While early warning systems are frequently used to predict the magnitude, location, and timing of potentially damaging events, these systems rarely provide impact estimates, such as the expected amount and distribution of physical damage, human consequences, disruption of services, or financial loss. Complementing early warning systems with impact forecasts has a twofold advantage: It would provide decision makers with richer information to take informed decisions about emergency measures and focus the attention of different disciplines on a common target. This would allow capitalizing on synergies between different disciplines and boosting the development of multihazard early warning systems. This review discusses the state of the art in impact forecasting for a wide range of natural hazards. We outline the added value of impact-based warnings compared to hazard forecasting for the emergency phase, indicate challenges and pitfalls, and synthesize the review results across hazard types most relevant for Europe.","[Merz, Bruno; Kreibich, Heidi; Schroeter, Kai] GFZ German Res Ctr Geosci, Sect Hydrol, Potsdam, Germany; [Merz, Bruno] Univ Potsdam, Inst Environm Sci & Geog, Potsdam, Germany; [Kuhlicke, Christian] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Urban & Environm Sociol, Leipzig, Germany; [Kunz, Michael; Pantillon, Florian; Pinto, Joaquim G.; Punge, Heinz Juergen] Karlsruhe Inst Technol KIT, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Karlsruhe, Germany; [Pittore, Massimiliano] GFZ German Res Ctr Geosci, Sect Seism Hazard & Risk Dynam, Potsdam, Germany; [Pittore, Massimiliano] Inst Earth Observat, EURAC Res, Bolzano, Italy; [Babeyko, Andrey] GFZ German Res Ctr Geosci, Sect Geodynam Modeling, Potsdam, Germany; [Bresch, David N.; Domeisen, Daniela I., V] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Environm Syst Sci, Zurich, Switzerland; [Bresch, David N.] Fed Off Meteorol & Climatol MeteoSwiss, Zurich, Switzerland; [Feser, Frauke; Weisse, Ralf] Helmholtz Zentmm Geesthacht, Inst Coastal Res, Geesthacht, Germany; [Koszalka, Inga; Strehlow, Karen] GEOMAR Helmholtz Ctr Ocean Res, Kiel, Germany; [Koszalka, Inga] Stockholm Univ, Dept Meteorol, Stockholm, Sweden; [Koszalka, Inga] Stockholm Univ, Baltic Sea Ctr, Stockholm, Sweden; [Pantillon, Florian] Univ Toulouse, Lab Aerol, CNRS, UPS, Toulouse, France; [Parolai, Stefano] Natl Inst Oceanog & Appl Geophys, OGS, Sgonico, Italy; [Rivalta, Eleonora] GFZ German Res Ctr Geosci, Sect Phys Earthquakes & Volcanoes, Potsdam, Germany; [Wurpts, Andreas] Forsch Stelle Kuste FSK, Nds Landesbetrieb Wasserwirtschaft Kusten & Nat S, Norderney, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Center Potsdam GFZ German Research Center for Geosciences; University of Potsdam; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ); Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Center Potsdam GFZ German Research Center for Geosciences; European Academy of Bozen-Bolzano; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Center Potsdam GFZ German Research Center for Geosciences; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Federal Office of Meteorology & Climatology (MeteoSwiss); Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Zentrum Geesthacht - Zentrum fur Material- und Kustenforschung; Helmholtz Association; GEOMAR Helmholtz Center for Ocean Research Kiel; Stockholm University; Stockholm University; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Istituto Nazionale di Oceanografia e di Geofisica Sperimentale; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Center Potsdam GFZ German Research Center for Geosciences,"Merz, B (corresponding author), GFZ German Res Ctr Geosci, Sect Hydrol, Potsdam, Germany.;Merz, B (corresponding author), Univ Potsdam, Inst Environm Sci & Geog, Potsdam, Germany.",bmerz@gfz-potsdam.de,"Feser, Frauke/C-1605-2014; Strehlow, Karen/GQP-6013-2022; Domeisen, Daniela/J-2589-2015; Parolai, Stefano/AGZ-3980-2022; Schröter, Kai/B-1482-2013; Pinto, Joaquim G/A-7352-2009; Weisse, Ralf/E-7550-2013; Bresch, David N./D-5298-2018; Kuhlicke, Christian/O-8397-2016; Kreibich, Heidi/G-9408-2012; Pittore, Massimiliano/F-5543-2013","Feser, Frauke/0000-0002-0252-468X; Domeisen, Daniela/0000-0002-1463-929X; Schröter, Kai/0000-0002-3173-7019; Pinto, Joaquim G/0000-0002-8865-1769; Weisse, Ralf/0000-0001-7449-6166; Bresch, David N./0000-0002-8431-4263; Kuhlicke, Christian/0000-0002-1193-228X; Kreibich, Heidi/0000-0001-6274-3625; Koszalka, Inga Monika/0000-0002-9164-2054; Merz, Bruno/0000-0002-5992-1440; Pittore, Massimiliano/0000-0003-4940-3444; Kunz, Michael/0000-0002-0202-9558","German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) [29599 03F0778B, 03G0876]; Swiss National Science Foundation [PP00P2 170523]; AXA Research Fund; Transregional Collaborative Research Center - German Science Foundation (DFG) [SFB/TRR 165]; European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program [700099]",German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission); AXA Research Fund(AXA Research Fund); Transregional Collaborative Research Center - German Science Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program,"The idea and concept of this paper were developed within the Cross-Program Activity Natural Disasters and Warning Systems of the Helmholtz Association of German Research Centers (HGF).

However, traditional street canyons are optimized from a single urban microclimate level, and lack multi-dimensional optimization strategies to deal with climate change and pay attention to human respiratory health. In this study, the Changhuai Street Canyon in Hefei, Anhui Province, China was taken as the measure-ment object, and ENVI-met was used to simulate the fine particles and the physical environment. First, control the three-dimensional space of street canyons reasonably, and then optimize the spatial form of urban street canyons. Second, the PM2.5 concentrations at different selected points and heights were obtained. Finally, the optimization strategy of reducing building height, widening road width and increasing street canyon greening is proposed. This study is based on the comparison of pollutant concentrations between winter and summer in Changhuai street canyons, different sample locations, and different building heights to improve the spatial form of urban street canyons, implement the dual carbon goal, and promote sustainable urban development.","[Wang, Wei] Hefei Univ Technol, Coll Architecture & Art, Hefei 230601, Peoples R China; [Cheng, Xinyue] Beijing Univ Civil Engn & Architecture, Sch Geomat & Urban Spatial Informat, Beijing 106216, Peoples R China; [Dai, Mengmeng] Anhui Jianzhu Univ, Sch Architecture & Urban Planning, Hefei 230601, Peoples R China",Hefei University of Technology; Beijing University of Civil Engineering & Architecture; Anhui Jianzhu University,"Wang, W (corresponding author), Hefei Univ Technol, Coll Architecture & Art, Hefei 230601, Peoples R China.",vivigan@ahjzu.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [51778001]; Graduate Scientific Research Project of Anhui Universities [YJS20210501],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Graduate Scientific Research Project of Anhui Universities,"The author (s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The authors would like to acknowledge the coordinated support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51778001) and the Graduate Scientific Research Project of Anhui Universities in 2021 (YJS20210501).",,41,0,0,9,9,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2210-6707,2210-6715,,SUSTAIN CITIES SOC,Sust.

The fact that this fuel is CO2-free provides many advantages in European and world aims for sustainable energy sources. Biomass trigeneration is a relatively new concept, which has the potential to improve the bioenergy economics for areas with warm climate, for which traditional biomass cogeneration was unfeasible. This concept can be applied with various energy conversion technologies, two of which are investigated in this paper: ORC and gasification. Both technologies are applied for a specific case study. The technological and financial comparison of the two technologies shows that gasification offers improved yield for the investment, mainly due to the higher electrical efficiency factor. However, attention should be placed to the increased investment risk of gasification projects, which could be an aversive factor for some investors. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

We numerically test the DBFN and compare it with other methods on both a 2D shallow water model, and a 3D full primitive ocean model. These numerical results show that the DBFN converges very quickly. Its main advantage is to filter the observation noise, unlike the BFN algorithm, particularly when the model diffusion is high.","[Auroux, Didier; Blum, Jacques] Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, Lab JA Dieudonne, Parc Valrose, F-06108 Nice 2, France; [Ruggiero, Giovanni] Mercator Ocean, 10 Rue Hermes, F-31520 Ramonville St Agne, France",UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Cote d'Azur,"Auroux, D (corresponding author), Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, Lab JA Dieudonne, Parc Valrose, F-06108 Nice 2, France.",auroux@unice.fr; jblum@unice.fr; giovanni.ruggiero@mercator-ocean.fr,,,,,,,65,0,0,0,4,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2281-518X,2281-5198,978-3-319-39092-5; 978-3-319-39091-8,SPRINGER INDAM SER,,,2016,,,,,139,174,,10.1007/978-3-319-39092-5_8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-39092-5_8,10.1007/978-3-319-39092-5,,36,"Geography, Physical; Geology; Mathematics; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences",Book Citation Index – Science (BKCI-S),Physical Geography; Geology; Mathematics; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,BH4NS,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000400504400009,View Full Record in Web of Science

The oldest Pleistocene loess in China is likely similar to 2.6 Ma, thus spanning much or all of the Pleistocene. In North America, most loess is no older than the penultimate glacial period, with the exception of Alaska, where the record may go back to similar to 3.0 Ma. On both continents, loess deposits date primarily to glacial periods, and interglacial or interstadial periods are represented by paleosols. Both glacial and non-glacial sources of silts that comprise the bulk of loess deposits are found on both continents. Although loess has been considered to be representative of the average upper continental crust, there are regionally distinctive compositions of loess in both Asia and North America. Loess deposits in Asia from Yakutia, Tajikistan, and China have compositionally distinct major element compositions, due to varying abundances of silicate minerals, carbonate minerals, and clay minerals. In North America, loess in the Mississippi River valley, the Great Plains, and Alaska are also distinguishable with regard to major element composition that reflects highly diverse source sediments. Trace element geochemistry (Sc-Th-Zr and the rare earth elements) also shows regional diversity of loess bodies, in both Asia and North America. On both continents, most loess bodies show significant contributions from later-cycle, altered sedimentary rocks, as opposed to direct derivation from igneous rocks. Further, some loess bodies have detectable contributions from mafic igneous rocks as well as major contributions from average, upper-crustal, felsic rocks. Intercalated paleosols in loess sections show geochemical compositions that differ significantly from the underlying loess parent materials. Ratios of soluble-to-insoluble elements show depletions in paleosols due to chemical weathering losses of calcite, dolomite, plagioclase, mica, apatite, and smectite. In Asia and North America, the last interglacial paleosol is more weathered than equivalent modern soils, which could be due either to a climate that was warmer and more humid, a longer period of pedogenesis, or both. In Asia, early Pleistocene loess and paleosols are both more weathered than those from the middle and late Pleistocene, forming prior to a mid-Pleistocene aridification of Asia from uplift of the Tibetan Plateau. Understanding the geochemistry of loess and paleosols can tell us much about past atmospheric circulation, past temperature and moisture regimes, and even tectonic processes.","[Muhs, Daniel R.] US Geol Survey, Fed Ctr, MS 980,Box 25046, Denver, CO 80225 USA",United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey,"Muhs, DR (corresponding author), US Geol Survey, Fed Ctr, MS 980,Box 25046, Denver, CO 80225 USA.",dmuhs@usgs.gov,,,Climate and Land Use Change Program of the U.S. Geological Survey,Climate and Land Use Change Program of the U.S. Geological Survey,"I thank Jimin Sun, Liping Zhou, Edward Derbyshire, and Ann Wintle for inviting me to contribute this paper, which is an honor.

Recognizing the characteristics of colors in urban landscape and optimizing their application together with developing responsive urban environments and spaces is major of concern. The concept of color on facade has been and is an inseparable aspect in city planning, because human needs aesthetics. There exist valuable historic urban spaces in Iran where each serves as a unique entity as to formation of an appropriate mosaic. Studies run on the aspect of facade color propose patterns in harmonizing contemporary urban spaces. The objective here proposes a method to analyze facade color and its patterns in urban spaces which include historical structure. The major question of this study is: How the information on environment color concept can be codified by applying modern digital technologies. The method adopted in this study is of analytic descriptive. In this study, the theoretical foundations and history of facade color concept and applied the common methods are analyzed through a combination of digital tools and image processing software. Naghsh-e Jahan Square is selected based on its historical background and its specific importance as a desirable urban space. Attempt is made here to assess the method adopted in our subject area and present the practical implications. The color system applied in this study is CIELab and the method of color strip is applied in the analysis section. The findings indicate that selecting color in harmony with climate in Naghsh-e Jahan Square is an appropriate measure in overcoming to the color problem in urban spaces. These selected colors, in terms of their attribution and characteristics, are in harmony and represented the main colors of the subject space facades. It is observed that the group of complementary color in harmony with the main colors of the background is applied to create qualities like diversity and visual richness, legibility and emphasis on the landmarks and building entrances in an excellent composition.","[Tadayon, Bahareh] Art Univ Isfahan, Fac Conservat, Conservat Hist Contexts, Esfahan, Iran; [Ghalehnoee, Mahmoud] Art Univ Isfahan, Fac Architecture & Urban Planning, Esfahan, Iran; [Abouei, Reza] Art Univ Isfahan, Fac Conservat & Renovat, Esfahan, Iran",,"Ghalehnoee, M (corresponding author), Art Univ Isfahan, Fac Architecture & Urban Planning, Esfahan, Iran.",b.tadayon@aui.ac.ir; m.ghalehnoee@aui.ac.ir; r.abouei@aui.ac.ir,"Tadayon, Bahareh/AAN-6153-2021; Abouei, Reza/HGU-0002-2022",,,,,,31,2,2,1,12,NAZAR RESEARCH CENTER ART ARCHITECTURE & URBANISM,TEHRAN,"NO 3, DR QARIB ST AZADI AVE, TEHRAN, 14198-43311, IRAN",1735-9635,2251-7197,,BAGH E NAZAR,Bagh e Nazar,APR,2018,59,,,,45,58,,10.22034/bagh.2018.60566,http://dx.doi.org/10.22034/bagh.2018.60566,,,14,"Humanities, Multidisciplinary",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Arts & Humanities - Other Topics,GN5CC,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000439060600004,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Sun, X; Morth, CM; Humborg, C; Gustafsson, B",,,,"Sun, Xiaole; Morth, Carl-Magnus; Humborg, Christoph; Gustafsson, Bo",,,Temporal and spatial variations of rock weathering and CO2 consumption in the Baltic Sea catchment,CHEMICAL GEOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Silicate; Carbonate; Weathering; Baltic Sea catchment; CO2 consumption,ATMOSPHERIC CO2; ORGANIC-CARBON; CLIMATE-CHANGE; TEMPERATURE-DEPENDENCE; FLUVIAL GEOCHEMISTRY; TERRESTRIAL EXPORT; NEGATIVE FEEDBACK; EASTERN SIBERIA; DRAINAGE-BASIN; REVISED MODEL,"This study provides the first estimate of silicate and carbonate weathering rates and derived CO2 consumption rates for the Baltic Sea catchment using river chemistry data of 78 rivers draining into the Baltic Sea. The silicate weathering rates (denoted as total dissolved solids) of individual river basin range from 0.014 Tg/year to 4.55 Tg/year and the carbonate weathering rates range from 0.079 Tg/year to 6.49 Tg/year. The total CO2 consumption across the Baltic catchment is approximately 3.9 Tg C/year and is almost equally shared by silicates and carbonates. Uncertainty associated with the weathering estimate is around 32%, which is mainly caused by incomplete pollution correction for a few major rivers in the south. The calculations for the boreal river basins have higher certainties because of less human impacts. The CO2 consumption rate of individual river basin vary between 0.53 and 5.66 g C/m(2)/year with an average of 2.97 g C/m(2)/year, in which carbonates consume CO2, 1.4 g C/m(2)/year and silicates take 1.5 g C/m(2)/year. This is in the same range as has been reported for the Mackenzie River and Siberian river basins, but at the lower range of tropical rivers, suggesting the Baltic Sea catchment holds solid weathering signals for high-latitude systems, especially in the pristine boreal silicatedominated areas. The amount of CO2 consumed by weathering in the Baltic Sea catchment accounts for approximately 3-30% of the net ecosystem carbon exchange (10-100 g C/m(2)/year), implying that weathering contributes as a significant sink of atmospheric CO2. Although many studies have shown the positive relation between temperature and weathering rates in various river catchments, multiple regression analysis using the 40-year continuous records of river chemistry in the boreal area of the Baltic Sea catchment reveals a strong correlation between weathering flux and precipitation, but no statistically significant correlation between weathering and temperature. This suggests not only that temperature is not necessarily to be primary controlling factor for weathering rates, but also besides precipitation, other factors, like increased soil organic matter contents and water path changes may have high impact on weathering rates. The 40-year data analysis also shows generally increasing weathering fluxes by 10-20% in the pristine boreal area over the past decades. This indicates that increased CO2 consumption by weathering and the resulting elevated dissolved inorganic carbon delivery to the ocean act as a negative feedback for ocean acidification, such as the Arctic Ocean that has become more acidic due to high terrestrial organic carbon delivery together with increased river water input.","[Sun, Xiaole; Morth, Carl-Magnus; Humborg, Christoph; Gustafsson, Bo] Stockholm Univ, Balt Sea Ctr, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Morth, Carl-Magnus] Stockholm Univ, Dept Geol Sci, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Humborg, Christoph] Stockholm Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Analyt Chem, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden",Stockholm University; Stockholm University; Stockholm University,"Sun, X (corresponding author), Stockholm Univ, Balt Sea Ctr, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",xiaole.sun@su.se,"Gustafsson, Bo/GQH-3048-2022; Humborg, Christoph/C-4756-2015","Humborg, Christoph/0000-0002-0649-5599; Sun, Xiaole/0000-0003-2391-5572",BONUS - EU [Art 185]; Swedish Research Council Formas,BONUS - EU; Swedish Research Council Formas(Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council Formas),"We thank Miguel Alberto Rodriguez Medina for helping compile river data and appreciate help with data sources from Erik Gustafsson and Barbel Muller-Karulis.

Using station precipitation data, vertically integrated water vapor (IWV) from Special Sensors Microwave Imager/Sounder (SSMIS) satellite observations and the state of the art NOAA-twentieth Century (NOAA-20C) reanalysis, it is shown that 55 out of 58 EDPs are associated with narrow plumes of intense low-level moisture defined as atmospheric rivers. Despite the high spatial correlation between IWV fields in the SSMIS and NOAA-20C data sets, the significant positive relationship between the maximum amount of observed precipitation at all stations and the IWV content hitting the coastal terrain is only observed in the SSMIS data set. Further, the composite analyses of synoptic conditions show that the preferred circulation type consists of a mean sea level pressure (MSLP) dipole pattern where a high-pressure system over central Europe and a series of low-pressure systems to the east of Iceland and over the Norwegian Sea are present. The west coast of Norway is located in the exit region of the anticyclonically curved upper tropospheric polar jet stream implying that the coupling of upper troposphere and surface dynamics begins to weaken at the time of EDPs. It is also found that the primary synoptic-scale precursors are persistent positive 500 hPa height geopotential and MSLP anomalies over central Europe up to 10 days before the occurrence of EDP events.","[Azad, Roohollah] Norwegian Meteorol Inst, Dev Ctr Weather Forecasting, Oslo, Norway; [Sorteberg, Asgeir] Univ Bergen, Inst Geophys, Bergen, Norway; [Sorteberg, Asgeir] Univ Bergen, Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, Bergen, Norway",Norwegian Meteorological Institute; University of Bergen; Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research; University of Bergen,"Azad, R (corresponding author), Norwegian Meteorol Inst, Dev Ctr Weather Forecasting, Oslo, Norway.",raz041@uib.no,"Sorteberg, Asgeir/N-8576-2015","Sorteberg, Asgeir/0000-0001-6003-9618; Azad, Roohollah/0000-0002-7043-8919",Norwegian Research Council through the EarthClim project; Norwegian Research Council through the ExPrecFlood project,Norwegian Research Council through the EarthClim project; Norwegian Research Council through the ExPrecFlood project,"This research has been supported by grants from the Norwegian Research Council through the EarthClim and ExPrecFlood projects.

After detailed investigation of the layer adherence, time dependent mechanical integrity and reversibility of phase transformations, metal-supported cells with cathodes sintered before cell operation (ex-situ sintering) could be produced reliably and were electrochemically characterized in single cell measurements. The novel sintering approach of such cathodes resulted in a significantly enhanced mechanical stability of the cathode layers. The adherence of the cathode to the electrolyte was considerably stronger, which is a substantial improvement in comparison with state-of-the-art MSCs.

The main focus of this study was to test the use of natural color and white-painted scrap tire blocks (STBs) as insulating material in a residential building prototype (RBP) and to compare their performance with a common insulating material (polystyrene). The STBs were prepared with a simple method using isoBond adhesive and tire particles from different suppliers. The thermal conductivity and water absorption of the materials were recorded. Moreover, several statistical parameters such as range, time lag and decrement factor were analyzed. The results showed that the STBs had higher thermal conductivity than polystyrene however, the ability to maintain the interior temperatures was nearly similar. This fact was explained by the combined convection-conduction heat transfer mechanism inside STBs. The water absorption of the STBs was relatively low in comparison with other organic insulating materials, such as palm fibers. The STBs performed better as insulating material when the outer-facing side was painted white, leading to an increase in the decrement factor (f) and the rate of heat loss as well as a decrease in the rate of heat gain. Finally, STB's are a practical option as insulating material for residential buildings in warm climates. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Many adaptation and mitigation studies use spatial distribution of highly vulnerable local populations to inform heat reduction and response plans. However, most available heat vulnerability studies focus on urban areas with high heat intensification by Urban Heat Islands (UHIs). Rural areas encompass different environmental and socioeconomic issues that require alternate analyses of vulnerability. We categorized Nebraska census tracts into four urbanization levels, then conducted factor analyses on each group and captured different patterns of socioeconomic vulnerabilities among resultant Heat Vulnerability Indices (HVIs). While disability is the major component of HVI in two urbanized classes, lower education, and races other than white have higher contributions in HVI for the two rural classes. To account for environmental vulnerability of HVI, we considered different land type combinations for each urban class based on their percentage areas and their differences in heat intensifications. Our results demonstrate different combinations of initial variables in heat vulnerability among urban classes of Nebraska and clustering of high and low heat vulnerable areas within the highest urbanized sections. Less urbanized areas show no spatial clustering of HVI. More studies with separation on urbanization level of residence can give insights into different socioeconomic vulnerability patterns in rural and urban areas, while also identifying changes in environmental variables that better capture heat intensification in rural settings.","[Fard, Babak Jalalzadeh; Abadi, Azar M.; Bell, Jesse E.] Univ Nebraska Med Ctr, Dept Environm Agr & Occupat Hlth, Coll Publ Hlth, Omaha, NE 68198 USA; [Mahmood, Rezaul; Shulski, Martha; Bell, Jesse E.] Univ Nebraska, Sch Nat Resources, High Plains Reg Climate Ctr, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA; [Hayes, Michael] Univ Nebraska, Sch Nat Resources, Inst Agr & Nat Resources, Lincoln, NE USA; [Rowe, Clinton] Univ Nebraska, Coll Art & Sci, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Lincoln, NE USA; [Medcalf, Sharon; Lookadoo, Rachel] Univ Nebraska Med Ctr, Dept Epidemiol, Coll Publ Hlth, Ctr Biosecur Biopreparedness & Emerging Infect Di, Lincoln, NE USA",University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Medical Center; University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Lincoln; University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Lincoln; University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Lincoln; University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Lincoln; University of Nebraska Medical Center,"Fard, BJ; Bell, JE (corresponding author), Univ Nebraska Med Ctr, Dept Environm Agr & Occupat Hlth, Coll Publ Hlth, Omaha, NE 68198 USA.;Bell, JE (corresponding author), Univ Nebraska, Sch Nat Resources, High Plains Reg Climate Ctr, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA.",babak.jfard@unmc.edu; Jesse.bell@unmc.edu,"Jalalzadeh-Fard, Babak/GXH-4040-2022","Hayes, Michael/0000-0001-5006-166X; J.Fard, Babak/0000-0003-1143-1191",Nebraska Research Initiative grant,Nebraska Research Initiative grant,This work was supported by the Nebraska Research Initiative grant.,,63,3,3,8,17,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",2471-1403,,,GEOHEALTH,GeoHealth,OCT,2021,10,,,,,,e2021GH000478,10.1029/2021GH000478,http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2021GH000478,,,18,"Environmental Sciences; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),"Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",WN7TU,34723046,"Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000711971100004,View Full Record in Web of Science

We estimate a TWS increase of 32 +/- 10 km(3)/yr for the entire basin, equivalent to an increase in water thickness of 1.3 +/- 0.4 cm/yr over a basin of 2.4 million km(2). We compare TWS estimates from GRACE with time series of precipitation (P) minus evapotranspiration (ET) from ERA-Interim reanalysis minus observational river discharge (R). We find an excellent agreement in annual and inter-annual variability between the two time series. Furthermore, we find that a bias of -20 +/- 10% in P-ET is sufficient to effectively close the water budget with GRACE. When we account for this bias, the time series of cumulative TWS from GRACE and climatological data agree to within +/- 3.8 cm of water thickness, or +/- 9% of the mean annual P. The TWS increase is not uniform across the river basin and exhibits a peak, over an area of 502,400 km(2), centered at 118.5 degrees E, 62.5 degrees N, and underlain by discontinuous permafrost. In this region, we attribute the observed TWS increase of 68 +/- 19 km(3) to an increase in subsurface water storage. This large subsurface water signal will have a significant impact on the terrestrial hydrology of the region, including increased baseflow and alteration of seasonal runoff.

Vietnam, as well as key countries in Southeast Asia. due to rapid industrialization and economic growth, for the last two decades have been faced with many problems such as: a large increase in urban population. enormous environmental pollution, and poor housing conditions. The impossibility of solving these problems imposes new innovative and fast solutions primarily in the field of education, urban planning. housing architecture, as well as in the field of design. use of sustainable materials in construction, and rational use of energy. The central point of this research is the analysis of the social context of housing. the planning framework, as well as the spatial manifestation and relations between the level of the city, public space, and housing facility. Using examples of recent achievements of the Vietnamese architecture, this work focuses on the row house which is the most characteristic form of urban housing in Asia. This research also addresses the bioclimatic approach to design, sustainable construction methods and passive adapting to climate change. Vietnamese row house thus becomes the paradigm of an integrated approach to the process of sustainable design.","[Prvanov, S.

To ask which factor has the strongest influence on long- and short-timescale metrics of P availability, we sampled soils across a full-factorial combination of two parent materials [quartz diorite (QD) and volcaniclastic (VC)], three topographic positions (ridge, slope, and valley), and across 550 m in elevation in 17 sub-watersheds of the Luquillo Mountains, Puerto Rico. VC rocks had double the P content of QD (600 vs. 300 ppm; P < 0.0001), and soil P was similarly approximately 2x higher in VC-derived soils (P < 0.0001). Parent material also explained the most variance in our two other long-timescale metrics of P status: the fraction of recalcitrant P (56% variance explained) and the loss of P relative to parent material (35% variance explained), both of which were higher on VC-derived soils (P < 0.0001 for both). Topographic position explained an additional 10-15% of the variance in these metrics. In contrast, there was no parent material effect on the more labile NaHCO3- and NaOH-extractable P soil pools, which were approximately 2.5x greater in valleys than on ridges (P < 0.0001). Taken together, these data suggest that the relative importance of different state factors varies depending on the ecosystem property of interest and that parent material and topography can play sub-equal roles in driving differences in ecosystem P status across landscapes.","[Mage, Susanna M.] Brown Univ, Ctr Environm Studies, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Porder, Stephen] Brown Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Providence, RI 02912 USA",Brown University; Brown University,"Porder, S (corresponding author), Brown Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Providence, RI 02912 USA.",stephen_porder@brown.edu,"Porder, Stephen/ACT-2074-2022",,"Andrew Mellon Foundation; NSF [DEB 0918387, EAR 0722476]; Directorate For Geosciences [0722476] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",Andrew Mellon Foundation; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Directorate For Geosciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)),"We would like to thank Fred Scatena, Art Johnson, Miguel Leon, Hao Xing, John Clark, Zhuo Wang, Joanna Karaman, and Swee Lim for their expertise and assistance in the field.

The ED is solved every 5 min identifying the most economic generation dispatch and reserve schedule. AGC is a feedback control system that regulates area control error by sending signals to regulation reserve every 26 s. In system with high renewable penetration and associated high net-load variability, the conventional ED-AGC hierarchical model may result in degraded MW-frequency performance and increasing operational cost. In this paper, an AGC dynamic constrained ED model is proposed to provide a more reliable and economical regulation reserve schedule in handling high net load variability. The continuous AGC dynamics is transformed into discrete state-space model, and the fast AGC dynamics are eliminated to reduce the system order. The discretized reduced-order AGC dynamics are incorporated into the ED to optimize the regulation schedule. The proposed model can be applied in a look-ahead mode with very short-term load forecast or in a look-back mode to provide a perfect dispatch benchmark based on historical net load data. The 5-bus and 118-bus systems are tested to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.","[Zang, Guangyuan] EON Climate & Renewables, Austin, TX 78704 USA; [McCalley, James] Iowa State Univ, Dept ECPE, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Wang, Qin] Elect Power Res Inst, Power Delivery & Utilizat, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA",Iowa State University; Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI),"Zang, GY (corresponding author), EON Climate & Renewables, Austin, TX 78704 USA.",gzhang@alumni.iastate.edu; jdm@iastate.edu; qwang@epri.com,"Wang, Qin/AAM-7913-2021",,,,,,17,17,20,1,10,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",0885-8950,1558-0679,,IEEE T POWER SYST,IEEE Trans.

Yet, compliance rates are generally below 50% of all opportunities for hand hygiene. This study aims at evaluating the short-and long-term effects of two different strategies for promoting hand hygiene in hospital nurses. Methods/design: This study is a cluster randomised controlled trial with inpatient wards as the unit of randomisation. Guidelines for hand hygiene will be implemented in this study. Two strategies will be used to improve the adherence to guidelines for hand hygiene. The state-of-the-art strategy is derived from the literature and includes education, reminders, feedback, and targeting adequate products and facilities. The extended strategy also contains activities aimed at influencing social influence in groups and enhancing leadership. The unique contribution of the extended strategy is built upon relevant behavioural science theories. The extended strategy includes all elements of the state-of-the-art strategy supplemented with gaining active commitment and initiative of ward management, modelling by informal leaders at the ward, and setting norms and targets within the team. Data will be collected at four points in time, with six-month intervals. An average of 3,000 opportunities for hand hygiene in approximately 900 nurses will be observed at each time point. Discussion: Performing and evaluating an implementation strategy that also targets the social context of teams may considerably add to the general body of knowledge in this field. Results from our study will allow us to draw conclusions on the effects of different strategies for the implementation of hand hygiene guidelines, and based on these results we will be able to define a preferred implementation strategy for hospital based nursing.","[Huis, Anita; Schoonhoven, Lisette; Grol, Richard; Borm, George; Adang, Eddy; Hulscher, Marlies; van Achterberg, Theo] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Med Ctr Nijmegen, Sci Inst Qual Healthcare, Nijmegen, Netherlands",Radboud University Nijmegen,"Huis, A (corresponding author), Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Med Ctr Nijmegen, Sci Inst Qual Healthcare, Nijmegen, Netherlands.",a.huis@iq.umcn.nl,"Hulscher, Marlies/B-1229-2014; Achterberg, M./H-8006-2014; Huis, Anita/F-8598-2016; Adang, E.M.M./L-4169-2015; Ysebaert, Alain/H-6407-2011; Grol, Richard/C-8523-2013; Schoonhoven, Lisette/O-3330-2013","Hulscher, Marlies/0000-0002-2160-4810; van Achterberg, Theo/0000-0003-0111-6622",ZonMw [94517101],ZonMw(Netherlands Organization for Health Research and Development),"This study is funded by a research grant from ZonMw, dossier number: 94517101.",,41,21,21,0,18,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1748-5908,,,IMPLEMENT SCI,Implement.

Amphibians provide provisioning services by serving as a food source for some human societies, especially in Southeast Asia. They also serve as models in medical research and provide potential for new pharmaceuticals such as analgesics and anti-viral drugs derived from skin secretions. Amphibians contribute to regulating services by reducing mosquito recruitment from ephemeral wetlands, potentially controlling other pest species, and indirectly through predation of insect pollinators. Often neglected, ecosystems also provide cultural services to human societies that increase the quality of human life through recreation, religion, spirituality, and aesthetics. As an abundant and diverse class of vertebrates, amphibians also play prominent roles in the culture of human societies through pathways such as mythology, literature, and art. Most research on the role of amphibians in ecosystems has been on their contribution to supporting services. This is also the area where amphibians are likely to have the largest contribution to ecosystem services. Supporting services have structural (e.g., habitat) and functional (e.g., ecosystem functions and processes) components. Amphibians can affect ecosystem structure through soil burrowing and aquatic bioturbation and ecosystem functions such as decomposition and nutrient cycling through waste excretion and indirectly through predatory changes in the food web. They also can control primary production in aquatic ecosystems through direct consumption and nutrient cycling. Unfortunately, amphibians are experiencing major declines and humans may be losing associated ecosystem services. It is important to understand how declines affect ecosystem services for human societies, but these declines can also serve as natural experiments to understand the role of amphibians in ecosystems.","[Hocking, Daniel J.; Babbitt, Kimberly J.] Univ New Hampshire, Dept Nat Resources & Environm, Durham, NH 03824 USA",University System Of New Hampshire; University of New Hampshire,"Hocking, DJ (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Dept Environm Conservat, DOI Northeast Climate Sci Ctr, Holdsworth Hall, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",dhocking@unh.edu,"Hocking, Daniel/C-5701-2013","Hocking, Daniel/0000-0003-1889-9184",New Hampshire Agricultural Experiment Station; University of New Hampshire Graduate School Dissertation-Year Fellowship,New Hampshire Agricultural Experiment Station; University of New Hampshire Graduate School Dissertation-Year Fellowship,"We appreciate the thoughtful comments from Jessica Veysey, Bill Peterman, Julia Earl, Lesley Hocking, John Maerz, Mark Ducey, and Adrienne Kovach, who helped improve earlier drafts of this manuscript.

The Youngest Toba Tuff (YTT) is the largest known super-eruption in the Quaternary. Here we reconstructed the ultra-distal volcanic ash dispersal during this super-eruption using a computational ash dispersal model, which provides insights into the eruption dynamics and the impact of the event. The method uses a 3D time-dependent tephra dispersion model, a set of wind fields, and several tens of thickness measurements of the YTT tephra deposit. Results reveal that the YTT eruption dispersed 8600 km(3) (3800 km3 dense rock equivalent, DRE) of ash, covering similar to 40 million km(2) with more than 5 mm of ash. These new fallout volume estimations indicate that the total volume of the material erupted (including the massive pyroclastic density current (PDC), 1500 km3 DRE, deposits on Sumatra) was 5300 km3 DRE. Simulation results indicate that the eruption had a very large mass flow rate and that the umbrella cloud, associated with the eruption plume, spread as an enormous gravity current around the neutral buoyancy level. The YTT tephra forms a key chronostratigraphic marker in the sedimentary sequences, and is particularly useful for constraining the age of the palaeoenvironmental and archeological records, and synchronizing these archives to investigate temporal relationships. These new constraints on the extent of the YTT deposit are therefore particularly useful for cryptotephra studies that aim to find nonvisible tephra layers for these chronological purposes. This method used to constrain volcanological parameters of eruptions in the past provides insights into the dispersal processes, and allows the amount of volatiles released to be estimated which is crucial to assessing the impact of such events.","[Costa, Antonio] Ist Nazl Geofis & Vulcanol, Via D Creti 12, Bologna, Italy; [Smith, Victoria C.] Univ Oxford, Res Lab Archaeol & Hist Art, Oxford, England; [Macedonio, Giovanni] Ist Nazl Geofis & Vulcanol, Osservatorio Vesuviano, Naples, Italy; [Matthews, Naomi E.] Univ Stavanger, Dept Petr Engn, Stavanger, Norway",Istituto Nazionale Geofisica e Vulcanologia (INGV); University of Oxford; Istituto Nazionale Geofisica e Vulcanologia (INGV); Universitetet i Stavanger,"Costa, A (corresponding author), Ist Nazl Geofis & Vulcanol, Via D Creti 12, Bologna, Italy.",antonio.costa@bo.ingv.it,"Costa, Antonio/D-2410-2009; Smith, Victoria C/P-6317-2016; Smith, Victoria/AAA-4152-2021; Macedonio, Giovanni/G-3855-2011","Costa, Antonio/0000-0002-4987-6471; Smith, Victoria C/0000-0003-0878-5060; Smith, Victoria/0000-0003-0878-5060; Macedonio, Giovanni/0000-0001-6604-1479",,,,,64,52,54,0,0,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-6463,,FRONT EARTH SC-SWITZ,Front.

Therefore, several pilot and large-scale investigations on the elimination of organic micropollutants have taken place in recent years. Based on the present findings, the most efficient treatment steps to eliminate organic micropollutants have proven to be ozonation, adsorption on powdered activated carbon (PAC), or filtration through granular activated carbon (GAC). Yet a further treatment step implies an increase in energy demand of the wastewater treatment plant, which has to be considered along with OMP elimination. To this aim, data on energy demand of ten large-scale municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) with processes for OMP elimination was collected and analyzed. Moreover, calculations on energy demand beyond the WWTP for production and transport of ancillary materials were performed to assess the cumulative energy demand of the processes. An assessment of the greenhouse gas emissions of the processes was achieved, which shall facilitate future life cycle analyses. The results show that energy demand of ozonation at the wastewater treatment plant is dependent upon the ozone dosage and is significantly higher than energy demand of PAC addition or GAC filtration (2 to 4 times higher without consideration of delivery heads). Despite uncertainties regarding the energy demand for production of activated carbon, it could be shown that the cumulative energy demand of adsorption steps is significantly higher than the energy demand at the WWTP. Using reactivated GAC can lead to energy and greenhouse gas emissions savings compared to using fresh GAC/PAC. Moreover, energy demand is always plant-specific and depends on different factors (delivery heads, existing filtration or post-treatment etc.). Since processes for elimination of organic micropollutants are still in a developing phase, future optimization steps shall minimize their energy demand. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The baseline experiment was a long integration of a state-of-the-art-coupled atmosphere-ocean-land general circulation model (GCM). A sensitivity experiment was conducted in which the ocean and atmosphere were fully interactive but the soil moisture was specified. This paper describes a connection found between land-atmosphere coupling and midlatitude sea surface temperature (SST) variability in the North American-North Atlantic sector. Specifying soil moisture results in a reduction in surface and atmospheric temperature variability and also an increase in net heat flux variability. Surface temperature variance is reduced because it is constrained by the fixed soil moistures. Since the surface temperature cannot equilibrate with a given atmospheric anomaly, the resulting heat flux will be quite large and will act to damp the atmospheric anomaly. This is consistent with larger heat flux variance and reduced temperature variance in the simulation with suppressed land processes. SST anomalies in the midlatitude Atlantic are sensitive to air temperature and moisture anomalies modified over the North American continent, so it is not unexpected that SST variance is significantly reduced when land temperature variability decreases. Oceanic 're-emergence' operates in both simulations but is weaker in the fixed soil moisture integration, particularly in a region of the western North Atlantic contiguous with North America. Reemergence is the mechanism by which late winter ocean temperature anomalies are sequestered below the stable summer ocean mixed layer and reentrained into the deepening autumn mixed layer. The larger oceanic anomalies in the fully coupled simulation decay more slowly and are a partial explanation for stronger reemergence. However, during the second winter, the atmospheric forcing favors the same sign of SST anomalies as those reemerging and, therefore, acts to reinforce the anomalies in the fully coupled simulation. An area averaged SST index was constructed for the region of the western North Atlantic where reemergence was most notably reduced. This index was used to construct composites which suggest that, in the fully coupled model, land surface temperature and SST anomalies both reemerge the second winter, whereas in the suppressed land processes simulation, there is no winter-to-winter reappearance of land surface temperature anomalies. The late winter land temperatures are able to reemerge in fall because of the persistence of soil moisture anomalies. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

However, obtaining a comprehensive perspective on wind energy considering the many diverse factors that impact its development and growth is challenging. A significant factor in the evolution of wind energy is technological advancement and most previous reviews have focused on this topic. However, wind energy is influenced by a host of other factors, such as financial viability, environmental concerns, government incentives, and the impact of wind on the ecosystem. This review aims to fill a gap, providing a comprehensive review on the diverse factors impacting wind energy development and providing readers with a holistic panoramic, furnishing a clearer perspective on its future growth. Data for wind energy was evaluated by applying pivot data analytics and geographic information systems. The factors impacting wind energy growth and development are reviewed, providing an overview of how these factors have impacted wind maturity. The future of wind energy development is assessed considering its social acceptance, financial viability, government incentives, and the minimization of the unintended potential negative impacts of this technology. The review is able to conclude that wind energy may continue growing all over the world as long as all the factors critical to its development are addressed.

Product quality is everything in this industry and attention to detail is essential. Postharvest-handling methods developed over 20 years ago for cut flowers are still current practice in the fresh flower industry. Current problems with cut flower longevity and quality are not only associated with differences in the geographical locations of production, new improved varieties, long-distance transport from farm to market, improper transport and storage temperatures and undesirable handling practices, but also by limited resources. This report will focus on the following methods whereby optimum vase-life can be maintained even when the product is cultivated in a hot climate by growers with limited resources. Experiments were conducted to determine the following: (1) optimum maturity at harvesting, (2) optimum hanging time in the greenhouse, (3) optimum post harvest solution hydration time, (4) optimum solution temperature, and (5) optimum pH of post harvest solution. If all the results and recommendations arising out of the above experiments are implemented, growers in hot climates and with limited resources such as non-cooled pack-house, dry packaging, non-cooled transport are able to produce Gerbera cut flowers having a vase-life of at least 14 d.","ARC Inst Trop & Subtrop Crops, ZA-1200 Nelspruit, Mpumalanga, South Africa",,"Hannweg, KF (corresponding author), ARC Inst Trop & Subtrop Crops, ZA-1200 Nelspruit, Mpumalanga, South Africa.",,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,3,INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-90-6605-309-0,ACTA HORTIC,,,2008,768,,,,437,443,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2008.768.57,http://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2008.768.57,,,7,Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BID72,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000258744700057,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the number of concepts explored by these approaches can grow to the millions for complex learning problems. This often leads to impractical runtimes. We propose to alleviate this problem by predicting the length of target concepts before the exploration of the solution space. By these means, we can prune the search space during concept learning. To achieve this goal, we compare four neural architectures and evaluate them on four benchmarks. Our evaluation results suggest that recurrent neural network architectures perform best at concept length prediction with a macro F-measure ranging from 38% to 92%. We then extend the CELOE algorithm, which learns ALC concepts, with our concept length predictor. Our extension yields the algorithm CLIP. In our experiments, CLIP is at least 7.5 x faster than other state-of-the-art concept learning algorithms for ALC-including CELOE-and achieves significant improvements in the F-measure of the concepts learned on 3 out of 4 datasets.

Thermal/chemical expansion behaviour, total electrical conductivities, and oxygen permeation rates were investigated. The substitution of Ti with Co leads to an increase in both electronic and ionic conductivities and, therefore, oxygen permeability. Thermal and chemical expansions also increase slightly. The optimum Co content was found to be 25-35% due to the trade-off between phase stability and permeability. The oxygen permeation rate of STC35 is comparable to that of state-of-the-art (La,Sr)(Co,Fe)O3-delta, whereas the expansion coefficients are lower. Co doping in STCF-y did not produce any significant differences in oxygen permeability at both high temperature and sample thickness (1.0 mm), i.e. in a solid-state diffusion-limited regime. At lower temperatures (< 800 degrees C), STC25 exhibits higher permeability than STF25 due to the higher catalytic activity of Co compared to Fe.","[Liu, Yang; Baumann, Stefan; Schulze-Kueppers, Falk; Guillon, Olivier] Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Energy & Climate Res Mat Synth & Proc IEK 1, Leo Brandt Str, D-52425 Julich, Germany; [Mueller, David N.] Forschungszentrum Julich, Peter Grunberg Inst Elect Properties PGI 6, Leo Brandt Str, D-52425 Julich, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Research Center Julich; Helmholtz Association; Research Center Julich,"Liu, Y (corresponding author), Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Energy & Climate Res Mat Synth & Proc IEK 1, Leo Brandt Str, D-52425 Julich, Germany.",ya.liu@fz-juelich.de,"Baumann, Stefan/ABF-3574-2021; Schulze-Küppers, Falk/ABD-6281-2021","Baumann, Stefan/0000-0002-7302-7103; Schulze-Küppers, Falk/0000-0001-6985-3835",China Scholarship Council (CSC),China Scholarship Council (CSC)(China Scholarship Council),"We would like to thank the China Scholarship Council (CSC) for providing financial support for this work.

However, there are no published research studies on refurbishment projects within the student accommodation sector. Refurbishment is an emergent trend to upgrade existing stock to ensure that buildings meet rising energy efficiency demands. Moreover, it is widely affirmed that greenhouse gases contribute to climate change and notably the built environment is a significant contributor, both through its construction and during its operation and use. This paper demonstrates through a comparative case study approach, how greenhouse gases levels can be effectively measured during refurbishment works. There are multiple metrics used for quantification/assessment of greenhouse gases performance and this paper aims to make well-argued recommendations for their best use. Four student accommodation refurbishment projects are presented to compare and contrast differing emission datasets. The results dictate that project cost and duration cannot alone be used to gauge greenhouse gases emissions; more too, in the instance of student accommodation refurbishment, gross internal floor area and the number of rooms offers a more predictable indicator. It is recommended that refurbishment developers reflect on these recommendations when reporting the primary energy and GHG performance of their refurbishment works. Best practice from this research may be adopted into domestic buildings refurbishment projects. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Lou, Eric C.

Iran is one Middle Eastern country facing a growing water crisis. Rafsanjan county, located in the province of Kerman, is losing its pistachio orchards to water shortages and climate change. The modernisation of irrigation methods and transfer of water from other regions have been the main strategies taken by the governmental authorities. The lack of success of these strategies has led to the emergence of more participatory approaches in the transformation of the agricultural sector and local urban planning in Rafsanjan. This study analyses the actor network of transformation in the agricultural sector and the rise of high-tech urban agriculture, and aims to understand the role of technologies in supporting citizen participation in local urban planning. The research draws on the concept of Technology-Driven Transitions (TDT). The interactions among social and materials entities and the impact of technological novelties on the re-configuration of their relationships in the transition process were studied. The research comprised an exploratory case study, and data were gathered through observations, document study and in-depth interviews with farmers, planners, researchers, and policy makers in Rafsanjan. The results of the study show that governmental planning organizations and their implementation bodies, such as the Agricultural Research, Education and Extension Organization (AREEO) and the 10-year plan for the development of greenhouses, were the most influential actants in the transition process. Their relationships with the other actants involved, such as the private sector, knowledge institutes and farmers, were re-configured by technological novelties. This re-configuration of relationships has led to strengthened participatory decision making in local urban planning in Rafsanjan.","[Farhangi, Mohsen] Linkoping Univ, Dept Themat Studies Technol & Social Change, S-58183 Linkoping, Sweden; [Farhangi, Sara] Univ Iuav Venice, Dept Art & Architecture, I-30135 Venice, Italy; [van de Vlasakker, Paulien C.

The aim of the Agrimonde-Terra foresight study was to build global scenarios linking land use and food security, with special attention paid to overlooked aspects such as nutrition and health, in order to help explore the possible future of the global food system. In this article, we seek to highlight how the resulting set of scenarios contributes to the debate on land use and food security and enlarges the range of possible futures for the global food system. We highlight four main contributions. Combining a scenario building method based on morphological analysis and quantitative simulations with a tractable and simple biomass balance model, the proposed approach improves transparency and coherence between scenario narratives and quantitative assessment. Agrimonde-Terra's scenarios comprise a wide range of alternative diets, with contrasting underlying nutritional and health issues, which accompany contrasting urbanization and rural transformation processes, both dimensions that are lacking in other sets of global scenarios. Agrimonde-Terra's scenarios share some similarities with existing sets of global scenarios, notably the SSPs, but are usually less optimistic regarding agricultural land expansion up to 2050. Results suggest that changing global diets toward healthier patterns could also help to limit the expansion in agricultural land area. Agrimonde-Terra's scenarios enlarge the scope of possible futures by proposing two pathways that are uncommon in other sets of global scenarios. The first proposes to explore possible reconnection of the food industry and regional production within supranational regional blocs. The second means that we should consider that a 'perfect storm', induced by climate change and an ecological crisis combined with social and economic crises, is still possible. Both scenarios should be part of the debate as the current context of the COVID-19 pandemic shows.","[Mora, Olivier; Donnars, Catherine; Rechauchere, Olivier; Manceron, Stephane; Barzman, Marc; Marty, Pauline] Inst Natl Rech Agr Alimentat & Environm INRAE, DEPE, Paris, France; [Le Mouel, Chantal; Marajo-Petitzon, Elodie] Agrocampus Ouest, SMART LERECO, Inst Natl Rech Agr Alimentat & Environm INRAE, Rennes, France; [de Lattre-Gasquet, Marie] Ctr Cooperat Int Rech Agron Dev CIRAD, ART DEV, Montpellier, France; [de Lattre-Gasquet, Marie] Univ Montpellier 3, CNRS, CIRAD, ART DEV,Univ Montpellier, Montpellier, France; [de Lattre-Gasquet, Marie] Univ Perpignan Via Domitia, Montpellier, France; [Dumas, Patrice] Ctr Cooperat Int Rech Agron Dev CIRAD, CIRED, Montpellier, France; [Brunelle, Thierry] Ctr Cooperat Int Rech Agron Dev CIRAD, CIRED, Nogent Sur Marne, France; [Moreau, Clemence] Ctr Cooperat Int Rech Agron Dev CIRAD, Paris, France; [Forslund, Agneta] Inst Natl Rech Agr Alimentat & Environm INRAE, Dept EcoSocio, Rennes, France",INRAE; INRAE; Institut Agro; Agrocampus Ouest; CIRAD; Universite de Montpellier; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CIRAD; Universite de Montpellier; Universite Paul-Valery; CIRAD; Ecole des Ponts ParisTech; AgroParisTech; CIRAD; Ecole des Ponts ParisTech; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; CIRAD; INRAE,"Mora, O (corresponding author), Inst Natl Rech Agr Alimentat & Environm INRAE, DEPE, Paris, France.",olivier.mora@inrae.fr,"MOREAU, Clémence/AAR-1194-2021","Le Mouel, Chantal/0000-0001-8805-1918; Mora, Olivier/0000-0002-4155-1955; de Lattre-Gasquet, Marie/0000-0002-7874-9762",,,,,89,38,40,8,44,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,8-Jul,2020,7,,,,,,e0235597,10.1371/journal.pone.0235597,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0235597,,,29,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics,MQ0QI,32639991,"Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000552601500044,View Full Record in Web of Science

The numerical results feature a growing peak in the size distribution whose magnitude is reproduced well analytically, and are consistent with the observed particle number concentration at sizes greater than 25 nm (measured dry diameter), but suggest that most of the aerosol was at unobserved smaller sizes. Because of growth and coagulation, number concentrations of the aerosol rapidly become independent of the number initially nucleated, so that conclusions as to the nucleation process, either homogeneous or ion-induced nucleation, cannot easily be drawn from existing atmospheric observations. The final concentration is very insensitive to the magnitude of the SO(2) source, but, if condensation on, and coagulation with, a remnant background aerosol occurs, such nucleation events will be cut off for source magnitudes less than a specific value. Anthropogenic emissions of SO(2) which exceed this value can produce higher aerosol number concentrations in the atmosphere with consequences for the indirect effect of aerosols on the climate.

J,"Hope, G",,,,"Hope, Geoffrey",,,"Environmental change and fire in the Owen Stanley Ranges, Papua New Guinea",QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,EARLY AGRICULTURE; HUMAN SETTLEMENT; GLACIATION; VEGETATION; INDONESIA; PROVINCE,"Kosipe, an upland valley at 2000 m altitude in the Owen Stanley Ranges of southeastern New Guinea, is known for the discovery of large stone waisted blades dated to 31400 cal a BP. The purpose of these tools and the nature of occupation are unknown. The altitude is too high for most food crops today and may have stood close to the treeline during the last glaciation. Three pollen and charcoal diagrams from a large swamp in the Kosipe Valley provide a record of swamp and dryland changes for more than 50 000 years. There have been considerable fluctuations in vegetation on the slopes and on the swamp which reflect both environmental change and anthropogenic influences. A gymnosperm-rich forest at the base is replaced by mountain forest dominated by Nothofagus about 42000 years ago. Fire first becomes apparent across the swamp around 40 000 years ago but is not common during the time when subalpine herbs reach their best representation. Tree fern-rich grasslands form a mosaic with montane forest in a near-treeline environment. The Pleistocene-Holocene boundary is marked by a decline in Nothofagus and increase in lower montane mixed forest taxa. Charcoal increases before this time and the swamp vegetation becomes more grass-rich. Charcoal is at its maximum through the last 3000 years possibly reflecting climate variability as well as sedentary occupation and agriculture on the swamp margin. Supplementary pollen diagrams from two higher altitude sites support the evidence from the Kosipe Swamp cores.

Streamflow variability and temporal evolution are impacted by the presence of lakes in the river network; therefore, any change in the lake state can induce a modification of the regional hydrological regime. Despite the importance of the impact of lakes on hydrological fluxes and the water balance, a representation of the mass budget is generally not included in climate models and global-scale hydrological modeling platforms. The goal of this study is to introduce a new lake mass module, MLake (Mass-Lake model), into the river-routing model CTRIP to resolve the specific mass balance of open-water bodies. Based on the inherent CTRIP parameters, the development of the non-calibrated MLake model was introduced to examine the influence of such hydrological buffer areas on global-scale river-routing performance. In the current study, an offline evaluation was performed for four river networks using a set of state-of-the-art quality atmospheric forcings and a combination of in situ and satellite measurements for river discharge and lake level observations. The results reveal a general improvement in CTRIP-simulated discharge and its variability, while also generating realistic lake level variations. MLake produces more realistic streamflows both in terms of daily and seasonal correlation. Excluding the specific case of Lake Victoria having low performances, the mean skill score of Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE) is 0.41 while the normalized information contribution (NIC) shows a mean improvement of 0.56 (ranging from 0.15 to 0.94). Streamflow results are spatially scale-dependent, with better scores associated with larger lakes and increased sensitivity to the width of the lake outlet. Regarding lake level variations, results indicate a good agreement between observations and simulations with a mean correlation of 0.56 (ranging from 0.07 to 0.92) which is linked to the capability of the model to retrieve seasonal variations. Discrepancies in the results are mainly explained by the anthropization of the selected lakes, which introduces high-frequency variations in both streamflows and lake levels that degraded the scores. Anthropization effects are prevalent in most of the lakes studied, but they are predominant for Lake Victoria and are the main cause for relatively low statistical scores for the Nile River However, results on the Angara and the Neva rivers also depend on the inherent gap of ISBA-CTRIP process representation, which relies on further development such as the partitioned energy budget between the snow and the canopy over a boreal zone. The study is a first step towards a global coupled land system that will help to qualitatively assess the evolution of future global water resources, leading to improvements in flood risk and drought forecasting.","[Guinaldo, Thibault; Munier, Simon; Le Moigne, Patrick; Boone, Aaron; Decharme, Bertrand; Leroux, Delphine J.] Univ Toulouse, Meteo France, CNRS, Ctr Natl Rech Meteorol, Toulouse, France; [Choulga, Margarita] European Ctr Medium Range Weather Forecasts ECMWF, Res Dept, Reading RG2 9AX, Berks, England",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Meteo France; Universite de Toulouse; European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF),"Guinaldo, T (corresponding author), Univ Toulouse, Meteo France, CNRS, Ctr Natl Rech Meteorol, Toulouse, France.",thibault.guinaldo@meteo.fr,"Le+Moigne, Patrick/AAU-9622-2020; Decharme, Bertrand/Z-4563-2019; Munier, Simon/D-3849-2011","Decharme, Bertrand/0000-0002-8661-1464; Choulga, Margarita/0000-0003-4393-931X; Munier, Simon/0000-0001-7176-8584",,,,,126,2,2,4,15,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1991-959X,1991-9603,,GEOSCI MODEL DEV,Geosci.

However, the state-of-the-art electrolyte material currently used in intermediate-temperature SOFCs (yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ)) does not provide sufficiently high ionic conductivity for low temperature applications. When looking for alternatives, the conductivity values for each material found in widely cited literature can be confusing, as the reported values are sometimes in conflict with each other. Therefore, we present a systematic comparison of the conductivity of the three most popular, commercially available electrolyte materials, i.e., YSZ, scandia-stabilized zirconia (ScSZ), and gadolinium-doped ceria (GDC). By using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to characterize the ionic conductivities, we find that at 500 degrees C, GDC has a higher ionic conductivity (5.8 x 10(-3) S cm(-1)) than ScSZ (2.5 x 10(-3) S cm(-1) ) and YSZ (1.1 x 10(-3) S cm(-1)). The properties of the starting powders, powder processing and the microstructure after sintering were considered. This conductivity comparison can be used as a guide when deciding on electrolyte materials for different SOFC applications, especially when the fabrication of different thickness of the electrolyte layer has to be considered and rectify misleading information in the literature.","[Zhang, Jun; Lenser, Christian; Menzler, Norbert H.; Guillon, Olivier] Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Energy & Climate Res, Mat Synth & Proc IEK 1, Julich, Germany; [Guillon, Olivier] JARA Energy, D-52425 Julich, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Research Center Julich,"Zhang, J (corresponding author), Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Energy & Climate Res, Mat Synth & Proc IEK 1, Julich, Germany.",jun.zhang@fz-juelich.de,"Zhang, Jun/U-7027-2019","Menzler, Norbert H./0000-0001-7091-0980; Zhang, Jun/0000-0001-5929-6801",Chinese Scholarship Council (CSC),Chinese Scholarship Council (CSC)(China Scholarship Council),"The Chinese Scholarship Council (CSC) is highly appreciated for its financial support for Jun Zhang's study in Forschungszentrum Jillich.

Little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying the observed physiological impacts in fish. We used RNAseq to characterize the transcriptome of 3 different larval stages of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) exposed to simulated OA at levels (1179 mu atm CO2) representing end-of-century predictions compared to controls (503 mu atm CO2), which were shown to induce tissue damage and elevated mortality in G. morhua. Only few genes were differentially expressed in 6 and 13 days-post-hatching (dph) (3 and 16 genes, respectively), during a period when maximal mortality as a response to elevated pCO(2) occurred. At 36 dph, 1413 genes were differentially expressed, most likely caused by developmental asynchrony between the treatment groups, with individuals under OA growing faster. A target gene analysis revealed only few genes of the universal and well-defined cellular stress response to be differentially expressed. We thus suggest that predicted ocean acidification levels constitute a stealth stress for early Atlantic cod larvae, with a rapid breakdown of cellular homeostasis leading to organismal death that was missed even with an 8-fold replication implemented in this study.","[Mittermayer, F.

We map the spatial distribution of dust input using three different geochemical tracers of eolian dust, He-4, Th-232 and rare earth elements, in combination with grain size distribution data, from a set of core-top sediments covering the entire Subarctic North Pacific. Using the suite of geochemical proxies to fingerprint different lithogenic components, we deconvolve eolian dust input from other lithogenic inputs such as volcanic ash, ice-rafted debris, riverine and hemipelagic input. While the open ocean sites far away from the volcanic arcs are dominantly composed of pure eolian dust, lithogenic components other than eolian dust play a more crucial role along the arcs. In sites dominated by dust, eolian dust input appears to be characterized by a nearly uniform grain size mode at similar to 4 mu m. Applying the Th-230-normalization technique, our proxies yield a consistent pattern of uniform dust fluxes of 1-2 g/m(2)/yr across the Subarctic North Pacific. Elevated eolian dust fluxes of 2-4 g/m(2)/yr characterize the westernmost region off Japan and the southern Kurile Islands south of 45 degrees N and west of 165 degrees E along the main pathway of the westerly winds. The core-top based dust flux reconstruction is consistent with recent estimates based on dissolved thorium isotope concentrations in seawater from the Subarctic North Pacific. The dust flux pattern compares well with state-of-the-art dust model predictions in the western and central Subarctic North Pacific, but we find that dust fluxes are higher than modeled fluxes by 0.5-1 g/m(2)/yr in the northwest, northeast and eastern Subarctic North Pacific. Our results provide an important benchmark for biogeochemical models and a robust approach for downcore studies testing dust-induced iron fertilization of past changes in biological productivity in the Subarctic North Pacific.

Participants Individuals from Yellowknife and surrounding communities presenting for care between 2012 and 2015. Main outcome measures Emergency room (ER) presentations, hospital admissions and clinic visits for cardiorespiratory events, and outpatient salbutamol prescriptions Results The median 24-hour mean particulate matter (PM2.5) was fivefold higher in the summer of 2014 compared with 2012, 2013 and 2015 (median=30.8 mu g/m(3)), with the mean peaking at 320.3 mu g/m(3).

Compared with 2012 and 2013, salbutamol dispensations in 2014 increased by 48%; clinic visits for asthma, pneumonia and cough increased; ER visits for asthma doubled, with the highest rate in females, in adults aged >= 40 years and in Dene people, while pneumonia increased by 57%, with higher rates in males, in individualsaged Conclusions Severe wildfires in 2014 resulted in extended poor air quality associated with increases in health resource utilization; some impacts were seen disproportionately among vulnerable populations, such as children and Indigenous individuals. Public health advisories asking people to stay inside were inadequately protective, with compliance possibly impacted by the prolonged exposure.

A state-of-the-art fully-coupled model, the Simulating WAves Nearshore (SWAN) model with unstructured grids and the ADvanced CIRCulation (ADCIRC) model, was used to study the hydrodynamic response in the Gulf of Maine during the Patriot's Day storm of 2007, a notable example of nor'easters in this area. The model predictions agree well with the observed tide-surges and waves during this storm event. Waves and circulation in the Gulf of Maine were analyzed. The Georges Bank plays an important role in dissipating wave energy through the bottom friction when waves propagate over the bank from offshore to the inner gulf due to its shallow bathymetry. Wave energy dissipation results in decreasing significant wave height (SWH) in the cross-bank direction and wave radiation stress gradient, which in turn induces changes in currents. While the tidal currents are dominant over the Georges Bank and in the Bay of Fundy, the residual currents generated by the meteorological forcing and waves are significant over the Georges Bank and in the coastal area and can reach 0.3 m/s and 0.2 m/s, respectively. In the vicinity of the coast, the longshore current generated by the surface wind stress and wave radiation stress acting parallel to the coastline is inversely proportional to the water depth and will eventually be limited by the bottom friction.

These microorganisms in surface waters worldwide exhibit pronounced seasonal succession patterns, governed by physicochemical factors (e.g., light, climate, and nutrient loading) that are determined by latitude and distance to shore. Moreover, we emphasize that the effects of large-scale factors are modulated regionally, and over shorter timespans (days to weeks), by biological interactions including molecule exchanges, viral lysis, and grazing. Thus the interplay and scaling between factors ultimately determine the success of particular bacterial populations. Spatiotemporal surveys of bacterioplankton community composition provide the necessary frame for interpreting how the distinct metabolisms encoded in the genomes of different bacteria regulate biogeochemical cycles.","[Bunse, Carina; Pinhassi, Jarone] Linnaeus Univ, Ctr Ecol & Evolut Microbial Model Syst EEMiS, Kalmar, Sweden",Linnaeus University,"Pinhassi, J (corresponding author), Linnaeus Univ, Ctr Ecol & Evolut Microbial Model Syst EEMiS, Kalmar, Sweden.",jarone.pinhassi@lnu.se,,,"Linnaeus University Center for Ecology and Evolution in Microbial model Systems (EEMiS); Swedish Research Council VR; Swedish Research Council FORMAS; BONUS BLUEPRINT project from BONUS, the joint Baltic Sea Research and Development Programme - European Union [185]","Linnaeus University Center for Ecology and Evolution in Microbial model Systems (EEMiS); Swedish Research Council VR(Swedish Research Council); Swedish Research Council FORMAS(Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council Formas); BONUS BLUEPRINT project from BONUS, the joint Baltic Sea Research and Development Programme - European Union","We thank Markus Lindh for valuable feedback during the development of this manuscript.

Bioenergy with carbon dioxide capture and storage/utilisation (BECCS/U) through its CO2 negative emission capacity is considered a principal component of global mitigation strategies as agreed in the Paris climate change agreement. In this study, the current global status and efforts to implement BECCS systems are comprehensively reviewed. The potential for thermochemical conversion processes (combustion, gasification, pyrolysis, and liquefaction) to manifest within BECCS systems is analysed, in addition to their integration potential with carbon dioxide capture methods. Outcomes suggest that gasification and combustion processes when integrated with CO2 capture and storage (CCS), within combine heat and power (CHP) configurations, biomass integrated gasification combine cycle (BIGCC) and chemical looping cycle (CLC) are mature technologies. Furthermore, this review indicates that pyrolysis and liquefaction process are commercial and lab-scale respectively. When integrated within BECCS systems, pyrolysis systems are at the pilot level and liquefaction processes are at lab scale. Moreover, a comprehensive discussion on the negative emission potential from various BECCS configurations is provided, highlighting their role in advancing bio-refineries through waste management and conversion to value-added products such as biochar, ethanol, bio diesel etc. The pyrolysis process has CO2 mitigation potential of 2.2 GtCO(2)/year by 2020-2050. Finally, an insight into the commercial barriers and future perspectives of BECCS technologies, role of international supply chains therein, and the need for effective stakeholder management to facilitate BECCS systems within global trade.","[Shahbaz, Muhammad; AlNouss, Ahmed; Ghiat, Ikhlas; Mckay, Gordon; Mackey, Hamish; Elkhalifa, Samar; Al-Ansari, Tareq] Hamad Bin Khalifa Univ, Qatar Fdn, Coll Sci & Engn, Educ City POB 5825, Doha, Qatar",Qatar Foundation (QF); Hamad Bin Khalifa University-Qatar,"Al-Ansari, T (corresponding author), Hamad Bin Khalifa Univ, Qatar Fdn, Coll Sci & Engn, Educ City POB 5825, Doha, Qatar.",talansari@hbku.edu.qa,"Shahbaz, Muhammad/R-9625-2019","Shahbaz, Muhammad/0000-0003-2295-8167; Ghiat, Ikhlas/0000-0002-4421-9413; Elkhalifa, Samar/0000-0002-2534-6919; Al-Ansari, Tareq/0000-0002-2932-8240","Hamad Bin Khalifa University; Qatar National Library, Qatar","Hamad Bin Khalifa University; Qatar National Library, Qatar","The authors would like to thank Hamad Bin Khalifa University for supporting this research.

By adding a small amount of a high boiling point solvent or molecules to a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solution, processing additive techniques have recently begun to offer an attractive and efficient method for controlling the nanoscale BHJ morphology of state-of-the-art OSCs with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) exceeding approximately 11%. However, it remains unknown whether the effect of processing additives can potentially pave the way for the ongoing development of various BHJ components and the commercialization of OSCs. Here, recent progress in understanding and developing the effects of processing additives on OSCs is highlighted. This overview suggests possible guidelines for a wide range of BHJ components with respect to morphological/structural evolution. Furthermore, the rational correlations among processing additives, BHJ components, and fabrication technologies and the performance of high-performance and low-cost OSCs are discussed along with future commercialization prospects.","[Lee, Jong-Hoon; Lee, Jinho; Hong, Soonil; Lee, Kwanghee] GIST, SMSE, Gwangju 61005, South Korea; [Kwon, Sooncheol; Kang, Hongkyu; Lee, Jong-Hoon; Lee, Jinho; Hong, Soonil; Kim, Heejoo; Lee, Kwanghee] GIST, HCAM, Gwangju 61005, South Korea; [Kwon, Sooncheol; Kang, Hongkyu; Kim, Heejoo; Lee, Kwanghee] GIST, Res Inst Solar & Sustainable Energies RISE, Gwangju 61005, South Korea",Gwangju Institute of Science & Technology (GIST); Gwangju Institute of Science & Technology (GIST); Gwangju Institute of Science & Technology (GIST),"Lee, K (corresponding author), GIST, SMSE, Gwangju 61005, South Korea.;Kim, H; Lee, K (corresponding author), GIST, HCAM, Gwangju 61005, South Korea.;Kim, H; Lee, K (corresponding author), GIST, Res Inst Solar & Sustainable Energies RISE, Gwangju 61005, South Korea.",heejook@giat.ac.kr; klee@gist.ac.kr,,"Kwon, Sooncheol/0000-0003-2799-9558; Lee, Jinho/0000-0001-5108-8733","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korea government (MSIP) [NRF-2014R1A2A1A09006137]; R&D program of MSIP/COMPA [2015K000199]; Technology Development Program to Solve Climate Changes of the NRF - Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning [NRF-2015M1A2A2057510]; National Research Foundation of Korea(NRF) - Korea government(MSIP) [NRF-2015K1A3A1A16002247]; GIST Research Institute (GRI)","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korea government (MSIP); R&D program of MSIP/COMPA; Technology Development Program to Solve Climate Changes of the NRF - Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning; National Research Foundation of Korea(NRF) - Korea government(MSIP); GIST Research Institute (GRI)","S.K. and H.K. contributed equally to this study.

To urban architectures, the developing mode has to be done from traditional high-consumption developing mode to low-consumption and low-pollution developing mode. Ecological architecture is the essential way for such transformation and also the essential trends to current world development. Ecological architecture refers to minimum affect environment; make full use of environmentally natural resources to realize high-efficiency utilization of resources and energy; satisfy people's demands with healthy, applicable and effective living environment, to achieve harmony between man and architectures; it is a big and complex systematic engineering including nature, society, economy and civilization, etc. Only if in a balanced state, the ecological architectures can be realized in overall significance and realize the object of sustainable development. Ecological construction in the design process should follow the overall design principle, Low-consumption and pollution-free principle, decrease the consumption on materials and energy, improve the utilization of energy. Decrease energy consumption of architectures by smart architecture systems. Designers also have to make reasonable use of sunlight, wind, rain and other natural energy according to various climate characteristics, design properly, decrease waste of non-renewable resources and advocate the recycles and reuse of energy.

Their impact can be devastating. The tropical cycloneIdai, which hit land in Mozambique in 2019, was one of the deadliest storms on record in the Southern Hemisphere. Previous studies have found that the tracks and strengths of tropical storms and cyclones are difficult to predict more than a few days ahead. An extension of this forecast horizon would be crucial for enabling authorities to take precautionary actions. Here, the ability of the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) state-of-the-art ensemble prediction model to predictIdaiand 38 other tropical systems is assessed. Local wind speed maxima and sea-level pressure (SLP) minima were predicted by about 25% of the ensemble members at lead times of 1-3 days but only about 5% of the members at 7-9 days' lead times. However, several variables showed potential as precursors of tropical storms and cyclones, and some of these could be predicted at long lead times. In particular, SLP anomalies, which were significantly lower than normal multiple days before the peaks of the storms, were skilfully predicted by the ensemble mean at lead times of at least 3 weeks. Specific humidity at 500 hPa and divergence at 200 hPa were higher than normal several days before the peaks, and these potential precursors were also forecasted with skill up to about 2 weeks in advance. The inclusion of forecasts of these variables as predictors in hybrid statistical-dynamical forecasting systems could potentially extend the time horizon for prediction and early detection of possible tropical storms and cyclones in the region.","[Kolstad, Erik W.] NORCE Climate, Jahnebakken 5, N-5007 Bergen, Norway",Norwegian Research Centre (NORCE),"Kolstad, EW (corresponding author), NORCE Climate, Jahnebakken 5, N-5007 Bergen, Norway.",ekol@norceresearch.no,"Kolstad, Erik/A-2311-2015; Kolstad, Erik Olsøybakk/GYJ-6310-2022","Kolstad, Erik/0000-0001-5394-9541; ",Norges Forskningsrad [270733],Norges Forskningsrad,"Norges Forskningsrad, Grant/Award Number: 270733",,59,10,10,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0035-9009,1477-870X,,Q J ROY METEOR SOC,Q.

Studies have focused on urban streets, studying the aspect ratio, the orientation, street vegetation patterns, etc. and how they affect thermal comfort. While the role of vegetation is undeniable, this paper asks the question whether the effects of a tree configuration does not vary under different street configurations, and if yes, how to select tree species and determine their appropriate layout. Here, an analytical framework is proposed to test the different tree configurations (changing one variable at a time) with the least favorable street configuration. It is confirmed that the east-west oriented streets are the least favorable cases and denser tree canopies are better for cooling. The interval between the trees are observed to have an optimal effect when it is equal to the crown width at maturity. Furthermore, the results show that the heat mitigation rate of a tree configuration is not linearly improved by the Aspect Ratio (AR). In the case of Shantou city, the improvement of thermal comfort slows down when the AR reaches 1.5 while Mangifera indica planted with 10 m intervals is recommended among the common street-tree species. Other species could be used also, but should meet the requirements of the canopy density and the interval of layout. The paper does not consider other configuration options such as asymmetrical cases of street geometry and one-side or axial tree planting, etc., but the framework allows for adding such options and simulating thermal comfort for a greater number of scenarios.","[Zheng, Bohong; Bedra, Komi Bernard] Cent South Univ, Sch Architecture & Art, Changsha 410083, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Jian; Wang, Guoguang] South China Univ Technol, Sch Architecture, Guangzhou 510641, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Wang, Guoguang] South China Univ Technol, State Key Lab Subtrop Bldg Sci, Guangzhou 510641, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Central South University; South China University of Technology; South China University of Technology,"Zheng, J (corresponding author), South China Univ Technol, Sch Architecture, Guangzhou 510641, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",zhengbohong@csu.edu.cn; komibedra@csu.edu.cn; arzhengjian@mail.scut.edu.cn; wgg999@126.com,"Wang, Guoguang/AAA-2629-2021","BEDRA, KOMI/0000-0003-1848-4309",Natural Science Foundation of China [51478470],Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This research was funded by the Natural Science Foundation of China, grant number 51478470.",,78,6,7,6,37,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,NOV,2018,11,,,,,,4192,10.3390/su10114192,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su10114192,,,23,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HC1AQ,,"Green Published, Green Submitted, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000451531700366,View Full Record in Web of Science

But in contrast to the plethora of modelling studies, the practical implementation of outcomes is comparatively small. There is an urgent need to implement results and to show the practical validation of the concept developed, especially against the context of water stress mitigation. The participative development of modelling studies as a joint effort of stakeholders and modellers is seen as a key to achieve a wider identification, acceptance, trust and applicability, of results. Participatory planning in the water sector is also increasingly requested in water management, where tasks have been for clarified decades through different institutional arrangements and national laws. Stakeholder involvement in water resources management have been limited to what was long time seen as participation, merely information on action to be taken. In the last decade the need for participation has been reflected in different ways. In Europe, the implementation of the Water Framework Directive (WFD) under Art. 14, requires all the European countries to involve stakeholders in decision making processes on water resource management. The aim of this paper is to present and discuss the research framework and possible results of investigating dam modelling through participatory systems modelling. We introduce a structured approach to use participatory modelling (PM) for stimulating the integration of modelling and decision making, also as a way of implementation of some articles of the WFD.

We examine 5 different realisations of the ocean's overturning circulation produced by a fully coupled atmosphere-ocean model under LGM forcing and suggested changes in the atmospheric deposition of iron and phytoplankton physiology at the LGM. Measured changes in carbon-13 and carbon-14, as well as a qualitative reconstruction of the change in ocean carbon export are used to evaluate the results. Overall, we find that while a reduction in ocean ventilation at the LGM is necessary to reproduce carbon-13 and carbon-14 observations, this circulation results in a low net sink for atmospheric CO2. In contrast, while biogeochemical processes contribute little to carbon isotopes, we propose that most of the change in atmospheric CO2 was due to such factors. However, the lesser role for circulation means that when all plausible factors are accounted for, most of the necessary CO2 change remains to be explained.

Soil biogeochemistry involves the study of elemental cycling as mediated by complex and inseparable interactions between the biotic (living) and abiotic (non-living) components of soils. Human activities have substantially altered biogeochemical cycling of several key elements including carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and other secondary and minor nutrients over the past few decades, which, in turn, had serious environmental consequences. The present chapter outlines the soil biogeochemical investigations conducted within Indian subcontinent in both natural ecosystems and managed agricultural systems and addresses the state-of-the-art in order to understand the undergoing biogeochemical reactions. Here, we sought to clarify complex interactions generally occurred during biogeochemical transformations of an element (or compound) of interest within the type-specific soil. Further, we emphasized the importance of advancing our understanding of feedback loops in soil biogeochemical processes as altered by anthropogenic perturbations in tropical and sub-tropical soils of India. Overall, this chapter is broadly focused on the nutrient cycling, which is followed by more specific topics like soil microbiology, soil biodiversity, and soil biotechnology.","[Sihi, Debjani] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Div Environm Sci, Climate Change Sci Inst, POB 2008, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA; [Dari, Biswanath] Univ Idaho, Aberdeen Res & Extens Ctr, Aberdeen, ID USA",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Oak Ridge National Laboratory; Idaho; University of Idaho,"Sihi, D (corresponding author), Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Div Environm Sci, Climate Change Sci Inst, POB 2008, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA.",sihid@ornl.gov,"Sihi, Debjani/Q-3874-2017","Sihi, Debjani/0000-0002-5513-8862; Dari, Biswanath/0000-0001-9585-7661",,,,,122,1,1,0,2,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2211-1255,2211-1263,978-3-030-31082-0; 978-3-030-31080-6,WOR SOIL BOOK SER,,,2020,,,,,143,158,,10.1007/978-3-030-31082-0_8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-31082-0_8,10.1007/978-3-030-31082-0,,16,"Geography, Physical; Soil Science",Book Citation Index – Science (BKCI-S),Physical Geography; Agriculture,BR8WI,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000674461000010,View Full Record in Web of Science

At the time, the public's sensitivity and attitude to waste issues were mainly influenced by their own lifestyles. We consider five separate waste collections, namely paper, plastic, glass, aluminium and food waste, to be taken to the relevant roadside containers. It focuses on three types of environmental concerns, classified as egoistic, altruistic and biospheric, and identifies five measures of general environmental issues able to match the different types of concerns considered. It also controls for three types of social relations: bonding, bridging and linking social capital. We use the dataset from the Multipurpose Household Survey, conducted by the Italian National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT), and five probit models to shape the number of separate waste collections. The results show that greater concern for waste production and disposal, pollution, climate change, resource depletion and alteration of environmental heritage is related to a higher likelihood of doing household waste recycling. Nonetheless, for the highest number of separate waste collections, the magnitude of the marginal effect of environmental concern variables decreases, showing the relevance of marginal costs in recycling behaviour. Finally, bridging social capital is the only social capital positively correlated with all five separate waste collections. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, we have conducted a systematic literature review as an attempt to characterize the state-of-the-art in this field, i.e., by identifying existing research and by identifying gaps and opportunities for further research. We have focused on finding the primary studies in the existing literature, which were classified and analyzed according to four criteria: bibliometric key facts, research type facets, knowledge graph characteristics, and application scenarios. Besides, an evaluation of the primary studies has also been carried out to gain deeper insights in terms of methodology, empirical evidence, and relevance. As a result, we can offer a complete picture of the domain, which includes such interesting aspects as the fact that knowledge fusion is currently the main use case for knowledge graphs, that empirical research and industrial application are still missing to a large extent, that graph embeddings are not fully exploited, and that technical literature is fast-growing but still seems to be far from its peak.","[Buchgeher, Georg; Gabauer, David; Martinez-Gil, Jorge; Ehrlinger, Lisa] Software Competence Ctr Hagenberg GmbH, A-4232 Hagenberg, Austria; [Ehrlinger, Lisa] Johannes Kepler Univ Linz, Inst Applicat Oriented Knowledge Proc FAW, A-4040 Linz, Austria",Softwarepark Hagenberg; Johannes Kepler University Linz,"Buchgeher, G (corresponding author), Software Competence Ctr Hagenberg GmbH, A-4232 Hagenberg, Austria.",georg.buchgeher@scch.at,"Martinez-Gil, Jorge/O-4784-2016; Gabauer, David/E-1817-2018","Martinez-Gil, Jorge/0000-0002-5730-7965; Gabauer, David/0000-0003-2465-5741; Buchgeher, Georg/0000-0002-8565-6257; Ehrlinger, Lisa/0000-0001-5313-0368","Interreg Osterreich-Bayern 2014-2020 Programme [AB292]; Federal Ministry for Climate Action, Environment, Energy, Mobility, Innovation and Technology (BMK); Federal Ministry for Digital and Economic Affairs (BMDW); Province of Upper Austria in the frame of the COMET - Competence Centers for Excellent Technologies Programme","Interreg Osterreich-Bayern 2014-2020 Programme; Federal Ministry for Climate Action, Environment, Energy, Mobility, Innovation and Technology (BMK); Federal Ministry for Digital and Economic Affairs (BMDW); Province of Upper Austria in the frame of the COMET - Competence Centers for Excellent Technologies Programme","This work was supported in part by the Interreg Osterreich-Bayern 2014-2020 Programme funded under Grant (AB292), in part by the Federal Ministry for Climate Action, Environment, Energy, Mobility, Innovation and Technology (BMK), in part by the Federal Ministry for Digital and Economic Affairs (BMDW), and in part by the Province of Upper Austria in the frame of the COMET - Competence Centers for Excellent Technologies Programme managed by Austrian Research Promotion Agency FFG.",,72,8,9,35,115,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2021,,,,,55537,55554,,10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3070395,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3070395,,,18,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,RO4KZ,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,12/21/22,WOS:000641015200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

These new findings present the medical profession, in the climate of scarce resources, with the challenge of meeting these needs without discriminating in favour of, or against, individuals on the basis of their race.

The approach of Ecocity is derived from ignoring the ecosystem and natural context of cities during the modern era urban planning and the environmental and human crisis caused by it. Current environmental concerns are derived from rapid growth of the cities and urban life style. Therefore the solution should be found within the cities. Ecocity is rebuilding cities in harmony with nature and natural life-cycle of ecosystem. Correspondingly, the simultaneous survival of human being and biosphere could be achieved through reintegration of built and natural environment. Comparable to other divisions of sustainability, theoretical framework of Ecocity is an interdisciplinary issue. According to the comprehensive scope of the matter, there are plenty of ambiguities for policy makers, planners and urban designers in the field of implementation. This fact would decrease practicability of Ecocity or else the approach would not be applied according to its main principles. Considering the fact that saving the biosphere could not be achieved entirely by having a couple of Ecocities, Ecocity principles should be applicable in various ecological and natural basis of each and every city. This paper seeks to answer the following questions: Do specific criteria exist to define Ecocity morphology? How would unique characteristics of ecological context influence on those macro-criteria? The research method is descriptive-analytical based on literature review of existing documents and comparative analyses amongst various theories in the field. The findings represent convergence within Ecocity's morphological criteria in different approaches. The results indicates that the adaption of built environment with the climatic, natural and ecological basis of the city, considerable capitation of green areas within the city, disavowal of urban sprawl, mixed use zoning, pedestrian, bicycle and public transport priority, vast usage of renewable energy, evidences of biodiversity within the city and employing specific ecological, historical and cultural symbols to have an improved sense of belonging are the main morphological indicators of Ecocity. However, these indicators are used as an upstream urban plan and each of them could be redefined in detail according to ecological characteristics of a particular city. Accordingly, Major criteria are redefined as follows: compliance with natural environment and climate will coordinate a city with bioregion and as a result emphasize on its specifications. Improving urban green space per capita will lead to widespread use of native plants and spreads of habitat for divert species. Preventing urban sprawl would conserve natural heritage and would highlight ecological landscape of the city. Mixed use reduces inner-city travel and strengthens the presence of pedestrians with their particular culture and behavior. Not being car-oriented, it helps the city to preserve its geographical and natural platform. The type of renewable energy will differ based on its climatic features. Promoting the sense of belonging of citizens' point of view in Ecocity is achieved through indigenous traditions and customs and the city's culture, history and symbols as well as its architecture and urban design. Therefore, it varies from one city to another. Consequently, this paper defined criteria for Ecocity morphology which are applicable to ecological context of cities. Thus, the research hypothesis is proved. According to the existing economic oriented approach through urban issues, Ecocity implementation needs changing attitude through common economic foundation, and promoting collective consciousness amongst climatic hazards and responsibility for the next generation.","[Barforoush, Seyedeh Shafagh Sharifian] Islamic Azad Univ, Sci & Res Branch, Dept Art & Architecture, Urbanism, Tehran, Iran; [Shemirani, Seyed Majid Mofidi] IUST, Architecture & Urban Planning Fac, Tehran, Iran",Islamic Azad University; Iran University Science & Technology,"Barforoush, SSS (corresponding author), Islamic Azad Univ, Sci & Res Branch, Dept Art & Architecture, Urbanism, Tehran, Iran.",Sh.Sharifian@gmail.com; s_m_mofidi@iust.ac.ir,"shemirani, majid mofidi/S-6243-2018",,,,,,13,3,3,1,7,NAZAR RESEARCH CENTER ART ARCHITECTURE & URBANISM,TEHRAN,"NO 3, DR QARIB ST AZADI AVE, TEHRAN, 14198-43311, IRAN",1735-9635,2251-7197,,BAGH E NAZAR,Bagh e Nazar,JAN,2015,31,,,,1,10,,,,,,10,"Humanities, Multidisciplinary",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Arts & Humanities - Other Topics,VH0SB,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000450016000009,View Full Record in Web of Science

It is commonly agreed that using plants or vegetation may reduce indoor direct solar radiation and energy consumption of HVAC system, so as to achieve better energy efficiency effects. By collecting and investigating several residential buildings and relevant data, three appropriate greening shading methods are summarized and analyzed in detail in the paper: 1) Environment greening shading, which means to plan vegetation location in building environment and peripheral site by calculation, simulation and measurement in order to reduce direct solar radiation absorbed by the ground; 2) Vertical greening shading, which means shading with plants such as liana growing on building or structure envelope surface. This shading device can not only prevent solar radiation, but also absorb heat by transpiration, increase e environmental humidity suitably, and reduce building envelopes' temperature change range, all of which may improve indoor thermal comfort. It is the primary greening shading method in hot summer and cold winter zone. 3) Roofing greening shading, which is adopted as a new shading model I-or its ability of.-heating absorption, insulation of cultivation matrix. It is useful to moderate hot-island effect and meliorate building thermal condition.

Indeed, the coupling algorithms generally implemented in those models do not allow for a correct phasing between the ocean and the atmosphere and hence between their diurnal cycles. A possibility to remove these temporal inconsistencies is to use an iterative coupling algorithm based on the Schwarz iterative method. Despite its large computational cost compared to standard coupling methods, which makes the algorithm implementation impractical for production runs, the Schwarz method is useful to evaluate some of the errors made in state-of-the-art ocean-atmosphere coupled models (e.g., in the representation of the processes related to diurnal cycle), as illustrated by the present study. IPSL-CM6-SW-VLR is a low-resolution version of the IPSL-CM6 coupled model with a simplified land surface model, implementing a Schwarz iterative coupling scheme. Comparisons between coupled solutions obtained with this new scheme and the standard IPSL coupling scheme (referred to as the parallel algorithm) show large differences after sunrise and before sunset, when the external forcing (insolation at the top of the atmosphere) has the fastest pace of change. At these times of the day, the difference between the two numerical solutions is often larger than 100% of the solution, even with a small coupling period, thus suggesting that significant errors are potentially made with current coupling methods. Most of those differences can be strongly reduced by making only two iterations of the Schwarz method, which leads to a doubling of the computing cost. Besides the parallel algorithm used in IPSL-CM6, we also test a so-called sequential atmosphere-first algorithm, which is used in some coupled ocean-atmosphere models.

Following an introduction of the concert of environmental security, connections are made between the global economy and localized processes that render women and children in some societies especially insecure or vulnerable. Linkages within the global economy, such as uneven benefits derived from resource exploitation, can shape environmental security or insecurity especially at sub-state levels. A feminist perspective encourages us to question agency and to examine who benefits from and who pays for resource use. As a way of bringing these ideas into the classroom, the article concludes with discussion suggestions based on a short video entitled Zoned for Slavery (Crowing Rooster Arts 1995).

Furthermore, the simultaneous occurrence of extreme discharges from rivers and storm surges could exacerbate flood risk, compared to when they occur separately. Hence, it is of great importance to assess the compound risks of fluvial and coastal floods at a large scale, including megadeltas. However, most studies on compound fluvial and coastal flooding have been limited to relatively small scales, and global-scale or large-scale studies have not yet addressed both of them. The objectives of this study are twofold: to develop a global coupled river-coast flood model; and to conduct a simulation of compound fluvial flooding and storm surges in Asian mega-delta regions. A state-of-the-art global river routing model was modified to represent the influence of dynamic sea surface levels on river discharges and water levels. We conducted the experiments by coupling a river model with a global tide and surge reanalysis data set. Results show that water levels in deltas and estuaries are greatly affected by the interaction between river discharge, ocean tides and storm surges. The effects of storm surges on fluvial flooding are further examined from a regional perspective, focusing on the case of Cyclone Sidr in the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna Delta in 2007. Modeled results demonstrate that a > 3 m storm surge propagated more than 200 km inland along rivers. We show that the performance of global river routing models can be improved by including sea level dynamics.","[Ikeuchi, Hiroaki] Univ Tokyo, Dept Civil Engn, Tokyo, Japan; [Ikeuchi, Hiroaki; Hirabayashi, Yukiko; Yamazaki, Dai] Univ Tokyo, Inst Ind Sci, Tokyo, Japan; [Ikeuchi, Hiroaki; Muis, Sanne; Ward, Philip J.; Winsemius, Hessel C.] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies IVM, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Yamazaki, Dai] Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, Dept Integrated Climate Change Project Res, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan; [Winsemius, Hessel C.; Verlaan, Martin] Deltares, Delft, Netherlands; [Verlaan, Martin] Delft Univ Technol, Dept Appl Math, Delft, Netherlands; [Kanae, Shinjiro] Tokyo Inst Technol, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Tokyo, Japan",University of Tokyo; University of Tokyo; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science & Technology (JAMSTEC); Deltares; Delft University of Technology; Tokyo Institute of Technology,"Ikeuchi, H (corresponding author), Univ Tokyo, Dept Civil Engn, Tokyo, Japan.;Ikeuchi, H (corresponding author), Univ Tokyo, Inst Ind Sci, Tokyo, Japan.;Ikeuchi, H (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies IVM, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",ikeuchi@rainbow.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Muis, Sanne/AFU-1082-2022; Ikeuchi, Hiroaki/P-9002-2016; Ward, Philip/E-6208-2010; Verlaan, Martin/K-5913-2012; Hirabayashi, Yukiko/E-5628-2010; Kanae, Shinjiro/E-5606-2010; Yamazaki, Dai/J-3029-2012","Muis, Sanne/0000-0002-8145-0171; Ikeuchi, Hiroaki/0000-0002-4824-0594; Verlaan, Martin/0000-0001-7181-3955; Hirabayashi, Yukiko/0000-0001-5693-197X; Kanae, Shinjiro/0000-0002-3176-4957; Yamazaki, Dai/0000-0002-6478-1841; Ward, Philip/0000-0001-7702-7859; Winsemius, H.C./0000-0001-5471-172X","Funding Program for the Global Environmental Research Fund [S-10, S-14]; Ministry of the Environment, Japan; Program for Risk Information on Climate Change; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology (MEXT), Japan; JSPS KAKENHI [16J07523, 16H06291]; Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research through VIDI grant [016.161.324]","Funding Program for the Global Environmental Research Fund; Ministry of the Environment, Japan(Ministry of the Environment, Japan); Program for Risk Information on Climate Change; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology (MEXT), Japan(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research through VIDI grant","This paper was financially supported by the Funding Program for the Global Environmental Research Fund (S-10 and S-14) by the Ministry of the Environment, Japan; the Program for Risk Information on Climate Change by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology (MEXT), Japan; JSPS KAKENHI grants 16J07523, 16H06291.

While several hypotheses have been put forth to explain decadal shifts in sardine and anchovy populations, a mechanistic basis for how the physics, biogeochemistry, and biology combine to produce patterns of synchronous variability across widely separated systems has remained elusive. The present study uses a 50-year (1959-2008) simulation of a fully coupled end-to-end ecosystem model configured for sardine and anchovy in the California Current System to investigate how environmental processes control their population dynamics. The results illustrate that slightly different temperature and diet preferences can lead to significantly different responses to environmental variability. Simulated adult population fluctuations are associated with age-1 growth (via age-2 egg production) and prey availability for anchovy, while they depend primarily on age-0 survival and temperature for sardine. The analysis also hints at potential linkages to known modes of climate variability, whereby changes in adult abundance are related to ENSO for anchovy and to the PDO for sardine. The connection to the PDO and ENSO is consistent with modes of interannual and decadal variability that would alternatively favor anchovy during years of cooler temperatures and higher prey availability, and sardine during years of warmer temperatures and lower prey availability. While the end-to-end ecosystem model provides valuable insight on potential relationships between environmental conditions and sardine and anchovy population dynamics, understanding the complex interplay, and potential lags, between the full array of processes controlling their abundances in the California Current System remains an on-going challenge.

Using a state-of-the-art photochemical mechanism within a global model, we calculate annual average stratospheric injection of total bromine due to VSL sources to be 5 pptv (parts per trillion by volume), with similar to 3 pptv entering the stratosphere as PG(VSL) and similar to 2 pptv as SG(VSL). The geographic distribution and partitioning of VSL bromine within the TTL, and its consequent stratospheric injection, is highly dependent on the oceanic flux, the strength of convection and the occurrence of heterogeneous recycling reactions. Our calculations indicate atomic Br should be the dominant inorganic species in large regions of the TTL during daytime, due to the low ozone and cold conditions of this region. We propose the existence of a tropical ring of atomic bromine located approximately between 15 and 19 km and between 30 degrees N and 30 degrees S. Daytime Br / BrO ratios of up to similar to 4 are predicted within this inhomogeneous ring in regions of highly convective transport, such as the tropical Western Pacific. Therefore, we suggest that experimental programs designed to quantify the bromine budget of the TTL and the stratospheric injection of VSL biogenic bromocarbons should include a strategy for the measurement of atomic Br during daytime as well as HOBr and BrCl during nighttime.","[Fernandez, R.

For that reason, teachers and parents have the responsibility to promote an active and healthy lifestyle in children and adolescents. Even though every school subject should promote healthy activities, Physical Education (PE) is the most important subject to foster well-being habits associated to healthy lifestyle during sport practice and other kinds of active tasks. Indeed, there are many factors that influence the acquisition of healthy habits that should be taken into account when programs and activities are implemented in both educational and extracurricular context. In this sense, psychological and social factors are of utmost importance to achieve optimal experiences for an active and healthy lifestyle. However, due to the myriad of studies analyzing different factors in different contexts, there could be confusion when programs and pedagogical strategies are applied in educational or extracurricular contexts. The objective of this investigation is to analyse the state of art of the psychosocial factors which influence the engagement in physical activities and sport practice. The keywords used in this review were mainly: Self-Determination Theory, (intrinsic) motivation, Psychological need satisfaction, physical activity and sport engagement, Elementary Education, Secondary Education, Physical Education. In addition, the Boolean data type and, or, and not were also used. The articles were selected according to the following criteria: (a) peer-reviewed original research published in international journals indexed in JCR or SJR, (b) published in English or Spanish, (c) about psychosocial factors which influence the physical activity and sport engagement, (d) in educational or extracurricular context. Research articles selected were found through Web of Science, Scopus, Google Scholar, SportDiscus (EBSCO-host), ERIC, PubMed, Medline, and PsycInfo databases. It was observed that physical activities and sport practice engagement are closely related to psychological factors. In particularly, intrinsic motivation was able to determine the active participation in any activity, including physical activity and sport practice during the implementation of Small-Sided Games and other kinds of pedagogical strategies (e.g., Pedagogical Models). Motivation was also closely related to flow state. Finally, these variables should be considered in order to organize effective programs to promote an active and healthy lifestyle in Physical Education classes.","[Jacob Sierra-Diaz, Manuel; Gonzalez-Villora, Sixto] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Fac Educ Cuenca, Didact Mus Plast & Phys Educ Dept, EDAF Grp, Cuenca, Spain; [Carlos Pastor-Vicedo, Juan] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Fac Educ Albacete, Didact Mus Plast & Phys Educ Dept, EDAF Grp, Albacete, Spain; [Felipe Lopez-Sanchez, Guillermo] Univ Murcia, Fac Sport Sci, Murcia, Spain",Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha; Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha; University of Murcia,"Gonzalez-Villora, S (corresponding author), Univ Castilla La Mancha, Fac Educ Cuenca, Didact Mus Plast & Phys Educ Dept, EDAF Grp, Cuenca, Spain.",sixto.gonzalez@uclm.es,"Díaz, Manuel Jacob Sierra/AAX-6421-2020; Vicedo, Juan Carlos Pastor/E-2883-2010; Sánchez, Guillermo Felipe López/K-8703-2015; González-Víllora, S./E-4384-2010","Díaz, Manuel Jacob Sierra/0000-0002-1098-4870; Vicedo, Juan Carlos Pastor/0000-0001-5771-6542; Sánchez, Guillermo Felipe López/0000-0002-9897-5273; González-Víllora, S./0000-0003-2473-5223",Excelentisima Diputacion Provincial de Albacete (Excellent Provincial Council of Albacete) [2019-PROYE-27346],Excelentisima Diputacion Provincial de Albacete (Excellent Provincial Council of Albacete),This secondary study has been partially funded by Excelentisima Diputacion Provincial de Albacete (Excellent Provincial Council of Albacete) with the identification 2019-PROYE-27346.,,155,29,29,13,52,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-1078,,,FRONT PSYCHOL,Front.

We recently have shown that VOD is related to plant productivity, i.e., gross primary production (GPP). Based on this relationship between VOD and GPP, we developed a theory-based machine learning model to estimate global patterns of GPP from passive microwave VOD retrievals. The VOD-GPP model generally showed good agreement with site observations and other global data sets in temporal dynamic but tended to overestimate annual GPP across all latitudes. We hypothesized that the reason for the overestimation is the missing effect of temperature on autotrophic respiration in the theorybased machine learning model. Here we aim to further assess and enhance the robustness of the VOD-GPP model by including the effect of temperature on autotrophic respiration within the machine learning approach and by assessing the interannual variability of the model results with respect to water availability. We used X-band VOD from the VOD Climate Archive (VODCA) data set for estimating GPP and used global state-of-the-art GPP data sets from FLUXCOM and MODIS to assess residuals of the VOD-GPP model with respect to drought conditions as quantified by the Standardized Precipitation and Evaporation Index (SPEI). Our results reveal an improvement in model performance for correlation when including the temperature dependency of autotrophic respiration (average correlation increase of 0.18). This improvement in temporal dynamic is larger for temperate and cold regions than for the tropics. For unbi-ased root-mean-square error (ubRMSE) and bias, the results are regionally diverse and are compensated in the global average. Improvements are observed in temperate and cold regions, while decreases in performance are obtained mainly in the tropics. The overall improvement when adding temperature was less than expected and thus may only partly explain previously observed differences between the global GPP data sets. On interannual timescales, estimates of the VOD-GPP model agree well with GPP from FLUXCOM and MODIS. We further find that the residuals between VOD-based GPP estimates and the other data sets do not significantly correlate with SPEI, which demonstrates that the VOD-GPP model can capture responses of GPP to water availability even without including additional information on precipitation, soil moisture or evapotranspiration. Exceptions from this rule were found in some regions: significant negative correlations between VOD-GPP residuals and SPEI were observed in the US corn belt, Argentina, eastern Europe, Russia and China, while significant positive correlations were obtained in South America, Africa and Australia. In these regions, the significant correlations may indicate different plant strategies for dealing with variations in water availability. Overall, our findings support the robustness of global microwave-derived estimates of gross primary production for large-scale studies on climate-vegetation interactions.","[Teubner, Irene E.; Wild, Benjamin; Moesinger, Leander; Dorigo, Wouter] TU Wien, Dept Geodesy & Geoinformat, Wiedner Hauptstr 8, A-1040 Vienna, Austria; [Teubner, Irene E.] Zent Anstalt Meteorol & Geodynamik ZAMG, Hohe Warte 38, A-1190 Vienna, Austria; [Forkel, Matthias] Tech Univ Dresden, Inst Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing, Environm Remote Sensing Grp, Helmholtzstr 10, D-01069 Dresden, Germany",Technische Universitat Wien; Technische Universitat Dresden,"Teubner, IE (corresponding author), TU Wien, Dept Geodesy & Geoinformat, Wiedner Hauptstr 8, A-1040 Vienna, Austria.;Teubner, IE (corresponding author), Zent Anstalt Meteorol & Geodynamik ZAMG, Hohe Warte 38, A-1190 Vienna, Austria.",irene.teubner@zamg.ac.at,"Forkel, Matthias/O-5592-2019; Dorigo, Wouter/C-7794-2014","Forkel, Matthias/0000-0003-0363-9697; Teubner, Irene E./0000-0001-7916-5593; Dorigo, Wouter/0000-0001-8054-7572; Mosinger, Leander/0000-0002-6813-5812",TU Wien Wissenschaftspreis,TU Wien Wissenschaftspreis,This research has been supported by the TU Wien Wissenschaftspreis 2015 (TU Wien Wissenschaftspreis 2015).,,81,5,5,7,17,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1726-4170,1726-4189,,BIOGEOSCIENCES,Biogeosciences,4-Jun,2021,11,,,,3285,3308,,10.5194/bg-18-3285-2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-3285-2021,,,24,"Ecology; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology,SR5NF,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,12/21/22,WOS:000661088300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Taxonomic treatment is required to establish and justify recommendations in conservation biology for the group being considered. Imperfect and controversial taxonomy can undermine conservation assessment. We studied 71 populations; 665 individuals corresponding to the morphology of the Rosa sericea complex (including six taxa, one of which has extremely narrow distributions) were collected from sympatric, parapatric, and allopatric populations distributed in China. This study aims to investigate whether the complex species are macromorphologically different species and evaluate the rare taxa of the complex for conservation priority. The morphological characters and principal component analysis (PCA) of the R. sericea complex showed that the complex species have overlapping characters but can distinguish morphologically. The species of R. sericea complex systematics status based on previous DNA sequencing is controversial. The ecological habitat's current morphological characters only delimit the R. morrisonensis (in Taiwan). To evade mistakes in species conservation, we recommend that taxonomical knowledge be needed to ensure success in protecting target species. Thus, the complementarity of systemic and conservation assurance makes conservation actions more necessary for the complex's rare taxa. The ecological niche modelling (ENM) results showed that habitats of these conspecific taxa would be shrunken. With the presence of snapshots in time, the geography of taxa might decrease rapidly in representative entirely of the Geographic space (G-space) and Environmental space (E-space) that such taxa are bright to inhabit. So far, the significant inferences meant for the niche occupy the most incredible comparative research, taking the impermanent nature of taxa distributions and undertaking that such species are at a state of stability. If the artificially identified species (rarely distributed) are based on morphological identification, they must be conserved.","[Ullah, Fazal; Gao, Yundong; Jiao, Rui-Fang; Gao, Xin-Fen] Chinese Acad Sci, Chengdu Inst Biol, CAS Key Lab Mt Ecol Restorat & Bioresource Utiliz, Biodivers Conservat Key Lab Sichuan Prov, Chengdu 610041, Peoples R China; [Ullah, Fazal; Saqib, Saddam] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Sari, Idris] Erzincan Binali Yildirim Univ, Fac Sci & Art, Dept Biol, TR-24100 Erzincan, Turkey; [Jiao, Rui-Fang] Sichuan Univ, Coll Life Sci, Key Lab Bioresources & Ecoenvironm, Minist Educ, Chengdu 610064, Peoples R China; [Saqib, Saddam] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Systemat & Evolutionary Bot, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chengdu Institute of Biology, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Erzincan Binali Yildirim University; Sichuan University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Botany, CAS","Gao, YD; Gao, XF (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Chengdu Inst Biol, CAS Key Lab Mt Ecol Restorat & Bioresource Utiliz, Biodivers Conservat Key Lab Sichuan Prov, Chengdu 610041, Peoples R China.",fazalbotanist@gmail.com; gaoyd@cib.ac.cn; botanical24@gmail.com; 2019322040062@stu.scu.edu.cn; saddamsaqib.qau@gmail.com; xfgao@cib.ac.cn,"SARI, İdris/AAY-4955-2020","SARI, İdris/0000-0003-2475-8759; Ullah, Fazal/0000-0002-0387-6409; gao, xin fen/0000-0002-5703-1639",Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research (STEP) program [2019QZKK0502]; National Natural Sciences Foundation of China [31670192]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [32171605]; Chinese Government Scholarship Program (CSC) [2018GXZ017484],Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research (STEP) program; National Natural Sciences Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Chinese Government Scholarship Program (CSC),"This research was supported by the Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research (STEP) program (2019QZKK0502) and the National Natural Sciences Foundation of China (Project No. 31670192), and National Natural Science Foundation of China 32171605.

Plants are an important source of biologically active compounds with therapeutic properties. These active compounds are commonly called as phytoconstituents or phytochemicals and are of significant importance in the efficacy of medicinal plants. These are mainly produced in those plants which are under stressful conditions. The amount of phytochemicals varies from plant to plant, and their concentration depends on location, local climate, and types of soil. Medicinal plants are normally collected from their natural and wild habitat, but now due to their growing market demand by the pharmaceutical industries, they are also cultivated. However, the cultivated plants may have lower efficacy due to the presence of lower amounts of active ingredients.

In information science, critical librarianship seeks to disrupt normative approaches to library work by confronting these ideologies and systems, empowering both library workers and users to understand how these structures affect access and dissemination of information. In industrial design, critical design challenges the status quo by posing troublesome design problems that encourage reflection and discourse. Design works that fall under this category are reactions against consumerism, systemic biases, and heedless scientific and technological development. In librarianship, critical design may be employed to help us explore current paradigms and approaches to library spaces, services, and technologies, as well as to uncover assumptions about what a library is and what a librarian does. Prototypes and narratives derived from critical design can make visible the normative constructions and problems heartedly debated in librarianship.","[Robinson, Shannon Marie] Drexel Univ, Media Arts & Design, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Robinson, Shannon Marie] Tyler Sch Art, Philadelphia, PA USA; [Robinson, Shannon Marie] Univ Arts, Philadelphia, PA USA; [Robinson, Shannon Marie] Denison Univ, Granville, OH 43023 USA",Drexel University; Denison University,"Robinson, SM (corresponding author), Drexel Univ, Media Arts & Design, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",librarianshannon@gmail.com,,"Robinson, Shannon Marie/0000-0001-5579-8679",,,,,40,1,1,2,8,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0024-2519,1549-652X,,LIBR QUART,Libr.

Our instrument can provide detailed and worldwide knowledge of aerosol amount, type and properties. This is important for climate and ecosystem science and human health [1, 2]. Therefore, NASA, ESA and the European Commission study the application of aerosol instruments for planned or future missions. We distinguish molecular Rayleigh scattering from aerosol Mie-type scattering by analyzing multi-angle observations of radiance and the polarization state of sun light that is scattered in the Earth atmosphere [3]. We measure across the visible wavelength spectrum and in five distinct viewing angles between -50 degrees and +50 degrees. Such analysis has been traditionally done by rotating polarizers and band-filters in front of an Earth observing wide-angle imager. In contrast, we adopt a means to map the linear polarization state on the spectrum using passive optical components [4]. Thereby we can characterize the full linear polarization state for a scene instantaneously. This improves the polarimetric accuracy, which is critical for aerosol characterization, enabling us to distinguish for example anthropogenic from natural aerosol types. Moreover, the absence of moving parts simplifies the instrument, and makes it more robust and reliable. We have demonstrated this method in an airborne instrument called SPEX airborne [5, 6] in the recent ACEPOL campaign together with a suite of state-of-the art and innovative active and passive aerosol sensors on the NASA ER-2 high-altitude research platform [7]. An earlier report on the SPEX development roadmap was given in [8]. In this contribution we introduce SPEXone, a compact space instrument that has a new telescope that projects the five viewing angles onto a single polarization modulation unit and the subsequent reflective spectrometer. The novel telescope allows the observation of five scenes with one spectrometer, hence the name. We describe the optical layout of the telescope, polarization modulation optics, and spectrometer and discuss the manufacturability and tolerances involved. We will also discuss the modelled instrument performance and show preliminary results from optical breadboards of the telescope and polarization modulation optics. With SPEXone we present a strong and new tool for climate research and air quality monitoring. It can be used to study the effect of atmospheric aerosol on the heating/cooling of the Earth and on air quality. Also, SPEXone can improve the accuracy of satellite measurements of greenhouse gas concentrations and ocean color that rely on molecular absorption of reflected sunlight by providing detailed knowledge of the aerosol properties, required to accurately trace the light path in presence of scattering.

The paper examines whether the presence of wild animals in the Early Holocene 'green' Sahara could have represented a 'disease challenge' to the spread of domestic livestock, as proposed for sub-Saharan Africa. Analysis of the zooarchaeological record and Saharan rock art highlights this potential threat also in North Africa, where it has hitherto been disregarded. Old and new data from the study area in SW Libya, with a focus on Takarkori rock shelter, highlight the presence of herding activity at a very early stage. Direct dating on bones of sheep/goat and cattle secures this chronology, providing evidence of a rapid ingression of small groups of herders who crossed Africa's north-eastern quadrant around similar to 8300 years cal BP. This rapidity defies the 'disease challenge' hypothesis and suggests alternative scenarios. In the central Sahara, the cultural complexity of local Early Holocene hunter-gatherers and their delayed return system of resource exploitation could have facilitated the incorporation of new practices, including the herding of small numbers of domestic animals. The societal implications of the transition from hunting and gathering to herding are archaeologically better visible in the funerary record and in rock art. By contrast, both material culture and the subsistence basis seem to demonstrate continuity with the former foraging groups' phase. Taken together, the Saharan evidence suggests a punctuated process of acculturation for the inception of food production in North Africa.","[di Lernia, Savino] Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Ancient World Studies, Piazzale Aldo Moro 5, I-00185 Rome, Italy; [di Lernia, Savino] Univ Witwatersrand, GAES, Johannesburg, South Africa",Sapienza University Rome; University of Witwatersrand,"di Lernia, S (corresponding author), Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Ancient World Studies, Piazzale Aldo Moro 5, I-00185 Rome, Italy.",Savino.dilernia@uniroma1.it,,,,,,,226,0,0,0,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0892-7537,1573-7802,,J WORLD PREHIST,J.

During seed germination, there is a spatial-temporal imbibition pattern that correlates with described physiological processes. However, only the moment of testa rupture has been described as a critical, discrete stage. Could a specific relative water content (RWC) value reflect a physiological stage useful for comparisons between seed batches? We tracked seed-by-seed imbibition during germination to homogenize sampling and selected a transcriptomic approach to analyse the physiological transitions that occur in seed batches collected in different years and with contrasting phenotypic responses to a priming treatment. The seed RWC reflected the transcriptional transitions that occur during germination, regardless of imbibition time or collection year, and revealed a set of biological processes that occur in the dry seed and during early germination are associated with the phenotypic response to priming. As climate shifts, so do the timing of developmental events important for determining organismal fitness, and poses another challenge to the comprehension of molecular and physiological processes driving the interaction between organisms and environment. In this study, we demonstrate that the use of physiological traits, specific to a particular developmental stage, is a reliable time-independent approach.","[Gomez-Maqueo, Ximena; Alvarado-Lopez, Sandra; del Mar Garciadiego, Maria; Gamboa-deBuen, Alicia] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ecol, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Soriano, Diana] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Biol, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Velazquez-Rosas, Noe] Univ Veracruzana, Ctr Invest Trop, Xalapa, Veracruz, Mexico; [Jimenez-Duran, Karina] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Fac Quim, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; Universidad Veracruzana; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico,"Gomez-Maqueo, X; Gamboa-deBuen, A (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ecol, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.",ximenagmb@ciencias.unam.mx; agamboa@ecologia.unam.mx,"Gomez Maqueo Bribiesca, Ximena/GQH-4693-2022","Gamboa de Buen, Alicia/0000-0002-6013-5949; Soriano Fernandez, Diana/0000-0003-4336-2725; Gomez Maqueo, Ximena/0000-0001-9582-6558",Programa de Apoyo a Proyectos de Investigacion e Inovacion Tecnologica (PAPIIT UNAM) [IN203218]; Direccion General del Sector Primario y Recursos Naturales Renovables within Secretaria de Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales (SEMARNAT) [OE001]; Comision Nacional para la Biodiversidad (CONABIO); Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT) [280483]; Direccion General de Asuntos del Personal Academico (DGAPA UNAM) [IN203218],Programa de Apoyo a Proyectos de Investigacion e Inovacion Tecnologica (PAPIIT UNAM)(Programa de Apoyo a Proyectos de Investigacion e Innovacion Tecnologica (PAPIIT)Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico); Direccion General del Sector Primario y Recursos Naturales Renovables within Secretaria de Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales (SEMARNAT); Comision Nacional para la Biodiversidad (CONABIO); Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)); Direccion General de Asuntos del Personal Academico (DGAPA UNAM)(Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico),"This work was supported by Programa de Apoyo a Proyectos de Investigacion e Inovacion Tecnologica (PAPIIT UNAM) [grant IN203218 to AGB], and by the Project OE001 Ceiba aesculifolia como especie modelo para el estudio molecular del envejecimiento de las semillas en relacion al desempeno germinativo financed by the Direccion General del Sector Primario y Recursos Naturales Renovables within Secretaria de Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales (SEMARNAT) and by the Comision Nacional para la Biodiversidad (CONABIO).

VAR-L is a linear regression model using global SSTA data from L prior months as predictors. In hindcasts for the recent 30 years, the multilevel VAR-L outperforms a state-of-the-art dynamic forecast model, as well as the commonly used linear inverse model (LIM). The multilevel VAR-L model shows skill in 6-12 month forecasts, with its greatest skill in the months of the active hurricane season. The optimized model for the best long-range skill score in the MDR, chosen by a cross-validation procedure, has 12 time levels and 12 empirical orthogonal function modes. We investigate the optimal initial conditions for MDR SSTA prediction using a generalized singular vector decomposition of the propagation matrix. We find that the added temporal degrees of freedom for the predictands in VAR12 as compared with a LIM model, which allow the model to capture both the local wind-evaporation-SST feedback in the Tropical Atlantic and the impact on the Atlantic of an improved medium-range ENSO forecast, elevate the long-range forecast skill in the MDR.","[Lee, Dong Eun; Chapman, David; Henderson, Naomi; Chen, Chen; Cane, Mark A.] Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY 10964 USA",Columbia University,"Lee, DE (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY 10964 USA.",dlee@ldeo.columbia.edu,,"Chen, Chen/0000-0002-5884-1211; Lee, dong eun/0000-0001-8546-563X; Henderson, Naomi/0000-0002-9531-2159; Cane, Mark/0000-0001-5408-2388",Office of Naval Research [N00014-12-1-0911],Office of Naval Research(Office of Naval Research),The authors would like to express our deep appreciation to the anonymous reviewer for the constructive comments.

A brief historical excursion into the history of the formation of the British and French concessions is given. This publication examines the stylistic and compositional features of the architecture of such banking institutions as: Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation; The Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China; International banking corporation (City Bank); Bank of Taiwan; Commercial Corporation of Mitsubishi; Yokogama Specie Bank; The E.D.Sassoon & Co.Ltd. (sic) D. Sassoon Sons Co. Ltd; Bank of Indochina; China & France Industry Bank. A composite and stylistic analysis was conducted, an iconographic description of the buildings of the main banks located within the boundaries of the former European concessions on Shamyan Island is given The study reveals the general principles of the development of the architecture of banking institutions in Guangzhou. The materials and results of the research carried out by the authors of this article allowed us to formulate the following conclusions: 1. The territorial isolation of the Shamyan island from the Chinese part of Guangzhou, as well as the operation within the concessions of British and French laws, contributed to the fact that the development of the architectural ensemble of the island as a whole was carried out in line with the advanced West European architectural and urban trends. 2. Most of the banking buildings here are built in the eclectic style with the predominance of neoclassicism features, of course, this fact is connected with the desire of the owners of bank corporations to demonstrate to the clients and competitors the financial strength of their organizations. 3. In the architecture of the considered banking institutions there is an active use of tectonics and elements of the order system, colonnades, arcades, the allocation of the first floor in the form of a rustic plinth. The motifs of Renaissance architecture, Baroque and Art Nouveau are also traced. 4. The formation of the appearance of banking buildings in Shamyan was strongly influenced by local conditions. The hot and humid subtropical climate of the south of China contributed to the spread in the architecture of the structures of this type of order colonnades, forming deep open verandas, as well as the use of X-shaped creaks-elements to ensure the natural ventilation of buildings, which, in addition, became an expressive element of the facade decoration.","[Bazilevich, Mikhail E.; Kim, Anton A.] Pacific Natl Univ, Khabarovsk, Russia",Pacific National University,"Bazilevich, ME (corresponding author), Pacific Natl Univ, Khabarovsk, Russia.",mikhailbazilevich@gmail.com; ant.kim@mail.ru,"Kim, Anton/B-8604-2019","Kim, Anton/0000-0002-3739-5048",,,,,8,0,0,1,2,TOMSK STATE UNIV,TOMSK,"LENIN AVE, 36, TOMSK, 634050, RUSSIA",2222-0836,2311-3685,,VESTN TOMSK GOS U KU,Vestn.

With limited resources, monitoring strategies need to be optimised considering both scientific knowledge and available resources. In doing so, it is crucial to understand how sampling frequency affects the value of the data. We analysed 11 years of weekly heterotrophic protist time-series data from Station L4 in the Western English Channel to explore how different sampling intervals impact data quality. In the L4 dataset, comprising 55 protist taxa, the reduction of sampling frequency from weekly to four times a year at specific seasons decreased the number of taxa encountered by 38% for ciliates and 29% for heterotrophic dinoflagellates while the mean annual biomass or its mean variation were not affected. Furthermore, when samples were taken only four times a year, biomass peaks of the ten most important taxa were often missed. The primary motivator for this study was furthering the development of the heterotrophic protist monitoring in temperate and subarctic marine areas, e.g. the Baltic Sea. Based on our findings, we give recommendations on sampling frequency to optimise the value of heterotrophic protist monitoring.","[Lehtiniemi, Maiju; Hallfors, Heidi; Kuosa, Harri; Lehtinen, Sirpa; Setala, Outi; Suikkanen, Sanna; Tuimala, Jarno] Finnish Environm Inst, Marine Res Ctr, Helsinki 00790, Finland; [Fileman, Elaine; Widdicombe, Claire] Plymouth Marine Lab, Prospect Pl, Plymouth PL1 3DH, Devon, England; [Lips, Inga] Tallinn Univ Technol, Dept Marine Syst, EE-12618 Tallinn, Estonia",Finnish Environment Institute; Plymouth Marine Laboratory; Tallinn University of Technology,"Lehtiniemi, M (corresponding author), Finnish Environm Inst, Marine Res Ctr, Helsinki 00790, Finland.",maiju.lehtiniemi@syke.fi,"Lips, Inga/N-5000-2019","Lips, Inga/0000-0001-6556-6281; Suikkanen, Sanna/0000-0002-0768-8149; Lehtiniemi, Maiju/0000-0003-4782-4958; Fileman, Elaine/0000-0002-7795-7535; Lehtinen, Sirpa/0000-0001-7784-8497",BONUS (Art. 185) by the EU; BONUS (Art. 185) by the Academy of Finland; BONUS (Art. 185) by the Estonian Research Council; UK Natural Environment Research Council [NE/R015953/1],BONUS (Art. 185) by the EU; BONUS (Art. 185) by the Academy of Finland; BONUS (Art. 185) by the Estonian Research Council; UK Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"This work resulted from the BONUS SEAM (Towards streamlined Baltic Sea environmental assessment andmonitoring) project, funded by BONUS (Art. 185), which is jointly funded by the EU, the Academy of Finland and the Estonian Research Council (funding forML, HH, HK, SL, IL, OS, SS).

However, this traditional mixture is sensitive to environmental factors, including climate conditions and microorganisms, because these components encourage microbial growth. This research aimed to add an antibacterial property to the traditional primer and to formulate functional primers with antibacterial behaviour, scrub resistance and washability. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) and silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), which have antibacterial properties, were used in the formulations. The antibacterial properties were tested against four bacterial species: Bacillus subtilis, B. cereus, B. mycoides, and Leclercia adecarboxylata, which had been found on the mural painting surface of the Somanas Rajavaravihara temple in Bangkok, Thailand. The presence of TiO2 and AgNPs in the modern functional primers inhibited the growth of these four bacterial species, while neither the traditional primer with AgNPs nor the one without showed inhibitory activity against all four bacterial species. We also tested the scrub resistance and washability of the modern functional primers compared to the traditional primer.","[Kaew-on, Nawarat; Katemake, Pichayada] Chulalongkorn Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Imaging & Printing Technol, Bangkok 10330, Thailand; [Prasongsuk, Sehanat] Chulalongkorn Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Bot, Plant Biomass Utilizat Res Unit, Bangkok 10330, Thailand",Chulalongkorn University; Chulalongkorn University,"Katemake, P (corresponding author), Chulalongkorn Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Imaging & Printing Technol, Bangkok 10330, Thailand.",pichayada.k@chula.ac.th,"Prasongsuk, Sehanat/AAU-3465-2020",,"Research and Researchers for Industries (RRI); Thailand Research Fund; Ministry of Science and Technology; Kenton Intertrade Co., Ltd, Thailand [PHD57I0074]","Research and Researchers for Industries (RRI); Thailand Research Fund(Thailand Research Fund (TRF)); Ministry of Science and Technology(Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning, Republic of Korea); Kenton Intertrade Co., Ltd, Thailand","The authors gratefully acknowledge the Research and Researchers for Industries (RRI), Thailand Research Fund, the Ministry of Science and Technology and Kenton Intertrade Co., Ltd, Thailand (Grant number PHD57I0074) for financial support.

The new HepaRG-CAR cell line overexpressing constitutive androstane receptor (CAR, NR1I3), a regulator of detoxification and energy metabolism outperforms the parental HepaRG cell line in various liver functions. To further characterize this cell line and assess its stability we compared HepaRG-CAR with HepaRG cells at different passages for their expression profile, ammonia and lactate metabolism, bile acid and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Transcriptomic profiling of HepaRG-CAR vs. HepaRG early-passage revealed downregulation of hypoxia, glycolysis and proliferation and upregulation of oxidative phosphorylation genesets. In addition CAR overexpression downregulated the mTORC1 signaling pathway, which, as mediator of proliferation and metabolic reprogramming, may play an important role in the establishment of the HepaRG-CAR phenotype. The ammonia and lactate metabolism and bile acid production of HepaRG-CAR cells was stable for 10 additional passages compared to HepaRG cells. Interestingly, bile acid production was 4.5-fold higher in HepaRG-CAR vs. HepaRG cells, whereas lactate and ROS production were 2.7- and 2.0-fold lower, respectively. Principal component analysis showed clustering of HepaRG-CAR (early- and late-passage) and HepaRG early-passage and not with HepaRG late-passage indicating that passaging exerted larger effect on the transcriptional profile of HepaRG than HepaRG-CAR cells. In conclusion, overexpression of CAR in HepaRG cells improves their bile acid production, mitochondrial energy metabolism, and stability, with the latter possibly due to reduced ROS production, resulting in an optimized source of human hepatocytes.","[Adam, Aziza A.

This article provides a detailed review of the progress made in the field of seasonal prediction by India starting from the first attempt of seasonal prediction by India Meteorology Department (IMD) in 1886 based on empirical methods to the present day state-of-the-art coupled dynamical modelling framework developed under Monsoon Mission. The success and failures of seasonal prediction were amply documented in several articles particularly with more emphasis on its failures. Starting in the early 1900s, the empirical models performed very well for a few decades after which they started failing. As the relationship with predictors underwent significant changes, empirical models were also updated/revamped on several occasions. Prior to Monsoon Mission (before 2010) attempts were made to use dynamical models for seasonal prediction of Indian monsoon, particularly in the tier-II modelling framework, which was based upon the standalone Atmospheric General Circulation Models (AGCMs), albeit with limited success. The immediate need for coupled modelling framework in India was felt in 2008-09 for making seasonal forecasts, primarily to model the dynamical nature of Indian Monsoon and hence, a coupled dynamical modelling framework at a very high atmospheric horizontal resolution of similar to 38 km was implemented to make operational/experimental seasonal forecasts, so far unparalleled. The dynamical modelling framework will be upgraded in the future to contain an earth system framework with aerosols/greenhouse gases, ocean bio-geo chemistry and closed model hydrology.","[Rao, Suryachandra A.; Pillai, Prasanth A.; Pradhan, Maheshwar; Srivastava, Ankur] Indian Inst Trop Meteorol, Pune 411008, Maharashtra, India",Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) - India; Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM),"Rao, SA (corresponding author), Indian Inst Trop Meteorol, Pune 411008, Maharashtra, India.",surya@tropmet.res.in,"A, RAO SURYACHANDRA/ABE-9913-2020",,Ministry of Earth Sciences,Ministry of Earth Sciences,"Scientists of IMD who worked tirelessly, since 1870s to improve the seasonal forecasting of Indian Summer Monsoon for several decades, knowing very well that it is the second toughest prediction problem, certainly deserve appreciation for their efforts.

In general, it is found to provide improved array spatial resolution and dynamic range. The computational time required for the functional beamforming is approximately the same as that for the conventional frequency domain beamformer and, in general, notably shorter than those of the deconvolution methods. In this paper, several simulations are presented comparing the performance of this algorithm with other imaging methods. Moreover, this beamforming technique is applied to 115 flyover measurements performed with a 32 microphone array on landing aircraft. The simulated and experimental results show good agreement. It is found that, for both synthetic and experimental data, functional beamforming offers better quality acoustic images, with a dynamic range (i.e., the difference in decibels between the main lobe and the highest sidelobe) approximately 30 times larger and an array spatial resolution (i.e., the width of the main lobe 3 dB below its peak) approximately 6 times better than the conventional frequency domain beamformer.

The present work proposes to increase hydrogen separation performance by incorporating deliberately chosen alicyclic segments into Troger's Base (TB)-based polyimide backbones via copolymerization. The resulting TB-based copolyimides showed the best hydrogen separation performance (e.g., H-2/CH4, H-2/N-2 and H-2/CO2) among all state-of-the-art TB-based polyimide materials reported to date. An important contribution of enhancement in solubility selectivity to increase hydrogen separation performance was investigated for the first time in this study. The introduction of alicyclic segments significantly promoted the Langmuir affinity parameters of H-2, thereby improving H-2 solubility over other gas solubilities (CH4, N-2 and CO2). Herein, the unique backbone architecture highlights the possibility of accessing membranes characterized by favorable hydrogen separation performance in adverse/harsh environments, as well as by solution processability, desirable physical properties for large-scale separation applications.","[Zhang, Yu; Zhuang, Yongbing; Feng, Shichao; Wan, Yinhua] Chinese Acad Sci, Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Proc Engn, State Key Lab Biochem Engn, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Lee, Won Hee; Seong, Jong Geun; Bae, Joon Yong; Lee, Young Moo] Hanyang Univ, Dept Energy Engn, Coll Engn, Seoul 04763, South Korea; [Seong, Jong Geun] Los Alamos Natl Lab, T004, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA","Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Institute of Process Engineering, CAS; Hanyang University; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Los Alamos National Laboratory","Zhuang, YB; Wan, YH (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Proc Engn, State Key Lab Biochem Engn, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China.;Lee, YM (corresponding author), Hanyang Univ, Dept Energy Engn, Coll Engn, Seoul 04763, South Korea.",ybzhuang@ipe.ac.cn; yhwan@ipe.ac.cn; ymlee@hanyang.ac.kr,"Seong, Jong Geun/AAK-4775-2021; Lee, Young Moo/G-5920-2015","Lee, Young Moo/0000-0002-5047-3143; Lee, Won Hee/0000-0002-9151-8475; Zhuang, Yongbing/0000-0003-4577-8142; SEONG, Jong Geun/0000-0001-9189-6073","Foundation for Hundred Talent Program [Y824011107]; State Key Laboratory of Biochemical Engineering, Institute of Process Engineering (IPE), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) [Y825031107]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [21978301]; Technology Development Program to Solve Climate Changes through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Science and ICT [NRF-2018M1A2A2061979]","Foundation for Hundred Talent Program; State Key Laboratory of Biochemical Engineering, Institute of Process Engineering (IPE), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Technology Development Program to Solve Climate Changes through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Science and ICT","The authors greatly thank Professor Kueir-Rarn Lee at Chung Yuan Christian University and Professor Wei-Sung Hong at National Taiwan University of Science and Technology in Taiwan for PALS measurements and data analyses.

An explication of its thrust, viz. the significance of sowing/sewing 'a quilt of harmony' (Wild 2012: 20), in relation to the broad yet symbiotic theme of cosmic ecology follows. The discussion proceeds by presenting a close critical analysis of Ben Okri's 'Lines in Potentis', a poem commissioned by the then Lord Mayor of London in 2002 in commemoration of the bombing of the City of London and which is featured in Okri's most recent anthology of poetry, Wild (2012: 26-27). Both my thrust and my argument are predicated on another occasional poem from Wild, 'A Wedding Prayer' (2012: 20-22), which is not analysed in any detail. Axiomatic to the interpretation is the poet's own conception of 'wild', cited on the dust cover of the anthology, as 'an alternative to the familiar, where energy meets freedom, where art meets the elemental, where chaos can be honed'. More precisely, for this London loving Nigerian poet, 'the wild is our link with the stars ...'. This is not aesthetic posturing. As I attempt to show in my reading of the focal poem, it has to do with mystical unrest viewed from an eco-phenomenological 'enjoyment of literature, of beauty, of the sublime, the elevated, as well as our compassion for the miseries of humankind, [and] generosity towards others ... inspired by the subliminal passions of the human soul' (Tymieniecka 1996). As the conclusion attempts to show, this projects some of the epistemology of Africans in Africa and the Diaspora. It does this by invoking the contentions of fellow African phenomenologist, Achile Mbembe, in comparison with Tymieniecka's argument that the soul is the 'soil' of life's forces and that it is thus the transmitter of life's constructive progress. Such progress is from the primeval logos of life to its annihilation in the anti-logos of man's 'transnatural telos' (Tymieniecka 1988: 3).","[Gray, Rosemary] Univ South Africa, Inst African Renaissance Studies, Pretoria, South Africa; [Gray, Rosemary] Univ Pretoria, Dept English, Pretoria, South Africa",University of South Africa; University of Pretoria,"Gray, R (corresponding author), Univ South Africa, Inst African Renaissance Studies, Pretoria, South Africa.",prof.r.gray@gmail.com,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1818-6874,1753-7274,,INT J AFR RENAISS ST,Int.

When the confidence is low, we avoid updating the object's position through the feature map; instead, the tracker passes to a single-frame failure mode, during which the patch's low-level visual content is used to swiftly update the object's position, before recovering from the target loss in the next frame.

Three different approaches to baseline quantification can be distinguished: (a) exploiting bottom-up model characteristics to endogenize responses of technological investment and utilization, (b) relying on external information sources to feed the exogenous parameters and variables of the model, and (c) linking the model with more technology-rich, partial models to obtain bottom-up- and pathway-consistent parameters.","[Faehn, Taran] Stat Norway, Postboks 2633 St Hanshaugen, NO-0131 Oslo, Norway; [Bachner, Gabriel; Steininger, Karl] Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Wegener Ctr Climate & Global Change, Brandhofgasse 5, A-8010 Graz, Austria; [Beach, Robert] RTI Int, 3040 Cornwallis Rd, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA; [Chateau, Jean; Lanzi, Elisa] Org Econ Cooperat & Dev OECD, Environm Directorate, 2 Rue Andre Pascal, Paris, France; [Fujimori, Shinichiro] Kyoto Univ, Nishikyo Ku, 361,C1-3,Katsura Campus, Kyoto 6158540, Japan; [Fujimori, Shinichiro] Natl Inst Environm Studies NIES, 16-2 Onogawa, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058506, Japan; [Ghosh, Madanmohan] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Model Dev & Quantitat Res, 200 Sacre Coeur Blvd, Gatineau, PQ J8X 4C6, Canada; [Ghosh, Madanmohan] CIRED SMASH Ctr Int Rech Environm & Dev, 45 Bis Ave Belle Gabrielle, Nogent Sur Marne, France; [Paltsev, Sergey] MIT, 77 Massachusetts Ave,E19-411, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Vandyck, Toon] European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Calle Inca Garcilaso 3, Seville 41092, Spain; [Cunha, Bruno; Garaffa, Rafael] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Energy Planning Program, CT Sala C-211, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Steininger, Karl] Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Dept Econ, Brandhofgasse 5, A-8010 Graz, Austria",Statistics Norway; University of Graz; Research Triangle Institute; Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD); Kyoto University; National Institute for Environmental Studies - Japan; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro; University of Graz,"Faehn, T (corresponding author), Stat Norway, Postboks 2633 St Hanshaugen, NO-0131 Oslo, Norway.",tfn@ssb.no; gabriel.bachner@uni-graz.at; rbeach@rti.org; jean.chateau@oecd.org; sfujimori@athehost.env.kyoto-u.ac.jp; Madanmohan.ghosh@canada.ca; hcmeriem@centre-cired.fr; elisa.lanzi@oecd.org; paltsev@mit.edu; toon.vandyck@ec.europa.eu; slcunha.bruno@ppe.ufrj.br; rgaraffa@ppe.ufrj.br; karl.steininger@uni-graz.at,"Fujimori, Shinichiro/A-1288-2015; Cunha, Bruno S.

Study focus: We propose a novel pseudo-reservoir concept (hereinafter PSRC) in the framework of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), to mimick and model the behavior of an alluvial floodplain. Outflows from PSRC are predicated on a conceptual storage-outflow-stage relationship, and decomposed into overflow and baseflow by considering floodplain hydrogeomorphic attributes and their dynamics in relation to critical bankful height. The model was tested for its skill to improve simulation of discharge. It`s performance was evaluated against SWAT targeted release reservoir and a configuration without a reservoir. New hydrological insights: We demonstrated that PSRC via its parameters was dynamically and significantly (p-value < 0.05) sensitive to discharge. It improved SWAT discharge predictions by four to over 100 percent compared to two model control set-ups. Results were influenced by sensitivities of parameters to flow regime and objective functions. The SWAT configured with PSRC (SWAT(psrc)) was the only model which accounted for uncertainties in the ninety-five percent prediction uncertainty band (95PPU) very well. We found that SWAT(psrc) simulated average values (i.e 95PPU) replicated discharge measured using state of the art acoustic doppler current profiler (ADCP) with a high degree of accuracy (Nash-Sutcliffe 0.86; R-2 0.96; PBIAS 10.7). All in all, results indicated that PSRC is a robust model. SWAT(psrc) together with its uncertainty bands has potential for improving understanding of water resources dynamics in typical environments as the present study area. The model can also potentially be useful for applied studies such as restoration designs and impact assessment of modified floodplains.","[Phiri, W. K.; Banda, K.; Nyambe, I.

Green facades can allow the physical shading of the building and promote evapotranspiration in summer, and increase the thermal insulation in winter. An experimental test was carried out at the University of Bari (Italy) for two years. Three vertical walls, made with perforated bricks, were tested: two were covered with evergreen plants (Pandorea jasminoides variegated and Rhyncospetmum jasminoides) while the third wall was kept uncovered and used as control. Several climatic parameters concerning the walls and the ambient conditions were collected during the experimental test. The daylight temperatures observed on the shielded walls during warm days were lower than the respective temperatures of the uncovered wall up to 9.0 degrees C. The nighttime temperatures during the cold days for the vegetated walls were higher than the respective temperatures of the control wall up to 3.5 degrees C. The thermal effects of the facades at daytime was driven by solar radiation, wind velocity arid air relative humidity. The highest cooling effect of such parameters occurred with a wind speed of 3-4 ms(-1), an air relative humidity within the range 30-60% and a solar radiation higher than 800 Wm(-2). The long-term experimental test demonstrated that both Pandorea jasminoides variegated and Rhyncospermum jasminoides are suitable for green facades in the Mediterranean climatic area. The results shown in the present research allow to fill the gap in literature concerning the lack of data for all the seasons of the year, in order to obtain a complete picture of the building thermal performance in the Mediterranean climate region.","[Vox, Giuliano; Blanco, Ileana; Schettini, Evelia] Univ Bari, Dept Agr & Environm Sci DISAAT, Bari, Italy",Universita degli Studi di Bari Aldo Moro,"Schettini, E (corresponding author), Univ Bari, Dept Agr & Environm Sci DISAAT, Bari, Italy.",evelia.schettini@uniba.it,"Blanco, Ileana/I-5210-2015; BLANCO, ILEANA/ADD-4669-2022; Blanco, Ileana/O-4063-2019; Schettini, Evelia/E-9252-2012","Blanco, Ileana/0000-0003-2927-3427; BLANCO, ILEANA/0000-0003-2927-3427; Vox, Giuliano/0000-0003-4017-5174; Schettini, Evelia/0000-0002-8456-8677",Italian Ministry of Economic Development,"Italian Ministry of Economic Development(Ministry of Economic Development, Italy)","The present work has been carried out under the Piano triennale della Ricerca 2015-2017 nell'ambito del Sistema Elettrico Nazionale, Progetto D.1 'Tecnologie per costruire gli edifici del futuro', Obiettivo: Tecnologie green per gli edifici, Piano Annuale di Realizzazione (PAR) 2015, Accordo di Programma Ministero dello Sviluppo Economico - ENEA, funded by the Italian Ministry of Economic Development, Decreto Ministeriale of 21/4/2016.",,40,74,75,13,115,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0360-1323,1873-684X,,BUILD ENVIRON,Build.

The results show that the methodology has reached a certain maturity: Coefficients of variation between databases lie in the range of 10% to 20%, and correlations between databases across countries amount to an average R2 of 0.95. After discussing some of the research frontiers for further methodological development, we conclude that the material flow accounting framework and the data generated have reached a maturity that warrants material flow indicators to complement traditional economic and demographic information in providing a sound basis for discussing national and international policies for sustainable resource use.","[Fischer-Kowalski, M.; Krausmann, F.] Alpen Adria Univ, Inst Social Ecol, A-1070 Vienna, Austria; [Giljum, S.; Lutter, S.] Sustainable Europe Res Inst, Vienna, Austria; [Bringezu, S.] Wuppertal Inst Climate Environm & Energy, Wuppertal, Germany; [Schuetz, H.] Wuppertal Inst, Wuppertal, Germany; [Moriguchi, Y.] Univ Tokyo, Tokyo 1138654, Japan; [Schandl, H.] CSIRO Sustainable Ecosyst, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Weisz, H.] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Potsdam, Germany",University of Klagenfurt; University of Tokyo; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung,"Fischer-Kowalski, M (corresponding author), Alpen Adria Univ, Inst Social Ecol, Schottenfeldgasse 29, A-1070 Vienna, Austria.",marina.fischer-kowalski@uni-klu.ac.at,"Giljum, Stefan/M-3162-2015; Bringezu, Stefan/W-6229-2018; Lutter, Stephan/AAD-1881-2019; Fischer-Kowalski, Marina/O-9646-2019; Krausmann, Fridolin/N-1918-2015; Schandl, Heinz/C-5055-2008","Giljum, Stefan/0000-0002-4719-5867; Fischer-Kowalski, Marina/0000-0003-3345-4538; Krausmann, Fridolin/0000-0002-9995-2372; Schandl, Heinz/0000-0001-6399-4231; Mayer, Andreas/0000-0002-6975-7082; Lutter, Stephan/0000-0003-0097-7535",Austrian Science Fund [GLOMETRA P-21012-G11]; Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [P 21012] Funding Source: researchfish,Austrian Science Fund(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)); Austrian Science Fund (FWF)(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)),We acknowledge the Austrian Science Fund for supporting the data work on which this article is based (Project GLOMETRA P-21012-G11).

Thermal insulation is considered a fundamental strategy before moving to more complex ones. Over the past 50 years, thermal insulation is mainly conceived and implemented through the steady-state heat transfer simplification, making its contribution easy to predict and control with high confidence. While historically, the concept of 'dynamic thermal insulation', or otherwise, variable thermal insulation is mainly found in warm regions, numerous recent studies show that there is a continuously growing interest in implementing it into buildings to counterbalance the few disadvantages of intense thermal insulation or to allow buildings adapting to the varying seasonal climate conditions. This interest is depicted in numerous published studies, supporting that thermal insulation can have a more beneficial and complex contribution than the steady-state assumption allows and that it can provide great potential for improving a building's energy efficiency by advancing and optimizing the envelope's thermal insulation according to the actual needs of the building on a year-round basis. In this review study, an effort to organize and classify the advances in the field is attempted, aiming at defining the complexity, the limits, the applicability and the barriers of all systems and techniques. Challenges regarding their wide utilization in the construction industry are highlighted, along with suggestions for future research. As the study shows, a few of the many approaches to dynamic thermal insulation can be simple and effective, while others show greater potential. What is more evident thought, is that further research is needed before their implementation can become practical.","[Karanafti, Aikaterina; Theodosiou, Theodoros; Tsikaloudaki, Katerina] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Civil Engn, Lab Bldg Construct & Bldg Phys, Thessaloniki, Greece",Aristotle University of Thessaloniki,"Theodosiou, T (corresponding author), Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Civil Engn, Lab Bldg Construct & Bldg Phys, Thessaloniki, Greece.",tgt@civil.auth.gr,,,Hellenic Foundation for Research and Innovation (HFRI) [5921],Hellenic Foundation for Research and Innovation (HFRI),The research work was supported by the Hellenic Foundation for Research and Innovation (HFRI) under the 3rd Call for HFRI PhD Fellowships (Fellowship Number 5921) .,,154,0,0,8,8,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0306-2619,1872-9118,,APPL ENERG,Appl.

Previous studies have demonstrated the beneficial effects of beta-carotene supplementation on bovine reproductive performance. This study was performed in Thailand, where the temperature-humidity index (THI) during the experimental periods was measured to range from 78.4 to 86.1. Lactating Holstein cows classified as repeat breeders (previous artificial insemination [AI] failures) were randomly assigned into two treatments, control treatment (T1; received placebo, n = 200) and test treatment (T2; received 400 mg/h/day of beta-carotene, n = 200). All cows were subjected to a protocol for synchronization of ovulation and timed artificial insemination (TAI). The day of the 1st ovulation synchronized protocol was defined as day 0, and the total experimental period was 160 days. Daily placebo or beta-carotene supplements were given orally on day 0 and each subsequent day of the experiment. Diagnosis of pregnancy was performed using ultrasound on day 30 after insemination. Non-pregnant cows were subjected to further ovulation synchronizations (maximum of four) and TAI over a period of 160 days. Milk samples were collected every ten days throughout the experiment. The samples were analyzed for beta-carotene concentration, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities. The pregnancies per AI of the cows in T2 were significantly greater than that of T1 from the 2nd to 4th TAI. During the entire experimental period, the pregnancies in T2 were significantly greater than that of T1. Cox's proportional hazards regression model data indicated a 44% greater probability of pregnancy for cows receiving beta-carotene. The concentrations of milk beta-carotene in T2 were significantly greater than T1 from the 2nd to 4th TAI. Significantly greater SOD and GPx activities were observed in T2 than T1, suggesting a reduction of oxidative stress in cows treated with beta-carotene. Dietary supplementation with beta-carotene thus improves the reproductive performance of repeat breeders exposed to heat stress, possibly by reducing oxidative stress.","[Khemarach, Soparak; Yammuen-art, Saowaluck] Chiang Mai Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Anim & Aquat Sci, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand; [Punyapornwithaya, Veerasak] Chiang Mai Univ, Fac Vet Med, Dept Food Anim Clin, Chiang Mai 50100, Thailand; [Nithithanasilp, Sutichai; Jaipolsaen, Narongrit; Sangsritavong, Siwat] Natl Ctr Genet Engn & Biotechnol, Thailand Sci Pk 12120, Khlong Luang Dist, Pathum Thani, Thailand",Chiang Mai University; Chiang Mai University; National Science & Technology Development Agency - Thailand; National Center Genetic Engineering & Biotechnology (BIOTEC),"Sangsritavong, S (corresponding author), Natl Ctr Genet Engn & Biotechnol, Thailand Sci Pk 12120, Khlong Luang Dist, Pathum Thani, Thailand.",siwat@biotec.or.th,"yammuen-art, Saowaluck/GLR-2970-2022","Punyapornwithaya, Veerasak/0000-0001-9870-7773","National Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, National Science and Technology Development Agency, Thailand","National Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, National Science and Technology Development Agency, Thailand","This study was funded by the National Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, National Science and Technology Development Agency, Thailand.",,48,0,0,0,4,NATURE PORTFOLIO,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",2045-2322,,,SCI REP-UK,Sci Rep,30-Nov,2021,1,,,,,,23171,10.1038/s41598-021-02655-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-02655-8,,,9,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,XG0VJ,34848807,"Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000724479000066,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this essay, I take advantage of this hermeneutic quality to explore the composer's relation to Lorca and surrealism more generally, and how this manifests in theIntermezzo. Ultimately, I argue that the movement is more than simply a lament over Lorca's tragic death, and is in fact a broader expression of Poulenc's despair towards a political and social climate that seeks to marginalize on the basis of sexual identity.",,,,olivercesmith@hotmail.co.uk,,,,,,,117,0,0,0,4,TAYLOR & FRANCIS AS,OSLO,"KARL JOHANS GATE 5, NO-0154 OSLO, NORWAY",2331-1983,,,COGENT ARTS HUMANITE,Cogent Art Humanities,,2016,,,,,,,1187242,10.1080/23311983.2016.1187242,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/23311983.2016.1187242,,,27,"Humanities, Multidisciplinary",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Arts & Humanities - Other Topics,DY3DO,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000384971200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Part II: Solute profiles, gradients and the comparisons of contemporary and long-term weathering rates",GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA,,,English,Article,,,,,,,CATION-EXCHANGE CAPACITY; SOIL CHRONOSEQUENCE; PRECIPITATION KINETICS; DISSOLUTION KINETICS; SILICATE MINERALS; ROCK INTERACTION; FREE-ENERGY; TRANSPORT; EVOLUTION; IMPACT,"The spatial and temporal changes in hydrology and pore water elemental and Sr-87/Sr-86 compositions are used to determine contemporary weathering rates in a 65- to 226-kyr-old soil chronosequence formed from granitic sediments deposited on marine terraces along coastal California. Soil moisture, tension and saturation exhibit large seasonal variations in shallow soils in response to a Mediterranean climate. These climate effects are dampened in underlying argillic horizons that progressively developed in older soils, and reached steady-state conditions in unsaturated horizons extending to depths in excess of 15 m. Hydraulic fluxes (q(h)), based on Cl mass balances, vary from 0.06 to 0.22 m yr(-1), resulting in fluid residence times in the terraces of 10-24 yrs. As expected for a coastal environment, the order of cation abundances in soil pore waters is comparable to sea water, i.e., Na > Mg > Ca > K > Sr, while the anion sequence Cl > NO3 > HCO3 > SO4 reflects modifying effects of nutrient cycling in the grassland vegetation. Net Cl-corrected solute Na, K and Si increase with depth, denoting inputs from feldspar weathering. Solute Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios exhibit progressive mixing of sea water-dominated precipitation with inputs from less radiogenic plagioclase. While net Sr and Ca concentrations are anomalously high in shallow soils due to biological cycling, they decline with depth to low and/or negative net concentrations. Ca/Mg, Sr/Mg and Sr-87/Sr-86 solute and exchange ratios are similar in all the terraces, denoting active exchange equilibration with selectivities close to unity for both detrital smectite and secondary kaolinite. Large differences in the magnitudes of the pore waters and exchange reservoirs result in short-term buffering of the solute Ca, Sr, and Mg. Such buffering over geologic time scales can not be sustained due to declining inputs from residual plagioclase and smectite, implying periodic resetting of the exchange reservoir such as by past vegetational changes and/or climate. Pore waters approach thermodynamic saturation with respect to albite at depth in the younger terraces, indicating that weathering rates ultimately become transport-limited and dependent on hydrologic flux. Contemporary rates R-solute are estimated from linear Na and Si pore weathering gradients b(solute) such that R-solute = q(h)/b(solute)beta S-v where S-v is the volumetric surface area and beta is the stoichiometric coefficient. Plagioclase weathering rates (0.38-2.8 x 10(-15) mol m(-2) s(-1)) are comparable to those based on Sr-87/Sr-86 mass balances and solid-state Na and Ca gradients using analogous gradient approximations. In addition, contemporary solute gradients, under transport-limited conditions, approximate long-term solid-state gradients when normalized against the mass of protolith plagioclase and its corresponding aqueous solubility. The multi-faceted weathering analysis presented in this paper is perhaps the most comprehensive yet applied to a single field study. Within uncertainties of the methods used, present day weathering rates, based on solute characterizations, are comparable to average long-term past rates as evidenced by soil profiles.

There is also a lack of consideration in the training curriculum of health professionals on the topic of the dancer's health. In recent years, the field of dance medicine and science research and its applications has been growing in Europe and abroad. In France, this research in this field is very recent but increasingly seeks the interest of sport and movement science researchers and of the dance institutions.

In what follows, I discuss ecological, economic, political, social, and ideational aspects of ancient Maya landscapes, and how new research is altering ideas on significant and enduring questions about Maya lives. Consideration is structured by three components earth, water, and sky that defined and still define the Maya world.

In the present review, we present a historical perspective of selection, harvest, and fiber processing features where the state of the art of nettle varietal selection is detailed. A synthesis of the general knowledge about its biology, adaptability, and genetics constituents, highlighting gaps in our current knowledge on interactions with other organisms, is provided. We further addressed cultivation and processing features, putting a special emphasis on harvesting systems and fiber extraction processes to improve fiber yield and quality.

With the contemporary increase in computational power, model resolution and technological improvements in quality and quantity of benthic data, it is necessary to ensure that benthic systems are appropriately represented in coupled benthic-pelagic biogeochemical and ecological modelling studies. In this paper we focus on five topical challenges related to various aspects of modelling benthic environments: organic matter reactivity, dynamics of benthic-pelagic boundary layer, microphytobenthos, biological transport and small-scale heterogeneity, and impacts of episodic events. We discuss current gaps in their understanding and indicate plausible ways ahead. Further, we propose a three-pronged approach for the advancement of benthic and benthic-pelagic modelling, essential for improved understanding, management and prediction of the marine environment. This includes: (A) development of a traceable and hierarchical framework for benthic-pelagic models, which will facilitate integration among models, reduce risk of bias, and clarify model limitations; (B) extended cross-disciplinary approach to promote effective collaboration between modelling and empirical scientists of various backgrounds and better involvement of stakeholders and end-users; (C) a common vocabulary for terminology used in benthic modelling, to promote model development and integration, and also to enhance mutual understanding.","[Lessin, Gennadi;

Exospheric temperatures were first estimated using rho-h-T-infinity relationships implicit within the Jacchia models, then averaged over individual orbits. We found good agreement between the orbital-averaged T-infinity obtained from CHAMP and GRACE accelerometer data as well as with globally averaged exospheric temperatures derived from drag measurements from the constellation of satellites used in the High-Accuracy Satellite Drag Model. Our analysis corrects a critical conjecture by Burke (2008) that globally averaged T-infinity is essentially the same as orbit-averaged values obtained by polar-orbiting satellites, independent of the local time of their orbital planes. Unlike the symmetric 0200-1400 LT distribution of T-infinity minima and maxima found in early Jacchia models, presented data indicate that the minima are located closer to the dawn meridian. We also demonstrate that the averaging technique used to estimate T-infinity affects the outcomes. Statistical analyses provide an empirical basis for improving estimates of the thermosphere's total energy budget.","[Wise, J. O.; Burke, W. J.; Sutton, E.

Yet, research indicates that urban Ghana is faced with rapid depletion of environmental resources amidst burgeoning urbanisation and climate change. Based on a review of relevant and related literature, this paper explores the implications of this dilemma for the future of urban Ghana. It examines the environmental problems confronting urban Ghana by: (i) analysing the factors that predispose urban Ghana to environmental threats; (ii) understanding the influence of human-induced activities and natural occurrences on urban environmental resources; (iii) discussing environmental protection in terms of sustainable urban development in Ghana; and (iv) presenting policy implications of the environmental problems in Ghana. Findings indicate that high demographics, defunct planning system, and rising poverty predispose environmental depletion in urban Ghana. Anthropogenic actions (e.g., pollution, poverty, and urban growth) and natural events (e.g., flooding, drought, and windstorms) have negatively changed the geography of the urban environment. This paper advocates the adoption and implementation of the values (e.g., inclusiveness, equity, pro-poor) of the sustainable urban development concept.","[Cobbinah, Patrick Brandful; Poku-Boansi, Michael; Peprah, Charles] Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Planning, Coll Art & Built Environm, Kumasi, Ghana; [Cobbinah, Patrick Brandful] Charles Sturt Univ, Inst Land Water & Soc, POB 789, Albury, NSW 2640, Australia",Kwame Nkrumah University Science & Technology; Charles Sturt University,"Cobbinah, PB (corresponding author), Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Planning, Coll Art & Built Environm, Kumasi, Ghana.",pcobbinah@csu.edu.au; poku-boansi@gmail.com; cpeprah.cap@knust.edu.gh,"Cobbinah, Patrick/ABH-9950-2020; Poku-Boansi, Michael/AGZ-8640-2022","Cobbinah, Patrick/0000-0003-2522-9293; Poku-Boansi, Michael/0000-0003-4929-0961",,,,,65,29,31,2,20,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2211-4645,2211-4653,,ENVIRON DEV,Environ.

Yet surprisingly little is known about the effectiveness of wildfire suppression or how wildfire incident managers prioritize resources threatened within a wildfire incident. We investigate the determinants of wildfire suppression effort using a novel empirical strategy comparing over 1,400 historical fire perimeters to the spatial distribution of assets at risk. We find that fires are more likely to stop spreading as they approach homes, particularly when homes are of greater value. This effect persists after controlling for physical factors (fuels, landscape, and weather) using a state-of-the-art wildfire simulation tool. As well, the probability that spread will be halted is affected by characteristics of homes 1-2 kilometers beyond a fire's edge. Overall, we find that suppression efforts can substantively affect wildfire outcomes but that some groups may benefit more from wildfire management than others.","[Plantinga, Andrew J.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Bren Sch Environm Sci & Management, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Walsh, Randall] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Econ, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; [Wibbenmeyer, Matthew] Resources Future Inc, Washington, DC USA",University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; Resources for the Future,"Plantinga, AJ (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Bren Sch Environm Sci & Management, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",plantinga@bren.ucsb.edu; walshr@pitt.edu; wibbenmeyer@rff.org,,,,,,,59,0,0,2,5,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",2333-5955,2333-5963,,J ASSOC ENVIRON RESO,J.

These contribute to the hike of urban temperature above the temperature of surrounding rural areas. When this happens, the city is said to experience Urban Heat Island (UHI). This paper presents a review of available literatures on the subject matter of UHI with peculiar emphasis on urban pavements. Information on the state of the art of UHI measurement, evaluation, and mitigation is reported. The causes, effects, and spatio-temporal variations in UHI events were studied and discussed. Addressing the harmful effects of UHI would involve adoption of effective mitigation strategies that can improve the environmental, societal, and economic sustainability of urban structures and landscapes. Implementation of innovative designs of urban pavements to ensure lower surface temperature was generally recommended. The use of vegetative covers, reflective surfaces, water retaining materials, and heat capturing devices were found to be effective. The facts presented in this paper are very expedient to inform policy making and guide to future studies that can lead to more innovative engineering designs of sustainable urban pavements for UHI mitigation.","[Nwakaire, Chidozie Maduabuchukwu; Onn, Chiu Chuen; Yap, Soon Poh; Yuen, Choon Wah] Univ Malaya, Dept Civil Engn, Fac Engn, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia; [Nwakaire, Chidozie Maduabuchukwu; Onodagu, Peter Dinwoke] Nnamdi Azikiwe Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Civil Engn, PMB 5025, Awka, Nigeria",Universiti Malaya,"Onn, CC (corresponding author), Univ Malaya, Dept Civil Engn, Fac Engn, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia.",onnchiuchuen@um.edu.my,"YUEN, CHOON WAH/B-5384-2010; Poh, Yap Soon/L-2110-2016; ONN, CHIU CHUEN/B-9460-2010","YUEN, CHOON WAH/0000-0001-7751-7292; Poh, Yap Soon/0000-0002-2036-9740; ONN, CHIU CHUEN/0000-0002-5093-5651",University of Malaya grant under the project Environmental Life Cycle Analysis of Reflective Paving Materials in Tackling the Issues of Urban Heat Island [GPF006A-2019]; Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFund) Nigeria,University of Malaya grant under the project Environmental Life Cycle Analysis of Reflective Paving Materials in Tackling the Issues of Urban Heat Island; Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFund) Nigeria,"This research work was funded by the University of Malaya grant under the project Environmental Life Cycle Analysis of Reflective Paving Materials in Tackling the Issues of Urban Heat Island (GPF006A-2019).

The manual methods traditionally used to monitor change in satellite imagery of marine-terminating outlet glaciers are time-consuming and can be subjective, especially where melange exists at the terminus. Recent advances in deep learning applied to image processing have created a new frontier in the field of automated delineation of glacier calving fronts. However, there remains a paucity of research on the use of deep learning for pixel-level semantic image classification of outlet glacier environments. Here, we apply and test a two-phase deep learning approach based on a well-established convolutional neural network (CNN) for automated classification of Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. The novel workflow, termed CNN-Supervised Classification (CSC) is adapted to produce multi-class outputs for unseen test imagery of glacial environments containing marine-terminating outlet glaciers in Greenland. Different CNN input parameters and training techniques are tested, with overall F1 scores for resulting classifications reaching up to 94 % for in-sample test data (Helheim Glacier) and 96 % for out-of-sample test data (Jakobshavn Isbrae and Store Glacier), establishing a state of the art in classification of marine-terminating glaciers in Greenland. Predicted calving fronts derived using optimal CSC input parameters have a mean deviation of 56.17 m (5.6 px) and median deviation of 24.7 m (2.5 px) from manually digitised fronts. This demonstrates the transferability and robustness of the deep learning workflow despite complex and seasonally variable imagery. Future research could focus on the integration of deep learning classification workflows with free cloud-based platforms, to efficiently classify imagery and produce datasets for a range of glacial applications without the need for substantial prior experience in coding or deep learning.","[Marochov, Melanie; Stokes, Chris R.; Carbonneau, Patrice E.] Univ Durham, Dept Geog, Durham DH1 3LE, England",Durham University,"Carbonneau, PE (corresponding author), Univ Durham, Dept Geog, Durham DH1 3LE, England.",patrice.carbonneau@durham.ac.uk,,,,,,,80,7,7,8,19,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1994-0416,1994-0424,,CRYOSPHERE,Cryosphere,1-Nov,2021,11,,,,5041,5059,,10.5194/tc-15-5041-2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-5041-2021,,,19,"Geography, Physical; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Physical Geography; Geology,WR2XW,,"Green Accepted, Green Submitted, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000714369200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, despite substantial efforts in recent decades, large-scale 30-m land cover maps still suffer from relatively low accuracy in terms of land cover type discrimination (especially for the vegetation and impervious types), due to limits in relation to the data, method, and design of the workflow. In this work, we improved the land cover classification accuracy by integrating free and public high-resolution Google Earth images (HR-GEI) with Landsat Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) imagery. Our major innovation is a hybrid approach that includes three major components: (1) a deep convolutional neural network (CNN)-based classifier that extracts high-resolution features from Google Earth imagery; (2) traditional machine learning classifiers (i.e., Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM)) that are based on spectral features extracted from 30-m Landsat data; and (3) an ensemble decision maker that takes all different features into account. Experimental results show that our proposed method achieves a classification accuracy of 84.40% on the entire validation dataset in China, improving the previous state-of-the-art accuracies obtained by RF and SVM by 4.50% and 4.20%, respectively. Moreover, our proposed method reduces misclassifications between certain vegetation types, and improves identification of the impervious type. Evaluation applied over an area of around 14,000 km(2) confirms little improvement for land cover types (e.g., forest) of which the classification accuracies are already over 80% when using traditional machine learning approaches, yet improvements in accuracy of 7% for cropland and shrubland, 9% for grassland, 23% for impervious and 25% for wetlands were achieved when compared with traditional machine learning approaches. The results demonstrate the great potential of integrating features of datasets at different resolutions and the possibility to produce more reliable land cover maps.","[Li, Weijia; Dong, Runmin; Fu, Haohuan; Yu, Le; Gong, Peng] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Minist Educ, Key Lab Earth Syst Modeling, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Li, Weijia; Dong, Runmin; Fu, Haohuan; Yu, Le; Gong, Peng] JCGCS, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Li, Weijia] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, CUHK SenseTime Joint Lab, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jie] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Remote Sensing & Digital Earth, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China","Tsinghua University; Chinese University of Hong Kong; Chinese Academy of Sciences; The Institute of Remote Sensing & Digital Earth, CAS","Fu, HH (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Minist Educ, Key Lab Earth Syst Modeling, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",haohuan@tsinghua.edu.cn,"Gong, Peng/AAM-1516-2021; Yu, Le/C-3701-2008","Gong, Peng/0000-0003-1513-3765; Yu, Le/0000-0003-3115-2042","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFA0604401]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [51761135015, U1839206]; Center for High Performance Computing and System Simulation, Pilot National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology (Qingdao); Cyrus Tang Foundation","National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Center for High Performance Computing and System Simulation, Pilot National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology (Qingdao); Cyrus Tang Foundation","This work was supported in part by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant No. 2017YFA0604401), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 51761135015 and U1839206), Center for High Performance Computing and System Simulation, Pilot National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology (Qingdao), and Cyrus Tang Foundation and a donation by Delos LLC to Tsinghua University.",,43,47,49,15,122,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0034-4257,1879-0704,,REMOTE SENS ENVIRON,Remote Sens.

LSMs have evolved from a leaky-bucket approximation to more sophisticated land surface water and energy budget models that typically have a specified bottom layer flux to depict the lowest model layer exchange with deeper aquifers. The LSM lower boundary is often assumed zero flux or the soil moisture content is set to a constant value; an approach that while mass conservative, ignores processes that can alter surface fluxes, runoff, and water quantity and quality. Conversely, groundwater models (GWMs) for saturated and unsaturated water flow, while addressing important features such as subsurface heterogeneity and three-dimensional flow, often have overly simplified upper boundary conditions that ignore soil heating. runoff, snow, and root-zone uptake. In the present study, a state-of-the-art LSM (Common Land Model) and a variably saturated GWM (ParFlow) have been coupled as a single-column model. A set of simulations based on synthetic data and data from the Project for Intercomparison of Land-surface Parameterization Schemes (PILPS), version 2(d), 18-yr dataset from VaIdai, Russia, demonstrate the temporal dynamics of this coupled modeling system. The soil moisture and water table depth simulated by the coupled model agree well with the Valdai observations. Differences in prediction between the coupled and uncoupled models demonstrate the effect of a dynamic water table on simulated watershed flow. Comparison of the coupled model predictions with observations indicates certain cold processes such as frozen soil and freeze/thaw processes have an important impact on predicted water table depth. Comparisons of soil moisture, latent heat, sensible heat. temperature, runoff, and predicted groundwater depth between the uncoupled and coupled models demonstrate the need for improved groundwater representation in land surface schemes.","Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, Div Environm Sci, Livermore, CA 94550 USA; Lawrence Berkeley Lab, Div Earth Sci, Berkeley, CA USA",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory,"Maxwell, RM (corresponding author), Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, Div Environm Sci, L-208,7000 E Ave, Livermore, CA 94550 USA.",maxwell15@llnl.gov,"Maxwell, Reed M/D-7980-2013; Miller, Norman L./E-6897-2010","Maxwell, Reed M/0000-0002-1364-4441; ",,,,,39,290,298,8,124,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",1525-755X,1525-7541,,J HYDROMETEOROL,J.

Among degradation processes, soil sealing represents the major threat, as ecosystem services dramatically decrease or are even nullified. The increasing use of big open data from satellites combined with AI algorithms are making geodata mining and mapping techniques essential to quantify soil sealing. Different keywords are adopted to define the phenomenon. However, at present, review articles presenting the state-of-the-art on mapping soil sealing by including the most common definitions are currently not available. Hence, we analyzed: (a) impervious surface, (b) soil sealing, (c) land take, (d) soil consumption, (e) land consumption. We provide a systematic review of remote sensing platforms and methodologies to map and to classify soil sealing, by highlighting: (a) definitions; (b) relationships among study areas, scales, platforms, resolutions, and classification methodologies; (c) emerging trends and policy implications. We performed a systematic search on Scopus (from 2000 to 2020), identifying 1277 papers; 392 focused on mapping soil sealing. 'Impervious surface' is the dominant definition. The phenomenon is more studied by the USA, China and Italy and, 'soil sealing' is recently more adopted in EU. Most studies focuses on mapping soil sealing at urban scale. We found Landsat are the most adopted platforms; they are frequently used for multi-temporal analyses. Eleven methodologies were identified: automatic classifications are the most adopted, dominated by pixel/sub-pixel-based approaches; other methods include Band Ratios, Supervised, OBIA, ANN. The majority of mapping analyses are performed on 30 m resolution in areas of 1000-10 000 km(2). Landsat images are less used for smaller areas. In conclusion, as study area size increases, a decrease in image resolution with the use of more completely automatic classification methodologies is recorded. However, most studies focuses on comparing classification techniques rather than supporting policy making for sustainable urban planning. Thus, we encourage to fill the gap by developing approaches that applicable to international policies.","[Peroni, Francesca; Facchinelli, Francesco] Univ Padua, Dept Hist & Geog Sci & Ancient World DiSSGeA, Padua, Italy; [Pappalardo, Salvatore Eugenio; Crescini, Edoardo; De Marchi, Massimo] Univ Padua, Dept Civil Environm & Architectural Engn ICEA, Padua, Italy; [Munafo, Michele] Italian Natl Inst Environm Protect & Res ISPRA, Rome, Italy; [Hodgson, Michael E.] Univ South Carolina, Dept Geog, Columbia, SC 29208 USA",University of Padua; University of Padua; Italian Institute for Environmental Protection & Research (ISPRA); University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia,"Pappalardo, SE (corresponding author), Univ Padua, Dept Civil Environm & Architectural Engn ICEA, Padua, Italy.",salvatore.pappalardo@unipd.it,"Facchinelli, Francesco/AAS-2022-2021","Facchinelli, Francesco/0000-0001-5740-8435; De Marchi, Massimo/0000-0001-8184-013X; PERONI, FRANCESCA/0000-0003-2389-5612",,,,,104,1,1,12,15,IOP Publishing Ltd,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1748-9326,,,ENVIRON RES LETT,Environ.

However, particularly for small dam reservoirs, there is a lack of consistent data on their geographical location. To address this data gap, a promising approach is to perform automated dam reservoir extraction based on globally available remote sensing imagery. It can be considered as a fine-grained task of water body extraction, which involves extracting water areas in images and then separating dam reservoirs from natural water bodies. A straightforward solution is to extend the commonly used binary-class segmentation in water body extraction to multiclass. This, however, does not work well as there exists not much pixel-level difference of water areas between dam reservoirs and natural water bodies. We propose a novel deep neural network (DNN)-based pipeline that decomposes dam reservoir extraction into water body segmentation and dam reservoir recognition. Water bodies are first separated from background lands in a segmentation model and each individual water body is then predicted as either dam reservoir or natural water body in a classification model. For the former step, point-level metric learning (PLML) with triplets across images is injected into the segmentation model to address contour ambiguities between water areas and land regions. For the latter step, prior-guided metric learning (PGML) with triplets from clusters is injected into the classification model to optimize the image embedding space in a fine-grained level based on reservoir clusters. To facilitate future research, we establish a benchmark dataset with Earth imagery data and human-labeled reservoirs from river basins in West Africa and India. Extensive experiments were conducted on this benchmark in the water body segmentation task, dam reservoir recognition task, and the joint dam reservoir extraction task. Superior performance has been observed in the respective tasks when comparing our method with state-of-the-art approaches.

The impact of human emissions on indoor air quality is inadequately understood. The aim of the Indoor Chemical Human Emissions and Reactivity (ICHEAR) project was to examine the impact on indoor air chemistry of whole-body, exhaled, and dermally emitted human bioeffluents under different conditions comprising human factors (t-shirts/shorts vs long-sleeve shirts/pants; age: teenagers, young adults, and seniors) and a variety of environmental factors (moderate vs high air temperature; low vs high relative humidity; presence vs absence of ozone). A series of human subject experiments were performed in a well-controlled stainless steel climate chamber. State-of-the-art measurement technologies were used to quantify the volatile organic compounds emitted by humans and their total OH reactivity; ammonia, nanoparticle, fluorescent biological aerosol particle (FBAP), and microbial emissions; and skin surface chemistry. This paper presents the design of the project, its methodologies, and preliminary results, comparing identical measurements performed with five groups, each composed of 4 volunteers (2 males and 2 females). The volunteers wore identical laundered new clothes and were asked to use the same set of fragrance-free personal care products. They occupied the ozone-free (<2 ppb) chamber for 3 hours (morning) and then left for a 10-min lunch break. Ozone (target concentration in occupied chamber similar to 35 ppb) was introduced 10 minutes after the volunteers returned to the chamber, and the measurements continued for another 2.5 hours. Under a given ozone condition, relatively small differences were observed in the steady-state concentrations of geranyl acetone, 6MHO, and 4OPA between the five groups. Larger variability was observed for acetone and isoprene. The absence or presence of ozone significantly influenced the steady-state concentrations of acetone, geranyl acetone, 6MHO, and 4OPA. Results of replicate experiments demonstrate the robustness of the experiments. Higher repeatability was achieved for dermally emitted compounds and their reaction products than for constituents of exhaled breath.","[Beko, Gabriel; Wargocki, Pawel; Weschler, Charles J.] Tech Univ Denmark, Int Ctr Indoor Environm & Energy, Dept Civil Engn, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark; [Wang, Nijing; Li, Mengze; Ernle, Lisa; Zannoni, Nora; Williams, Jonathan] Max Planck Inst Chem, Mainz, Germany; [Weschler, Charles J.] Rutgers State Univ, Environm & Occupat Hlth Sci Inst, Piscataway, NJ USA; [Morrison, Glenn] Univ N Carolina, Gillings Sch Global Publ Hlth, Dept Environm Sci & Engn, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA; [Langer, Sarka] IVL Swedish Environm Res Inst, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Langer, Sarka] Chalmers Univ Technol, Dept Architecture & Civil Engn, Div Bldg Serv Engn, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Licina, Dusan; Yang, Shen] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Human Oriented Built Environm Lab, Sch Architecture Civil & Environm Engn, Fribourg, Switzerland",Technical University of Denmark; Max Planck Society; Rutgers State University New Brunswick; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; IVL Swedish Environmental Research Institute; Chalmers University of Technology; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne,"Beko, G (corresponding author), Tech Univ Denmark, Int Ctr Indoor Environm & Energy, Dept Civil Engn, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark.",gab@byg.dtu.dk,"Beko, Gabriel/C-8684-2009; Wang, Nijing/GRX-8410-2022; yang, shen/GWC-0424-2022; Yang, Shen/AAL-6350-2020; Li, Mengze/ABE-9949-2020; Wargocki, Pawel/AAZ-9496-2021; Weschler, Charles/A-9788-2009; Langer, Sarka/A-4076-2011; Morrison, Glenn/B-4261-2016","Beko, Gabriel/0000-0001-6107-8336; Yang, Shen/0000-0001-6964-4814; Li, Mengze/0000-0003-0620-6301; Wargocki, Pawel/0000-0003-3865-3560; Weschler, Charles/0000-0002-9097-5850; Ernle, Lisa/0000-0001-7641-4347; Licina, Dusan/0000-0001-5945-0872; Langer, Sarka/0000-0002-6580-8911; Morrison, Glenn/0000-0001-6876-7185",Alfred P.

This supports a saving of around US$ 4.1 trillion per year globally by limiting the cost of expensive drinking water treatments and provision of unnecessary infrastructure. Even low levels of contaminants specifically organics and metals in catchments when in a mobile state can reduce these economic benefits by seriously affecting the water quality. Contamination and contaminant mobility can occur through natural and anthropogenic activities including forest fires. Moderate to high intensity forest fires are able to alter soil properties and release sequestered metals from sediments, soil organic matter and fragments of vegetation. In addition, the increase in post-fire erosion rate by rainfall runoff and strong winds facilitates the rapid transport of these metals downslope and downstream. The subsequent metal deposition in distal soil and water bodies can influence surface water quality with potential impacts to the larger ecosystems inclusive of negative effects on humans. This is of substantial concern as 4 billion hectares of forest catchments provide high quality water to global communities. Redressing this problem requires quantification of the potential effects on water resources and instituting rigorous fire and environmental management plans to mitigate deleterious effects on catchment areas. This paper is a review of the current state of,the art literature dealing with the risk of post-fire mobilization of the metals into surface water resources. It is intended to inform discussion on the preparation of suitable management plans and policies during and after fire events in order to maintain potable water quality in a cost-effective manner. In these times of climate fluctuation and increased incidence of fires, the need for development of new policies and management frameworks are of heighted significance. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In practice, rule-based control and PID controllers are typically used and implemented at the beginning of the building operation. Since this approach neither guarantees optimal or even good control, optimal control algorithms (which can be predictive and adaptive) are in the focus of research. The problem with most of the approaches is that a model of the system is often needed which comes with high engineering efforts. Further, the required computing power can quickly exceed the capacities, even in modern buildings. Therefore, in this paper we investigate the application of a state-of-the-art Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm, as a self-calibrating valve controller for two water-air heat exchangers of a real-world air handling unit. We choose a generic problem formulation to pre-train the algorithm with a simulation of an admixing heater and use it to control an injection heater and a throttle cooler. Our results show that after only 70 hours, the control quality significantly increases. Therefore, it seems evident that with pre-trained RL algorithms, a self-improving HVAC automation can be realized with little hardware requirements and without extensive modelling of the system dynamics.","[Schreiber, T.; Schwartz, A.; Mueller, D.] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, EON Energy Res Ctr, Inst Energy Efficient Bldg & Indoor Climate, Mathieustr 10, D-52072 Aachen, Germany",E-ON; RWTH Aachen University,"Schreiber, T (corresponding author), Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, EON Energy Res Ctr, Inst Energy Efficient Bldg & Indoor Climate, Mathieustr 10, D-52072 Aachen, Germany.",thomas.schreiber@eonerc.rwth-aachen.de,,,BMWi (Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy) [03SBE0006A],BMWi (Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy),"We gratefully acknowledge the financial support provided by the BMWi (Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy), promotional reference 03SBE0006A.",,19,1,1,2,4,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021,,,,,,,12028,10.1088/1742-6596/2042/1/012028,http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1742-6596/2042/1/012028,,,6,Construction & Building Technology; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Energy & Fuels; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Construction & Building Technology; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Energy & Fuels; Public Administration,BS4ZU,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000724676100028,View Full Record in Web of Science

It demonstrates that increasingly open licensing of digital cultural heritage content is creating opportunities for researchers in the arts and humanities for both access to and analysis of cultural heritage materials. Design/methodology/approach - The paper is primarily a literature and scoping review of the current digitisation licensing climate, using and embedding examples from ongoing research projects and recent writings on Open Access (OA) and digitisation to highlight both opportunities and barriers to the creation and use of digital heritage content from galleries, libraries, archives and museums (GLAM). Findings - The digital information environment in which digitised content is created and delivered has changed phenomenally, allowing the sharing and reuse of digital data and encouraging new advances in research across the sector, although issues of licensing persist. There remain further opportunities for understanding how to: study use and users of openly available cultural and heritage content; disseminate and encourage the uptake of open cultural data; persuade other institutions to contribute their data into the commons in an open and accessible manner; build aggregation and search facilities to link across information sources to allow resource discovery; and how best to use high-performance computing facilities to analyse and process the large amounts of data the author is now seeing being made available throughout the sector. Research limitations/implications - It is hoped that by pulling together this discussion, the benefits to making material openly available have been made clear, encouraging others in the GLAM sector to consider making their collections openly available for reuse and repurposing. Practical implications - This paper will encourage others in the GLAM sector to consider licensing their collections in an open and reusable fashion. By spelling out the range of opportunities for researchers in using open cultural and heritage materials it makes a contribution to the discussion in this area. Social implications - Increasing the quantity of high-quality OA resources in the cultural heritage sector will lead to a richer research environment which will increase the understanding of history, culture and society. Originality/value - This paper has pulled together, for the first time, an overview of the current state of affairs of digitisation in the cultural and heritage sector seen through the context of the OAM. It has highlighted opportunities for researchers in the arts, humanities and social and historical sciences in the embedding of open cultural data into both their research and teaching, whilst scoping the wave of cultural heritage content which is being created from institutional repositories which are now available for research and use. As such, it is a position paper that encourages the open data agenda within the cultural and heritage sector, showing the potentials that exists for the study of culture and society when data are made open.","[Terras, Melissa] UCL, Dept Informat Studies, Digital Humanities, London, England",University of London; University College London,"Terras, M (corresponding author), UCL, Dept Informat Studies, Digital Humanities, London, England.",m.terras@ucl.ac.uk,,"Terras, Melissa/0000-0001-6496-3197; Okwudili, Obiora/0000-0002-7186-8558",,,,,55,24,25,22,108,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1468-4527,1468-4535,,ONLINE INFORM REV,Online Inf.

The dengue-related risk map is one of the most practical tools for executing effective control policies, breaking the transmission chain, and preventing disease outbreaks. Mapping risk at a small scale, such as at an urban level, can demonstrate the spatial heterogeneities in complicated built environments. This review aims to summarize state-of-the-art modeling methods and influential factors in mapping dengue fever risk in urban settings. Data were manually extracted from five major academic search databases following a set of querying and selection criteria, and a total of 28 studies were analyzed. Twenty of the selected papers investigated the spatial pattern of dengue risk by epidemic data, whereas the remaining eight papers developed an entomological risk map as a proxy for potential dengue burden in cities or agglomerated urban regions. The key findings included: (1) Big data sources and emerging data-mining techniques are innovatively employed for detecting hot spots of dengue-related burden in the urban context; (2) Bayesian approaches and machine learning algorithms have become more popular as spatial modeling tools for predicting the distribution of dengue incidence and mosquito presence; (3) Climatic and built environmental variables are the most common factors in making predictions, though the effects of these factors vary with the mosquito species; (4) Socio-economic data may be a better representation of the huge heterogeneity of risk or vulnerability spatial distribution on an urban scale. In conclusion, for spatially assessing dengue-related risk in an urban context, data availability and the purpose for mapping determine the analytical approaches and modeling methods used. To enhance the reliabilities of predictive models, sufficient data about dengue serotyping, socio-economic status, and spatial connectivity may be more important for mapping dengue-related risk in urban settings for future studies.","[Yin, Shi; Ren, Chao] Univ Hong Kong, Fac Architecture, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Yin, Shi] South China Univ Technol, Sch Architecture, Guangzhou 510641, Peoples R China; [Shi, Yuan] Univ Liverpool, Dept Geog & Planning, Liverpool L69 3BX, Merseyside, England; [Hua, Junyi] Ocean Univ China, Sch Int Affairs & Publ Adm, Qingdao 266100, Peoples R China; [Yuan, Hsiang-Yu] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Biomed Sci, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Tian, Lin-Wei] Univ Hong Kong, LKS Fac Med, Sch Publ Hlth, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",University of Hong Kong; South China University of Technology; University of Liverpool; Ocean University of China; City University of Hong Kong; University of Hong Kong,"Ren, C (corresponding author), Univ Hong Kong, Fac Architecture, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",renchao@hku.hk,,"Shi, Yuan/0000-0003-4011-8735; Yin, Shi/0000-0002-5825-5749; Tian, Linwei/0000-0003-2240-8886",Health and Medical Research Fund by Food and Health Bureau [20190672]; Hong Kong Scholars Program and Fellowship of China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2020M672633],Health and Medical Research Fund by Food and Health Bureau; Hong Kong Scholars Program and Fellowship of China Postdoctoral Science Foundation,This study was funded by the Health and Medical Research Fund by Food and Health Bureau (No. 20190672).

In addition to the increased efficiency of harvesting operations, a higher road density may trigger other positive and negative side-effects. Austria has a long tradition of forestry, and also of monitoring the economic performance of forest enterprises by means of forest accountancy data networks. Using these almost unique preconditions, this research paper approaches the topic of forest roads from a managerial accounting perspective. Based on a specially designed report, the results for the fiscal years 2008-2017 were investigated. On average, Austrian forest enterprises larger than 500 ha report a road density of 50.5 m/ha. The yearly net cost of forest roads, including depreciation and reduction of revenue, is 32.4 Euro/ha. The pure maintenance cost amounts to 27.9 Euro/ha on average. The annual investment in forest roads accounts for 9.4 Euro/ha. Whereas the enterprises' average annual cost of maintenance is 0.63 Euro/m, the actual maintenance cost of forest roads is 5.6 Euro/m. To cover the ongoing costs of maintenance, 12.1% of the allowable annual cut is needed. Grouping the analyzed enterprises according to different attributes, namely size of forest land, production conditions, coherence of estate, average slope, and share of forest land requiring cable yarding, showed some statistically significant differences in the maintenance costs of forest roads. In almost all of the tested groupings, significant differences of maintenance costs (expressed as Euro/ha, Euro/m(3) felling volume, or Euro/m) were found. However, an initially expected significant correlation between road density and harvesting cost could not be established. The challenges brought about by the trend towards a bioeconomy on the one hand and climate change on the other most likely further enhance the significance of the opening-up of forests and the efficiency of road maintenance.","[Toscani, Philipp; Sekot, Walter] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Agr & Forestry Econ, Feistmantelstr 4, A-1180 Vienna, Austria; [Holzleitner, Franz] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Forest Engn, Peter Jordan Str 82, A-1190 Vienna, Austria","University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna; University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna","Toscani, P (corresponding author), Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Agr & Forestry Econ, Feistmantelstr 4, A-1180 Vienna, Austria.",philipp.toscani@boku.ac.at; walter.sekot@boku.ac.at; franz.holzleitner@boku.ac.at,,"Holzleitner, Franz/0000-0001-8489-3050","Open Access Publishing Fund of the University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Vienna","Open Access Publishing Fund of the University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Vienna","This research received no external funding.

SiNx moisture permeation barriers have been fabricated using a very recently developed low-temperature plasma-assisted atomic layer deposition (ALD) approach, consisting of half-reactions of the substrate with the precursor SiH2((NHBu)-Bu-t)(2) and with N-2-fed plasma. The deposited films have been characterized in terms of their refractive index and chemical composition by spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The SiNx thin-film refractive index ranges from 1.80 to 1.90 for films deposited at 80 degrees C up to 200 degrees C, respectively, and the C, O, and H impurity levels decrease when the deposition temperature increases. The relative open porosity content of the layers has been studied by means of multisolvent ellipsometric porosimetry (EP), adopting three solvents with different kinetic diameters: water (similar to 0.3 nm), ethanol (similar to 0.4 nm), and toluene (similar to 0.6 nm). Irrespective of the deposition temperature, and hence the impurity content in the SiNx films, no uptake of any adsorptive has been observed, pointing to the absence of open pores larger than 0.3 nm in diameter. Instead, multilayer development has been observed, leading to type II isotherms that, according to the IUPAC classification, are characteristic of nonporous layers. The calcium test has been performed in a climate chamber at 20 degrees C and 50% relative humidity to determine the intrinsic water vapor transmission rate (WVTR) of SiNx barriers deposited at 120 degrees C. Intrinsic WVTR values in the range of 10(-6) g/m(2)/day indicate excellent barrier properties for ALD SiNx layers as thin as 10 nm, competing with that of state-of-the-art plasma-enhanced chemical vapor-deposited SiNx layers of a few hundred nanometers in thickness.","[Andringa, Anne-Marije; Perrotta, Alberto; de Peuter, Koen; Knoops, Harm C.

They play a vital role in the global carbon cycle by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating the impacts of climate change. However, there has been a large reduction in the global BC ecosystems due to their conversion to agriculture and aquaculture, overexploitation, and removal for human settlements. Effectively monitoring BC ecosystems at large scales remains a challenge owing to practical difficulties in monitoring and the time-consuming field measurement approaches used. As a result, sensible policies and actions for the sustainability and conservation of BC ecosystems can be hard to implement. In this context, remote sensing provides a useful tool for mapping and monitoring BC ecosystems faster and at larger scales. Numerous studies have been carried out on various sensors based on optical imagery, synthetic aperture radar (SAR), light detection and ranging (LiDAR), aerial photographs (APs), and multispectral data. Remote sensing-based approaches have been proven effective for mapping and monitoring BC ecosystems by a large number of studies. However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive review on the applications of remote sensing techniques for mapping and monitoring BC ecosystems. The main goal of this review is to provide an overview and summary of the key studies undertaken from 2010 onwards on remote sensing applications for mapping and monitoring BC ecosystems. Our review showed that optical imagery, such as multispectral and hyper-spectral data, is the most common for mapping BC ecosystems, while the Landsat time-series are the most widely-used data for monitoring their changes on larger scales. We investigate the limitations of current studies and suggest several key aspects for future applications of remote sensing combined with state-of-the-art machine learning techniques for mapping coastal vegetation and monitoring their extents and changes.","[Tien Dat Pham; Xia, Junshi] RIKEN, Geoinformat Unit, Ctr Adv Intelligence Project AIP, Chuo Ku, Mitsui Bldg,15th Floor,1-4-1 Nihonbashi, Tokyo 1030027, Japan; [Nam Thang Ha] Univ Waikato, Environm Res Inst, Sch Sci, Hamilton 3240, New Zealand; [Nam Thang Ha] Hue Univ Agr & Forestry, Fac Fisheries, Hue 49000, Vietnam; [Dieu Tien Bui] Univ South Eastern Norway, Geog Informat Syst Grp, Dept Business & IT, Gullbringvegen 36, N-3800 BoiTelemark, Norway; [Nga Nhu Le] VAST, Inst Mech, Dept Marine Mech & Environm, 264 Doi Can St, Hanoi 100000, Vietnam; [Takeuchi, Wataru] Univ Tokyo, Inst Ind Sci, Meguro Ku, 4-6-1 Komaba, Tokyo 1538505, Japan",RIKEN; University of Waikato; Hue University; Vietnam Academy of Science & Technology (VAST); University of Tokyo,"Pham, TD (corresponding author), RIKEN, Geoinformat Unit, Ctr Adv Intelligence Project AIP, Chuo Ku, Mitsui Bldg,15th Floor,1-4-1 Nihonbashi, Tokyo 1030027, Japan.",tiendat.pham@riken.jp; junshi.xia@riken.jp; hanamthang@huaf.edu.vn; dieu.t.bui@usn.no; lenhunga70@gmail.com; wataru@iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Pham, Tien Dat/N-9821-2017; Tien Bui, Dieu/K-2125-2012","Pham, Tien Dat/0000-0002-6422-2847; Tien Bui, Dieu/0000-0001-5161-6479; Thang, Ha/0000-0002-4661-8602; nhu Le, Nga/0000-0001-5845-5233; Takeuchi, Wataru/0000-0002-9138-6601","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [KAKENHI 19K20309]; RIKEN Center for Advanced Intelligent Project (AIP), Japan","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); RIKEN Center for Advanced Intelligent Project (AIP), Japan","This research was funded by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (KAKENHI 19K20309).

However, especially the high vapor pressure of C-3 hydrocarbons can result in hot fuel handling issues as evaporation or even in reaching the supercritical state of LPG upstream or inside the high pressure pump (HPP). This is particularly critical under hot soak conditions. As a result of a rapid fuel density drop close to the supercritical point, the HPP is not able to keep the rail pressure constant and the engine stalls. Thus, in order to enable wider use of LPG and to assist the process of standardization, a limitation for maximum content of C-3 fuel components - as propane and propene - is required as a key enabler for LPG DI applications. In order to determine a maximum C-3 limit, hot idle investigations were performed on a modern turbocharged 4-cylinder direct injection spark ignition (DI SI) engine operated in a climate cham. Furthermore, stationary idle tests were carried out on a single cylinder engine with four different LPG fuels, all in accordance with EN 589. The experimental investigations indicate a maximum content of 70 % (m/m) C-3 fuel components as an upper limit for an LPG DI injection concept, when a HPP, which is based on state-of-the-art HPP technology for gasoline engines, is used. For a maximum propane content of 70 % (m/m), pump functionality can be maintained with a fuel pressure of approximately 45 bar upstream the HPP at fuel temperatures of about 110 degrees C during hot idle. For lower pressures upstream the HPP, cooling measures need to be implemented.","[Krieck, Martin; Guenther, Marco; Pischinger, Stefan] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, VKA, Aachen, Germany; [Kramer, Ulrich] Ford Werke GmbH, Cologne, Germany; [Heinze, Thomas] Saarland Univ Appl Sci, IAP, Saarbrucken, Germany; [Thewes, Matthias] FEV GmbH, Aachen, Germany",RWTH Aachen University; Ford Motor Company,"Krieck, M (corresponding author), Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, VKA, Aachen, Germany.",Krieck@vka.rwth-aachen.de,,,,,,,25,2,2,0,2,SAE INT,WARRENDALE,"400 COMMONWEALTH DR, WARRENDALE, PA 15096 USA",1946-3952,1946-3960,,SAE INT J FUELS LUBR,SAE Int.

The real scenario is composed of a real basket and a stick - both of the equipment is the actual ones used in daily training. Both, equipment are tracked by high precision infrared cameras system (OptiTrack) providing a high degree of immersion and realism. In addition to tracking the scenario, the user is completely tracked: heads, shoulders, arms and hands are tracked. This tracking allows a perfect simulation of the participant's movements in the Virtual World. This allows precise evaluation of movements as well as ergonomics. The virtual scenario was carefully designed to accurately reproduce in a coherent way all relevant spatial, architectonic and natural features typical of the urban environment, reflecting the variety of challenges that real cities might impose on the activity. The system consists of two modules: the first module being Instructor Interface, which will help create and control different challenging scenarios and follow the student's reactions and behavior; and the second module is the simulator itself, which will be presented to the student through VR goggles. The training session can also be viewed on a projected screen by other students, enabling learning through observation of mistakes and successes of their peers, such as a martial arts dojo.

LAI(max) represents a surrogate for overall site growth potential, as demonstrated from a strong correlation between the two variables, with the latter based on the culmination of mean annual increment estimates made at 3356 ground-based U.S. Forest Service survey plots across the states of Oregon and Washington. Results indicate that since 2000, predicted LAI(max) has decreased more than 20% in portions of the Southwest USA and for much of the forested area in western Alberta. Similar percentage increases in LAI(max) were predicted for parts of British Columbia, Idaho and Montana. The modeling analysis included an assessment of changes in seasonal constraints on gross primary production (GPP).

The effects of the ecosystem deterioration impacts directly to human activities. In this scenario, the building industry has increased the pressure on proposing new materials to replace the cementicious component and natural resources (water, sand, gravel, and limestone) on mortar and concrete to reverse this trend. To this end, organic residues can offer opportunities as an available alternative for construction applications. Therefore, this paper aims to broaden the scope of research in this field by investigating the potential use of organic residues as cementicious building material based on bibliometric-statistical analysis using scientific information. A preliminary bibliometric analysis using VOSviewer was carried out to define the keywords co-ocurrence from Scopus database. Type of organic material, constructive use, and its properties (physicochemical, mechanical, and thermal) were extracted from scientific publications. Then, a systematic analysis criteria was defined to limit the scope of the study. Finally, statistical variance analysis and multiple correlation for identifying constructive application were applied. From the co-ocurrence analysis of keywords, we determined that 54% of the selected scientific publications were closely related to the scope of this study. State-of-the-art study established that related researches grew exponentially at a rate of about 30%/year. Moreover, scientific publications reported the use of a wide variety of organic residues, such as wheat, paper, hemp, rice, wood, molluscs, olive, coconut, among others. Mainly, agricultural residues (82%) with building applications related to structural concrete, mortar, bricks, and blocks, had been evaluated. Physicochemical properties from organic residues (extractives content, lignin content, and density) were correlated to mechanical (compressive, flexural and tensile strength) and thermal properties (thermal conductivity). The identification of the physicochemical properties of the organic residues allow us to predict the mechanical and thermal behavior of the material with residues. In summary, agricultural residues are the most promising organic building material due to their abundance and lignin content, exhibiting better mechanic and thermal properties than any other organic residues.","[Yanez, Sergio; Marquez, Constanza; Valenzuela, Benjamin; Villamar-Ayala, Cristina Alejandra] Univ Santiago Chile, Dept Civil Engn, Av Victor Jara 3659, Santiago 9170124, Chile",Universidad de Santiago de Chile,"Villamar-Ayala, CA (corresponding author), Univ Santiago Chile, Dept Civil Engn, Av Victor Jara 3659, Santiago 9170124, Chile.",sergio.yanez.c@usach.cl; constanza.marquez@usach.cl; benjamin.valenzuela.d@usach.cl; cristina.villamar@usach.cl,,"Yanez, Sergio/0000-0002-8856-0955; Marquez, Constanza/0000-0003-1797-5640; Villamar, Cristina Alejandra/0000-0003-4654-0670","Fondecyt [11190352]; Universidad de Santiago de Chile, Usach [DGT-TR2007]; Universidad de Santiago de Chile, Usach, through project DICYT [052018YC]","Fondecyt(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT); Universidad de Santiago de Chile, Usach; Universidad de Santiago de Chile, Usach, through project DICYT","S.Y. acknowledges the financial support from Universidad de Santiago de Chile, Usach, through project DICYT Nffi 052018YC, Direccion de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica, Dicyt.

Numerous data in these disciplines are sequence of observations measured as functions of time, which can be further used for different applications via analytical or data analytics techniques (e.g., to forecast future price, climate change, etc.). However, presence of outliers can cause significant uncertainties to interpretation results; hence, it is essential to remove the outliers accurately and efficiently before conducting any further analysis. A total of 17 techniques that belong to statistical, regressionbased, and machine learning (ML) based categories for outlier detection in timeseries are applied to the oil and gas production data analysis. 15 of these methods are utilized for production data analysis for the first time. Two state-of-the-art and high-performance techniques are then selected for data cleaning which require minimum control and time complexity. Moreover, performances of these techniques are evaluated based on several metrics including the accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and Cohen's Kappa to rank the techniques. Results show that eight unsupervised algorithms outperform the rest of the methods based on the synthetic case study with known outliers. For example, accuracies of the eight shortlisted methods are in the range of 0.83-0.99 with a precision between 0.83 and 0.98, compared to 0.65-0.82 and 0.07-0.77 for the others. In addition, ML-based techniques perform better than statistical techniques. Our experimental results on real field data further indicate that the knearest neighbor (KNN) and Fulford-Blasingame methods are superior to other outlier detection frameworks for outlier detection in production data, followed by four others including density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN), and angle-based outlier detection (ABOD). Even though the techniques are examined with oil and gas production data, but the same data cleaning workflow can be used to detect timeseries' outliers in other disciplines.","[Alimohammadi, Hamzeh; Chen, Shengnan Nancy] Univ Calgary, Schulich Sch Engn, Dept Chem & Petr Engn, 2500 Univ Dr NW, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada",University of Calgary,"Chen, SN (corresponding author), Univ Calgary, Schulich Sch Engn, Dept Chem & Petr Engn, 2500 Univ Dr NW, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada.",hamzeh.alimohammadi@ucalgary.ca; snchen@ucalgary.ca,,,"Office of Energy Research and Development, Natural Resource of Canada","Office of Energy Research and Development, Natural Resource of Canada","The authors wish to acknowledge the Office of Energy Research and Development, Natural Resource of Canada, for supporting the work.

In many of these applications, the samples are fragile, unique or available in limited quantities, and have to be subsequently studied by additional techniques, implying that sample preservation is important. Established light scattering single particle measurements involve attaching the sample to a holder or measuring a laminar flow of particles, neither of which allows a controlled, unperturbed non-destructive measurement. Acoustic levitation is a state-of-the-art and non-contacting approach capable of assisting light scattering measurements. However, a full 4 pi measurement (i.e., a measurement from any direction on the full 4 pi solid angle) has hither been impossible due to levitation instabilities. Here we present and describe the instrument capable of performing a full 4 pi light scattering measurement. We measure light scattering properties of millimeter-sized samples at any direction. This is enabled by introducing a novel non-contacting sample holder based on acoustic levitation, which allows a disturbance-free measurement of an orientation-controlled sample. The instrument is scalable and currently employs polarized visible light (400-700 nm). It also measures beam and sample stability as well as temperature and humidity, to ensure consistency of measurements. We demonstrate the 4 pi capabilities of the instrument by measuring an angular map of light scattering from a polystyrene foam sample, as well as a multi-angular measurement (two semicircular measurements 90 degrees apart) of a sample consisting of agglomerated 500 nm silica spheres. The upper left 2 x 2 submatrix of the Mueller matrix is measured from the sample along the (polar) scattering angle in semicircular sweeps, changing the azimuthal scattering angle for each sweep. Our results allow for verification of theoretical models by mimicking the conditions of the simulations and by making the measurements directly comparable to model predictions. (C) 2020 The Authors.

This slow growth can be attributed to two factors; firstly, the lack of understanding of coastal processes and design fundamentals by the larger geosyntheticcommunity in order to provide coastal engineers with suitable solutions, and secondly; there has been very little rigorous scientific wave flume testing with which to analyse the wave stability of geotextile sand containers. The application of geotextile containers in coastal protection works can be traced back to early works carried out in 1970s. The application of these types of structures was somewhat haphazard as very little was understood about the wave stability and durability of the structures. Early wave stability work was carried out Ray (1977) and Jacobs (1983) with small containers, however, the testing programs were limited and did not provide sufficient confidence in the product to carry out exhaustive engineering design. As a result, the technology until recently has relied on manufacturers' design suggestions based on monitoring of actual structures. Over the past five years, coastal population pressure, extreme events and concerns over climate change and sea level rise have resulted in more emphasis being placed on shoreline protection systems. Geotextile manufacturers have responded to the challenges put forward by design engineers and intensive research has been carried out in the field. This paper outlines the current state of the art in terms of the design and specification of geotextile sand containers (GSC). This paper covers the key issues which will ensure the long term integrity of a geotextile shoreline protection system is maintained, these issues include: Container stability; Detailed analysis of recent large scale wave flume testing which assess filling capacity, size of container, structure slope and scour protection etc.; Container/geotextile durability; Methods and specifications used to limit the effects of the fundamental factors affecting the life span of geotextile containers such as vandal resistance, LW degradation and abrasion resistance etc. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

U.S. Air Force is particularly active in this effort while the entire military is involved in simultaneously developing fuel specifications for alternative fuels that enable a single fuel for the entire battle space; all ground vehicles, aircraft and fuel cells. By limiting its focus on coal, tar sands and oil shale resources, the military risks violating federal law which requires the use of synfuels that have lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions less than or equal to emissions from conventional petroleum fuels. A climate-friendly option would use a high temperature nuclear reactor to split water. The hydrogen (H-2) Would be used in the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) to react with carbon dioxide (CO2) to produce carbon monoxide (CO) and water. The oxygen (O-2) Would be fed into a supercritical (SC) coal furnace. The flue gas CO2 emissions would be stripped of impurities before reacting with H-2 in a RWGS process. Resultant carbon monoxide (CO) is fed, with additional H-2, (extra H-2 needed to adjust the stoichiometry: 2 moles H-2 to one mole CO) into a conventional Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) to produce a heavy wax which is cracked and isomerized and refined to Jet Propulsion 8 (JP-8) and Jet Propulsion 5 (JP-5) fuels. The entire process offers valuable carbon-offsets and multiple products that contribute to lower synfuel costs and to comply with the federal limitation imposed on synfuel purchases. While the entire process is not commercially available, component parts are being researched; their physical and chemical properties understood and some are state-of-the-art technologies. An international consortium should complete physical, chemical and economic flow sheets to determine the feasibility of this concept that, if pursued, has broad applications to military and civilian aviation fleets and freight-hauling diesel engines.","Energy Policy Ctr, Alexandria, VA USA",,"McCormick, JL (corresponding author), Energy Policy Ctr, 7818 Friars Court, Alexandria, VA USA.",Johnmcc793@aol.com,,,,,,,25,0,0,0,9,AMER SOC MECHANICAL ENGINEERS,NEW YORK,"THREE PARK AVENUE, NEW YORK, NY 10016-5990 USA",,,978-0-7918-4855-5,,,,2009,,,,,579,588,,,,,,10,"Engineering, Mechanical; Physics, Nuclear",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Engineering; Physics,BJI55,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000266155300068,View Full Record in Web of Science

By battery systems grid efficiency and reliability as well as power quality can be increased. A further characteristic of battery systems is the ability to respond rapidly and precisely to frequency deviations, making them technical ideal candidates for primary control provision (PCP). PCP by battery systems is applied in form of positive (discharge mode) and negative control (charge mode) and can reduce must-run capacity of fossil power plants. In this study environmental impacts of PCP by novelLi-ion large-scale battery energy storage systems (BESSs) are compared to impacts of PCP by state-of-the-art coal power plants (CPPs) using a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approach. An inventory of all relevant inputs (resources, material and energy flows) and outputs (emissions, wastes and waste water) is compiled. Environmental impacts associated with these inputs and outputs are evaluated. Finally, PCP by BESSs and fossil power plants are compared in terms of environmental performance.

Though snow depth can be markedly different from one season to another there are strong repeated relationships between ecotype and snowpack depth. In the diverse vegetative cover of the boreal forest of Interior Alaska, a warming climate has shortened the winter season. Alterations to the seasonal snowpack, which plays a critical role in regulating wintertime soil thermal conditions, have major ramifications for near-surface permafrost. Therefore, relationships between vegetation and snowpack depth are critical for identifying how present and projected future changes in winter season processes or land cover will affect permafrost. Vegetation and snow cover areal extent can be assessed rapidly over large spatial scales with remote sensing methods, however, measuring snow depth remotely has proven difficult. This makes snow depth-vegetation relationships a potential means of assessing snowpack characteristics. In this study, we combined airborne hyperspectral and LiDAR data with machine learning methods to characterize relationships between ecotype and the end of winter snowpack depth. More than 26 000 snow depth measurements were collected between 2014 and 2019 at three field sites representing common boreal ecoregion land cover types. Our results show hyperspectral measurements account for two thirds or more of the variance in the relationship between ecotype and snow depth. Of the three modeling approaches we used, support vector machine yields slightly stronger statistical correlations between snowpack depth and ecotype for most winters. An ensemble analysis of model outputs using hyperspectral and LiDAR measurements yields the strongest relationships between ecotype and snow depth. Our results can be applied across the boreal biome to model the coupling effects between vegetation and snowpack depth.","[Douglas, Thomas A.] US Army Cold Reg Res & Engn Lab, Ft Wainwright, AK 99703 USA; [Zhang, Caiyun] Florida Atlantic Univ, Dept Geosci, Boca Raton, FL 33431 USA",United States Department of Defense; United States Army; U.S. Army Corps of Engineers; U.S. Army Engineer Research & Development Center (ERDC); Cold Regions Research & Engineering Laboratory (CRREL); State University System of Florida; Florida Atlantic University,"Douglas, TA (corresponding author), US Army Cold Reg Res & Engn Lab, Ft Wainwright, AK 99703 USA.",thomas.a.douglas@usace.army.mil,,,U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center Army Basic Research Program [PE 0601102/AB2]; Department of Defense's Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program [RC18-1170],U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center Army Basic Research Program; Department of Defense's Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program,"This research was funded by the U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center Army Basic Research Program under PE 0601102/AB2 (Protection, Maneuver, Geospatial, Natural Sciences) and the Department of Defense's Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (Project RC18-1170).

Drought stress is induced when a plant's water demand is not met with its water supply through root water uptake. The latter depends on root and soil properties, including soil texture (i.e. the soil clay and sand fractions) that determines the soil water availability and its hydraulic properties. Hence, soil clay content is responsible for a significant fraction of the spatial variability in forest structure and productivity. Soil-textural properties largely vary at the spatial resolution used by Terrestrial Biosphere Models (TBMs) and it is currently unclear how this variability affects the outputs of these models used to predict the response of vegetation ecosystems to future climate change scenarios. In this study, we assessed the sensitivity of the carbon cycle of three state-of-the-art TBMs, i.e. ORganizing Carbon and Hydrology in Dynamic EcosystEms (ORCHIDEEv2.2), Ecosystem Demography model version 2 (ED2), and Lund-Potsdam-Jena General Ecosystem Simulator (LPJ-GUESS) to soil-textural properties at the regional level over the South American tropics using model default pedotransfer functions. For all three TBMs, the model outputs, including gross primary productivity (GPP), aboveground biomass (AGB), soil carbon content and drought stress, were shown to be mostly insensitive to soil-texture changes representative of the spatial variability in soil properties, except for a small region characterised by very low water availability in ORCHIDEEv2.2 and ED2. We argue that generic pedotransfer and simple drought stress functions, as currently implemented in TBMs, should be reconsidered to better capture the role of soil texture and its coupling to plant processes. Similarly, we suggest that better estimates of the soil-texture uncertainty resulting from soil-texture data aggregate should be considered in the future. Those steps forward are critical to properly account for future increasing drought stress conditions in tropical regions.","[Meunier, Felicien; Verbruggen, Wim; Verbeeck, Hans; Peaucelle, Marc] Univ Ghent, Dept Environm, Computat & Appl Vegetat Ecol, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Verbruggen, Wim] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Geosci & Nat Resource Management, DK-1350 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Peaucelle, Marc] Univ Bordeaux, INRAE, UMR ISPA 1391, F-33140 Villenave Dornon, France",Ghent University; University of Copenhagen; INRAE; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite de Bordeaux,"Meunier, F (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Dept Environm, Computat & Appl Vegetat Ecol, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",felicien.meunier@ugent.be,,"Verbruggen, Wim/0000-0002-3611-6561; Meunier, Felicien/0000-0003-2486-309X; Peaucelle, Marc/0000-0003-0324-4628",Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek [G018319N]; Research Foundation -Flanders (FWO); Flemish Government -department EWI; GENCI-TGCC [A0110106328]; FWO [1214720N]; ArboreSens (Dryland woody vegetation sensitivity to soil texture and precipitation variability) dissemination and support project (BELSPO STEREO III) [SR/02/209]; H2020 Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions [891369]; European Research Council [637643],Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek(FWO); Research Foundation -Flanders (FWO)(FWO); Flemish Government -department EWI; GENCI-TGCC; FWO(FWO); ArboreSens (Dryland woody vegetation sensitivity to soil texture and precipitation variability) dissemination and support project (BELSPO STEREO III); H2020 Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions; European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)European Commission),"This research was funded by the Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek (FWO grant no.

El Nino events have been shown to have important influences on meteorological conditions in China. In this study, the impacts of El Nino with different durations on aerosol concentrations and haze days during December-January-February (DJF) in China are quantitatively examined using the state-of-the-art Energy Exascale Earth System Model version 1 (E3SMv1). We find that PM2.5 concentrations are increased by 1-2 mu gm(-3) in northeastern and southern China and decreased by up to 2.4 mu gm(-3) in central-eastern China during El Nino events relative to the climatological means. Compared to long-duration (LD) El Nino events, El Nino with short duration (SD) but strong intensity causes northerly wind anomalies over central-eastern China, which is favorable for aerosol dispersion over this region. Moreover, the anomalous southeasterly winds weaken the wintertime prevailing northwesterly in northeastern China and facilitate aerosol transport from southern and southeast Asia, enhancing aerosol increase in northeastern China during SD El Nino events relative to LD El Nino events. In addition, the modulation effect on haze days by SD El Nino events is 2-3 times more than that by LD El Nino events in China. The aerosol variations during El Nino events are mainly controlled by anomalous aerosol accumulation/dispersion and transport due to changes in atmospheric circulation, while El Nino-induced precipitation change has little effect. The occurrence frequency of SD El Nino events has been increasing significantly in recent decades, especially after the 1940s, suggesting that El Nino with short duration has exerted an increasingly intense modulation on aerosol pollution in China over the past few decades.","[Zeng, Liangying; Yang, Yang; Ren, Lili; Li, Huimin; Zhou, Yang; Wang, Pinya; Liao, Hong] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Jiangsu Key Lab Atmospher Environm Monitoring & P, Jiangsu Collaborat Innovat Ctr Atmospher Environm, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Wang, Hailong] Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Atmospher Sci & Global Change Div, Richland, WA 99352 USA; [Wang, Jing] Tianjin Inst Meteorol Sci, Tianjin Key Lab Ocean Meteorol, Tianjin, Peoples R China; [Li, Jing] Peking Univ, Sch Phys, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China",Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Pacific Northwest National Laboratory; Peking University,"Yang, Y (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Jiangsu Key Lab Atmospher Environm Monitoring & P, Jiangsu Collaborat Innovat Ctr Atmospher Environm, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",yang.yang@nuist.edu.cn,"曾, 靓莹/AAZ-1968-2021; Yang, Yang/AFP-4916-2022; Wang, Hailong/AAM-1464-2021; Liao, Hong/T-7963-2017; Li, Jing/J-2397-2014","Wang, Hailong/0000-0002-1994-4402; Liao, Hong/0000-0002-9315-4839; Li, Jing/0000-0002-0540-0412","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41975159]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2020YFA0607803, 2019YFA0606800]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key Research and Development Program of China,This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant no. 41975159) and the National Key Research and Development Program of China (grant nos. 2020YFA0607803 and 2019YFA0606800).,,55,8,8,8,27,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1680-7316,1680-7324,,ATMOS CHEM PHYS,Atmos.

The interaction of fluorescence with photochemistry at the leaf and canopy scales provides opportunities to diagnose and constrain model simulations of photosynthesis and related processes, through direct comparison to and assimilation of tower, airborne, and satellite data. TBMs describe key processes related to the absorption of sunlight, leaf-level fluorescence emission, scattering, and reabsorption throughout the canopy. Here, we analyze simulations from an ensemble of process-based TBM-SIF models (SiB3 - Simple Bio-sphere Model, SiB4, CLM4.5 - Community Land Model, CLM5.0, BETHY - Biosphere Energy Transfer Hydrology, ORCHIDEE - Organizing Carbon and Hydrology In Dynamic Ecosystems, and BEPS - Boreal Ecosystems Productivity Simulator) and the SCOPE (Soil Canopy Observation Photosynthesis Energy) canopy radiation and vegetation model at a subalpine evergreen needleleaf forest near Niwot Ridge, Colorado. These models are forced with local meteorology and analyzed against tower-based continuous far-red SIF and gross-primary-productivity-partitioned (GPP) eddy covariance data at diurnal and synoptic scales during the growing season (July-August 2017). Our primary objective is to summarize the site-level state of the art in TBM-SIF modeling over a relatively short time period (summer) when light, canopy structure, and pigments are similar, setting the stage for regional- to global-scale analyses. We find that these models are generally well constrained in simulating photosynthetic yield but show strongly divergent patterns in the simulation of absorbed photosynthetic active radiation (PAR), absolute GPP and fluorescence, quantum yields, and light response at the leaf and canopy scales. This study highlights the need for mechanistic modeling of non-photochemical quenching in stressed and unstressed environments and improved the representation of light absorption (APAR), distribution of light across sunlit and shaded leaves, and radiative transfer from the leaf to the canopy scale.","[Parazoo, Nicholas C.; Norton, Alex; Frankenberg, Christian] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Magney, Troy] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Plant Sci, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Raczka, Brett; Bowling, Dave R.] Univ Utah, Sch Biol Sci, Salt Lake City, UT USA; [Bacour, Cedric] NOVELTIS, 153 Rue Lac, F-31670 Labege, France; [Maignan, Fabienne] Univ Paris Saclay, Lab Sci Climat & Environm, LSCE IPSL, CEA CNRS UVSQ, Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Baker, Ian] Colorado State Univ, Cooperat Inst Res Atmosphere, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Zhang, Yongguang; Qiu, Bo] Nanjing Univ, Int Inst Earth Syst Sci, Qixia Dist, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Shi, Mingjie] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Joint Inst Reg Earth Syst Sci & Engn, Los Angeles, CA USA; [MacBean, Natasha] Indiana Univ, Dept Geog, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Burns, Sean P.; Blanken, Peter D.] Univ Colorado, Dept Geog, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Burns, Sean P.] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Mesoscale & Microscale Meteorol Lab, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [Stutz, Jochen] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Grossmann, Katja] Heidelberg Univ, Inst Environm Phys, Heidelberg, Germany; [Frankenberg, Christian] CALTECH, Div Geol & Planetary Sci, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA",California Institute of Technology; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL); University of California System; University of California Davis; Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; CEA; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Colorado State University; Nanjing University; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg; California Institute of Technology,"Parazoo, NC (corresponding author), CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",nicholas.c.parazoo@jpl.nasa.gov,"OCO, OCO/GVS-4314-2022; Stutz, Jochen/K-7159-2014; Maignan, Fabienne/F-5419-2013; Frankenberg, Christian/A-2944-2013","Maignan, Fabienne/0000-0001-5024-5928; Frankenberg, Christian/0000-0002-0546-5857; Zhang, Yongguang/0000-0001-8286-300X; Norton, Alexander/0000-0001-7708-3914; Bacour, Cedric/0000-0002-1913-3722; Shi, Mingjie/0000-0002-2469-4831",NASA [18-TE18-0062],NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)),This research has been supported by the NASA (grant no. 18-TE18-0062).,,84,16,16,0,22,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1726-4170,1726-4189,,BIOGEOSCIENCES,Biogeosciences,16-Jul,2020,13,,,,3733,3755,,10.5194/bg-17-3733-2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-3733-2020,,,23,"Ecology; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology,MO4OG,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000551506900002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Silicates are more soluble and generally more susceptible to weathering than the refractory mineral chromite, the principal ore mineral of Cr. Studies at the nanoscale using a combination of advanced sample preparation via microtoming and focused ion beam techniques, in combination with state-of-the art analytical transmission electron microscopy and electron diffraction, reveal the occurrence of chromite nanoparticles held within clinochlore and lizardite grains in chromitite ore (an igneous cumulate consisting primarily of chromite) from the Black Thor Chromium deposit in Northern Ontario, Canada, and the Mistake Mine, Fresno County, California, U.S.A., respectively. Nanoscale examinations of altered chromitite ore samples from the Black Thor deposit after dissolution experiments in sulfuric acid-bearing solutions of pH 2.5 show that clinochlore alters to amorphous silica depleted in chromite nanoparticles. This observation suggests the release of chromite nanoparticles rather than Cr3+ aqueous species during the weathering of chromite-bearing silicate minerals. This will in turn have an impact on the environmental behavior of Cr3+ and its potential oxidation to Cr6+. The formation of Cr-aq(6+) species in this case will require either the initial dissolution of the nanoparticles or the oxidation of Cr3+ species on the surface of the nanoparticles, either process being a rate limiting step in the formation of Cr-aq(6+) species.","[Schindler, Michael] Laurentian Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Sudbury, ON P3E 2C6, Canada; [Berti, Debora] Virginia Tech, Inst Crit Technol & Appl Sci, NanoEarth, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Hochella, Michael F., Jr.] Virginia Tech, Dept Geosci, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Hochella, Michael F., Jr.] Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Geosci Grp, Richland, WA 99352 USA",Laurentian University; Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University; Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Pacific Northwest National Laboratory,"Schindler, M (corresponding author), Laurentian Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Sudbury, ON P3E 2C6, Canada.",mschindler@laurentian.ca,,"Berti, Debora/0000-0003-1123-7794",Ministry of Environment and Climate Change of Ontario; Virginia Tech National Center for Earth and Environmental Nanotechnology Infrastructure (NanoEarth); NSF [ECCS 1542100],Ministry of Environment and Climate Change of Ontario; Virginia Tech National Center for Earth and Environmental Nanotechnology Infrastructure (NanoEarth); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This work was supported by a Best of Science Award from the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change of Ontario to M.S., as well as by the Virginia Tech National Center for Earth and Environmental Nanotechnology Infrastructure (NanoEarth), a member of the National Nanotechnology Coordinated Infrastructure (NNCI) funded by NSF (ECCS 1542100).

Given their higher susceptibility to the effects of air pollutants, as compared to older children and adults, indoor air quality (IAQ) is regarded as an essential parameter to monitor in DCCs. Recent advances in IAQ monitoring technologies have enabled the deployment of low-cost air quality monitors (LCMs) and single sensors (LCSs) to continuously monitor various indoor environments, and their performance testing should also be performed in the intended indoor applications. To our knowledge, there is no study evaluating the application of LCMs/LCSs in DCCs scenarios yet. Therefore, this study is aimed to assess the response of five types of LCMs (previously not tested) and five LCSs to typical DCCs emission activities in detecting multiple IAQ parameters, i.e., particulate matter, carbon dioxide, total volatile organic compounds, temperature, and relative humidity. These LCMs/LCSs were compared to outcomes from research-grade instruments (RGIs). All the experiments were performed in a climate chamber, where three kinds of typical activities (background; arts-and-crafts; cleaning; [in a total of 32 events]) were simulated by recruited subjects at two typical indoor climatic conditions (cool and dry [20 +/- 1 degrees C & 40 +/- 10%], warm and humid [26 +/- 1 degrees C & 70 +/- 5%]). Results showed that tested LCMs had the ability to capture DCCs activities by simultaneously monitoring multiple IAQ parameters, and LCMs/LCSs revealed a strong correlation with RGIs in most events (R-2 values from 0.7 to 1), but, for some events, the magnitude of responses varied widely. Sensirion SCD41, an emerging CO2 sensor built on the photoacoustic sensing principle, had a more accurate performance than all tested NDIR-based CO2 sensors/monitors. In general, the study implies that the selection of LCMs/LCSs for a specific application of interest should be based on emission characteristics and space conditions.","[Zheng, Hailin; Krishnan, Vinayak; Walker, Shalika; Loomans, Marcel; Zeiler, Wim] Eindhoven Univ Technol, Dept Built Environm, Eindhoven, Netherlands",Eindhoven University of Technology,"Zheng, HL (corresponding author), Eindhoven Univ Technol, Dept Built Environm, Eindhoven, Netherlands.",h.zheng1@tue.nl,,,,,,,109,0,0,13,13,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0160-4120,1873-6750,,ENVIRON INT,Environ.

However, more than half of these forests have been lost since 1990 due to the rapid expansion of drainage-based agriculture and forestry. Within the oil palm sector, the number of regional smallholder oil palm plantings on peat soils has risen quickly. These activities are challenging to govern and manage, due to their fragmented nature and the numerous farmers involved. It is imperative to understand the spatial distribution and drivers of the smallholder oil palm-related conversion of peat swamp forests. In contrast to existing studies based on farm surveys, we used state-of-art maps of smallholder oil palm plantings, derived from 2019 remote sensing data. Spatial data about socioeconomic and biophysical factors (e.g. mills, roads, water ways, and concessions) was then used to develop logistic regression models to investigate the relative influence of these factors. We show that the spatial patterns of smallholder oil palm plantings are distinct from those of industrial oil palm plantations, revealing the critical roles of roads, especially service roads, residential roads and tracks, in driving smallholder oil palm expansion within peatlands. We found that 90% of smallholder oil palm areas were located within 2 km of roads and 25 km of mills. The mean likelihood of a given land area being converted from peat swamp forests to smallholder oil palm declined rapidly with increasing distance from roads and mills. In addition to roads and mills, land use zones (e.g. the setting of concessions and migration settlements) and other environmental factors (e.g. precipitation and elevation) were identified as important drivers of smallholder oil palm expansion on peatland. Based on these findings, we identify priority regions for the protection of the remaining peat swamp forests in Indonesia and discuss strategies for tackling these sustainability challenges on local and global scales.","[Zhao, Jing; Elmore, Andrew J.; Numata, Izaya; Zhang, Xin; Cochrane, Mark A.] Univ Maryland, Appalachian Lab, Ctr Environm Sci, Frostburg, MD 21532 USA; [Lee, Janice Ser Huay; Fatimah, Yuti Ariani] Nanyang Technol Univ Singapore, Asian Sch Environm, Singapore, Singapore; [Lee, Janice Ser Huay] Nanyang Technol Univ Singapore, Earth Observ Singapore, Singapore, Singapore; [Elmore, Andrew J.] Natl Socioenvironm Synth Ctr SESYNC, Annapolis, MD USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science; Nanyang Technological University & National Institute of Education (NIE) Singapore; Nanyang Technological University; Nanyang Technological University & National Institute of Education (NIE) Singapore; Nanyang Technological University,"Zhang, X; Cochrane, MA (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Appalachian Lab, Ctr Environm Sci, Frostburg, MD 21532 USA.",xin.zhang@umces.edu; mark.cochrane@umuces.edu,"Elmore, Andrew James/D-4341-2012; Cochrane, Mark A/A-1735-2018; Zhang, Xin/K-8264-2016; Zhang, Xin/AGA-7371-2022","Elmore, Andrew James/0000-0002-9697-9457; Cochrane, Mark A/0000-0002-4573-568X; Zhang, Xin/0000-0003-1619-1537; Zhang, Xin/0000-0003-1619-1537; Zhao, Jing/0000-0003-2212-7558",NASA LCLUC fund [80NSSC20K0365]; Singaporean Ministry of Education Academic Research Tier 2 Funds [MOE2018-T2-2-156(NS)],NASA LCLUC fund; Singaporean Ministry of Education Academic Research Tier 2 Funds,This project is supported by NASA LCLUC fund (80NSSC20K0365).

This lateral transport can be far from negligible for small sinking velocities. To estimate its magnitude and direction, the material is often modelled as a set of Lagrangian particles advected by current velocities that are obtained from Ocean General Circulation Models (OGCMs). State-of-the-art OGCMs are strongly eddying, similar to the real ocean, providing results with a spatial resolution on the order of 10 km on a daily frequency. While the importance of eddies in OGCMs is well-appreciated in the physical oceanographic community, other marine research communities may not. Further, many long term climate modelling simulations (e.g. in paleoclimate) rely on lower spatial resolution models that do not capture mesoscale features. To demonstrate how much the absence of mesoscale features in low-resolution models influences the Lagrangian particle transport, we simulate the transport of sinking Lagrangian particles using low- and high-resolution global OGCMs, and assess the lateral transport differences resulting from the difference in spatial and temporal model resolution. We find major differences between the transport in the non-eddying OGCM and in the eddying OGCM. Addition of stochastic noise to the particle trajectories in the non-eddying OGCM parameterises the effect of eddies well in some cases (e.g. in the North Pacific gyre). The effect of a coarser temporal resolution (once every 5 days versus monthly) is smaller compared to a coarser spatial resolution (0.1 degrees versus 1 degrees horizontally). We recommend to use sinking Lagrangian particles, representing e.g. marine snow, microplankton or sinking plastic, only with velocity fields from eddying Eulerian OGCMs, requiring high-resolution models in e.g. paleoceanographic studies. To increase the accessibility of our particle trace simulations, we launch planktondrift.science.uu.nl, an online tool to reconstruct the surface origin of sedimentary particles in a specific location.","[Nooteboom, Peter D.; Delandmeter, Philippe; van Sebille, Erik; Dijkstra, Henk A.; von der Heydt, Anna S.] Univ Utrecht, Inst Marine & Atmospher Res Utrecht IMAU, Dept Phys, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Nooteboom, Peter D.; van Sebille, Erik; Dijkstra, Henk A.; von der Heydt, Anna S.] Univ Utrecht, Ctr Complex Syst Studies, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Bijl, Peter K.] Univ Utrecht, Dept Earth Sci, Lab Paleobot & Palynol, Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University; Utrecht University; Utrecht University,"Nooteboom, PD (corresponding author), Univ Utrecht, Inst Marine & Atmospher Res Utrecht IMAU, Dept Phys, Utrecht, Netherlands.;Nooteboom, PD (corresponding author), Univ Utrecht, Ctr Complex Syst Studies, Utrecht, Netherlands.",p.d.nooteboom@uu.nl,"von der Heydt, Anna S/B-9250-2008","von der Heydt, Anna S/0000-0002-5557-3282; Nooteboom, Peter/0000-0003-3689-0845","Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO), Earth and Life Sciences [ALWOP.207]; NWO-EW (Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research, Exact Sciences) [17189]; European Research Council under the European Community's Seventh Framework Program by ERC [802835]; European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [715386]","Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO), Earth and Life Sciences(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)); NWO-EW (Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research, Exact Sciences); European Research Council under the European Community's Seventh Framework Program by ERC; European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme(European Research Council (ERC))","This work was funded by the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO), Earth and Life Sciences, through project ALWOP.207.

Captive assurance colonies have been established for some species at risk; however, many species do not breed well in captivity and the development of assisted reproductive technologies (ART) is critical to help sustain genetic diversity. To date, the majority of the work has been accomplished in species from the American continent and Australia, and there is a need to address similar breeding challenges in Eurasian and African species of amphibians.MethodsThe aim of this study was to develop a hormone protocol for stimulation of spermiation in Epidalea calamita as a model for Eurasian bufonids. Hence, the effect on sperm production and quality of three doses of chorionic gonadotropin hormone (5, 10 and 15IU hCG/g) over time (1 to 24h) was evaluated. In addition, cold storage (at 5 degrees C) of sperm for 24 and 48h and three frequencies for hormonal treatment (weekly, biweekly and monthly) were examined.ResultsHormone concentrations of 10 or 15IU of hCG induced spermiation in 100% of males and produced sperm of comparable quality, while 5IU hCG stimulated spermiation in only 40% of males. Total motility peaked between 1 to 4h post-treatment with 10IU hCG, whereas treatment with 15IU hCG peaked between 2 to 6h. After 24h of cold storage total motility dropped by 20% and forward motility dropped by 10% for both the 10 and 15IU treatments. Weekly hormone administration resulted in higher variation between trials in all motility parameters and a lower overall Total Motility and Forward Movement. Furthermore, the effect of exogenous hormone treatment overlapped between the last two trials in the weekly frequency. Sperm concentration was higher in the first trial for all frequencies but showed no differences among other trials.ConclusionsOverall, these results show that hormone concentration, time after treatment, frequency of hormone treatment and cold storage should be borne in mind when developing a hormone stimulation protocol for Eurasian amphibian species.","[Arregui, Lucia; Diaz-Diaz, Sergio; Alonso-Lopez, Elia] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Biol, C Darwin 2,Av Niceto Alcala Zamora 19,4 2, Madrid 28050, Spain; [Arregui, Lucia; Kouba, Andrew J.] Mississippi State Univ, Dept Wildlife Fisheries & Aquaculture, 775 Stone Blvd, Starkville, MS 39762 USA",Autonomous University of Madrid; Mississippi State University,"Arregui, L (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Biol, C Darwin 2,Av Niceto Alcala Zamora 19,4 2, Madrid 28050, Spain.;Arregui, L (corresponding author), Mississippi State Univ, Dept Wildlife Fisheries & Aquaculture, 775 Stone Blvd, Starkville, MS 39762 USA.",lucia.arregui@gmail.com,"Arregui, Lucia/C-2525-2013","Arregui, Lucia/0000-0002-4355-0155","CAN grant (2011) from the Memphis Zoo (Tennessee, USA)","CAN grant (2011) from the Memphis Zoo (Tennessee, USA)","This study was supported by a CAN grant (2011) from the Memphis Zoo (Tennessee, USA).|",,46,10,10,0,3,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,1477-7827,,REPROD BIOL ENDOCRIN,Reprod.

Here, we use state-of-the-art models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 to project the number of days with rainfall, the intensities and onset dates of rainfall events in the Arctic under the strong emission scenario (RCP8.5). The multi-model mean shows that rainfall will occur more frequently in the Arctic at the end of this century (2091-2100), with larger increase in the rainy days over the Pacific and Atlantic sectors (up to 12 days/month) during the cold seasons (October-May) and over the Arctic Ocean (up to 14 days/month) during the warm seasons (June-September) as compared with the present day (2006-2015). Greater uncertainty is found in the cold seasons, which mainly comes from the high variability among different models in the Norwegian Sea. Sixty-seven to ninety-three percentage of the increases in rainy days is contributed by the local warming and the remainder by the increase in total precipitation. Moreover, at the end of this century, the rainfall in spring will occur much earlier than the present day by more than 1 month, and the extent of rainfall will further expand toward the center of the Arctic Ocean and the inland Greenland in the future. The changes of rainfall intensity on the Arctic land area to the climate warming are more sensitive than that on the Arctic Ocean in warm seasons (May-September). The rainfall will be further strengthened in most of the Arctic continents in summer, with the largest increase in the intensity of similar to 2 mm/day along the southwest coast of Greenland. The above results are confirmed by the latest projections from CMIP6 models.","[Dou, T. F.] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Resources & Environm, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Pan, S.

However, CCS deployment faces multiple economic, technological, and infrastructure challenges. Related literature tends to only focus on certain aspects of the CCS technology or to be limited to a particular sector perspective. In contrast, this paper presents a holistic modelling framework to analyse the long-term perspectives of CCS in Europe by extending the typical analysis from the electricity sector to the industry sector, and by including the CO2 infrastructure level with CO2 pipelines and storage. To this end, we use state-ofthe-art models of the electricity sector (generation investment and electricity grid models), the industry sector, as well as the CO2 infrastructure sector. This unique modelling framework analyses the feasibility and costs of CCS deployment in the European Union towards 2050 in three scenarios with the same ambitious climate policy target (similar to 85% CO2 emissions reduction). The main insights on the deployment of CCS in Europe hinges on two factors: i) the development of low-cost power generation technologies with carbon capture (coal and/or gas-fired), and ii) a sufficiently high CO2 price to compensate for the costs of deploying the CO2 transport infrastructure. Once CO2 transport infrastructure is available, CCS will be a preferred mitigation option for the industry sector emissions. The joint use of CO2 infrastructure by the electricity and the industry sector allows for economies of scale and economies of density. In the long term, CCS cannot achieve the 100% decarbonisation target of the energy sector because the technology can only capture 80-90% of the CO2 emissions of thermal power plants. Moreover, the advantages of CCS in terms of energy system costs compared to a system without CCS is rather small, in the range of 2%. It crucially depends on the costs of renewables and the costs of their integration in the electricity grid.","[Holz, Franziska; Scherwath, Tim] German Inst Econ Res DIW Berlin, Berlin, Germany; [Holz, Franziska; del Granado, Pedro Crespo; Skar, Christian] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Trondheim, Norway; [Olmos, Luis; Ploussard, Quentin; Ramos, Andres] Comillas Pontif Univ, Inst Res Technol IIT, Madrid, Spain; [Herbst, Andrea] Fraunhofer Inst Syst & Innovat Res ISI, Karlsruhe, Germany",DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); Comillas Pontifical University; Fraunhofer Gesellschaft,"Holz, F (corresponding author), German Inst Econ Res DIW Berlin, Berlin, Germany.",fholz@diw.de,,"Herbst, Andrea/0000-0002-7487-2245; Scherwath, Tim/0000-0002-4391-0050; Crespo Del Granado, Pedro/0000-0001-6048-8376","Horizon 2020 project Navigating the Roadmap for Clean, Secure and Efficient Energy Innovation (SET-Nav) [691843]","Horizon 2020 project Navigating the Roadmap for Clean, Secure and Efficient Energy Innovation (SET-Nav)","We gratefully acknowledge funding from the Horizon 2020 project Navigating the Roadmap for Clean, Secure and Efficient Energy Innovation (SET-Nav, grant no. 691843).

Hydrological drought assessment is critical for drought prevention and water resources management. However, in China to assess hydrological drought at national scale is still challenging basically because of the difficulty of obtaining runoff data. In this study, we used the state-of-the-art passive microwave remote sensing techniques in river runoff modelling and thus assessed hydrological drought in Mainland China in 1996-2016. Specifically, 79 typical hydrological stations in 9 major basins were selected to simulate river runoff using the M/C signal method based on a high-resolution passive microwave bright temperature dataset. The standardized runoff index (SRI) was calculated for the spatial and temporal patterns of hydrological drought. Results show that passive microwave remote sensing can provide an effective way for runoff modelling as 92.4% and 59.5% of the selected 79 stations had the Pearson correlation coefficient (R) and the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NS) scores greater than 0.5. Especially in areas located on Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in the Inland and the Southwest River Basin, the performance of the M/C signal method is quite outstanding. Further analysis indicates that stations with small rivers in the plateau areas with sparse vegetation tend to have better simulated results, which are usually located in drought-prone regions. Hydrological drought assessment shows that 30 out of the 79 stations present significant increasing trends in SRI-3 and 18 indicate significant decreasing trends. The duration and severity of droughts in the non-permanent dry areas of the Hai River Basin, the middle reaches of the Yangtze River Basin and the Southwest of China were found out to be more frequent and severe than other regions. This work can provide guidance for extending the applications of remote sensing data in drought assessment and other hydrological research.","[Qu, Xing; Zeng, Ziyue; Yuan, Zhe; Huo, Junjun; Wang, Yongqiang; Xu, Jijun] Changjiang Water Resources Commiss, Changjiang River Sci Res Inst, Wuhan 430010, Peoples R China; [Qu, Xing; Zeng, Ziyue; Yuan, Zhe; Huo, Junjun; Wang, Yongqiang; Xu, Jijun] Hubei Prov Key Lab Basin Water Resources & Ecol E, Wuhan 430010, Peoples R China",Yangtze River Water Resources Protection Bureau,"Zeng, ZY; Yuan, Z (corresponding author), Changjiang Water Resources Commiss, Changjiang River Sci Res Inst, Wuhan 430010, Peoples R China.;Zeng, ZY; Yuan, Z (corresponding author), Hubei Prov Key Lab Basin Water Resources & Ecol E, Wuhan 430010, Peoples R China.",qxky1910@163.com; zengzy@mail.crsri.cn; yuanzhe_0116@126.com; coconeth@163.com; wangyongqiang1022@126.com; xujj07@163.com,"yuan, zhe/GYE-0922-2022",,National Natural Science Foundation of China [52009007]; Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province [2020CFB132]; Water Resource Science and Technology Innovation Program of Guangdong Province [2017-03],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province(Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province); Water Resource Science and Technology Innovation Program of Guangdong Province,"This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, grant number 52009007, the Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province, grant number 2020CFB132 and the Water Resource Science and Technology Innovation Program of Guangdong Province, grant number 2017-03.",,69,1,1,7,24,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,SEP,2021,17,,,,,,2429,10.3390/w13172429,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w13172429,,,21,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,UO2HE,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000694520000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This review is based on an extensive search of published literature in the Web of Science database that specifically addressed EG erosion. This review included 173 papers published in 56 scientific journals over the last 30 years. The results indicated that the main EG erosion topics were related to gully erosion processes, factors, methodology, models, and the detrimental effects of EGs. The definition of EG was identical worldwide. There is an urgency to define critical morphological values under different conditions for identifying EG channel locations in fields in order to map and model their development quickly and accurately. Topographic factors have been much more studied than other contributing factors, including climate, land management, soil, and hydraulics. Fifteen different methodological approaches or technologies, which were categorized into four kinds of methods, including field monitoring, modelling, simulation experiments, and review, have been employed to assess and quantify EG erosion. The average soil erosion rate of EGs in 36 publications increased and decreased with increase of slope and catchment areas, respectively, and the number of EGs linearly increased with catchment area. The complexity of the development of EG channels and the driving force mechanisms should also be studied intentionally, e.g., the quantification of soil detachment and sediment transport mechanisms for both surface and subsurface flow during different subprocesses, including gully head advance, sidewall collapse and bed incision. It was concluded that the interactive effects of different contributing factors on EG erosion across various spatio-temporal scales should be further researched. The comprehensive utilization or application of new methods and technologies, e.g., automatic monitoring technologies, artificial intelligence, machine learning algorithms, would be helpful to improve study efficiency and accuracy. The scientific basis of prediction models still needs further development and refinement. This review provides recommendations and suggestions to improve knowledge, prediction, and control of EG erosion.","[Liu, Gang; Zheng, Fenli; Xu, Ximeng; Liu, Chang] Northwest A&F Univ, Inst Soil & Water Conservat, State Key Lab Soil Eros & Dryland Farming Loess P, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Liu, Gang; Zheng, Fenli] Chinese Acad Sci & Minist Water Resources, Inst Soil & Water Conservat, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Wilson, Glenn, V] USDA ARS, Natl Sedimentat Lab, Oxford, MS 38655 USA; [Xu, Ximeng] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Water Cycle & Related Land Surface Proc, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Soil & Water Conservation (ISWC), CAS; Northwest A&F University - China; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Soil & Water Conservation (ISWC), CAS; Ministry of Water Resources; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS","Zheng, FL (corresponding author), Northwest A&F Univ, Inst Soil & Water Conservat, 26 Xinong Rd, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",flzh@ms.iswc.ac.cn,"Liu, Gang/I-8858-2019; Xu, Ximeng/AAE-8719-2022","Liu, Gang/0000-0002-3444-3649; ",National Key R&D Program of China [2016YFE0202900]; Natural Science Basic Research Plan in Shaanxi Province of China [2020JM163]; Water Conservancy Science and Technology Innovation Project in Guangdong Province of China [202021]; International Partnership Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences [161461KYSB20170013],National Key R&D Program of China; Natural Science Basic Research Plan in Shaanxi Province of China; Water Conservancy Science and Technology Innovation Project in Guangdong Province of China; International Partnership Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences,"This research was jointly supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (No. 2016YFE0202900) , the Natural Science Basic Research Plan in Shaanxi Province of China (No. 2020JM163) , the Water Conservancy Science and Technology Innovation Project in Guangdong Province of China (No. 202021) , and the International Partnership Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences (No. 161461KYSB20170013) .",,154,15,16,24,63,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29a, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0167-1987,1879-3444,,SOIL TILL RES,Soil Tillage Res.,AUG,2021,,,,,,,105046,10.1016/j.still.2021.105046,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2021.105046,,21-May,18,Soil Science,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,SV2SN,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000663674500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Competing failure scenarios are identified, and are distinguished by the degree to which the coating-substrate interface delaminates, and whether this delamination is finite or unlimited in nature. Failure mechanism maps are constructed, and illustrate the sensitivity of the active crack channelling mechanism and associated channelling stress to the ratio of coating toughness to interfacial toughness, to the mismatch in elastic modulus and to the mismatch in coefficient of hygral or thermal expansion. The effect of the ratio of coating to substrate thickness upon the failure mechanism and channelling stress is also explored. Closed-form expressions for the steady-state delamination stress are derived, and are used to determine the transition value of moisture state that leads to unlimited delamination. Although the results are applicable to coating-substrate systems in a wide range of applications, the study focusses on the prediction of cracking in historical paintings due to indoor climate fluctuations, with the objective of helping museums developing strategies for the preservation of art objects. For this specific application, crack channelling with delamination needs to be avoided under all circumstances, as it may induce flaking of paint material. In historical paintings, the substrate thickness is typically more than ten times larger than the thickness of the paint layer; for such a system, the failure maps constructed from the numerical simulations indicate that paint delamination is absent if the delamination toughness is larger than approximately half of the mode I toughness of the paint layer. Further, the transition between crack channelling with and without delamination appears to be relatively insensitive to the mismatch in the elastic modulus of the substrate and paint layer. The failure maps developed in this work may provide a useful tool for museum conservators to identify the allowable indoor humidity and temperature fluctuations for which crack channelling with delamination is prevented in historical paintings.","[Bosco, E.; Suiker, A.

Due to increasing anthropogenic influences and the impact of climate change, wetlands are increasingly threatened and degraded. An effective monitoring of wetlands is therefore necessary to preserve and restore these endangered ecosystems. Earth Observation (EO) data offer a great potential to support cost-effective and large-scale monitoring of wetlands. Current state-of-the-art methods for wetland mapping, however, require large training data and manual effort and can therefore only be locally applied. The focus of this study is to evaluate a methodology for large-scale and highly automated wetland mapping based on current EO data streams. For this purpose, an algorithm for water and wetness detection based on multi-temporal optical imagery and topographic data is presented. Suitable spectral indices sensitive to water and wetness were identified using feature selection methods based on mutual information between optical indices and occurrence of water and wetness. In combination with the Topographic Wetness Index (TWI), these were used to derive monthly water and wetness masks using a dynamic thresholding approach. Aggregating all observations corrected for seasonal bias yielded flooding and wetness frequencies and the Water Wetness Presence (or Probability) Index (WWPI) as an indicator for wetland occurrence or a pre-inventory. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method, the algorithm is demonstrated at three study sites with different wetland types in Kenya/Uganda, Algeria, and Austria using Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) imagery. For all sites, the overall accuracy was above 92%. User's and producer's accuracies were higher for water (> 96%) than for wetness (> 75%). Due to the high degree of automation and low processing time, the proposed method is applicable on a large scale and has already been applied during the production of the Copernicus High Resolution Water-Wetness Layer and within the European Space Agency (ESA) project GlobWetland Africa.","[Ludwig, Christina; Walli, Andreas; Schleicher, Christian; Weichselbaum, Juergen; Riffler, Michael] GeoVille Informat Syst & Data Proc GmbH, Sparkassenpl 2, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria",,"Riffler, M (corresponding author), GeoVille Informat Syst & Data Proc GmbH, Sparkassenpl 2, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria.",ludwig@geoville.com; walli@geoville.com; schleicher@geoville.com; weichselbaum@geoville.com; riffler@geoville.com,,"Ludwig, Christina/0000-0003-4669-3298",ESA,ESA(European Space Agency),"We would like to thank ESA for providing the funding for the GlobWetland Africa project and our colleagues at GeoVille Information Systems and Data Processing GmbH for the great support, specifically Dr. Andrew Moran, project manager for the Copernicus implementation of the Water-Wetness layer, and former staff member Steve Kass for early research activities.

Oceans today, are playing an eminent part in monitoring climate, storing and releasing Carbon dioxide, supplying foodstuffs, and shipping. The sectors that can benefit most from this research are industries dealing with oil and gas, fisheries, UW instrumentation, armed forces, research and exploration bureaus, etc. Existing terrestrial Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol which mostly use radio waves for communications are unsuitable for underwater atmosphere. Underwater sensor networks (UWSNs) using acoustic wireless networking finds application in the supporting tools for such applications. The unique properties of the UW acoustic communication path necessitate the need for new efficient, reliable MAC protocols to meet the challenges of propagation delay, multipath and fading and excessive power absorption at higher frequencies etc. Owing to the typical properties of acoustic wave propagation in the underwater atmosphere, the energy efficiency in UW-ASN is badly affected by the long propagation delay and data packet collisions, which hinders the transmission of the data packets that enables us to achieve collective monitoring tasks. This paper, present MAC protocols tailored for UWANs, the classification of MAC protocols, the state of the art, environment characteristics, challenges, and performance metrics in terms of throughput, propagation delay, energy consumption and quantitative analysis of some selected protocols. It also gives an insight of some challenges and open issues for future works. The analysis was made on UAN-CW-MAC protocol and UAN-Aloha, to understand the shape of the throughput curves for the protocol. The simulations were performed on network simulator ns3 to obtain the throughput curves for uan-cw mac with 20 nodes and uan-Aloha with 2-15 sensor nodes with one sink. The results obtained are shown for 20 simulation runs for each node.","[Ansari, Seema; Poncela Gonzalez, Javier; Otero, Pablo] Univ Malaga, Telecommun Engn Dept, E-29071 Malaga, Spain; [Ansari, Seema] Inst Business Management, Dept Elect Engn, Karachi, Pakistan; [Ansari, Adeel] Univ Teknol PETRONAS, Comp Informat Sci Dept, Seri Iskandar, Malaysia",Universidad de Malaga; Universiti Teknologi Petronas,"Ansari, S (corresponding author), Univ Malaga, Telecommun Engn Dept, E-29071 Malaga, Spain.",seema.ansari@iobm.edu.pk; javier@ic.uma.es; pablo.otero@ic.uma.es; adeel.ansari@hotmail.com,"Ansari, Dr. Seema/AAW-9067-2020; Otero, Pablo/Y-7029-2019","Ansari, Dr. Seema/0000-0002-0108-7481; Otero, Pablo/0000-0003-3042-4392; Ansari, Adeel/0000-0003-1674-703X",,,,,34,8,10,2,44,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-6212,1572-834X,,WIRELESS PERS COMMUN,Wirel.

It was found that the behaviour of leaders have influence on the organizational climate and culture conducive to creativity (Hage and Dewar, 1973; Maier, 1970; Amabile et al., 1996; Mumford et al., 2002). It is claimed that the leader should build such working conditions that enable creativity, learning and efficiency. The superior may not always be able to influence the complexity and suitability to work, but it can have an impact on working conditions and the willingness that the people in this environment will continue to develop and grow by encouraging them and recognition. In a work environment that encourages creativity, should be perceived atmosphere of fairness, confidentiality and security. Which improves the basic conditions for the development of creativity, i.e. well-being, freedom and enthusiasm. The purpose of this article is to present theories that relate to the leadership impact on the creativity. Therefore, the attempt to study the impact of leadership of academics lecturers among young people (students) was made. The main objective of the research was: Using scientific procedures and using the appropriate methodology examined and recognized types of leadership, which in the opinion of students most actively shape the creative attitude. Considerations were the basis for the formulation of the research hypothesis: The more active leadership favourable to the development of creativity, the higher the level of creativity among students, who as part of the intellectual capital is a major factor in the development of micro-and macro-region. In order to verify this objective and the research hypothesis, tests on a group of 232 students from the University of Szczecin, West Pomeranian University of Technology and the Academy of Arts was conducted.

The assessment aims to furnish a state-of-the-art overview and identify knowledge gaps. So far, total jatropha production has remained small. Numbers and value of jatropha projects have even declined since 2008. The economic analyses indicate minimal financial feasibility for projects. Yield increase and value addition (e.g., through utilising by-products) are necessary. Plantations seem to fare the worst, mainly due to the higher financial inputs used. in a plantation setting and the still limited yield levels. Smallholders can only achieve financial feasibility in low-input settings and when opportunity costs are low. Unfortunately, hardly any Cost Benefit Analyses (CBA) are based on real data; partly due to a lack of long-running jatropha projects. The environmental impact varies greatly across locations. Most studies indicate significant Greenhouse Gas (GHG) benefits over fossil fuels; however, this is only achieved with limited inputs and no loss of high C-stock biodiversity. The determinants in Life Cycle Analyses (LCA) are yield, input level, by-products utilisation, transesterification, transport distances, and land cover. More LCA research is required with more accurate data, and focusing on nitrous oxide emissions and the relation between production intensity and biodiversity impacts. Minimal negative social impacts have been revealed so far, but discontinuation of projects affects communities through income losses and fostering more negative attitudes towards new projects. Moreover, hardly any studies quantify social impact comprehensively. Detailed data collection is necessary, involving baseline studies to start with. If its financial feasibility is improved, jatropha can still become an option for sustainable energy production, GHG mitigation and rural development, especially through smallholder models. Successful implementation requires careful advance assessment of local circumstances, such as the political climate, gender aspects and land ownership structures. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The sedimentary fill of the Lake Tanganyika Rift records a long history of continental extension and variable tropical climate, that is unparalleled in its duration and fidelity. Recently acquired, state-of-the-art 2D seismic reflection data, together with reprocessed legacy data, are used to evaluate the evolution and distribution of sedimentary facies over the rift lake. Using seismic stratigraphic analysis, we reconstruct past depositional environments and the paleogeography of the lake and assess how tectonic-driven subsidence and hydroclimate variability modified the lake basin. We identify six syn-rift seismic units that overly the acoustic basement and identify depositional units beneath the syn-rift sequence that suggest episodes of pre-rift sedimentation. Based upon the seismic facies analysis, the earliest seismic stratigraphic unit is interpreted as deposited in an early-stage rift system of low-relief, that was dominated by alluvial, fluvial and shallow lacustrine conditions. Subsequent units exhibit attributes of a lacustrine environment of much greater water depth, enhanced catchment relief and accommodation, consistent with a more mature rift. In Seismic units 2-5, we observe extensive deltaic deposits and deep-water fans, and locally canyons, channels, channel-levee complexes, turbidites, slumps and other mass flow deposits. In the latter part of its history, erosional surfaces and abundant lowstand delta facies are observed, indicating the rift experienced dramatic hydroclimate cycles. We assess the relative timing of key features of the rift, including the emergence of major structures and rift segment boundaries, development of major drainages and linkages to upstream rift lakes. The evolving sedimentary facies of the rift illustrate a shallow-to-deep progression of rift valley environments and the more limited littoral habitats that influenced the evolution of its unique endemic organisms.","[Shaban, Shaidu Nuru; Scholz, Christopher A.; Muirhead, James D.; Wood, Douglas A.] Syracuse Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA; [Muirhead, James D.] Univ Auckland, Sch Environm, Auckland 1010, New Zealand; [Wood, Douglas A.] NOAA, Hydrog Surveys Div, Off Coast Survey, 1315 East West Highway, Silver Spring, MD 20910 USA",Syracuse University; University of Auckland; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Shaban, SN (corresponding author), Syracuse Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA.",snshaban@syr.edu; cascholz@syr.edu; jdmuirhe@syr.edu; douglas.wood@noaa.gov,,,Syracuse University; National Science Foundation (NSF)-Empower Program; Tanzania Petroleum Development Corporation,Syracuse University; National Science Foundation (NSF)-Empower Program(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Tanzania Petroleum Development Corporation,"Support for this research was provided by the Syracuse University, National Science Foundation (NSF)-Empower Program and the Tanzania Petroleum Development Corporation.",,97,1,1,0,9,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0031-0182,1872-616X,,PALAEOGEOGR PALAEOCL,Paleogeogr.

Taking also into consideration the direct emissions of carbon dioxide to the environment due to leakage of refrigerants with high Global Warming Potential that are employed today for such applications, a step towards more environmentally friendly and less energy-consuming solutions should be made. In the current research, different topologies of an all-in-one R744 transcritical unit providing refrigeration, heating and air conditioning to a real Greek supermarket store (METRO S.A.) in Athens are studied, using the softwares Engineering Equation Solver and EnergyPlus. The different configurations include a state-of-the-art R744 system with parallel compression and multi-ejector block, the same system with the addition of a subcooling heat exchanger that utilizes available geothermal water, as well as the last described unit with the integration of adiabatic cooling configuration on the gas cooler. These solutions are investigated in terms of energy efficiency and environmental impact (total equivalent warming impact) and they are compared to an indirect arrangement employing R744 and R290, to conventional direct expansion solutions (with R448A or R404A) and to a heat pump employing R410A that covers the heating and air conditioning demands of the supermarket. The comparative energy analysis was separated into the refrigeration part, the heating and air conditioning part and the sum of them. The results indicated that for the climate of the store's location, the case including the subcooler and adiabatic cooling configuration, the case with only the subcooler and the case with neither the subcooler nor the adiabatic cooling configuration consume annually 20.9%, 17.6% and 8.7% less energy respectively than the combination of a refrigeration unit with R448A and a heat pump with R410A for the heating/cooling needs.

The Indian Himalayan region is no exception to landslide incidences affecting key economic sectors such as transportation and agriculture and often leading to loss of lives. As reflected in the global landslide dataset, most of the landslides in this region are rainfall triggered. The region is prone to 15% of the global rainfall-induced landslides, and thereby a review of the studies in the region is inevitable. The high exposure to landslide risk has made the Indian Himalayas receive growing attention by the landslides community. A review of landslides studies conducted in this region is therefore important to provide a general picture of the state-of-the-art, a reference point for researchers and practitioners working in this region for the first time, and a summary of the improvements most urgently needed to better address landslide hazard research and management. This article focuses on various studies ranging from forecasting and monitoring to hazard and susceptibility analysis. The various factors used to analyze landslide are also studied for various landslide zones in the region. The analysis reveals that there are several avenues where significant research work is needed such as the inclusion of climate change factors or the acquisition of basic data of highest quality to be used as input data for computational models. In addition, the review reveals that, despite the entire region being highly landslide prone, most of the studies have focused on few regions and large areas have been neglected. The aim of the review is to provide a reference for stakeholders and researchers who are currently or looking to work in the Indian Himalayas, to highlight the shortcomings and the points of strength of the research being conducted, and to provide a contribution in addressing the future developments most urgently needed to obtain a consistent advance in landslide risk reduction of the area.","[Dikshit, Abhirup; Pradhan, Biswajeet] Univ Technol, Ctr Adv Modeling & Geospatial Informat Syst CAMGI, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia; [Sarkar, Raju] Delhi Technol Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Delhi 110042, India; [Pradhan, Biswajeet] Sejong Univ, Dept Energy & Mineral Resources Engn, 209 Neungdong Ro, Seoul 05006, South Korea; [Segoni, Samuele] Univ Firenze, Dept Earth Sci, Via Giorgio La Pira 4, I-50121 Florence, Italy; [Alamri, Abdullah M.] King Saud Univ, Dept Geol & Geophys, Coll Sci, Riyadh 11451, Saudi Arabia",University of Technology Sydney; Delhi Technological University; Sejong University; University of Florence; King Saud University,"Pradhan, B (corresponding author), Univ Technol, Ctr Adv Modeling & Geospatial Informat Syst CAMGI, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia.;Pradhan, B (corresponding author), Sejong Univ, Dept Energy & Mineral Resources Engn, 209 Neungdong Ro, Seoul 05006, South Korea.",abhirup.dikshit@student.uts.edu.au; rajusarkar@dce.ac.in; Biswajeet.pradhan@uts.edu.au; samuele.segoni@unifi.it; amsamri@ksu.edu.sa,"Dikshit, Abhirup/V-4046-2019; Pradhan, Biswajeet/E-8226-2010","Dikshit, Abhirup/0000-0003-2876-4080; Pradhan, Biswajeet/0000-0001-9863-2054; segoni, samuele/0000-0002-6030-1046","Centre for Advanced Modelling and Geospatial Information Systems (CAMGIS) in the University of Technology Sydney (UTS) [321740.2232335, 321740.2232357, 321740.2232424, 321740.2232452]; International Science Council [ISCROAP/IRDR/SG/2019/009]; King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia [RSP-2019/14]; Universita degli Studi di Firenze [58517_INTERNAZIONALIZZAZIONE]","Centre for Advanced Modelling and Geospatial Information Systems (CAMGIS) in the University of Technology Sydney (UTS); International Science Council; King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia(King Saud University); Universita degli Studi di Firenze","This research was supported by the Centre for Advanced Modelling and Geospatial Information Systems (CAMGIS) in the University of Technology Sydney (UTS) under Grants 321740.2232335, 321740.2232357, 321740.2232424, and 321740.2232452.

CO2 emissions from shipping, although they today contribute to less than 3% of the total anthropogenic emissions, are expected to rise in the future as a consequence of increased cargo volumes. On the other hand, for the 2 degrees C climate goal to be achieved, emissions from shipping will be required to be reduced by as much as 80% by 2050. The power required to propel the ship through the water depends, among other parameters, on the trim of the vessel, i.e. on the difference between the ship's draft in the fore and the aft of the ship. The optimisation of the trim can, therefore, lead to a reduction of the ship's fuel consumption. Today, however, the trim is generally set to a fixed value depending on whether the ship is sailed in loaded or ballast conditions, based on results performed on model tests in basins. Nevertheless, the on-board monitoring systems, which produce a huge amount of historical data about the life of the vessels, lead to the application of state of the art data analytics techniques. The latter can be used to reduce the vessel consumption by means of optimising the vessel operational conditions. In this book chapter, we present the potential of data-driven based techniques for accurately predicting the influence of independent variables measured from the on board monitoring system and the fuel consumption of a specific case study vessel. In particular, we show that gray-box models (GBM) are able to combine the high prediction accuracy of black-box models (BBM) while reducing the amount of data required for training the model by adding a white-box model (WBM) component. The resulting GBM model is then used for optimising the trim of the vessel, suggesting that between 0.5 and 2.3% fuel savings can be obtained by appropriately trimming the ship, depending on the extent of the range for varying the trim.","[Coraddu, Andrea] DAMEN Shipyard Singapore, R&D Dept, Singapore, Singapore; [Oneto, Luca; Anguita, Davide] DIBRIS Univ Genoa, Genoa, Italy; [Baldi, Francesco] Chalmers Univ Technol, Dept Shipping & Marine Technol, Gothenburg, Sweden",Chalmers University of Technology,"Coraddu, A (corresponding author), DAMEN Shipyard Singapore, R&D Dept, Singapore, Singapore.",andrea.coraddu@damen.com; luca.oneto@unige.it; francesco.baldi@chalmers.se; davide.anguita@unige.it,"Coraddu, Andrea/Q-2690-2018","Coraddu, Andrea/0000-0001-8891-4963; Oneto, Luca/0000-0002-8445-395X",,,,,82,12,12,1,3,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",1434-9922,,978-3-319-62359-7; 978-3-319-62358-0,STUD FUZZ SOFT COMP,,,2018,,,,,11,48,,10.1007/978-3-319-62359-7_2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-62359-7_2,10.1007/978-3-319-62359-7,,38,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology",Book Citation Index – Science (BKCI-S),Computer Science; Science & Technology - Other Topics,BJ9IB,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000429222100003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Transdisciplinarity is demanded; it goes beyond interdisciplinarity and focuses both on the relevance of research to the problem at hand and on the feasibility of conducting and implementing it. Problem areas in which different sectors of society and academia may make effective contributions to include new technologies like genetic engineering, biotechnologies, energy, mobility, and nutrition; the creation, organization, and distribution of welfare and resources; human health, age, urban and regional development, and North-South cooperation; new modes of learning, new social systems and decision-making processes; and environmental issues like climate, biodiversity, soil, water, air, recycling, and waste. Real-world problems determine the kind of action to be taken and not, or at least to a distinctly lesser degree, the competence or the instruments available at any given time. Transdisciplinary research adopts an integrative approach to identifying such problems and working towards solutions. Industry, business, public administration, non-governmental organizations, and consulting firms all possess know-how which may be as important to developing new solutions as the knowledge generated and collected by universities or other scientific institutions. Thus, transdisciplinarity is a vital means of appropriately confronting many of the challenges of the present century, It also promises better and quicker solutions at lower costs, since its value lies not only in its potential for efficiently solving real-world problems but also in its ability to identify such problems at an early stage. It is the purpose of the present contribution to show, by way of example, how Alexander von Humboldt, who received his education in a time when the modern clear-cut distinction of science and art did not yet exist, aimed at an inter- and transdisciplinary comprehension of his World, and how his ideas became implemented in the second half of the past century in the form of application-oriented long-term ecosystem research.","Univ Kiel, Inst Geog, D-24089 Kiel, Germany",University of Kiel,"Franzle, O (corresponding author), Univ Kiel, Inst Geog, D-24089 Kiel, Germany.",fraenzle@geographie.uni-kiel.de,,,,,,,118,3,3,0,15,HUMBOLDT FIELD RESEARCH INST,STEUBEN,"PO BOX 9, STEUBEN, ME 04680-0009 USA",1092-6194,,,NORTHEAST NAT,Northeast.

Time series of satellite imagery collected at fine spatial resolution using stable spectral bands over decades are most desirable for this purpose. In practice, however, temporal spectral variance arising from variations in atmospheric conditions, sensor calibration, cloud cover, and other factors complicates extraction of consistent information on changes in urban land cover. Moreover, the construction and application of effective training samples is time-consuming, especially at continental and global scales. Here, we propose a new framework for satellite-based mapping of urban areas based on transfer learning and deep learning techniques. We apply this method to Landsat observations collected during 1984-2016 and extract annual records of urban areas in four cities in the temperate zone (Beijing, New York, Melbourne, and Munich). The method is trained using observations of Beijing collected in 1999, and then used to map urban areas in all target cities for the entire 1984-2016 period. The method addresses two central challenges in long term detection of urban change: temporal spectral variance and a scarcity of training samples. First, we use a recurrent neural network to minimize seasonal urban spectral variance. Second, we introduce an automated transfer strategy to maximize information gain from limited training samples when applied to new target cities in similar climate zones. Compared with other state-of-the-art methods, our method achieved comparable or even better accuracy: the average change detection accuracy during 1984-2016 is 89% for Beijing, 94% for New York, 93% for Melbourne, and 89% for Munich, and the overall accuracy of single-year urban maps is approximately 96 +/- 3% among the four target cities. The results demonstrate the practical potential and suitability of the proposed framework. The method is a promising tool for detecting urban change in massive remote sensing data sets with limited training data.","[Lyu, Haobo; Lu, Hui; Li, Wenyu; Wright, Jonathon; Li, Xinlu; Yu, Le; Gong, Peng] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Key Lab Earth Syst Modeling, Minist Educ, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Lu, Hui; Wright, Jonathon; Yu, Le; Gong, Peng] Joint Ctr Global Change Studies, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Mou, Lichao; Zhu, Xiao Xiang] German Aerosp Ctr DLR, Remote Sensing Technol Inst IMF, D-82234 Wessling, Germany; [Mou, Lichao; Zhu, Xiao Xiang] TUM, Signal Proc Earth Observat, D-80333 Munich, Germany; [Li, Xuecao] Iowa State Univ, Dept Geol & Atmospher Sci, Ames, IA 50014 USA; [Li, Xinlu] Chinese Acad Sci, Natl Space Sci Ctr, Beijing 10019, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jie] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Remote Sensing Applicat, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China","Tsinghua University; Helmholtz Association; German Aerospace Centre (DLR); Technical University of Munich; Iowa State University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; National Space Science Center, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences","Lu, H (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Key Lab Earth Syst Modeling, Minist Educ, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.;Lu, H (corresponding author), Joint Ctr Global Change Studies, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",lvhb15@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn; luhui@tsinghua.edu.cn; lichao.mou@dlr.de; li-wy15@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn; jswright@mail.tsinghua.edu.cn; xuecaoli@iastate.edu; xinlulee@126.com; xiao.zhu@dlr.de; sohuwangjie@163.com; leyu@tsinghua.edu.cn; penggong@mail.tsinghua.edu.cn,"LI, XUECAO/ABG-0618-2022; Lu, Hui/H-4349-2011; li, xuecao/L-3807-2018; Yu, Le/C-3701-2008; Gong, Peng/AAM-1516-2021","LI, XUECAO/0000-0002-6942-0746; Lu, Hui/0000-0003-1640-239X; li, xuecao/0000-0002-6942-0746; Yu, Le/0000-0003-3115-2042; Gong, Peng/0000-0003-1513-3765; Wright, Jonathon/0000-0001-6551-7017","National Basic Research Program of China [2015CB953703]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFA0603703]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [91537210, 91747101]; European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union [ERC-2016-StG-714087]; Helmholtz Association [VH-NG-1018]; China Scholarship Council",National Basic Research Program of China(National Basic Research Program of China); National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union(European Research Council (ERC)); Helmholtz Association(Helmholtz Association); China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council),"This work was jointly supported by the National Basic Research Program of China (No. 2015CB953703), the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2017YFA0603703), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (91537210 & 91747101).

Advocates of planned non-hospital deliveries have emphasised patient safety, patient satisfaction, cost effectiveness, and respect for women's rights. We provide a critical evaluation of each of these claims and have doubts that the information available for the pregnant women and the public is in accord with professional responsibility. We understand that the increasing rates of interventions and operative deliveries in hospital births demand an answer, but we doubt that planned home birth is the appropriate professional solution. Complications during non-hospital births inevitably demand a transport of mother and child to a perinatal centre. The time delay by itself is an unnecessary risk for both and this cannot be abolished by bureaucratic quality criteria as introduced for non-hospital births in Germany. Evidence-based studies have shown that modern knowledge of the course of delivery including ultrasound as well as intensive care during the delivery all reduce the rate of operative deliveries. Unfortunately, this is not well-known and only rarely considered during any delivery. All these facts, however, are the best arguments to find a cooperative model within perinatal centres to combine the art of midwifery with modern science, reduction of pain and perinatal care of the pregnant women before, during and after birth. We therefore call on obstetricians, midwifes and health-care providers as well as health politicians to carefully analyse the studies from Western countries showing increasing risks if the model of intention-to-treat is considered and accoordingly not to support planned non-hospital births nor to include these models into prospective trials. Alternatively, we recommend the introduction of a home-like climate within hospitals and perinatal centres, to avoid unnecessary invasive measures and to really care for the pregnant mother before, during and after delivery within a cooperative model without the lack of patient safety for both mother and child in case of impending or acute emergencies.","[Arabin, B.] Univ Marburg, Clara Angela Fdn, Mutter Kind Zentrum, Berlin, Germany; [Chervenak, F.

Heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems are among the most significant contributors to global primary energy consumption and carbon gas emissions. Furthermore, HVAC energy demand is expected to rise in the future. Therefore, advancements in HVAC systems' performance and design would be critical for mitigating worldwide energy and environmental concerns. To make such advancements, energy modeling and model predictive control (MPC) play an imperative role in designing and operating HVAC systems effectively. Building energy simulations and analysis techniques effectively implement HVAC control schemes in the building system design and operation phases, and thus provide quantitative insights into the behaviors of the HVAC energy flow for architects and engineers. Extensive research and advanced HVAC modeling/control techniques have emerged to provide better solutions in response to the issues. This study reviews building energy modeling techniques and state-of-the-art updates of MPC in HVAC applications based on the most recent research articles (e.g., from MDPI's and Elsevier's databases). For the review process, the investigation of relevant keywords and context-based collected data is first carried out to overview their frequency and distribution comprehensively. Then, this review study narrows the topic selection and search scopes to focus on relevant research papers and extract relevant information and outcomes. Finally, a systematic review approach is adopted based on the collected review and research papers to overview the advancements in building system modeling and MPC technologies. This study reveals that advanced building energy modeling is crucial in implementing the MPC-based control and operation design to reduce building energy consumption and cost. This paper presents the details of major modeling techniques, including white-box, grey-box, and black-box modeling approaches.

Transport presents a challenge for Atmospheric General Circulation Models (AGCMs), as errors in both the resolved circulation and the numerical representation of transport processes can bias their abundance. In this study, two tests are proposed to assess transport by the dynamical core of an AGCM. To separate transport from chemistry, the tests focus on the age-of-air, an estimate of the mean transport time by the circulation. The tests assess the coupled stratosphere-troposphere system, focusing on transport by the overturning circulation and isentropic mixing in the stratosphere, or Brewer-Dobson Circulation, where transport time-scales on the order of months to years provide a challenging test of model numerics. Four dynamical cores employing different numerical schemes (finite-volume, pseudo-spectral, and spectral-element) and discretizations (cubed sphere versus latitude-longitude) are compared across a range of resolutions. The subtle momentum balance of the tropical stratosphere is sensitive to model numerics, and the first intercomparison reveals stark differences in tropical stratospheric winds, particularly at high vertical resolution: some cores develop westerly jets and others easterly jets. This leads to substantial spread in transport, biasing the age-of-air by up to 25% relative to its climatological mean, making it difficult to assess the impact of the numerical representation of transport processes. This uncertainty is removed by constraining the tropical winds in the second intercomparison test, in a manner akin to specifying the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation in an AGCM. The dynamical cores exhibit qualitative agreement on the structure of atmospheric transport in the second test, with evidence of convergence as the horizontal and vertical resolution is increased in a given model. Significant quantitative differences remain, however, particularly between models employing spectral versus finite-volume numerics, even in state-of-the-art cores.","[Gupta, Aman; Gerber, Edwin P.] NYU, Courant Inst Math Sci, Ctr Atmosphere Ocean Sci, New York, NY USA; [Lauritzen, Peter H.] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA",New York University; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA,"Gupta, A (corresponding author), Courant Inst Math Sci, Ctr Atmosphere Ocean Sci, 251 Mercer St 801, New York, NY 10012 USA.",agupta@cims.nyu.edu,,"Gerber, Edwin/0000-0002-6010-6638; Lauritzen, Peter/0000-0001-7066-138X; Gupta, Aman/0000-0002-2215-7135","US National Science Foundation [AGS-1546585, AGS-1852727]",US National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"We acknowledge support of the US National Science Foundation through grants AGS-1546585 and AGS-1852727 to New York University.

Moreover, zooplankton have an important role in supporting primary production as they can recycle large amounts of micronutrients such as iron, facilitating its retention in the surface ocean and alleviating iron limitation of phytoplankton. Intuitively, one may consider that a large quantity of prey should ensure a healthy zooplankton ecosystem, but the microbial oceanic food web is characterized by a great variability in both the composition and quality of preys. This variability may lead to mismatches between predator and prey stoichiometry, which can in turn affect the growth efficiency of zooplankton. Here we show that variations in food quality are the main drivers of changes in iron assimilation and recycling by zooplankton. Making use of a state-of-the-art biogeochemical model that explicitly accounts for the impact of multiple drivers on the iron assimilation efficiency, we quantify the relative drivers of iron recycling in different ocean regions and across seasons. Our results can be reconciled within a conceptual framework that links the assimilation efficiency of zooplankton to predator-prey stoichiometric mismatch and zooplankton physiological assumptions. If predator and prey stoichiometries are close, then the micronutrient assimilation by zooplankton is optimal and recycling is low. Any departure from this optimal stoichiometry leads to a decrease in assimilation efficiency and a subsequent increase in micronutrient recycling. This framework can be used to understand the impact of variability in prey food quality on iron recycling from previous experiments and generates clear hypotheses about the relative importance of recycling for other micronutrients such as copper, cobalt, manganese, and zinc. Finally, our findings highlight the importance of future changes in prey food quality in driving recycling rates of micronutrients that can amplify or attenuate any climate driven trends in upper ocean nutrient supply.","[Richon, Camille; Tagliabue, Alessandro] Univ Liverpool, Sch Environm Sci, Liverpool, Merseyside, England; [Aumont, Olivier] CNRS, Lab Oceanog & Climat Expt & Approches Numer, IRD, MNHN,SU IPSL, Paris, France",University of Liverpool; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle (MNHN); UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Universite Paris Cite,"Richon, C (corresponding author), Univ Liverpool, Sch Environm Sci, Liverpool, Merseyside, England.",crichon@liverpool.ac.uk,"aumont, olivier/G-5207-2016","aumont, olivier/0000-0003-3954-506X; Richon, Camille/0000-0001-7097-7173",European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union [724289],European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union(European Research Council (ERC)),This project has received funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (Grant agreement No. 724289).,,49,9,9,3,16,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-7745,,FRONT MAR SCI,Front.

Five of these have, to date, resulted in pregnancy and four live births have now been recorded. The most significant obstacles to the availability of UTx are presently scientific and technical, relating to the safety and efficacy of the procedure itself. However, if and when such obstacles are overcome, the most likely barriers to its availability will be social and financial in nature, relating in particular to the ability and willingness of patients, insurers or the state to pay. Thus, publicly funded healthcare systems such as the UK's National Health Service (NHS) will eventually have to decide whether UTx should be funded. With this in mind, we seek to provide an answer to the question of whether there exist any compelling reasons for the state not to fund UTx. The paper proceeds as follows. It assumes, at least for the sake of argument, that UTx will become sufficiently safe and cost-effective to be a candidate for funding and then asks, given that, what objections to funding there might be. Three main arguments are considered and ultimately rejected as providing insufficient reason to withhold funding for UTx. The first two are broad in their scope and offer an opportunity to reflect on wider issues about funding for infertility treatment in general. The third is narrower in scope and could, in certain forms, apply to UTx but not other assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs). The first argument suggests that UTx should not be publicly funded because doing so would be inconsistent with governments' obligations to prevent climate change and environmental pollution. The second claims that UTx does not treat a disorder and is not medically necessary. Finally, the third asserts that funding for UTx should be denied because of the availability of alternatives such as adoption and surrogacy.","[Wilkinson, Stephen; Williams, Nicola Jane] Univ Lancaster, Dept Polit Philosophy & Relig, Lancaster LA1 4YQ, England",Lancaster University,"Williams, NJ (corresponding author), Univ Lancaster, Dept Polit Philosophy & Relig, Lancaster LA1 4YQ, England.",n.williams2@lancaster.ac.uk,,"Wilkinson, Stephen/0000-0002-4445-9353; Williams, Nicola/0000-0002-8400-6279",Wellcome Trust,Wellcome Trust(Wellcome TrustEuropean Commission),"Authors wish to thank the following for their helpful comments on previous versions: members of the Reproductive Donation Team at both Lancaster University and King's College London, the Centre for Social Ethics and Policy at the University of Manchester, attendees at the Social and Ethical Aspects of Health and Medicine 2015 seminar series, and the JME's anonymous referees.

This involves the process of burning the fuel with nearly pure oxygen instead of air. In order to control the flame temperature, some part of the flue gas are recycled back into the furnace/boiler. Since the publication of the Special Report on CO2 Capture and Storage by the International Panel for Climate Change (IPCC, 2005), the development of oxyfuel combustion technology has progressed significantly and could be considered at par in terms of technology maturity as compared to other leading CO2 capture technologies. This paper presents an overview to the current state-of-the-art technology on the development of oxyfuel combustion applied to (a) PC and CFB coal fired power plants and (b) gas turbine based power plant. It should be noted that it is not the intention of this paper to provide a comprehensive review but to present what have been achieved in the past 10 years of RD&D efforts. For coal fired power plant using oxyfuel combustion, this paper primarily presents the different development aspects of the burners and boilers (combustion and heat transfer), emissions, operation of the plant (i.e. start-up and turndown) and its integration to the ASU and CPU. For gas turbine based power plant using oxyfuel combustion, the different GT cycles are described, looking at the different aspects in combustion, emissions, cycle efficiency and development of the turbomachineries. Also presented in this paper is a snapshot to what we have learned from the operation of the different large-scale pilot plants and development of large scale demonstration projects worldwide. The paper concludes by presenting the potential of this technology and highlighting the importance of realizing large scale demonstration plant as a necessary step to achieve its ultimate goal of technology commercialization.

In considering the commission and collecting of these clay figures as tangible by-products of the Indo-American relationship between traders in the 19th century, I look at three distinct categories within portrait-objects: life-size clay representations of two mendicant figures; three Calcutta merchants given as gifts; and a set of miniature clay dolls representing various Indian social types. Accounting for various European and American presences in nineteenth century India and acknowledging asymmetrical power relations in such encounters, I home in on iconographical and technological choices made by the Krishnagar craftsmen to point to the juxtaposition of the local and the adopted. This adoption, I suggest, is not a straightforward one but a moment in a series of moments of transaction among different cultural subjects. Extending these relations to a climate of variable artistic patronage, I problematise the relationship between artistic agency and portraiture, arguing that it is the act of commission and exchange within this space of cultural encounter in colonial India and the museum that determines to what extent a figure is, or is not, considered a portrait.","[Chatterjee, Sria] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",Princeton University,"Chatterjee, S (corresponding author), Princeton Univ, Dept Art & Archaeol, 105 McCormick Hall, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",sria@princeton.edu,,,,,,,32,0,0,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1936-9816,1936-9824,,MUS HIST J,Mus.

The efficient power management integrated into a smart solar microgrid is required to address these problems. The deep learning predictive tools are utilized to forecast the maximum building's three-phase load power in the short term. In this project, historical data from the solar module, battery module, grid data, and climate data are collected by integrated advanced metering infrastructure in a smart solar microgrid in Taiwan. These historical data are utilized in predicting the building's three-phase load power in the smart solar microgrid. This project proposed the hybrid model in the short-term three-phase loads forecasting based on convolution neural network bidirectional gated recurrent unit (CNN-Bi-GRU). The CNN-Bi-GRU utilizes the continuous-time sliding window, which is extracted features and reshaped into vectors by CNN layers. The hyperparameter optimization is utilized to construct the highest performance structure of the CNN-Bi-GRU model. The CNN-Bi-GRU performance is compared and evaluated with other state-of-arts models, which are the recurrent neural network (RNN), LSTM, gated recurrent unit (GRU), and bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM), and Bi-GRU models. The experiment results prove that the forecasting accuracy could be effectively improved by a hybrid CNN-Bi-GRU model with an appropriate window size of sequential historical data. According to research knowledge, this is the first work to predict the building's three-phase load power using multiple source data from advanced metering infrastructures (AMI) and deep learning CNN-Bi-GRU in the smart solar microgrid. The CNN-Bi-GRU model is successfully integrated into the efficient power management, which maintains the adequate battery storage level, solar power, and grid power balance under different weather conditions and working requirements of the building's three-phase load power.","[Phuong Nguyen Thanh; Cho, Ming-Yuan; Chang, Chun-Lung; Chen, Meng-Jie] Natl Kaohsiung Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Elect Engn, Kaohsiung 82445, Taiwan; [Phuong Nguyen Thanh] Nha Trang Univ, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Nha Trang 650000, Khanh Hoa, Vietnam",National Kaohsiung University of Science & Technology; Nha Trang University,"Thanh, PN (corresponding author), Natl Kaohsiung Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Elect Engn, Kaohsiung 82445, Taiwan.;Thanh, PN (corresponding author), Nha Trang Univ, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Nha Trang 650000, Khanh Hoa, Vietnam.",thanhphuong@ntu.edu.vn,,"Phuong, Thanh/0000-0002-7220-7356",,,,,57,0,0,7,7,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2022,,,,,68686,68699,,10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3185747,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3185747,,,14,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,3Q7RG,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000838422900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Many scholars (M.M. Bakhtin, Yu.M. Lotman, VN Toporov, V.E. Khalizev and others) have repeatedly emphasized that literature is an art form most closely associated with spatial categories. The common semantic field for contemporary poetry of Chelyabinsk is the concentration of local atmosphere transmission through spatial motifs and images, their semantic unity and coherence of main aspects of the description of a city and region (such as ecology, climate, flora, fauna, landscape, architecture, marginal city location). This article presents an analysis of the system of spatial motifs and images of modem poetry of Chelyabinsk. The most frequent aspects of locus description of the city and the region are revealed. The continuity and development of various spatial models in three generations of contemporary poetry of Chelyabinsk is demonstrated. Nowadays the prevailing spatial model in the poetry of Chelyabinsk is the theme of the city manifested in the abundance of toponyms and urban imagery. In the poetry of the older generation, the space of Chelyabinsk is more often depicted in gray, dark tones, evoking a sense of melancholy and hopelessness. The theme of the nature in the South Ural becomes a common semantic field for those older Chelyabinsk poets who carry on with the traditions of classical and Soviet poetry (for example, N.I. Godina, N.A. Yagodintseva). The intersection point of the middle generation with the older authors is the perception and representation of urban space as a provincial one: the city is extremely narrowed, localized by certain toponyms associated with the authors' geobiography. A. Samoilov and J. Grants adopt the aesthetics of minimalism and conceptualism when describing the Chelyabinsk space. The cosmopolitan lyric subject moving in the intertextual space that combines many local cultural texts becomes relevant for modem Chelyabinsk poets of the younger generation. Thus, the Chelyabinsk locus appears to be only one of the many places where the lyric character lives.","[Smyshlyaev, E.

In contrast at the same time strong fusion specific challenges are being recognized in the light of some issues with the ITER project in terms of schedule, technologies and cost. Therefore, it seems to be appropriate to reappraise the role of DEMO and fusion energy in the overall context and consider readjusting or redefining the medium-term mission in nuclear fusion and its relation to nuclear fission. Firstly, the current paper assesses synergies with nuclear fission Gen4 reactors. It is ascertained that the development of efficiently helium cooled high temperature components and reactor systems allows for strong collaboration between fission and fusion. Furthermore, it could be concluded that an integrated nuclear strategy for the 21(st) century should be developed including all important aspects of the possible interplay between fusion and fission. It is briefly discussed whether hybrid fusion-fission systems could be a central point of such an integrated strategy in the world wide context. The second emphasis of the current paper is on the description of the current progress made in Karlsruhe in the fields of design and testing of helium cooled components for fusion power stations and test facilities. Efficient helium cooling methods for divertor and blanket structures were found by applying the state of the art jet impingement and rib turbulator heat transfer enhancement techniques.

It aims to deliver 'good ecological status' for all rivers through the adoption of basin-based Integrated Water Resources Management. Identifying and implementing a programme of measures, encapsulated in River Basin Management Plans, will achieve this. To support the Water Framework Directive implementation, much research has been commissioned at both national and European levels. CatchMod is a cluster of these projects, which is focusing on the development of computational catchment models and related tools. Models are seen as essential for evaluating the various possible programmes of measures. However, the Water Framework Directive creates new challenges for modellers, particularly because it requires models not only to represent individual processes from many domains but also how they interact. Some projects, therefore, target the development of frameworks for model linking, while other projects aim at specific issues such as 'transboundary challenges', 'participatory tools', transitional waters and climate change effects. A Concerted Action promotes collaboration, disseminating results and active use during the implementation. CatchMod is co-funded by the European Commission's Directorate General Research. This paper presents an overview of the results of the CatchMod cluster to date. Based on the result it is clear that the joint CatchMod projects have addressed a large number of issues in integrated modelling. Due to the parallel execution of the projects, the results do require further integration. This integration is picked up in follow-up projects, in which many researchers from different projects have joined forces. Separate initiatives are brought forward to achieve true integration. This largely would not have happened if key partners of various projects hadn't gotten the chance to meet, discuss and learn about the broadness of European research. Now that almost all the results are available, Harmoni-CA will facilitate discussions on the various products, providing crosscutting state of the art with advice to further integration and use within the WFD implementation.","[Blind, M.

Many migratory fish populations are declining, threatened by human-induced pressures such as habitat loss and fragmentation caused by dams, roads, land use change, climate change and pollution. However, public awareness of fish migration and associated human pressures remains limited. 2. It is important to communicate about hard-to-see and complex environmental topics and issues, such as fish migration, with young people, who stand to be the most affected by ongoing global changes. Young people are also at a critical stage in their attitude formation and may be particularly receptive to learning enrichment and engagement for behaviour change about environmental issues. 3. Arts-based methods can be particularly effective in fostering broad personal connections with nature, especially for complex topics like fish migration. The collaborative and creative processes involved in developing such media often lack critique, which limits learning from previous experiences. 4. In this article, we reflect on the co-creation of the Shout Trout Workout (STW), a lyric poem, comic and music video for 8- to 14-year-olds, designed to entertain, engage and enrich learning about migratory fishes and aquatic environments. We chart the process of creation, including conception of ideas, writing the poem, fact-checking and developing the storyline with scientists and creating a comic and music video with visual artists and musicians. 5. We explore some of the challenges and merits of collaborative working, consider the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the creative and initial engagement process and share what we learned about creative input, communication and respect. We also discuss how the experience shaped our thoughts about the nature of co-creation itself, and how in creating STW, collaborators contributed to the process in multiple, nuanced and unanticipated ways (e.g. artistic input, ideas, science, dissemination), representing a spectrum of co-creative practice. 6. We hope that sharing our experiences and reflections is useful and inspiring for other cross-disciplinary collaborations, and for those who aim to create learning enrichment and engagement material about ecological processes and environmental issues for young people.","[Thomas, Merryn J.; Giannoulatou, Ioanna Daphne; Jones, Peter E.; Januchowski-Hartley, Stephanie R.] Swansea Univ, Fac Sci & Engn, Dept Biosci, Singleton Pk Campus, Swansea, W Glam, Wales; [Thomas, Merryn J.] Cardiff Univ, Sch Psychol, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales; [Kocak, Ethan] Ethan Kocak, Solvay, NY USA; [Tank, Wes; Sarnowski, Ryan] TankThink, Milwaukee, WI USA",Swansea University; Cardiff University; Solvay SA,"Thomas, MJ (corresponding author), Swansea Univ, Fac Sci & Engn, Dept Biosci, Singleton Pk Campus, Swansea, W Glam, Wales.;Thomas, MJ (corresponding author), Cardiff Univ, Sch Psychol, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales.",Merryn.J.Thomas@Swansea.ac.uk,,"Januchowski-Hartley, Stephanie/0000-0002-1661-917X; Giannoulatou, Ioanna/0000-0003-4882-5653",Welsh European Funding Office; European Regional Development Fund [80761-SU-140]; H2020 project AMBER [689682],Welsh European Funding Office; European Regional Development Fund(European Commission); H2020 project AMBER,"Welsh European Funding Office and European Regional Development Fund, Grant/Award Number: 80761-SU-140; H2020 project AMBER, Grant/Award Number: 689682",,63,1,1,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",,2575-8314,,PEOPLE NAT,People Nat.,DEC,2021,6,,,,1272,1283,,10.1002/pan3.10241,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pan3.10241,,21-Jul,12,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,XK2WT,,"Green Accepted, Green Published",,,12/21/22,WOS:000676501800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

It reports, for the first time, on the formation of cyclone over the Empty Quarter Desert as important mechanism for intense dust storms over this source region. The dust direct and semi-direct radiative forcings are observed, for the first time over this source region, using high-resolution in-situ and CERES-SYN satellite observational data. The three-dimensional structure and evolution of the dust storms are inferred from state-of-the-art satellite products such as SEVIRI, AEROIASI and CALIPSO. The dynamics and thermodynamics of the boundary layer during this event are thoroughly analyzed using ERA5 reanalysis and ground based observations. We found that a large dust storm by Shamal winds led up, through radiative forcing, to cyclone development over the Empty Quarter Desert, subsequent dust emissions, development of convective clouds and rain. The cyclogenesis over this region initiated a second intense dust storm which developed and impacted the AP for 3 consecutive days. The uplifted dust by the cyclone reached 5 km in altitude and altered the radiative budget at the surface, inducing both significant warming during night and cooling during day. The dust load uplifted by the cyclone was estimated by the mesoscale model Meso-NH to be in the order of 20 Tg, and the associated aerosol optical depth was higher than 3. The model simulates reasonably the radiative impact of the dust in the shortwave but highly underestimated its impact in the LW. Our study stresses the importance of the dust radiative forcing in the longwave and that it should be accurately accounted for in models to properly represent the impact of dust on the Earth system especially near source areas. Missing the warming effect of dust aerosols would impact both the weather and air quality forecast, and the regional climate projections.","[Francis, Diana; Nelli, Narendra] Khalifa Univ Sci & Technol, POB 54224, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates; [Chaboureau, Jean-Pierre] Univ Toulouse, Lab Aerol, UPS, CNRS, Toulouse, France; [Cuesta, Juan] CNRS, Lab Interuniv Syst Atmospher, Paris, France; [Cuesta, Juan] Univ Paris Est Creteil Val de Marne, Creteil, France; [Alshamsi, Noor; Pauluis, Olivier] New York Univ Abu Dhabi, POB 129188, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates; [Temimi, Marouane] Stevens Inst Technol, Dept Civil Environm Ocean Engn CEOE, Hoboken, NJ 07030 USA; [Xue, Lulin] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res NCAR, Boulder, CO USA",Khalifa University of Science & Technology; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Cite; Universite Paris-Est-Creteil-Val-de-Marne (UPEC); Universite Paris-Est-Creteil-Val-de-Marne (UPEC); Stevens Institute of Technology; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA,"Francis, D (corresponding author), Khalifa Univ Sci & Technol, POB 54224, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates.",diana.francis@ku.ac.ae,"Keyes, Dennis/AAZ-9285-2021; FRANCIS, Diana/N-3729-2018","FRANCIS, Diana/0000-0002-7587-0006; N, Dr Narendra Reddy/0000-0003-0066-6040","National Center of Meteorology, Abu Dhabi, UAE under the UAE Research Program for Rain Enhancement Science","National Center of Meteorology, Abu Dhabi, UAE under the UAE Research Program for Rain Enhancement Science","Part of this work is supported by the National Center of Meteorology, Abu Dhabi, UAE under the UAE Research Program for Rain Enhancement Science.

Once nature does not provide the required climate conditions for that to happen, humans can take action. Based on that concept, a consortium of three Dutch companies (Zwarts & Jansma Architects, Royal HaskoningDHV, and Polyned) presents a sharp, cool and innovative idea that can facilitate sport's industry in desert-covered areas; the Shaded Dome (TM). The Shaded Dome (TM) is a semi-permanent facility, comprised of an air-supported dome excluding any internal supports. A very light and highly resistant outer fabric tent (the Shade) covers it, transforming it into an astonishing state-of-the-art building. A grid of cavity struts links the two layers, creating a peripheral structural system that supports the whole structure. A pleasant internal microclimate is enabled by a constant natural airflow between the dome and the shade together with the use of a custom made combination of several membrane materials. This passive design element provides protection from extreme climatological conditions like solar radiation, wind, high air temperature, humidity and precipitation. The first real-scale models are already under development and the results are extremely encouraging. The current tests show an almost 20oC temperature decline between the dome's skins, reducing consequently the need for high demanding cooling systems. Next to that the Shaded Dome (TM) requires limited transport volume, and can be constructed and dismantled in a matter of days. Thus, the preponderant fabrication plan promotes the sources' economy, the efficient materials' use, the reusability of the product and the self-support of its energy needs, highlighting that way a new concept on the asset management of future sport infrastructure. Moving into an era where the need for dynamic constructions is becoming more and more intense, the Shaded Dome (TM) can constitute an easy to build, quick and fit-for-purpose solution which can efficiently meet any sport infrastructure requirements.

Scientific research projects are often required to emphasize and counter the effects of inequity and globalisation, and prioritise cooperation supported by cooperative research. This paper investigates whether publication of research that is carried out in least developed countries is done in cooperation with research institutes from these countries. The study uses the Current Contents database of peer-reviewed publications from more than 7,000 journals in all sciences (Biology and environmental sciences; Physical, chemical and earth sciences; Engineering, computing and technology; Life sciences; Clinical medicine; Arts and humanities; Social and behavioral sciences) published between 1 January 1999 and 3 November 2000. From a total of 1,601, 196 papers published, 2, 798 articles of research activities carried out in the 48 least developed countries were selected using title information as an indicator. Collaborative relationships between research institutions involved was then analysed within and between countries and sciences. Our results show that publications of research, carried out in the least developed countries, do not have co-authorship of local research institutes in 70% of the cases, and that a majority of the papers is published by research institutes from the most industrialised countries in the world. We employed the use of questionnaires sent to authors from papers in the above-mentioned database to detect possible causes of this high percentage of lack of authorship in the essential academic currency that 'publications' are. 'Neo-colonial science' is identified as one of them. In addition, there exists a large discrepancy between what the surveyed scientists say they find important in international collaboration and joint publishing, and the way they act to it. However, the interpretation given to the fact that institutional co-authorship is underrepresented for local research institutions in the least developed countries is less important than the fact itself, and future research should concentrate on a scientific way to equilibrate this adverse trend.","Free Univ Brussels, Fac Sci, VUB APNA WE, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium",Universite Libre de Bruxelles; Vrije Universiteit Brussel,"Dahdouh-Guebas, F (corresponding author), Free Univ Brussels, Fac Sci, VUB APNA WE, Pleinlaan 2, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.",,,"DAHDOUH-GUEBAS, Farid/0000-0002-5906-8996",,,,,17,57,59,1,27,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0138-9130,,,SCIENTOMETRICS,Scientometrics,,2003,3,,,,329,343,,10.1023/A:1022374703178,http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1022374703178,,,15,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Information Science & Library Science",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Computer Science; Information Science & Library Science,646AP,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000181012900004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Yet the likelihood of successive observed droughts in South Asia (SA) and its four subregions (R-1: semi-arid, R-2: arid, R-3: subtropical wet, and R-4: tropical wet and dry) remains poorly understood. Using the state-of-the-art self-calibrated Palmer Drought Severity Index (scPDSI), we examined the impact of different natural ocean variability modes on the evolution, severity, and magnitude of observed droughts across the four subregions that have distinct precipitation seasonality and cover key breadbaskets and highly vulnerable populations. The study revealed that dryness had significantly increased in R-1, R-2, and R-4 during 1981-2020. Temporal analysis revealed an increase in drought intensity for R-1 and R-4 since the 2000s, while a mixed behavior was observed in R-2 and R-3. Moreover, most of the sub-regions witnessed a substantial upsurge in annual precipitation, but a significant decrease in vapor pressure deficit (VPD) during 1981-2020. The increase in precipitation and the decline in VPD partially contributed to a significant rise in Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and a decrease in dryness. In contrast, a strong positive correlation was found between drought index and precipitation, and NDVI across R-1, R-2, and R-4, whereas temperature and VPD exhibited a negative correlation over these regions. No obvious link was detected with El-Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events, or Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) and drought evolution, as explored for certain regions of SA. The findings showed the possibility that the precipitation changes over these regions had an insignificant relationship with ENSO, IOD, and drought onset. Thus, the study results highlight the need for considering interactions within the longer climate system in describing observed drought risks rather than aiming at drivers from an individual perspective.","[Ullah, Irfan] Hohai Univ, Coll Hydrol & Water Resources, Nanjing 210098, Peoples R China; [Ullah, Irfan] Hohai Univ, CMA HHU Joint Lab Hydrometeorol Studies, Nanjing 210098, Peoples R China; [Ma, Xieyao; Yin, Jun; Lu, Kaidong; Xing, Yun] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Minist Water Resources, Key Lab Hydrometeorol Disaster Mech & Warning, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China; [Ma, Xieyao; Yin, Jun; Lu, Kaidong; Xing, Yun] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Hydrol & Water Resources, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China; [Ren, Guoyu] China Univ Geosci, Sch Environm Res, Dept Atmospher Sci, Wuhan 340074, Peoples R China; [Iyakaremye, Vedaste] Rwanda Meteorol Agcy, POB 898, Kigali, Rwanda; [Syed, Sidra] Univ Peshawar, Inst Peace & Conflicts Studies, Peshawar 25000, Pakistan; [Singh, Vijay P.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Biol & Agr Engn, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Singh, Vijay P.] Texas A&M Univ, Zachry Dept Civil Engn, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",Hohai University; Hohai University; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; China University of Geosciences; University of Peshawar; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Ma, XY (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Minist Water Resources, Key Lab Hydrometeorol Disaster Mech & Warning, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China.;Ma, XY (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Hydrol & Water Resources, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China.",irfan.marwat@nuist.edu.cn; xyma@nuist.edu.cn; gyren@cug.edu.cn; jun.yin@nuist.edu.cn; 20195101007@nuist.edu.cn; sid.syed92@yahoo.com; lukaidong@nuist.edu.cn; yxing@nuist.edu.cn; vsingh@tamu.edu,"Ullah, Irfan/AEN-0985-2022","Ullah, Irfan/0000-0002-7374-7485; Ma, Xieyao/0000-0002-3936-2020",National Natural Science Foundation of China [41877158],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),The National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant/award number: 41877158) supported the present study.,,81,4,4,9,9,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2072-4292,,REMOTE SENS-BASEL,Remote Sens.,JUL,2022,13,,,,,,3219,10.3390/rs14133219,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs14133219,,,20,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,2V6AK,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000823926300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Recent advances in novel adsorbents, such as metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and advanced zeolites, with high sorption capacity at low humidity and facile regeneration, promise the development of efficient AWH technologies. However, a comprehensive thermodynamic analysis based on fundamental material properties to predict optimal operating parameters and system-level efficiency has not been pursued. In this work, we present a generalized theoretical framework to optimize the energetic performance of thermally-driven adsorption-based AWH systems using fundamental material properties, such as adsorption isotherms. Using example characteristics of recently reported MOFs (MOF-801, MOF-303, and Ni2Cl2 BTDD) with step-wise adsorption isotherms, we present AWH system-level theoretical efficiencies of each MOF based on the First and Second Law of Thermodynamics. We show the impact of heat source temperature from realistically achievable low-grade heat sources (up to 100 degrees C) on the overall efficiency. We also present the concept of a cascaded system which operates two adsorbent beds in series, and by capturing the condensation heat of the first bed, an increase in the overall efficiency can be achieved. At ambient conditions with relative humidities (RHs) below 40%, which is typical of arid climates, we show theoretical thermal (thermal energy to water conversion) and Second Law efficiencies of 0.33 and 0.18 with MOF-801 and MOF-303, and 0.56 and 0.19 with Ni2Cl2 BTDD, respectively. For the cascaded system, a thermal efficiency of 0.7 and Second Law efficiency of 0.23 can be achieved with Ni2Cl2 BTDD, over an order of magnitude greater than state-of-the-art refrigeration systems. Our framework presented can identify optimal operating parameters, and enable system-level predictions using materials properties for AWH and other related applications, including thermal energy storage, dehumidification, and desalination.

Various geophysical and biological processes generate underwater sounds at different frequencies. Using spectral, wavelet and statistical analysis, it becomes possible to distinguish almost all individual phenomena. This allows the assessment of, among other things, the rainfall intensity, various characteristics of wind-generated waves, abundance of marine organisms and shipping traffic. These issues are now relatively well-understood. What is more, for such studies hydroacoustic methods have been widely used for many years and provided satisfactory results. In the last decades, however, more and more attention is paid to sea-ice processes and properties, calving events and drifting icebergs. Melting ice and retreating tidewater glaciers are also sources of underwater ambient noise. This becomes more and more noticeable due to the observed climate shifts. Dynamic nature of these phenomena and harsh conditions encountered during field measurements still limit the progress in this area of research. In spite of all, recent preliminary studies show the possibility of using passive acoustic methods for both analyzing calving events in the Arctic fjords and investigating the behavior of icebergs. It became possible, for instance, to identify and describe various stages of calving processes: large rumbles, ice fractures, impacts on the water and iceberg oscillations. On the other hand, ambient noise related with freshwater outflows and sound propagation in the vicinity of glaciers are still unstudied. Moreover, underwater sounds associated with sea-ice processes occurring in small basins are also poorly understood, as well as their directivity and relationships with meteorological and oceanographic conditions. These topics require further investigation, which will enable the development of appropriate classification algorithms. For this purpose, new field experiments and methods of data analysis as well as state-of-the-art measuring devices are needed. A review of existing research articles concerning underwater cryogenic sounds is presented here, supplemented by a summary of the main gaps and suggested future needs.

However, two questions remain to be answered, including what is the practical performance of high-energy-density based pouch cells in all-climate and why has a charge cutoff voltage of >= 4.4 V still not been commercialized in NCM523-based cells. Herein, an similar to 2 Ah artificial graphite/LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (AGr/NCM523) pouch cell was developed, and the cell behaviors at 4.2 and 4.4 V under cold, room and hot temperature conditions were researched in detail. When charged to 4.4 V, a specific capacity of 185.7 mAh g(-1) was achieved, along with gravimetric and volumetric energy-densities of 261.9 Wh kg(-1) and 640.1 Wh L-1, respectively; additionally a similar rate and low-temperature (0, -10 and -20 degrees C) discharge capabilities were maintained at compared with those of the cell at 4.2 V. However, the practical applications of this 4.4 V AGr/NCM523 cell are hindered by its low storage stability at 70 degrees C and short service life upon cycling at 0, 25 and 45 degrees C. Various characterizations were employed to differentiate the contributions of the cutoff voltage to the cycling degradation mechanism. Results reveal that side reactions, especially electrolyte breakdown, increased at both the cathode and anode interphases, which notably increased the impedance and became the major reason for the capacity fade of the cell at 4.4 V. Notably, the damage to the interior structure of NCM523 was similar to that of NCM523 at 4.2 V. This fundamental and comprehensive understanding of NCM523 in a full cell will pave the way for optimizing state-of-the-art NCM523 materials and high-voltage LIBs. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

The perception of biodiversity and their linkages to the ecosystems functioning and human well-being may have significant impacts in terms of Biodiversity Education and Sustainable Development (BESD). Interdisciplinary and participatory research, have increasingly strong evidence in the biodiversity conservation awareness. In early childhood, however, certain challenges come around in the understanding of basic concepts of biology and ecology, and their combination with the areas of proximal development of children. This chapter explores the effectiveness of a participatory research at early childhood through a discovery process focused on biodiversity experience. We intended to explore how biological understanding of the biodiversity and ecological processes at early childhood may contribute to BESD awareness. The participatory research undertook a constructive programme, with the active collaboration of researchers from life sciences, humanities, science education, kindergarten teachers, children, and artists. The perceptions, evaluation, and validation of the approach are emphasised in the ateliers progressively designed, in the drawings by the children, in the documentation by the kindergarten teachers, and in the interviews to the children. The findings focused attention on the understanding of biological and ecological interactions, the adaptations to climate, the food and the products of the Mediterranean forests, and the biodiversity legacy in Mediterranean region. We highlight the construction of a conceptual design from the child's perspective that includes the children as actors/authors of knowledge, which resulted from mutual learning and active collaboration. The participatory research linked to real-life of children and local/regional context clearly contributed the extension to families and society. Moreover, the science-art collaborations did engage the children expressively. The paper concludes with remarks addressing the participatory research in early childhood to rise awarenes in BESD context, with attitude gains and lifelong outcomes.","[Miranda, Joao] Univ Coimbra, Ctr 20th Century Interdisciplinary Studies, Fac Arts & Humanities, Coimbra, Portugal; [Maricato, Raquel; Nova, Joana Vila; Baptista, Joana Margarida; Freitas, Nuno; Goncalves, Odete] Univ Coimbra, Serv Acao Social, Kindergarten JISASUC Jardim Infancia, Ave Dias da Silva 7, P-3030136 Coimbra, Portugal; [Monteiro, Joao Lourenco] Univ NOVA Lisboa, CIUHCT Interuniv Ctr Hist Sci & Technol, Dept Appl Social Sci, Fac Sci & Technol, Lisbon, Portugal; [Vale, Vera] ESEC, Coll Educ Coimbra, Rua Dom Joao 3 Solum, P-3030329 Coimbra, Portugal; [Azul, Anabela Marisa] Univ Coimbra, CNC Ctr Neurosci & Cell Biol, Polo 1,Edificio FMUC,Rua Larga, P-3004517 Coimbra, Portugal",Universidade de Coimbra; Universidade de Coimbra; Universidade Nova de Lisboa; Instituto Politecnico de Coimbra (IPC); Escola Superior Educacao Coimbra; Universidade de Coimbra,"Azul, AM (corresponding author), Univ Coimbra, CNC Ctr Neurosci & Cell Biol, Polo 1,Edificio FMUC,Rua Larga, P-3004517 Coimbra, Portugal.",amjrazul@ci.uc.pt,"Azul, Anabela Marisa/AFP-5802-2022","Azul, Anabela Marisa/0000-0003-3295-1284; Miranda, Joao/0000-0002-4720-3724",,,,,23,0,0,1,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",2199-7373,,978-3-319-32318-3; 978-3-319-32317-6,WORLD SUSTAIN SER,,,2016,,,,,265,285,,10.1007/978-3-319-32318-3_17,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-32318-3_17,10.1007/978-3-319-32318-3,,21,Education & Educational Research,Book Citation Index – Social Sciences & Humanities (BKCI-SSH),Education & Educational Research,BI2PL,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000409551700018,View Full Record in Web of Science

Increasing research activities have been carried out towards alternative viable biofuel sources. Of several different biofuel platforms, cyanobacteria possess great potential, for their ability to accumulate biomass tens of times faster than traditional oilseed crops. The cyanobacterium Cyanothece sp. ATCC 51142 has recently attracted lots of research interest as a model organism for such research. Cyanothece can perform efficiently both photosynthesis and nitrogen fixation within the same cell, and has been recently shown to produce biohydrogen-a byproduct of nitrogen fixation-at very high rates of several folds higher than previously described hydrogen-producing photosynthetic microbes. Since the key enzyme for nitrogen fixation is very sensitive to oxygen produced by photosynthesis, Cyanothece employs a sophisticated temporal separation scheme, where nitrogen fixation occurs at night and photosynthesis at day. At the core of this temporal separation scheme is a robust clocking mechanism, which so far has not been thoroughly studied. Understanding how this circadian clock interacts with and harmonizes global transcription of key cellular processes is one of the keys to realize the inherent potential of this organism. Results: In this paper, we employ several state of the art bioinformatics techniques for studying the core circadian clock in Cyanothece sp. ATCC 51142, and its interactions with other key cellular processes. We employ comparative genomics techniques to map the circadian clock genes and genetic interactions from another cyanobacterial species, namely Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942, of which the circadian clock has been much more thoroughly investigated. Using time series gene expression data for Cyanothece, we employ gene regulatory network reconstruction techniques to learn this network de novo, and compare the reconstructed network against the interactions currently reported in the literature. Next, we build a computational model of the interactions between the core clock and other cellular processes, and show how this model can predict the behaviour of the system under changing environmental conditions. The constructed models significantly advance our understanding of the Cyanothece circadian clock functional mechanisms.","[Nguyen Xuan Vinh; Chetty, Madhu] Monash Univ, Gippsland Sch Informat Technol, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Coppel, Ross] Monash Univ, Dept Microbiol, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Gaudana, Sandeep; Wangikar, Pramod P.] Indian Inst Technol, Dept Chem Engn, Bombay 400076, Maharashtra, India",Federation University Australia; Monash University; Monash University; Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Bombay,"Vinh, NX (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Gippsland Sch Informat Technol, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia.",vinh.nguyen@monash.edu; madhu.chetty@monash.edu,"Coppel, Ross L/A-6626-2008","Coppel, Ross L/0000-0002-4476-9124; Chetty, Madhu/0000-0001-7052-0413",,,,,16,3,4,0,22,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1471-2105,,,BMC BIOINFORMATICS,BMC Bioinformatics,21-Jan,2013,,,,,,,S14,10.1186/1471-2105-14-S2-S14,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-14-S2-S14,,,9,Biochemical Research Methods; Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Mathematical & Computational Biology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Mathematical & Computational Biology,083MK,23368635,"Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000314468200014,View Full Record in Web of Science

These data can be provided by existing weather station networks. However, the spatial resolution of such networks is generally coarse for renewable energy applications because of the relatively high installation and operational costs. Moreover, most of the existing stations do not provide information about the full range of the variables required for the wind energy applications. These limitations inevitably lead to the exploitation of different data sources and to employment of simulation techniques for the assessment of wind resources. Numerical weather prediction (NWP) models are considered to be a valuable tool for this purpose. In this study we evaluated the performance of the state-of-the-art Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) NWP model in simulating wind. The WRF was implemented for an entire year, providing hourly meteorological data on a 6 km resolution domain focusing on Greece. Surface and upper-air observations were ingested into the model at 6 h intervals, using an advanced three-dimensional variational data assimilation system (WRF-Var). The model results for wind speed were compared against data from twenty surface synoptic weather stations, located within Greece, to determine the bias and root mean squared error of the modeling system in terms of wind prediction. Wind speed histograms were also used for the verification of the simulated wind climate. The evaluation revealed an overall satisfactory performance of the modeling system. The wind regime of the study area was simulated reasonably well, although the model showed a slight tendency to overestimate the occurrences of high wind speeds. Overall, the obtained results suggest that the WRF model is a promising tool for wind resource mapping. The exploitation of this tool is of great significance for assessing renewable resources, especially in areas like Greece, which are characterized by complex terrain and low spatial coverage of weather station networks.","[Giannaros, T.

Because of the underlying climatic changes and thus environmental alterations, the area was the scene for various cultural developments during the period under investigation. In the course of the melting of the glaciers at the end of the last Ice Age, isostatic and eustatic movements caused continual changes to the Baltic Sea basin. Changes in water level, however, affected not only the Early and Mid-Holocene coastlines, but also the whole Baltic Sea drainage system, including large lakes, rivers and watersheds in the hinterland were also dramatically impacted by these ecological changes. Prehistoric people were thus affected by changes in resource availability and reduction or enlargement of their territories, respectively. In order to evaluate the impact of changes in the water and land networks on the environment, resource availability, and human behaviour, and to reconstruct human responses to these changes, we pursue an interdisciplinary approach connecting environmental and archaeological research highlighted through different case studies.

For this, the observed aerosol size distributions, chemical composition, and vertical-velocity distribution are introduced into a state-of-the-art cloud droplet parameterization to show that cloud maximum supersaturations in the region range from 0.02 % to 0.52 %, with an average of 0.14 +/- 0.05 %. Based on these low values of supersaturation, the majority of activated droplets correspond to particles with a dry diameter of 90 nm and above. An important finding is that the standard deviation of the vertical velocity (sigma(w)) exhibits considerable diurnal variability (ranging from 0.16 m s(-1 )during nighttime to over 1.2 m s(-1) during day), and it tends to covary with total aerosol number (N-a). This sigma(w)-N-a covariance amplifies the predicted response in cloud droplet number (N-d) to N-a increases by 3 to 5 times compared to expectations based on N-a changes alone. This amplified response is important given that droplet formation is often velocity-limited and therefore should normally be insensitive to aerosol changes. We also find that N-d cannot exceed a characteristic concentration that depends solely on sigma(w). Correct consideration of sigma(w) and its covariance with time and N-a is important for fully understanding aerosol-cloud interactions and the magnitude of the aerosol indirect effect. Given that model assessments of aerosol-cloud-climate interactions do not routinely evaluate for overall turbulence or its covariance with other parameters, datasets and analyses such as the one presented here are of the highest priority to address unresolved sources of hydrometeor variability, bias, and the response of droplet number to aerosol perturbations.","[Bougiatioti, Aikaterini] Natl Observ Athens, Inst Environm Res & Sustainable Dev, Palea Penteli 15236, Greece; [Bougiatioti, Aikaterini; Nenes, Athanasios; Lin, Jack J.] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Earth & Atmospher Sci, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Nenes, Athanasios] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Sch Architecture Civil & Environm Engn, Lab Atmospher Proc & Their Impacts, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Nenes, Athanasios] Fdn Res & Technol Hellas, Inst Chem Engn Sci, Patras 26504, Greece; [Brock, Charles A.; de Gouw, Joost A.; Liao, Jin; Middlebrook, Ann M.; Welti, Andre] NOAA, Chem Sci Lab, Boulder, CO 80305 USA; [de Gouw, Joost A.; Liao, Jin; Welti, Andre] Univ Colorado, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Lin, Jack J.] Univ Oulu, Nano & Mol Syst Res Unit, Oulu 90014, Finland; [de Gouw, Joost A.] Univ Colorado, Dept Chem & Biochem, Campus Box 215, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Liao, Jin] NASA, Atmospher Chem & Dynam Lab, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; [Liao, Jin] Univ Space Res Assoc, GESTAR, Columbia, MD 21046 USA; [Welti, Andre] Finnish Meteorol Inst, Atmospher Composit Res Unit, Helsinki 00560, Finland",National Observatory of Athens; University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne; Foundation for Research & Technology - Hellas (FORTH); Institute of Chemical Engineering Sciences (ICE-HT); National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; University of Oulu; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; Universities Space Research Association (USRA); Finnish Meteorological Institute,"Bougiatioti, A (corresponding author), Natl Observ Athens, Inst Environm Res & Sustainable Dev, Palea Penteli 15236, Greece.;Bougiatioti, A; Nenes, A (corresponding author), Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Earth & Atmospher Sci, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.;Nenes, A (corresponding author), Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Sch Architecture Civil & Environm Engn, Lab Atmospher Proc & Their Impacts, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.;Nenes, A (corresponding author), Fdn Res & Technol Hellas, Inst Chem Engn Sci, Patras 26504, Greece.",abougiat@noa.gr; athanasios.nenes@epfl.ch,"de Gouw, Joost/A-9675-2008; Middlebrook, Ann M/E-4831-2011; Nenes, Athanasios/ABE-6478-2020; Welti, André/J-8425-2013; Lin, Jack Jie/P-4970-2017; Brock, Charles/G-3406-2011","de Gouw, Joost/0000-0002-0385-1826; Middlebrook, Ann M/0000-0002-2984-6304; Nenes, Athanasios/0000-0003-3873-9970; Welti, André/0000-0002-3549-1212; Lin, Jack Jie/0000-0002-4453-1263; Brock, Charles/0000-0002-4033-4668",US Environmental Protection Agency (STAR grant) [R835410]; General Secretariat for Research and Technology (Supporting of Postdoctoral Researchers action of the Operational Program Education and Lifelong Learning); H2020 European Research Council (PyroTRACH) [726165],US Environmental Protection Agency (STAR grant); General Secretariat for Research and Technology (Supporting of Postdoctoral Researchers action of the Operational Program Education and Lifelong Learning); H2020 European Research Council (PyroTRACH),";This research has been supported by the US Environmental Protection Agency (STAR grant no.

In these models, however, the boundary layer turbulence and boundary layer cloud features are still grossly underresolved. Underresolution is also present in climate models that use a multiscale modeling framework (MMF), in which a convection-permitting model is run in each grid column of a global general circulation model. To better represent boundary layer clouds and turbulence in convection-permitting models, a parameterization was developed that models the joint probability density function (PDF) of vertical velocity, heat, and moisture. Although PDF-based parameterizations are more complex and computationally expensive than many other parameterizations, in principle PDF parameterizations have several advantages. For instance, they ensure consistency of liquid (cloud) water and cloud fraction; they avoid using, separate parameterizations for different cloud types such as cumulus and stratocumulus; and they have an appropriate formulation in the terra incognita in which updrafts are marginally resolved. In this paper, an implementation of a PDF parameterization is tested to see whether it improves the simulations of a state-of-the-art convection-permitting model. The PDF parameterization used is the Cloud Layers Unified By Binormals (CLUBB) parameterization. The host cloud-resolving model used is the System for Atmospheric Modeling (SAM). SAM is run both with and without CLUBB implemented in it. Simulations of two shallow cumulus (Cu) cases and two shallow stratocumulus (Sc) cases are run in a 3D configuration at 2-, 4-, and 16-km horizontal grid spacings. Including CLUBB in the simulations improves some of the simulated fields-such as vertical velocity variance, horizontal wind fields, cloud water content, and drizzle water content-especially in the two Cu cases. Implementing CLUBB in SAM improves the simulations slightly at 2-km horizontal grid spacing, significantly at 4-km grid spacing, and greatly at 16-km grid spacing. Furthermore, the simulations that include CLUBB exhibit a reduced sensitivity to horizontal grid spacing.","[Larson, Vincent E.] Univ Wisconsin Milwaukee, Dept Math Sci, Milwaukee, WI 53211 USA; [Wang, Minghuai; Ovchinnikov, Mikhail; Ghan, Steven] Pacific NW Natl Lab, Richland, WA 99352 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Milwaukee; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Pacific Northwest National Laboratory,"Larson, VE (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin Milwaukee, Dept Math Sci, POB 413, Milwaukee, WI 53211 USA.",vlarson@uwm.edu,"Ghan, Steven/H-4301-2011; Wang, Minghuai/E-5390-2011","Ghan, Steven/0000-0001-8355-8699; Wang, Minghuai/0000-0002-9179-228X; Ovchinnikov, Mikhail/0000-0002-7939-1299",NASA [NNX07AI56G]; DOE by Battelle Memorial Institute [DE-AC06-76RLO1830]; Battelle Memorial Institute [47164],NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); DOE by Battelle Memorial Institute(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Battelle Memorial Institute,"The authors are grateful to Dr. Marat Khairoutdinov for the use of his numerical model, SAM.

Almost every island was visited between Houtman Abrolhos and The Pages (n = 255), many of them more than once. Sea lions breed on at least 50 islands, 27 in Western Australia and 23 in South Australia. Of the 50 breeding sites, 31 have not been reported previously. A further 19 islands may also support breeding colonies. A total of 1,941 pups was counted and pup production was estimated at 2,432. Only five colonies produced more than 100 pups each and they accounted for almost half of the pup production. Most of these colonies are near Kangaroo Island, South Australia. A breeding cycle of 17-18 months has been reported for N. cinerea at Kangaroo Island and on the west coast of Western Australia; this was also noted at another 11 islands where repeated visits coincided with breeding. No evidence was found for breeding seasons shorter or longer than 17-18 months. The breeding season was not synchronized between islands, as it is in other pinnipeds. A predictive model is developed to estimate the population size from pup production figures. It indicates that pup numbers should be multiplied by between 3.81 and 4.81 to estimate the total population size just before the pupping season begins. This leads to estimates of 9,300- 11,700 for the total population, considerably greater than earlier estimates. Causes of the unique reproductive cycle of N. cinerea art unknown, but we hypothesize that it results from living in a temperate climate in some of the most biologically depauperate waters of the world. It is also clear that day length and water temperature cannot act as exogenous cues for implantation of the blastocyst; the physiological events of gestation must, rather, be cued endogenously.","MURDOCH UNIV,SCH VET STUDIES,MURDOCH,WA 6150,AUSTRALIA; CSIRO,DIV WILDLIFE & ECOL,LYNEHAM,ACT 2602,AUSTRALIA; S AUSTRALIAN NATL PKS & WILDLIFE SERV,KINGSCOTE,SA 5223,AUSTRALIA",Murdoch University; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),,,"Shaughnessy, Peter/AAG-6689-2021",,,,,,47,81,88,0,41,OXFORD UNIV PRESS UNITED KINGDOM,OXFORD,"WALTON ST JOURNALS DEPT, OXFORD, ENGLAND OX2 6DP",0952-8369,,,J ZOOL,J.

Empirical measurements of water consumption of major crops in this region are scarce but crucial to assess agricultural water use dynamics in the light of increasing regional water conflicts. We empirically quantify total crop water use (CWU) and water footprints (WFs) of rainfed upland rice (wet season) and groundwater-irrigated melons (dry season) grown sequentially as a double cropping system, one of the major cropping systems in the seasonally dry province of Guanacaste in northwestern Costa Rica. Data for this study cover 2years and were measured with a state-of-the-art eddy covariance water and carbon flux station. Upland rice only consumed green water (CWUgreen=383L/m(2)), while melons only consumed blue water (CWUblue=177L/m(2)). Irrigation was found to be 1.5 times larger than the actual melon water consumption, with better irrigation efficiencies than reported for melon farms in Brazil but slightly inferior to farms in Spain. Melon WFblue was 79m(3)/t, a much lower value than global and regional estimates reported but similar to values reported for melons produced in Brazil or Spain. Upland rice WFgreen (681m(3)/t) was reported for the first time and was proven to be much lower than flood irrigated-rice WFblue-green. Our results demonstrated lower overall water demand for upland rice-melon double crop compared to the two other major monocultures of the region (flood-irrigated rice and irrigated sugar cane). Plain Language Summary Agricultural intensification is occurring in seasonally dry tropical areas. At the same time, droughts are becoming more severe due to climate change in many tropical regions. Empirical measurements of water usage in agriculture and water use efficiency are scarce in the tropics but are critical to achieving sustainable water management and resilient agricultural systems. We instrumented a production farm in the seasonally dry Guanacaste province of Costa Rica to measure agricultural water use for a regionally widespread double cropping system composed of irrigated melons and rainfed rice grown sequentially during the dry and wet seasons, respectively. For rice, 681m(3) of rainwater was used per ton of yield, which is much less water than the water used to produce rice in flooded fields. Seventy-nine cubic meters of irrigated water was used per ton of melons, which is similar to values reported for melons produced in Brazil or Spain. Irrigation of melons was found to be 1.5 times larger than crop water consumption during the dry season, and irrigation efficiencies were similar to Brazilian melon farms but slightly inferior to Spanish farms. We showed that the studied system used considerably less water than did two principal monocultures in the region (irrigated rice and irrigated sugar cane). This cropping system seems a competitive option for the Central American wet-dry tropics in terms of water use.","[Morillas, L.] Univ British Columbia, Fac Land & Food Syst, Ctr Sustainable Food Syst, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Hund, S.

Design/methodology/approach The authors' approach has several steps. The first is textual analysis. To detect the dominating topics in the news, the authors use Latent Dirichlet allocation. The authors use bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) pretrained on financial news corpus to evaluate the tonality of articles. The second is evaluation of feature importance. To this end, a linear regression with robust estimators and Classification and Regression Tree and Random Forest are used. The third is data. The text data consists of 345,731 news articles from Thomson Reuters related to the USA in the date range from 1 January 2011 to 31 May 2018. The data contains all the possible topics from the website, excluding anything related to sports. The sample of 386 initial public offerings completed in the USA from 1 January 2011 to 31 May 2018 was collected from Bloomberg Database. Findings The authors found that sentiment of the media regarding the companies going public influences IPO underpricing. Some topics, namely, the climate change and environmental policies and the trade war between the US and China, have influence on IPO underpricing if they appear in the media prior to the IPO day. Originality/value The puzzle of IPO underpricing is studied from the point of Narrative Economics theory for the first time. While most of the works cover only some specific news segment, we use Thomson Reuters news aggregator, which uses such sources The New York Post, CNN, Fox, Atlantic, The Washington Post ? Buzzfeed. To evaluate the sentiment of the articles, a state-of-the-art approach BERT is used. The hypothesis that some common narratives or topics in the public discussion may impose influence on such example of biased behaviour like IPO underpricing has also found confirmation.","[Fedorova, Elena] Financial Univ Govt Russian Federat, Moscow, Russia; [Druchok, Sergei] Natl Res Univ Higher Sch Econ, Moscow, Russia; [Drogovoz, Pavel] Bauman Moscow State Tech Univ, Moscow, Russia",Financial University Under the Government of Russian Federation; HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics); Bauman Moscow State Technical University,"Fedorova, E (corresponding author), Financial Univ Govt Russian Federat, Moscow, Russia.",ecolena@mail.ru,"Drogovoz, Pavel/F-4594-2015","Drogovoz, Pavel/0000-0003-2560-7944",,,,,64,3,3,3,8,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1834-7649,1758-9037,,INT J ACCOUNT INF MA,Int.

More research is needed to enable nurses and other medical staff to use singing and music-based interventions, to access singing-based programmes, and promote a greater use of choirs in nursing homes. A solid basis of positive experiences and feedback through evidence in practice is required to help promote support for such activities. Aims: To identify, explore and describe experiences, attitudes, beliefs, issues, processes and changes among nurses, carers and leaders in reference to implementation of the educational programme 'Singing Nursing Homes', Norway. To increase knowledge and understanding of how an educational song programme could become an integral part of nursing practice and quality of care in nursing and care homes, and identify why this would be constructive. Since its inception in 2015, 'Singing Norway' wanted to offer a professional, evidence-based programme for nursing homes throughout the country. Methods: A longitudinal, qualitative and explorative approach. In-depth interviews and focus group interviews of female employees (n = 19) from three nursing homes in Norway, 2018. Results: Nursing home employees perceived singing to have potential benefits for their patients, such as reducing uneasiness, increased comfort, well-being and joy, improved sleep, and believed singing had the potential to reduce the need for medication and prevent accidents among their patients. By facilitating opportunities for learning and practice, staff in nursing homes were able to use singing as part of their 'art of caring', enhancing environmental care for the older person. Singing was found to have positive effects for the patients, their relatives and the staff, which improved the psychosocial working climate overall. Conclusions: Singing interventions could be a vital component for the enhancement of health, well-being and quality of life for the patients and staff in nursing homes.","[Batt-Rawden, Kari Bjerke] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Hlth Sci Gjovik, Gjovik, Norway; [Stedje, Kristi] Univ Coll Mus, Dept Music & Hlth, Oslo, Norway",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Batt-Rawden, KB (corresponding author), Teknologiveien 21, N-2815 Gjovik, Norway.",Kari.batt-rawden@ntnu.no,,"Stedje, Kristi/0000-0002-9187-9705",,,,,69,2,2,3,22,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1744-9871,1744-988X,,J RES NURS,J.

J,"Obermeister, N",,,,"Obermeister, Noam",,,Tapping into science advisers' learning,PALGRAVE COMMUNICATIONS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,POLICY; SCIENTISTS; EXPERTISE; SOCIETY; ADVICE; ROLES; HEART,"The art and craft of science advice is not innately known by those scientists who choose to step out of the lab or the university to engage with the world of policy. Despite a wealth of literature on the 'science of science advice', in nearly every situation there is no 'teacher' of science advice; it is a typical case of learning on the job. Within that context, the learning of scholars engaging in expert advice is always situated and can sometimes be transformative. To date, however, there has been no systematic, in-depth research into expert advisers' learning-instead focusing mostly on policymakers' and publics' learning about science. In this article, I suggest that such a research programme is timely and potentially a very fruitful line of inquiry for two mains reasons. First, in the case of environmental and climate issues-the focus of the paper-it has become ubiquitous to talk about the need for transformative change(s) towards sustainable futures. If scholars are going to advocate for and inform transformations beyond academia, then in doing so they ought to also take a harder look at how they themselves are transforming within. Specifically, the article illustrates how qualitative research on advisers' learning can contribute to our understanding of how experts are adapting to changing circumstances in science-policy interactions. Second, it is argued that research on advisers' learning can directly contribute to: (i) guidance for present and future advisers (especially early-career researchers wishing to engage with policy) and organisational learning in science-policy organisations; and (ii) improving policy-relevance of research and the design of impact evaluations for research funding (e.g. Research Excellence Framework). With the hope of stimulating (rather than closing off) innovative ideas, the article offers some ways of thinking through and carrying out such a research programme. As the nature of both science and policymaking continues to change, the learning experiences of expert advisers is a bountiful resource that has yet to be tapped into.","[Obermeister, Noam] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge, England",University of Cambridge,"Obermeister, N (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Cambridge, England.",no291@cam.ac.uk,,"Obermeister, Noam/0000-0001-7738-9462",Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) Doctoral Training Partnership at the University of Cambridge,Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) Doctoral Training Partnership at the University of Cambridge,"I am grateful for the scholarship provided by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) Doctoral Training Partnership at the University of Cambridge, without which this work would not have been possible.

Net ecosystem carbon exchange (NEE), which is affected by a bunch of meteorological variables to different extent, helps to gauge the balance of the carbon cycle between biological organisms and atmosphere. In this study, the NEE data is collected from two flux measuring sites. Gradient boosting regression algorithm is employed to predict NEE based on the meteorology and flux data from site UK-Gri. During the training process, KFold cross-validation algorithm is implemented to avoid overfitting, and random forest algorithm is implemented to identify the important variables influencing NEE mostly. The four most important variables are found to be global radiation, photosynthetic active radiation, minimum soil temperature, and latent heat. The regression model was compared with three state-of-the-art prediction models: support vector machine, stochastic gradient descent, and bayesian ridge to verify its performance. The experimental results show that this regression model outperforms the other three models, and gives higher value of R-squared, lower values of mean absolute error and root mean squared error. To verify the regression model's generalization ability, the data from the second flux site, NL-Loo, was employed, and the hybrid data of the two sites was used. The results show that this model performs well on the hybrid data, too. In practical terms, the gradient boosting regression model provides many tunable hypterparameters and loss functions, which make it more flexible and accurate compared to the other three models. This study has conclusively demonstrated for the first time that the combination of gradient boosting regression and random forest models should be considered as valuable tools to make effective prediction for NEE and acquire reliable important variables influencing NEE mostly. The methodologies could be useful in the research fields of ecosystem stability evaluation, environmental restoration, trend analysis of climate change, and global warming monitoring.","[Cai, Jianchao] China Univ Petr, State Key Lab Petr Resources & Prospecting, Beijing 102249, Peoples R China; [Cai, Jianchao; Xu, Kai] China Univ Geosci, Inst Geophys & Geomat, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China; [Hu, Fang; Li, Liuhuan] Hubei Univ Chinese Med, Coll Informat Engn, Wuhan 430065, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Yanhui] Univ West Florida, Dept Math & Stat, Pensacola, FL 32514 USA",China University of Petroleum; China University of Geosciences; Hubei University of Chinese Medicine; State University System of Florida; University of West Florida,"Hu, F (corresponding author), Hubei Univ Chinese Med, Coll Informat Engn, Wuhan 430065, Peoples R China.",naomifang@hbtcm.edu.cn,"Cai, Jianchao/B-7047-2012; Zhu, Yanhui/GPC-8784-2022; Hu, Fang/L-3343-2019","Cai, Jianchao/0000-0003-2950-888X; Hu, Fang/0000-0002-3725-2936","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41722403]; Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province [2018CFB259, 2018CFA051]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2462019YJRC011]; CDIAC Ecosystem Thematic Center; ICOS Ecosystem Thematic Center; OzFlux office; ChinaFlux office; AsiaFlux office",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province(Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); CDIAC Ecosystem Thematic Center; ICOS Ecosystem Thematic Center; OzFlux office; ChinaFlux office; AsiaFlux office,"We acknowledge the funding supportted by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41722403), the Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province (2018CFB259, 2018CFA051), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (2462019YJRC011).

Water storage in soils of the Plateau has direct impacts on food security, human health and ecosystem function. Despite extensive research on the behavior and function of soil water in the Plateau, there is no state-of-the-art review that presents research achievements, gaps and future perspectives. This paper reviews the advances in soil water research and highlights future research needs and challenges in the Loess Plateau, and thereby provides informed decision on sustainable water management. We report that considerable efforts have been made to investigate: i) soil water movement and hydraulic property estimation in the typical loess regions; ii) spatial and temporal variations in soil water content and storage at multiple scales; iii) dried soil layers induced by excessive water use from unreasonable artificial revegetation; and iv) soil water availability and water carrying capacity of typical vegetation types on the Loess Plateau. These studies have greatly enhanced our understanding about the fundamental characteristics, spatio-temporal patterns and natural and anthropogenic controls of soil water distribution and water cycles in the Loess Plateau, which in turn have important implications for the regulation and management of water resources toward sustainable ecological construction. Based on the identified key issues and future research priorities, recommendations were drawn to address unsolved problems, including: i) processes and mechanisms controlling water transport and interactions within the groundwater-soil-plant-atmosphere continuum; ii) how soil hydrological processes couple nutrient cycles in response to climate change and human activities; and iii) development of quantitative models across spatial scales for modeling changes in thresholds of soil water carrying capacity for vegetation. The incorporation of research findings into policy and practice can improve soil water management that will in turn significantly benefit the promotion of ecosystem services and functions in the Loess Plateau.","[Huang, Laiming; Shao, Ming'an] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Ecosyst Network Observat & Modeling, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Huang, Laiming; Shao, Ming'an] Northwest A&F Univ, State Key Lab Soil Eros & Dryland Farming Loess P, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Huang, Laiming; Shao, Ming'an] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Resources & Environm, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Northwest A&F University - China; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Shao, MA (corresponding author), Northwest A&F Univ, State Key Lab Soil Eros & Dryland Farming Loess P, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",mashao@ms.iswc.ac.cn,,,"Ministry of Science and Technology of China [2016YFC0501605]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41601221, 41571130051]; Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA23070200]; Youth Innovation Promotion Association of Chinese Academy of Sciences [2019052]; Bingwei Outstanding Young Talent Project from Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research [2017RC203]; Key Laboratory of Ecosystem Network Observation and Modeling, Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences [LENOM2016Q0001]","Ministry of Science and Technology of China(Ministry of Science and Technology, China); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); Youth Innovation Promotion Association of Chinese Academy of Sciences; Bingwei Outstanding Young Talent Project from Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research; Key Laboratory of Ecosystem Network Observation and Modeling, Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences","This study was supported by projects from the Ministry of Science and Technology of China (Grant no. 2016YFC0501605), National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant no. 41601221 and 41571130051), Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDA23070200), Youth Innovation Promotion Association of Chinese Academy of Sciences (2019052), Bingwei Outstanding Young Talent Project from Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research (Grant no. 2017RC203) and Youth Innovation Research Team Project from Key Laboratory of Ecosystem Network Observation and Modeling, Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences (Grant no.

Simulation models provide excellent instruments for researchers to gain more insight into relevant processes and best agricultural practices and provide tools for planners for decision making support. The extent to which models are capable of reliable extrapolation and prediction is important for exploring new farming systems or assessing the impacts of future land and climate changes. A performance assessment was conducted by testing six detailed state-of-the-art models for simulation of nitrate leaching (ARMOSA, COUPMODEL, DAISY, EPIC, SIMWASER/STOTRASIM, SWAP/ANIMO) for lysimeter data of the Wagna experimental field station in Eastern Austria, where the soil is highly vulnerable to nitrate leaching. Three consecutive phases were distinguished to gain insight in the predictive power of the models: 1) a blind test for 2005-2008 in which only soil hydraulic characteristics, meteorological data and information about the agricultural management were accessible; 2) a calibration for the same period in which essential information on field observations was additionally available to the modellers; and 3) a validation for 2009-2011 with the corresponding type of data available as for the blind test. A set of statistical metrics (mean absolute error, root mean squared error, index of agreement, model efficiency, root relative squared error, Pearson's linear correlation coefficient) was applied for testing the results and comparing the models. None of the models performed good for all of the statistical metrics. Models designed for nitrate leaching in high-input farming systems had difficulties in accurately predicting leaching in low-input farming systems that are strongly influenced by the retention of nitrogen in catch crops and nitrogen fixation by legumes. An accurate calibration does not guarantee a good predictive power of the model. Nevertheless all models were able to identify years and crops with high- and low-leaching rates.

The global gap between sustainable water supply and water demand is expected to grow above 2,700 km(3) by 2030, equivalent to 40% of total water demand. Desalination is an established method to make fresh water-mostly as a last resort. Its contribution to water supply is minor on a global scale. In some regions, though, it is difficult to imagine a sufficient water supply without desalination. But is this technical fix sustainable? In its main part, this paper sheds light on the major issues that call the sustainability of desalination into question. Examination of a number of criteria indicates that the energy demand for desalination is by far the most important issue. Further relevant impacts are wastewater discharges, waste disposal and visual impact. In retrospect, it is noted that energy demand has already shaped today's desalination market, since energy-efficient membrane-based desalination technology has gained market share compared with the more energy-intensive thermal desalination technologies. This development has been supported by a substantial decrease in the specific energy demand of seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) plants. As a result, state-of-the-art SWRO plants require approximately 3-5 kWh/m(3) compared to some 10 kWh/m(3) or more two or three decades ago. But almost all desalination plants are powered by fossil energy resources. Hence, using renewable energy (RE) resources instead would be a big step forward towards sustainability. Case studies prepared for three projects in the MENA region demonstrate that selecting RE sources for a desalination plant is economically feasible when compared to non-subsidized fossil fuel. This paper is based on our viewpoint as engineering consultants. It is a summary of studies, reports and surveys conducted on this issue by us in past years. It is intended to give an idea of the options that are available today to make seawater desalination sustainable.","[Baten, Rudolf; Stummeyer, Karen] Fichtner GmbH & Co KG, D-70191 Stuttgart, Germany",,"Stummeyer, K (corresponding author), Fichtner GmbH & Co KG, Sarweystr 3, D-70191 Stuttgart, Germany.",karen.stummeyer@fichtner.de,,,,,,,9,17,17,0,68,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"325 CHESTNUT ST, SUITE 800, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1944-3994,,,DESALIN WATER TREAT,Desalin.

In CCS schemes, carbon dioxide is captured from anthropogenic sources and transported to suitable sites either for EOR (Enhanced Oil Recovery) or storage. Globally, the largest source Of CO2 is from power generation, therefore the initial projects proposed for CCS in the UK are from power plant. There are various technologies for capturing CO2 from power stations, however the captured CO2 can contain significant amounts of impurities. The presence of the impurities in the CO2 stream has an effect on the requirements for pipeline transportation and can change such factors as the flow properties, the decompression characteristics and the solubility of water in the mixture. Although transport Of CO2 by pipeline is not new technology, and has been implemented in the USA for over 30 years, the effect of these impurities is not fully understood. The UK is in the advantageous position of having natural sinks for CO2 available offshore in the North and Irish Sea, which can be used for either EOR or storage. Therefore CCS implementation in the UK will involve transport of anthropogenic carbon dioxide from power stations to offshore sinks. All of the current experience with CO2 pipeline transport has been onshore, predominantly from near pure natural sources and therefore this is also a new challenge. This state-of the-art review paper will: discuss the key technical factors presented by the transport Of CO2 from power plant, including the effects of impurities on the design and operation of pipelines, compare and contrast the current experience of transporting CO2 onshore with the proposed transport onshore and offshore in the UK and identify the technical and regulatory challenges, present the results of initial modelling work to demonstrate the effects of the key variables on the development of a CO2 transport system in the UK.","Newcastle Univ, Sch Marine Sci & Technol, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England",Newcastle University - UK,"Race, JM (corresponding author), Newcastle Univ, Sch Marine Sci & Technol, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England.",,,"Race, Julia/0000-0002-1567-3617",,,,,49,4,4,0,4,AMER SOC MECHANICAL ENGINEERS,NEW YORK,"THREE PARK AVENUE, NEW YORK, NY 10016-5990 USA",,,978-0-7918-4269-0,,,,2007,,,,,589,602,,,,,,14,"Engineering, Marine; Engineering, Ocean; Engineering, Petroleum; Engineering, Mechanical; Engineering, Geological",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Engineering,BGP39,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000249558900060,View Full Record in Web of Science

The literature shows conclusively that the reduction targets of the Baltic Sea Action Plan (BSAP) could be achieved at considerably lower cost, if countries would cooperate to implement the least costly abatement plan. Focusing on phosphorus abatement could be prudent as the often recommended measures-wastewater treatment and wetlands-abate nitrogen too. An implication of our review is that the potential for restoring the Baltic Sea to good health is undermined by an abatement strategy that is more costly than necessary and likely to be perceived as unfair by several countries.

In times of climate emergency and the dawn of a new geological era known as the Anthropocene, dogma becomes particularly disabling and dangerous for business and management. However, recent research findings in the study of creativity and imagination in management learning and education provide some promising ways of responding. Here I draw on techniques in experiential learning and contribute to the call for disciplined imagination (Weick, 1989) to explore what can be learned from the study of film for stimulating classroom creativity. The paper is devoted to a close analysis of Leviathan (2012), an experiential and avant-garde contemporary masterpiece in ethnographic filmmaking. I find that existing approaches to creativity need to be supplemented with greater attention to the technological apparatus of cinema and its affective materialities. Drawing on the work of Gilles Deleuze, this essay shows that cinema can produce what we call an event of thought. This requires the generation of original concepts, and we propose  becoming Go-Pro to best harness the affects and heightened existential awareness stimulated by Leviathan and to help delimit the contours of this event. With this concept, we produce findings that challenge prevailing concepts of reason and rationality in management studies.","[O'Doherty, Damian] Univ Manchester, Manchester, Lancs, England",University of Manchester,"O'Doherty, D (corresponding author), Univ Manchester, Manchester, Lancs, England.",,"O'Doherty, Damian/AAS-8245-2020",,,,,,143,2,2,7,11,ACAD MANAGEMENT,BRIARCLIFF MANOR,"PACE UNIV, PO BOX 3020, 235 ELM RD, BRIARCLIFF MANOR, NY 10510-8020 USA",1537-260X,,,ACAD MANAG LEARN EDU,Acad.

To achieve this, policy-driven scenarios need to be evaluated with available data and models to explore trade-offs with robust accounting for the uncertainty in predictions. We developed a novel model ensemble using four complementary state-of-the-art agroecosystems models to explore the impacts of land management change. The ensemble was used to simulate key agricultural and environmental outputs under various scenarios for the upper River Taw observatory, UK. Scenarios assumed (i) reducing livestock production whilst simultaneously increasing the area of arable where it is feasible to cultivate (PG2A), (ii) reducing livestock production whilst simultaneously increasing bioenergy production in areas of the catchment that are amenable to growing bioenergy crops (PG2BE) and (iii) increasing both arable and bioenergy production (PG2A + BE). Our ensemble approach combined model uncertainty using the tower property of expectation and the law of total variance. Results show considerable uncertainty for predicted nutrient losses with different models partitioning the uncertainty into different pathways. Bioenergy crops were predicted to produce greatest yields from Miscanthus in lowland and from SRC-willow (cv. Endurance) in uplands. Each choice of management is associated with trade-offs; e.g. PG2A results in a significant increase of edible calories (6736 Mcal ha(-1)) but reduced soil C (-4.32 t C ha(-1)). Model ensembles in the agroecosystem context are difficult to implement due to challenges of model availability and input and output alignment. Despite these challenges, we show that ensemble modelling is a powerful approach for applications such as ours, offering benefits such as capturing structural as well as data uncertainty and allowing greater combinations of variables to be explored. Furthermore, the ensemble provides a robust means for combining uncertainty at different scales and enables us to identify weaknesses in system understanding.","[Hassall, Kirsty L.] Rothamsted Res, Computat & Analyt Sci Dept, Harpenden AL5 2JQ, Herts, England; [Coleman, Kevin; Dixit, Prakash N.; Sharp, Ryan T.; Whitmore, Andrew P.; Richter, Goetz M.; Milne, Alice E.] Rothamsted Res, Sustainable Agr Sci Dept, Harpenden AL5 2JQ, Herts, England; [Granger, Steve J.; Zhang, Yusheng; Wu, Lianhai; Collins, Adrian L.] Rothamsted Res, Sustainable Agr Sci Dept, North Wyke EX20 2SB, Oakhampton, England",UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC); Rothamsted Research; UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC); Rothamsted Research; UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC); Rothamsted Research,"Milne, AE (corresponding author), Rothamsted Res, Sustainable Agr Sci Dept, Harpenden AL5 2JQ, Herts, England.",kirsty.hassall@rothamsted.ac.uk; kevin.coleman@rothamsted.ac.uk; prakash.dixit@rothamsted.ac.uk; steve.granger@rothamsted.ac.uk; yusheng.zhang@rothamsted.ac.uk; ryan.sharp@rothamsted.ac.uk; lianhai.wu@rothamsted.ac.uk; andy.whitmore@rothamsted.ac.uk; goetz.richter@rothamsted.ac.uk; adrian.collins@rothamsted.ac.uk; alice.milne@rothamsted.ac.uk,"Hassall, Kirsty/AAD-3222-2019; Granger, Steve/B-8268-2009; Milne, Alice/HGE-7308-2022; Sharp, Ryan/HGF-3872-2022; Coleman, Kevin/D-5271-2011; Collins, Adrian/V-5938-2018; Wu, Lianhai/B-1892-2016; Richter, Goetz/E-5861-2016","Hassall, Kirsty/0000-0003-0033-1136; Granger, Steve/0000-0003-0183-0244; Whitmore, Andrew/0000-0001-8984-1436; Dixit, Prakash/0000-0003-0957-2972; Zhang, Yusheng/0000-0002-7899-6560; Milne, Alice/0000-0002-4509-0578; Sharp, Ryan/0000-0002-9065-7297; Coleman, Kevin/0000-0002-9640-1479; Collins, Adrian/0000-0001-8790-8473; Wu, Lianhai/0000-0003-0221-9009; Richter, Goetz/0000-0003-2180-9514",Institute Strategic Programme (ISP) grant Soils to Nutrition (S2N) [BBS/E/C/000I0330]; UK-BBSRC [BBS/E/C/000J0300]; Lawes Agriculture Trust;  [BBS/E/C/000J0100],Institute Strategic Programme (ISP) grant Soils to Nutrition (S2N); UK-BBSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)); Lawes Agriculture Trust; ,"Rothamsted Research receives strategic support from the UKRI-BBSRC (UK Research and Innovation-Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council.

However, the thermal conductivity depends on many factors, such as on the temperature and moisture content. Linear temperature-dependent laws have been occasionally proposed for inorganic fibrous materials such as fiberglass or rock wool that exhibit a decreased thermal conductivity (better performance) at low temperatures. However, the petrochemical-foamed insulating materials such as the polyisocyanurate, have less regular temperature dependent behaviors with a poorer performance at both extremely cold and warm temperatures. This means that the use of constant thermal conductivity values results in actual building envelope performance different from the design predictions, with increasing building energy consumptions, greater risks of condensation issues, and decreased occupants' comfort. This paper aims to quantify the impact of the temperature dependency of the thermal conductivity in exterior walls and flat roofs. Experimental results over a large temperature range (from -20 degrees C to +60 degrees C) for different insulating materials were used in hygrothermal simulations in both continental and humid temperate climates. Common insulating materials were taken into accounts, such as fiberglass, rock wool, polyisocyanurate, and extruded polystyrene. The increase in the energy fluxes from common building envelopes once the effective thermal conductivity was considered resulted below 10% for walls and as high as 70% for roofs, especially in the cold weather. Finally, a hybrid insulation system constituted by two layers of different materials, i.e. a polyisocyanurate and a rock wool is investigated. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Especially, if a key intent is to increase the degree entrepreneurial-mindedness of its graduates and promote innovation? We believe the answer is to truly integrate the core professional competencies cultivated by general education into the engineering curriculum and to have general education courses more specifically connect to issues that engineers need to be more aware of in a career climate of extensive globalization. General education is an essential educational component to be embraced as being on par in importance in an engineering curriculum with technical topics, science and math. The definition of general education is intended to include the humanities, social sciences, and business. The purpose of an education is not just to provide job skills, but to provide the foundation for a lifetime series of careers. Engineering graduates should recognize that while technical skills are readily perishable, professional skills/competencies are more likely to endure. The latter skills will play a key role in career advancement and job survival since professional skills, when accompanied by technical skills, provide long-term career value. This includes but is not limited to the ability to recognize societal needs, assess perceived versus real needs, work with others to address these needs, communicate effectively, and provide innovations that contribute commercial value. For the development of entrepreneurial minded graduates, the educational contributions provided by general education are essential for career success. Introducing an entrepreneurial mindset in an engineering curriculum will not be accomplished by adding courses. This challenge must be addressed by making the liberal arts, social science, and business topics relevant to engineering students in a practical sense that allows engineering graduates to commit to engaging in a world driven by more than technical facts. Professional competencies and engineering skills/knowledge must be integrated, together in the same course, because that is how the graduates will engage their careers and innovate.","[Petersen, Owe G.] Milwaukee Sch Engn, Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Milwaukee, WI 53202 USA; [Kent, R.

Two leading EOF modes are found to dominate the spatial and temporal changes of the summertime zonal mean winds in the troposphere. EOF1 shows the distribution of zonal-mean flow anomalies with higher variance in the North Polar Region, whereas the EOF2 shows the distribution of zonal-mean flow anomalies with higher variance in tropical and extra-tropical regions. The EOF1 and EOF2 have respectively the periodicities similar to those of AO and ENSO. Significant lag correlations have been found between EOF1 and ENSO, and between EOF2 and AO, in the seasons including spring, autumn, and winter. However, no significant correlations have been found between EOF1 in summer and ENSO in any other seasons, and between EOF2 in summer and AO in other seasons, no matter how big the lag that represents number of sea-sons has been set. These results suggest that the principal modes of summertime zonal mean flow could be statistically separated from each other. Hence, EOF1 and EOF2 are physically related to the AO and ENSO respectively. A theory called quasi-geostrophic non-acceleration theorem has been used to partly explain the possible mechanisms of the maintenance of the two principal modes. The composite differences of the divergence of Eliassen-Palm flux (E-P flux) between positive and negative years as obtained from the time series of EOF1 and EOF2 display the distributions that contribute to the zonal mean wind anomalies represented by EOF1 and EOF2, respectively. The planetary other than tire synoptic waves dominate the behaviors of the E-P fluxes, suggesting the crucial role of the planetary waves in the maintenance of the zonal mean flow anomalies. The residual circulation as well as the friction, which cancel the divergence of the FP flux, also play art important role in some places. These results are very helpful for our better understanding how the anomalous zonal mean flows maintain and how the ENSO and AO influence the global climate variations.","[Bai Yingying; Guan Zhaoyong] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, KLME, Sch Atmospher Sci, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China; [Bai Yingying] Chongqing Inst Meteorol Sci, Chongqing 401147, Peoples R China",Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology,"Guan, ZY (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, KLME, Sch Atmospher Sci, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China.",guanzy@nuist.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [40675025]; Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Meteorological Disaster [KLME060101]; National Key Technology RD Program [2007BAC29B02],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Meteorological Disaster; National Key Technology RD Program(National Key Technology R&D Program),"Supported jointly by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 40675025, the Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Meteorological Disaster under Grant No. KLME060101, and the National Key Technology R&D Program under Grant No.2007BAC29B02.",,31,1,1,0,2,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0894-0525,2191-4788,,ACTA METEOROL SIN,Acta Meteorol.

While utilizing them at elevated temperatures is highly desirable, their operating temperature is usually kept below 300 degrees C to prevent isolated atoms from agglomerating. Moreover, their applications in high-temperature electrochemical devices have been hindered by the lack of suitable processing techniques for catalyst loading. Herein, we report single-atom Pt/ceria nanocatalysts that are highly active and thermally stable in solid oxide cells (SOCs) operating at 600-800 degrees C. Our urea-based chemical solution process creates strong Pt-O-Ce interactions that securely anchor isolated Pt atoms to the surface of ceria nanoparticles and suppress their high-temperature migration. These single-atom Pt/ceria nanocatalysts are loaded in the oxide fuel electrode of a SOC via an in situ synthetic process, which reduces the polarization resistance from 28.2 to 0.82 Ohm cm(2) at 600 degrees C. This electrode outperforms the state-of-the-art Ni-based fuel electrode by up to 10 times and delivers extremely high performance in full SOCs in fuel cell and electrolysis modes. Furthermore, it stably operates at 700 degrees C for over 500 h under realistic operating conditions.

All lines unite in the inner city area between stations Laim and Ostbahnhof to form the so-called Stammstrecke, which has been in operation since 1972. With a train follow-up time of 120 s, the line, which has a continuous double-track length of around 11 km, is one of the busiest lines in Germany. With a view to the megatrend of urbanization and the demand for climate-friendly inner-city transport options, the expansion project 2nd S-Bahn trunk line Munich, which has been pursued since the 1990s, has been implemented since the symbolic ground-breaking ceremony on April 5, 2017. However, the increasingly intensive densification of urban living spaces also leads to new challenges. For the expansion of the existing public infrastructure and public transport, there are hardly any suitable areas available in inner-city areas, so that usually only the evasion into the underground remains. At the same time, the requirements for sustainable construction are increasing with the smallest possible CO2 footprint, city-compatible construction times, low noise and dust emissions and vibrations as well as few transports and the lowest possible impact on adjacent habitats. Using the example of the new Marienhof station for the 2nd S-Bahn trunk line, it will be shown how a highly complex and structurally highly demanding structure in Munich's deepest excavation pit to date is produced in accordance with the challenges mentioned above and with the help of state-of-the-art tools, construction methods and digital work processes. Particular attention is paid to the production of milled diaphragm walls. The diaphragm wall milling machine, which is also used in a further developed form for the upcoming loose floors and complex layer sequences, will become increasingly important for the production of ever deeper excavation pits and will also be an integral part of digitally networked construction in Germany.","[Meier, Joachim; Boehm, Sebastian] Implenia Spezialtiefbau GmbH, Robert Bosch Str 25, D-63226 Langen, Germany",,"Bohm, S (corresponding author), Implenia Spezialtiefbau GmbH, Robert Bosch Str 25, D-63226 Langen, Germany.",joachim.meier@implenia.com; sebastian.boehm@implenia.com,,,,,,,1,0,0,2,2,ERNST & SOHN,BERLIN,"ROTHERSTRASSE 21, BERLIN, DEUTSCHLAND 10245, GERMANY",0932-8351,1437-0999,,BAUTECHNIK,Bautechnik,SEP,2022,9,,,,679,685,,10.1002/bate.202200063,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/bate.202200063,,22-Aug,7,"Engineering, Civil",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Engineering,4I6HU,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000839526700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Most of the models or available tools do not provide both an economic and environmental assessment of the energy systems and thus lead to the design of systems that are sub-optimal. A flexible and modular simulation tool, Eco-Sim, is thus developed in the current study to conduct a comprehensive techno-economic and environmental assessment of a distributed energy system considering different configuration scenarios. Subsequently, an intermodel comparison is conducted with the Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewable (HOMER) Pro as well as with a state-of-the-art industrial tool. Eco-Sim is then extended by including the heating demand, thermal conversion (by using heat pumps and solar thermal) methods and thermal storage. A parametric analysis is conducted by considering different capacities of solar photovoltaics (PV), solar thermal panels and energy storage technologies. The levelized cost of electricity, the autonomy level and the COemissions are used as the key performance indicators. Based on the analysis of a study case conducted in a neighbourhood in Geneva, Switzerland, the study reveals that, with the present market prices for batteries and seasonal changes in solar energy potential, the combination of solar PV with battery storage doesn't bring a significant autonomy to the system and increases the CO emissions of the system. However, the integration of thermal storage and solar thermal generation is shown to considerably increase the autonomy of the neighbourhood. Finally, multiple scenarios are also run in order to evaluate the sensitivity of economic parameters on the performance indicators of the system. Under the assumptions of the model, to foster investments in solar PV and battery installations, falling installation costs or stronger policies in favor of renewable energy seem necessary for the future.","[Siraganyan, Karni; Perera, Amarasinghage Tharindu Dasun; Scartezzini, Jean-Louis; Mauree, Dasaraden] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Solar Energy & Bldg Phys Lab, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne,"Mauree, D (corresponding author), Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Solar Energy & Bldg Phys Lab, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",karnisira@gmail.com; dasun.perera@epfl.ch; jean-louis.scartezzini@epfl.ch; dasaraden.mauree@gmail.com,"Mauree, Dasaraden/C-2372-2011; Perera, Amarasinghage Tharindu Dasun/D-7408-2013","Mauree, Dasaraden/0000-0001-8954-321X; Perera, Amarasinghage Tharindu Dasun/0000-0002-0461-8874",Swiss Innovation Agency Innosuisse; Swiss Competence Center for Energy Research SCCER FEEBD; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne Library,Swiss Innovation Agency Innosuisse; Swiss Competence Center for Energy Research SCCER FEEBD; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne Library,This research project has been financially supported by the Swiss Innovation Agency Innosuisse and is part of the Swiss Competence Center for Energy Research SCCER FEEB&D.

The aim for this study was to understand the phenomena affecting the formation of particulate emissions of a non-road natural gas engine. To achieve this, the engine's exhaust emissions were characterized under different operating conditions. The regulated pollutants (gaseous CO, HC, and NOx; particulate matter (PM) and particle number (PN)) were determined experimentally and a detailed characterization of particulate pollutants over a wide particle size range (particles down to 1.2 nm) was con-ducted with state-of-the-art instrumentation considering both physical and chemical properties of the exhaust aerosol. The test engine was a prototype non-road spark-ignited natural gas engine, which was studied over the non-road steady test cycle (NRSC). The role of the three-way catalyst (TWC) was studied by sampling and characterizing the exhaust aerosol both with and without the TWC. The TWC was observed to efficiently remove the vast majority of the regulated gaseous (96% CO, 98% HC, 98% NOx) and particulate mass emissions (98%). In general, the measured particle number emission factors were highly dependent on the cut-off sizes of the condensation particle counters. Using CPCs with smaller cut-off sizes resulted in higher particle number emission factors. For black carbon (BC), the intermediate engine speed conditions (modes 5-7) led to lower BC emissions than the high speed conditions (modes 1-3). In contrast, highest BC emissions on a work basis were observed during idling. TWC did not influence BC levels. Without the TWC, PM was comprised mostly of organic com-pounds (70-100%). Downstream of the TWC, the majority of PM was, depending on the load, composed of organic compounds, sulfate, or black carbon. A statistical source apportionment based on mass spectra revealed that the PM1 was mostly related to unburned and burned lubricating oil, indicating a minor role of fuel in PM formation.","[Marjanen, Petteri; Kuittinen, Niina; Karjalainen, Panu; Lintusaari, Henna; Simonen, Pauli; Markkula, Lassi; Kalliokoski, Joni; Ronkko, Topi] Tampere Univ, Fac Engn & Nat Sci, Phys Unit, Aerosol Phys Lab, Korkeakoulunkatu 3,PL692, Tampere 33014, Finland; [Saarikoski, Sanna; Aurela, Minna; Timonen, Hilkka] Finnish Meteorol Inst, Atmospher Composit Res, POB 503, FI-00101 Helsinki, Finland; [Westerholm, Marten; Pettinen, Rasmus] VTT Tech Res Ctr Finland, PL 1000, Espoo 02044, Finland; [Kalliokoski, Joni; Wihersaari, Hugo] AGCO Power, Linnavuorentie 8-10, FI-37240 Linnavuori, Finland",Tampere University; Finnish Meteorological Institute; VTT Technical Research Center Finland,"Kuittinen, N (corresponding author), Tampere Univ, Fac Engn & Nat Sci, Phys Unit, Aerosol Phys Lab, Korkeakoulunkatu 3,PL692, Tampere 33014, Finland.",petteri.marjanen@tuni.fi; niina.kuittinen@tuni.fi; panu.karjalainen@tuni.fi; sanna.saarikoski@fmi.fi; Marten.Westerholm@vtt.fi; Rasmus.Pettinen@vtt.fi; Minna.aurela@fmi.fi; henna.lintusaari@tuni.fi; pauli.simonen@tuni.fi; lassi.markkula@tuni.fi; joni.kalliokoski@tuni.fi; Hugo.Wihersaari@agcocorp.com; Hilkka.Timonen@fmi.fi; topi.ronkko@tuni.fi,"; Karjalainen, Panu/B-9585-2015","Simonen, Pauli/0000-0002-4267-6098; Kuittinen, Niina/0000-0002-8423-8934; Ronkko, Topi/0000-0002-1555-3367; Karjalainen, Panu/0000-0003-2824-0033; Lintusaari nee Silvennoinen, Henna/0000-0003-4624-5508","BC Footprint project - Business Finland [530/31/2019, 528/31/2019]; Academy of Finland Flagship [337551, 337552]; Academy of Finland project EFFi [322120]",BC Footprint project - Business Finland; Academy of Finland Flagship; Academy of Finland project EFFi,"This work was supported by the BC Footprint project funded by Business Finland, participating companies and municipalities (Grant number: 530/31/2019 and 528/31/2019), and Academy of Finland Flagship funding (grant no's. 337551 and 337552).

The importance of the Gulf Stream frontal system in the selection of high residence time (HRT) areas by the North Atlantic leatherback turtle is assessed here for the first time using state-of-the-art ocean reanalysis products. Ten adult females from the Eastern French Guianese rookery were satellite tracked during post-nesting migration to relate (1) their horizontal movements to physical gradients (Sea Surface Temperature (SST), Sea Surface Height (SSH) and filaments) and biological variables (micronekton and chlorophyll a), and (2) their diving behaviour to vertical structures within the water column (mixed layer, thermocline, halocline and nutricline). All the turtles migrated northward towards the Gulf Stream north wall. Although their HRT areas were geographically remote (spread between 80-30 degrees W and 28-45 degrees N), all the turtles targeted similar habitats in terms of physical structures, i.e. strong gradients of SST, SSH and a deep mixed layer. This close association with the Gulf Stream frontal system highlights the first substantial synchronization ever observed in this species, as the HRTs were observed in close match with the autumn phytoplankton bloom. Turtles remained within the enriched mixed layer at depths of 38.5 +/- 7.9 m when diving in HRT areas, likely to have an easier access to their prey and maximize therefore the energy gain. These depths were shallow in comparison to those attained within the thermocline (82.4 +/- 5.6 m) while crossing the nutrient-poor subtropical gyre, probably to reach cooler temperatures and save energy during the transit. In a context of climate change, anticipating the evolution of such frontal structure under the influence of global warming is crucial to ensure the conservation of this vulnerable species.","[Chambault, Philippine; Bonola, Marc; Brucker, Mathieu; Le Maho, Yvon; Chevallier, Damien] Univ Strasbourg, IPHC UMR 7178, F-67000 Strasbourg, France; [Roquet, Fabien; Pauthenet, Etienne] Stockholm Univ, Dept Meteorol MISU, Stockholm, Sweden; [Benhamou, Simon] CNRS, Ctr & Etude Fonct & Evolut, 1919 Route Mende, F-34293 Montpellier, France; [Baudena, Alberto] UPMC Univ Paris 06, Sorbonne Univ, CNRS IRD MNHN IPSL Lab, 4 Pl Jussieu, F-75005 Paris, France; [de Thoisy, Benoit; Dos Reis, Virginie; Crosson, Rodrigue] Assoc Kwata, 16 Ave Pasteur,BP 672, F-97335 Cayenne, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute of Nuclear and Particle Physics (IN2P3); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes; Universite de Strasbourg; Stockholm University; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle (MNHN); UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite,"Chambault, P (corresponding author), Univ Strasbourg, IPHC UMR 7178, F-67000 Strasbourg, France.",philippine.chambault@gmail.com,"Chevallier, Damien/AAD-6754-2020; Chambault, Philippine/ABI-2110-2020; Roquet, Fabien/D-4848-2013; damien, chevallier/N-6532-2013","damien, chevallier/0000-0002-2232-6787; Pauthenet, Etienne/0000-0002-0531-3810; Roquet, Fabien/0000-0003-1124-4564; de thoisy, benoit/0000-0002-8420-5112","CNES Guyane [475591]; ANTIDOT project (Pepiniere Interdisciplinaire Guyane, Mission pour l'Interdisciplinarite, CNRS); French Guiana Regional Council; Fondation de France [0047667]; Shell; EDF Foundation","CNES Guyane; ANTIDOT project (Pepiniere Interdisciplinaire Guyane, Mission pour l'Interdisciplinarite, CNRS); French Guiana Regional Council; Fondation de France(Fondation de France); Shell(Royal Dutch Shell); EDF Foundation","This study was carried out within the framework of the Plan National d'Action Tortues Marines de Guyane and was produced as part of the CARET2 cooperation project between French Guiana and Suriname, headed by the French Guiana office of WWF-France, in partnership with Kwata NGO, the French National Agency for Hunting and Wildlife (ONCFS), the French Guiana Regional Nature Park (PNRG) and WWF Guianas.

This plan, coupled with the need to mitigate climate change and also find alternative energy options to fossil fuels, is expected to continuously lead to increased interests in the development of renewable energy systems, around the world. Such systems have the potential to address the energy deficit in the world's energy poor regions, e.g. sub-Saharan Africa, where about 50% of the 1.2 billion people in the world live without access to electricity. This paper first discusses the state-of-the-art of photovoltaic (PV) technologies worldwide. It then presents the development of solar panel plant, using the National Agency for Science and Engineering Infrastructure (NASENI) 7.5 MW solar panel plant in Nigeria as a case study, which is established to build local capacity in PV technologies and also promote their widespread applications. The plant layout design, materials, equipment and production line are discussed. A new technique called Fundamental PV Module Performance Analysis (FPVMPA) is employed to assess the performance of a single NASENI 190 W module in terms of power output, energy yield, capture losses, fill factor, and efficiency, allowing the prediction of the module performance pre-installation, based on IEC 61724 standards. Furthermore, emphasis is laid on the impact Of temperature on the module, which affects its efficiency and overall outputs. These analyses are then used to evaluate the performance of a 54.72 kW Photovoltaic Electric Power Generation Plant (PEPGP) that is proposed for a remote mini-estate in Kutunku, Nigeria. Future research directions are also provided on module life cycle analysis, end-of-life management and recycling. Results show the module performance under varying irradiance and temperature conditions, which can be useful for design, planning and application purposes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, more definitive research on new paradigms is very expensive, and in the current economic climate, progress can be made by evaluating smaller pilot studies. This study describes one such approach. Methods A sample of 18-year-old or older, healthy, drinking freshmen at our university was assigned to 2 groups stratified to be similar on demography, drinking histories, and their level of response (LR) to alcohol. In the spring quarter of the school year, the 32 subjects in each of 2 groups viewed four 45-minute Internet-based videotapes as part of 4 prevention sessions. All 8 modules were based on the same techniques and general content, but the 4 videos for the first group were structured around the validated model of how a low LR affects heavy drinking (the low level of response-based [LRB] Group), with partial mediation by heavier drinking peers, positive alcohol expectancies, and drinking to cope with stress. Videos for the state-of-the-art (SOTA) comparison group did not place the similar prevention messages into the low LR framework. Changes in drinking were evaluated at 3 times: before Module 1, before Module 4, and 1 month after Module 4. Results Usual and maximum drinks per occasion decreased over time for both high and low LR subjects in both LRB and SOTA groups. As predicted, the low LR students showed greater decreases in the LRB Group, while high LR students showed greater decreases in the more generic SOTA Group. Conclusions The results support the hypothesis that tailoring prevention efforts to address specific predisposing factors, such as a low LR, may be associated with beneficial effects on drinking quantity. We hope that these data will encourage additional efforts to validate the low LR-based prevention paradigm and test other interventions that are targeted toward predisposing phenotypes such as impulsivity and negative affect.","[Schuckit, Marc A.; Kalmijn, Jelger A.; Smith, Tom L.; Saunders, Gretchen] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Psychiat, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Fromme, Kim] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Psychol, Austin, TX 78712 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Schuckit, MA (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Psychiat, 8950 Villa La Jolla Dr,Suite B-218, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",mschuckit@ucsd.edu,,,,,,,62,26,26,0,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0145-6008,1530-0277,,ALCOHOL CLIN EXP RES,Alcoholism (NY),JUL,2012,7,,,,1244,1252,,10.1111/j.1530-0277.2011.01723.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1530-0277.2011.01723.x,,,9,Substance Abuse,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Substance Abuse,971QR,22309202,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000306219400018,View Full Record in Web of Science

Thus, accurately monitoring the snow depth and the associated aerial coverage are critical issues for monitoring the global climate system. Passive microwave satellite measurements provide an optimal means to monitor the snowpack over the arctic region. While the temporal evolution of snow extent can be observed globally from microwave radiometers, the determination of the corresponding snow depth is more difficult. A dynamic algorithm that accounts for the dependence of the microwave scattering on the snow grain size has been developed to estimate snow depth from Special Sensor Microwave/ Imager (SSM/I) brightness temperatures and was validated over the U.S. Great Plains and Western Siberia. The purpose of this study is to assess the dynamic algorithm performance over the entire high latitude (land) region by computing a snow depth multi-year field for the time period 1987-1995. This multi-year average is compared to the Global Soil Wetness Project-Phase2 (GSWP2) snow depth computed from several state-of-the-art land surface schemes and averaged over the same time period. The multi-year average obtained by the dynamic algorithm is in good agreement with the GSWP2 snow depth field (the correlation coefficient for January is 0.55). The static algorithm, which assumes a constant snow grain size in space and time does not correlate with the GSWP2 snow depth field (the correlation coefficient with GSWP2 data for January is -0.03), but exhibits a very high anti-correlation with the NCEP average January air temperature field (correlation coefficient -0.77), the deepest satellite snow pack being located in the coldest regions, where the snow grain size may be significantly larger than the average value used in the static algorithm. The dynamic algorithm performs better over Eurasia (with a correlation coefficient with GSWP2 snow depth equal to 0.65) than over North America (where the correlation coefficient decreases to 0.29).

Unfortunately, however, the state-of-the-art SOFC anodes, composed of a nickel and an anionically conducting oxide such as yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ), are associated with Ni-catalyzed carbon deposition and the ensuing degradation of the anode performance. Here, we address these issues through the application of a simple, scalable, cost-effective ceramic coating method known as cathodic electrochemical deposition (CELD). Samaria-doped CeO2 (SDC) was chosen as the coating material due to its high chemical stability against carbon formation, high electronic and ionic conductivities, and favorable electrocatalytic activity toward fuel oxidation reaction. Nanostructured SDC layers with a high specific surface area were successfully coated onto Ni surfaces via CELD. The physical and chemical attributes of each coating were characterized by a range of analysis tools, in this case SEM, TEM, XRD, EDS, ICP-MS and Raman spectroscopy. An analysis of the AC impedance spectroscopy (ACIS) of Ni-patterned YSZ symmetric cells (anodelelectrolytelanode) with SDC coatings revealed significantly enhanced electrode activity toward fuel oxidation and coking stability under dry or wet methane fuel at 650 degrees C. These results suggest that the Ni-surface modification via CELD can be a feasible solution for the direct use of hydrocarbon fuels in SOFCs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The relative contribution of natural and anthropogenic dust sources, however, remains largely uncertain. Although human activities disturb soils and therefore enhance wind erosion, their contribution to global dust emission has never been directly evaluated because of a lack of data. The retrieval of aerosol properties over land, including deserts, using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Deep Blue algorithm makes the first direct characterization of the origin of individual sources possible. In order to separate freshly emitted dust from other aerosol types and aged dust particles, the spectral dependence of the single scattering albedo and the Angstrom wavelength exponent are used. Four years of data from the eastern part of West Africa, which includes one of the most active natural dust sources and the highest population density on the continent, are processed. Sources are identified on the basis of the persistence of significant aerosol optical depth from freshly emitted dust, and the origin is characterized as natural or anthropogenic on the basis of a land use data set. Our results indicate that although anthropogenic dust is observed less frequently and with lower optical depth than dust from natural sources in this particular region, it occupies a large area covering most of northern Nigeria and southern Chad, around Lake Chad. In addition, smaller anthropogenic sources are found as far south as 5 degrees of latitude north, well outside the domain of most dust source inventories.","[Ginoux, Paul] NOAA, Geophys Fluid Dynam Lab, Princeton, NJ 08542 USA; [Garbuzov, Dmitri] Princeton Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Princeton, NJ 08542 USA; [Hsu, N.

Agricultural simulation models can be a key component in testing new technologies, seeds and cultivars etc., however, inaccurate input information in addition to model related errors adds to model uncertainties. Satellite observations of soil moisture (SM), vegetation index etc. can be assimilated into crop models to reduce input and model related uncertainties. The goal of this study was to determine if assimilation of satellite-driven SM profiles can improve crop model yield estimations in a commonly used crop model while reducing the reliance on field management information at regional scales. Toward reaching this goal, this study utilized satellite derived microwave and thermal-infrared coupled SM profiles assimilated into a crop model via the Ensemble Kalman Filter over parts of the Southeastern United States from 2006 to 2010. The gridded Decision Support System for AgroTechnology Transfer (GriDSSAT) model was used to test and verify the SM profile assimilation methodology in two specific modes: (a) first using the best state-of-the art climate inputs available without data assimilation (open-loop); (b) then enhancing the open-loop model by assimilating into the model Remote sensing Driven SM Profile (RDSMP) data where available. The National Agricultural Statistical Services (NASS) reported yield data at county levels were used for comparison and validation purposes. For non-irrigated regions, the GriDSSAT model simulation (rain-fed) showed an overall absolute error of nearly 36 % in comparison with the reported NASS yields, whereas the error in crop yields after data assimilation was only 29 %. Over irrigated counties, the GriDSSAT model simulation (irrigated) showed an error of nearly 24 % while using the data assimilation model simulation without irrigation information also showed overall error of similar to 23 %. Compared to the open-loop model simulation and improvement in simulated crop yields of nearly 2.5 times was found over irrigated regions (23 % vs 58 %).","[Mishra, Vikalp] NASA, SERVIR, Marshall Space Flight Ctr, 320 Sparkman Dr, Huntsville, AL 35805 USA; [Mishra, Vikalp; Cruise, James F.] Univ Alabama, Earth Syst Sci Ctr, 320 Sparkman Dr, Huntsville, AL 35808 USA; [Mecikalski, John R.] Univ Alabama, Atmospher Sci Dept, 320 Sparkman Dr, Huntsville, AL 35805 USA",National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Marshall Space Flight Center; University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Huntsville; University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Huntsville,"Mishra, V (corresponding author), NASA, SERVIR, Marshall Space Flight Ctr, 320 Sparkman Dr, Huntsville, AL 35805 USA.",vikalp.mishra@nasa.gov; james.cruise@nsstc.uah.edu; johnm@nsstc.uah.edu,,,NASA Headquarters under the NASA Earth and Space Science Fellowship (NESSF) Program [NNX15AN58H],NASA Headquarters under the NASA Earth and Space Science Fellowship (NESSF) Program,The authors would like to acknowledge the assistance of numerous individuals who provided data for this study.

To sustain this growth trajectory, continued cost and capital expenditure (capex) reductions are needed. Thinning the silicon wafer well below the industry-standard 160 mu m, in principle reduces both manufacturing cost and capex, and accelerates economically-sustainable expansion of PV manufacturing. In this analysis piece, we explore two questions surrounding adoption of thin silicon wafers: (a) What are the market benefits of thin wafers? (b) What are the technological challenges to adopt thin wafers? In this analysis, we re-evaluate the benefits and challenges of thin Si for current and future PV modules using a comprehensive technoeconomic framework that couples device simulation, bottom-up cost modeling, and a sustainable cash-flow growth model. When adopting an advanced technology concept that features sufficiently good surface passivation, the comparable efficiencies are achievable for both 50 mu m wafers and 160 mu m ones. We then quantify the economic benefits for thin Si wafers in terms of poly-Si-to-module manufacturing capex, module cost, and levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for utility PV systems. Particularly, LCOE favors thinner wafers for all investigated device architectures, and can potentially be reduced by more than 5% from the value of 160 mu m wafers. With further improvements in module efficiency, an advanced device concept with 50 mu m wafers could potentially reduce manufacturing capex by 48%, module cost by 28%, and LCOE by 24%. Furthermore, we apply a sustainable growth model to investigate PV deployment scenarios in 2030. It is found that the state-of-the-art industry concept could not achieve the climate targets even with very aggressive financial scenarios, therefore the capex reduction benefit of thin wafers is advantageous to facilitate faster PV adoption. Lastly, we discuss the remaining technological challenges and areas for innovation to enable high-yield manufacturing of high-efficiency PV modules with thin Si wafers.","[Liu, Zhe; Sofia, Sarah E.; Laine, Hannu S.; Wieghold, Sarah; Peters, Ian Marius; Buonassisi, Tonio] MIT, Dept Mech Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Woodhouse, Michael] Natl Renewable Energy Lab, Strateg Energy Anal Ctr, Golden, CO USA; [Laine, Hannu S.] Sellforte Inc, Helsinki, Finland; [Wieghold, Sarah] Florida State Univ, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); United States Department of Energy (DOE); National Renewable Energy Laboratory - USA; State University System of Florida; Florida State University,"Liu, Z; Buonassisi, T (corresponding author), MIT, Dept Mech Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",zheliu@mit.edu; buonassisi@mit.edu,"Liu, Zhe/T-9004-2019","Liu, Zhe/0000-0001-7268-6214; Wieghold, Sarah/0000-0001-6169-3961; Peters, Ian Marius/0000-0002-1725-0909",U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) under Photovoltaic Research and Development (PVRD) program [DE-EE0007535]; TOTAL Energy Fellowship through the MIT Energy Initiative; DOE-NSF ERF for Quantum Energy and Sustainable Solar Technologies (QESST); Singapore's National Research Foundation through the Singapore MIT Alliance for Research and Technology's Low energy electronic systems (LEES) IRG'',"U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) under Photovoltaic Research and Development (PVRD) program(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); TOTAL Energy Fellowship through the MIT Energy Initiative; DOE-NSF ERF for Quantum Energy and Sustainable Solar Technologies (QESST); Singapore's National Research Foundation through the Singapore MIT Alliance for Research and Technology's Low energy electronic systems (LEES) IRG''(Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research & Technology Centre (SMART)National Research Foundation, Singapore)","The authors thank Dr Qi Wang from Jinko Solar, Dr Yifeng Chen from Trina Solar, Dr Hongbin Fang from Longi Solar and Dr Shaffiq Jaffer from TOTAL to provide the industrial perspectives about the thin wafer manufacturing.

Terrestrial biosphere models are important forecasting tools, but to improve our understanding of large-scale terrestrial ecosystem function, we need to consider data from a number of sources and scales. Today remote sensing is improving our ability to derive information on forest structure and composition at a variety of scales, but their uncertainties in deriving these products to predicted carbon fluxes have not been investigated. This study investigated how uncertainties in forest structure and composition initialized at a temperate North American forest using a state-of-the-art terrestrial biosphere model affect predictions of carbon dynamics in the short and decadal time-frame. Uncertainties in net carbon predictions are compared to a +/- 20% uncertainty value estimated for the terrestrial sink component of the global carbon budget (Pan et al., 2011). For short-term simulations, a +/- 20% uncertainty in both forest structure and composition is enough to predict a net carbon flux variation of +/- 21.5% (+/- 0.077 kg C/m(2)/year) and 20.5% (+/- 0.092 kg C/m(2)/year) respectively. For medium-term (11-40 years) simulations, only a 50% uncertainty in the initial forest structure predicts a net carbon flux variation beyond the +/- 20% threshold, but uncertainties in net carbon flux variation beyond +/- 20% were predicted from a 5% change in initial composition after 25 years of simulation. Remote sensing-derived forest structure and composition using LiDAR and imaging spectroscopy were also initialized, with all short term simulated net carbon fluxes within the +/- 20% cutoff. These results indicate that an accurate and full description of forest structure and composition from remote sensing within a +/- 20% uncertainty can be adequate in producing improved forecasts of terrestrial ecosystems for the next few decades.

The study contains an assessment of vertical temperature and salinity profiles as well as various statistical time series analyses of temperature and salinity for different depths at specific representative monitoring stations. Simulation results for 1970-1999 are compared to observations from the Baltic Environmental Database (BED). Further, we analyze current velocities and volume transports both in the horizontal plane and through three transects in the Baltic Sea. Simulated current velocities are validated against 10 years of Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) measurements in the Arkona Basin and 5 years of mooring observations in the Gotland Basin. Furthermore, the atmospheric forcing datasets, which drive the models, are evaluated using wind measurements from 28 automatic stations along the Swedish coast. We found that the seasonal cycle, variability, and vertical profiles of temperature and salinity are simulated close to observations by RCO with an assimilation setup. All models reproduce temperature well near the sea surface. Salinity simulations are of lower quality from GETM in the northern Baltic Sea and from MOM at various stations. Simulated current velocities lie mainly within the standard deviation of the measurements at the two monitoring stations. However, sea surface currents and transports in the ocean interior are significantly larger in GETM than in the other models. Although simulated hydrographic profiles agree predominantly well with observations, the mean circulation differs considerably between the models highlighting the need for additional long-term current measurements to assess the mean circulation in ocean models. With the help of reanalysis data ocean state estimates of regions and time periods without observations are improved. However, due to the lack of current measurements only the baroclinic velocities of the reanalyses are reliable. A substantial part of the differences in barotropic velocities between the three ocean models and reanalysis data is explained by differences in wind velocities of the atmospheric forcing datasets.","[Placke, Manja; Meier, H.

One such improvement is the state-of-the-art Tripleclouds radiative solver, which has one cloud-free and two cloudy regions in each vertical model layer and is thereby capable of representing cloud horizontal inhomogeneity. Inspired by the Tripleclouds concept, primarily introduced by Shonk and Hogan (2008), we incorporated a second cloudy region into the widely employed delta-Eddington two-stream method with the maximum-random overlap assumption for partial cloudiness. The inclusion of another cloudy region in the two-stream framework required an extension of vertical overlap rules. While retaining the maximum-random overlap for the entire layer cloudiness, we additionally assumed the maximum overlap of optically thicker cloudy regions in pairs of adjacent layers. This extended overlap formulation implicitly places the optically thicker region towards the interior of the cloud, which is in agreement with the core-shell model for convective clouds. The method was initially applied on a shallow cumulus cloud field, evaluated against a three-dimensional benchmark radiation computation. Different approaches were used to generate a pair of cloud condensates characterizing the two cloudy regions, testing various condensate distribution assumptions along with global cloud variability estimate. Regardless of the exact condensate setup, the radiative bias in the vast majority of Tripleclouds configurations was considerably reduced compared to the conventional plane-parallel calcula- tion. Whereas previous studies employing the Tripleclouds concept focused on researching the top-of-the-atmosphere radiation budget, the present work applies Tripleclouds to atmospheric heating rate and net surface flux. The Tripleclouds scheme was implemented in the comprehensive libRadtran radiative transfer package and can be utilized to further address key scientific issues related to unresolved cloud-radiation interplay in coarse-resolution atmospheric models.","[Crnivec, Nina; Mayer, Bernhard] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Chair Expt Meteorol, Munich, Germany; [Mayer, Bernhard] Deutsch Zentrum Luft & Raumfahrt, Inst Phys Atmosphare, Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany",University of Munich; Helmholtz Association; German Aerospace Centre (DLR),"Crnivec, N (corresponding author), Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Chair Expt Meteorol, Munich, Germany.",nina.crnivec@physik.uni-muenchen.de,"Mayer, Bernhard C/B-3397-2011; Črnivec, Nina/AAL-9789-2020","Mayer, Bernhard C/0000-0002-3358-0190; Crnivec, Nina/0000-0002-3134-6480",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) (Transregional Collaborative Research Center SFB/TRR 165 Waves To Weather),Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) (Transregional Collaborative Research Center SFB/TRR 165 Waves To Weather)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),This research has been supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) (Transregional Collaborative Research Center SFB/TRR 165 Waves To Weather).,,83,1,1,0,2,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1680-7316,1680-7324,,ATMOS CHEM PHYS,Atmos.

The life cycle assessment methodology has been widely employed to assess electricity generation. However, there are still gaps in research to be explored within this theme. Therefore, this paper aims to conduct a systematic theoretical analysis of the state of the art of the scientific research on LCA of electricity generation systems in the world. Methods A critical review of 47 studies was conducted. The study is comprehensive in the analysis of the main aspects of the identified high impact studies as follows: authors, countries, universities, keywords, journals, number of citations, life cycle impact assessment methods, impact categories, software tools, and databases. The Methodi Ordinatio was applied to rank the studies in terms of impact factor and number of citations, pointing out high impact research. Results and discussion Wind and solar powers have two of the smallest impact indices in their generation in terms of global warming, compared to other sources. The ecoinvent database was the most used among the studies analyzed, providing data for potential environmental impacts. The most frequently used impact category in the assessments was climate change. The studies are not equally distributed but most of them are concentrated in European countries. In some countries, clean sources seem promising due to their capacity to generate electricity in places with high wind incidence and high capacity for sunlight capture. Conclusions The conclusions of this article summarize the characteristics of existing literature and provide suggestions for future work. The results of the study can also be used to promote development actions and foment changes in energy matrices in a global context. The main studies in this area point that in the future, the main sources for electricity generation will be renewable ones, since life cycle assessment of electricity generation systems has been seeking to generate knowledge to support informed decision-making.","[Barros, Murillo Vetroni; Salvador, Rodrigo; Piekarski, Cassiano Moro; de Francisco, Antonio Carlos] Fed Univ Technol Parana UTFPR, Sustainable Prod Syst Lab LESP, Ponta Grossa, Parana, Brazil; [Freire, Fausto Miguel Cereja Seixas] Univ Coimbra, CIE, Coimbra, Portugal; [Freire, Fausto Miguel Cereja Seixas] Univ Coimbra, Dept Mech Engn, ADAILAETA, Coimbra, Portugal",Universidade Tecnologica Federal do Parana; Universidade de Coimbra; Universidade de Coimbra,"Barros, MV (corresponding author), Fed Univ Technol Parana UTFPR, Sustainable Prod Syst Lab LESP, Ponta Grossa, Parana, Brazil.",murillo.vetroni@gmail.com,"Salvador, Rodrigo/X-8245-2019; Piekarski, Cassiano Moro/R-3936-2019; de Francisco, Antonio Carlos/G-4374-2015; Freire, Fausto/C-6741-2008","Salvador, Rodrigo/0000-0003-3398-7684; Piekarski, Cassiano Moro/0000-0002-5085-101X; de Francisco, Antonio Carlos/0000-0003-0401-4445; Freire, Fausto/0000-0001-7269-5372; Barros, Murillo Vetroni/0000-0002-1711-6056",Coordination of Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES); National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq),Coordination of Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES)(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)),This research was financially supported by the Coordination of Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES) and the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq).,,80,24,24,7,67,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0948-3349,1614-7502,,INT J LIFE CYCLE ASS,Int.

With a total of 105 organic species and over 265 gas-phase reactions, 69 photodissociations, and 7 heterogeneous reactions, the mechanism treats the chemical degradation of isoprene - its main focus - as well as acetaldehyde, acetone, methylbutenol, and the family of monoterpenes. Regarding isoprene, the mechanism incorporates a state-of-the-art representation of its oxidation scheme accounting for all major advances put forward in recent theoretical and laboratory studies. The recycling of OH radicals in isoprene oxidation through the isomerization of Z-delta-hydroxyperoxy radicals is found to enhance OH concentrations by up to 40% over western Amazonia in the boundary layer and by 10 %-15% over the southeastern US and Siberia in July. The model and its chemical mechanism are evaluated against the suite of chemical measurements from the SEAC(4)RS (Studies of Emissions and Atmospheric Composition, Clouds and Climate Coupling by Regional Surveys) airborne campaign, demonstrating a good overall agreement for major isoprene oxidation products, although the aerosol hydrolysis of tertiary and non-tertiary nitrates remain poorly constrained. The comparisons for methylnitrate indicate a very low nitrate yield (< 3 x 10(-4)) in the CH3O2 + NO reaction. The oxidation of isoprene, acetone, and acetaldehyde by OH is shown to be a substantial source of enols and keto-enols, primarily through the photolysis of multifunctional carbonyls generated in their oxidation schemes. Oxidation of those enols by OH radicals constitutes a sizable source of carboxylic acids estimated at 9 Tg (HC(O)OH) yr(-1) and 11 Tg(CH3C(O)OH) yr(-1) or similar to 20% of their global identified source. The ozonolysis of alkenes is found to be a smaller source of HC(O)OH (6 TgHC(O)OH yr(-1)) than previously estimated, due to several factors including the strong deposition sink of hydroxymethyl hydroperoxide (HMHP).","[Mueller, Jean-Francois; Stavrakou, Trissevgeni] Royal Belgian Inst Space Aeron, Ave Circulaire 3, B-1180 Brussels, Belgium; [Peeters, Jozef] Univ Leuven, Dept Chem, Celestijnenlaan 200F, B-3001 Leuven, Belgium",KU Leuven,"Muller, JF (corresponding author), Royal Belgian Inst Space Aeron, Ave Circulaire 3, B-1180 Brussels, Belgium.",jean-francois.muller@aeronomie.be,"Peeters, Jozef/S-6633-2019",,Belgian Science Policy Office,Belgian Science Policy Office(Belgian Federal Science Policy Office),"This research was supported by the Belgian Science Policy Office through the projects TROVA (2016-2018), within the ESA/PRODEX programme, OCTAVE (2017-2021), within the BRAIN-be research programme, and BIOSOA, within the SSD program (2006-2010).",,180,21,21,1,25,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1991-959X,1991-9603,,GEOSCI MODEL DEV,Geosci.

Among the many problems afflicting maize production in WCA, drought, foliar diseases, and parasitic weeds are the most critical. Several decades of efforts devoted to the genetic improvement of maize have resulted in remarkable genetic gain, leading to increased yields of maize on farmers' fields. The revolution unfolding in the areas of genomics, bioinformatics, and phenomics is generating innovative tools, resources, and technologies for transforming crop breeding programs. It is envisaged that such tools will be integrated within maize breeding programs, thereby advancing these programs and addressing current and future challenges. Accordingly, the maize improvement program within International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) is undergoing a process of modernization through the introduction of innovative tools and new schemes that are expected to enhance genetic gains and impact on smallholder farmers in the region. Genomic tools enable genetic dissections of complex traits and promote an understanding of the physiological basis of key agronomic and nutritional quality traits. Marker-aided selection and genome-wide selection schemes are being implemented to accelerate genetic gain relating to yield, resilience, and nutritional quality. Therefore, strategies that effectively combine genotypic information with data from field phenotyping and laboratory-based analysis are currently being optimized. Molecular breeding, guided by methodically defined product profiles tailored to different agroecological zones and conditions of climate change, supported by state-of-the-art decision-making tools, is pivotal for the advancement of modern, genomics-aided maize improvement programs. Accelerated genetic gain, in turn, catalyzes a faster variety replacement rate. It is critical to forge and strengthen partnerships for enhancing the impacts of breeding products on farmers' livelihood. IITA has well-established channels for delivering its research products/technologies to partner organizations for further testing, multiplication, and dissemination across various countries within the subregion. Capacity building of national agricultural research system (NARS) will facilitate the smooth transfer of technologies and best practices from IITA and its partners.","[Gedil, Melaku] Int Inst Trop Agr, Biosci Ctr, Ibadan, Nigeria; [Gedil, Melaku; Menkir, Abebe] Int Inst Trop Agr, Maize Improvement Program, Ibadan, Nigeria",CGIAR; International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA); CGIAR; International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA),"Gedil, M (corresponding author), Int Inst Trop Agr, Biosci Ctr, Ibadan, Nigeria.;Gedil, M (corresponding author), Int Inst Trop Agr, Maize Improvement Program, Ibadan, Nigeria.",m.gedil@cgiar.org,"Gedil, Melaku/H-9445-2019","Gedil, Melaku/0000-0002-6258-6014",CGIAR Research Program on Maize (MAIZE); Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation; USAID [OPP1134248]; government of Australia; government of Belgium; government of Canada; government of China; government of France; government of India; government of Japan; government of Korea; government of Mexico; government of the Netherlands; government of New Zealand; government of Norway; government of Sweden; government of Switzerland; government of the U.K.; government of the United States; World Bank,CGIAR Research Program on Maize (MAIZE)(CGIAR); Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation(Bill & Melinda Gates FoundationCGIAR); USAID(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); government of Australia; government of Belgium(CGIAR); government of Canada(CGIAR); government of China; government of France; government of India; government of Japan; government of Korea(Korean Government); government of Mexico; government of the Netherlands(Netherlands Government); government of New Zealand; government of Norway; government of Sweden; government of Switzerland; government of the U.K.; government of the United States; World Bank(The World Bank India),"This work was supported by the CGIAR Research Program on Maize (MAIZE) and by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and USAID funded project titled Stress Tolerant Maize for Africa (grant number OPP1134248), The MAIZE program receives financial support from the governments of Australia, Belgium, Canada, China, France, India, Japan, Korea, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, the U.K., and the United States, and from the World Bank.",,99,16,17,3,10,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-462X,,,FRONT PLANT SCI,Front.

The proposed algorithm includes a switching population utilization strategy, where the population size is adjusted dynamically based on the solution-searching status. Thus, this adaptive control method realizes the identification of fractional-order Lorenz, Lu and Chen systems in both deterministic and stochastic environments, respectively.

However, several key questions and uncertainties remain with these assessments. Here we used results from an ensemble of 19 state-of-the-art dynamic global vegetation models from the TRENDYv9 project to improve these estimates and study the drivers of its interannual variability. Our results show that North America has been a C sink with a magnitude of 0.37 +/- 0.38 (mean and one standard deviation) PgC year(-1) for the period 2000-2019 (0.31 and 0.44 PgC year(-1) in each decade); split into 0.18 +/- 0.12 PgC year(-1) in Canada (0.15 and 0.20), 0.16 +/- 0.17 in the United States (0.14 and 0.17), 0.02 +/- 0.05 PgC year(-1) in Mexico (0.02 and 0.02) and 0.01 +/- 0.02 in Central America and the Caribbean (0.01 and 0.01). About 57% of the new C assimilated by terrestrial ecosystems is allocated into vegetation, 30% into soils, and 13% into litter. Losses of C due to fire account for 41% of the interannual variability of the mean net biome productivity for all North America in the model ensemble. Finally, we show that drought years (e.g., 2002) have the potential to shift the region to a small net C source in the simulations (-0.02 +/- 0.46 PgC year(-1)). Our results highlight the importance of identifying the major drivers of the interannual variability of the continental-scale land C cycle along with the spatial distribution of local sink-source dynamics.","[Murray-Tortarolo, Guillermo] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Invest Ecosistemas & Sustentabilidad, Morelia, Michoacan, Mexico;

BP is associated with dramatic climatic changes. These events led to fundamental shifts in landscape and have, therefore, been seen as responsible for a major impact on the human ecological behavior of the last hunter-gatherers in the Western European territory. In the case of Iberian Peninsula, it is commonly assumed that these human ecological adaptations are reflected in the new settlement and subsistence patterns that characterized the Late Upper Paleolithic-Mesolithic transition. Following the argument, the main aim of this paper is to present the state-of-the-art and consider this theoretical model using zooarchaeological data of small terrestrial vertebrates and fish from SW Portugal. Archaeological data are reviewed and discussed in order to analyze the change in the exploitation of small game, birds, and aquatic resources during this period. In this paper, we reinforce the idea that in SW Iberia, subsistence intensification and diversification precede the transition itself and are more likely to be related to other long-term phenomena, cultural and/or demographical, than to the changes in settlement behavior. The state-of-the-art discussed here led to new research questions related to the role of small vertebrates on the changes in human subsistence behavior during the Pleistocene-Holocene from Western Iberia.","[Dias, Rita; Bicho, Nuno] Univ Algarve, Fac Ciencias Humanas & Sociais, ICArEHB, Campus Gambelas, P-8005139 Faro, Portugal; [Detry, Cleia] Univ Lisbon, Fac Letras, UNIARQ, Alameda Univ, P-1699 Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade do Algarve; Universidade de Lisboa,"Dias, R (corresponding author), Univ Algarve, Fac Ciencias Humanas & Sociais, ICArEHB, Campus Gambelas, P-8005139 Faro, Portugal.",ritadupontdias@gmail.com,"Bicho, Nuno/J-2841-2012; Detry, Cleia/H-5372-2016","Bicho, Nuno/0000-0001-9655-0549; Dias, Rita/0000-0003-2999-3133; Detry, Cleia/0000-0002-5359-2500",,,,,171,9,9,1,15,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0959-6836,1477-0911,,HOLOCENE,Holocene,JUN,2016,6,,,,964,984,,10.1177/0959683615622547,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683615622547,,,21,"Geography, Physical; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Physical Geography; Geology,DM4GS,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000376305700010,View Full Record in Web of Science

Since knocking combustion is highly stochastic, a cyclic analysis of in-cylinder pressure is necessary. In this study we propose an approach for efficient and robust detection and identification of knocking combustion in three different internal combustion engines. The proposed methodology includes a signal processing technique, called continuous wavelet transformation (CWT), which provides a simultaneous analysis of the in-cylinder pressure traces in the time and frequency domains with coefficients. These coefficients serve as input for a convolutional neural network (CNN) which extracts distinctive features and performs an image recognition task in order to distinguish between non-knock and knock. The results revealed the following: (i) The CWT delivered a stable and effective feature space with the coefficients that represents the unique time-frequency pattern of each individual in-cylinder pressure cycle; (ii) the proposed approach was superior to the state-of-the-art threshold value exceeded (TVE) method with a maximum amplitude pressure oscillation (MAPO) criterion improving the overall accuracy by 6.15 percentage points (up to 92.62%); and (iii) The CWT + CNN method does not require calibrating threshold values for different engines or operating conditions as long as enough and diverse data is used to train the neural network.","[Kefalas, Achilles; Wimmer, Andreas] Graz Univ Technol, Inst Internal Combust Engines & Thermodynam, A-8010 Graz, Austria; [Ofner, Andreas B.; Geiger, Bernhard C.] Know Ctr GmbH, Res Ctr Data Driven Business & Big Data Analyt, A-8010 Graz, Austria; [Pirker, Gerhard; Posch, Stefan; Wimmer, Andreas] LEC GmbH, Large Engine Competence Ctr, A-8010 Graz, Austria",Graz University of Technology,"Kefalas, A (corresponding author), Graz Univ Technol, Inst Internal Combust Engines & Thermodynam, A-8010 Graz, Austria.",kefalas@ivt.tugraz.at; aofner@know-center.at; Gerhard.Pirker@lec.tugraz.at; Stefan.Posch@lec.tugraz.at; bgeiger@know-center.at; andreas.wimmer@lec.tugraz.at,,"Geiger, Bernhard/0000-0003-3257-743X; Kefalas, Achilles/0000-0001-9040-2860; Ofner, Andreas Benjamin/0000-0001-8645-7973","Austrian COMET-Competence Centers for Excellent Technologies-Programme of the Austrian Federal Ministry for Climate Action, Environment, Energy, Mobility, Innovation and Technology; Austrian Federal Ministry for Digital and Economic Affairs; State of Styria; State of Upper Austria; State of Tyrol; State of Vienna","Austrian COMET-Competence Centers for Excellent Technologies-Programme of the Austrian Federal Ministry for Climate Action, Environment, Energy, Mobility, Innovation and Technology; Austrian Federal Ministry for Digital and Economic Affairs; State of Styria; State of Upper Austria; State of Tyrol; State of Vienna","The authors acknowledge the financial support of the Austrian COMET-Competence Centers for Excellent Technologies-Programme of the Austrian Federal Ministry for Climate Action, Environment, Energy, Mobility, Innovation and Technology, the Austrian Federal Ministry for Digital and Economic Affairs, and the States of Styria, Upper Austria, Tyrol, and Vienna for the COMET Centers Know-Center and LEC EvoLET, respectively.

Insect cuticle, such as elytra in beetles, with a typical lightweight lamellar structure, has shown this capability, which is attributed to the accumulation of phenol oxidase with polyphenol and amine-rich compounds in the hard cuticle. In this study, laminar-structure-based intelligence is imitated by incorporating adaptable and growable pyrogallol (PG)-borax dynamic-covalent bonds into a poly(acrylamide)-clay network. The events that lead to crack formation and water accumulation quickly trigger the deprotection of PG. Subsequently, atmospheric O-2, as a regeneration source, activates PG oxidative self-polymerization. Multiple permanent and dynamic cross-links, with the involvement of the sacrificed borax, and initiation of a series of intelligent responses occur. The fabricated composites with an aligned lamellar structure exhibit outstanding characteristics, such as air/water-triggered superstrong adhesion, self-repairing, self-sealing and resealing, and reprocessing. Moreover, the strategy endows the composites with a self-growing capability, which leads to a 4- to 10-fold increase in its strength in an outdoor climate (up to 51 MPa). This study could lead to advances in the development of air/water-responsive composite materials for applications such as adaptive barriers.","[Bei, Zhongwu; Lei, Yang; Lv, Rui; Huang, Yuan; Chen, Yangwei; Zhu, Chao; Cai, Shaojun; Zhao, Dong; You, Qingliang; Cao, Yiping] Jianghan Univ, Inst Interdisciplinary Res, Wuhan 430056, Peoples R China; [Bei, Zhongwu; Lei, Yang; Lv, Rui; Huang, Yuan; Chen, Yangwei; Zhu, Chao; Cai, Shaojun; Zhao, Dong; You, Qingliang; Cao, Yiping] Jianghan Univ, Dept Polymer Sci, Wuhan 430056, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xianzheng] Wuhan Univ, Key Lab Biomed Polymers, Minist Educ, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xianzheng] Wuhan Univ, Dept Chem, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China",Jianghan University; Jianghan University; Wuhan University; Wuhan University,"Cao, YP (corresponding author), Jianghan Univ, Inst Interdisciplinary Res, Wuhan 430056, Peoples R China.;Cao, YP (corresponding author), Jianghan Univ, Dept Polymer Sci, Wuhan 430056, Peoples R China.",cyp@jhun.edu.cn,"zhang, xian/GYA-0290-2022",,Natural Science Foundation of the Hubei Province [2019CFB582],Natural Science Foundation of the Hubei Province(Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province),The authors thank the Natural Science Foundation of the Hubei Province (Grant No. 2019CFB582) for funding.,,58,8,9,10,129,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1936-0851,1936-086X,,ACS NANO,ACS Nano,27-Oct,2020,10,,,,12546,12557,,10.1021/acsnano.0c02549,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.0c02549,,,12,"Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; Chemistry, Physical; Nanoscience & Nanotechnology; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Materials Science,ON6FD,32813499,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000586793400015,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Hurx, M",,,,"Hurx, Merlijn",,,The Most Expert in Europe: Patents and Innovation in the Building Trades in the Early Dutch Republic (1580-1650),ARCHITECTURAL HISTORIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,INVENTION; PROPERTY,"Famous early modern engineering feats in architecture, such as Brunelleschi's dome in Florence, have traditionally been presented in historiography as the accomplishments of individual 'authorial' figures. Yet, for many other innovative building technologies of the early modern period, the authorship remains unknown. Often such inventions were the result of incremental advances for which many people were responsible. The socio-economic circumstances that allowed for technological developments remain an understudied field in architectural history. This paper presents the building site as an important space of knowledge production. Difficulties that arose during construction had a stimulating effect on the exchange of ideas among various professional groups, including architects, master craftsmen, and engineers. A special case is found in the development of specialised building techniques in the 17th-century Dutch Republic. By the end of the Golden Age, the 'Hollanders', considered 'the most expert in Europe' in the construction of large structures in marshy conditions, were valued for their 'incomparable inventions' in hydraulic engineering and their skill in laying foundations. The work involved in this process - driving piles and excavating pits in marshy conditions - was by definition an interdisciplinary endeavour, and required the expertise of architects, masons, carpenters, and others. Building in these conditions not only posed serious technical difficulties, but also involved high costs, challenging master craftsmen to invent new cost-saving methods and techniques. In this paper, this innovative and interdisciplinary climate will be explored through the analysis of 17th-century patents, or inventor privileges, in the Early Dutch Republic (1580-1650). Patents are an understudied source in architectural history, yet architects and artisans from the building trades were highly active in obtaining such privileges. In addition, the patenting process was an important incentive to invest time and capital in technological innovation among various social groups within and outside the building trades, thus stimulating exchanges between people with theoretical and practical backgrounds.","[Hurx, Merlijn] Univ Utrecht, Dept Hist & Art Hist, Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University,"Hurx, M (corresponding author), Univ Utrecht, Dept Hist & Art Hist, Utrecht, Netherlands.",m.hurx@uu.nl,,"Hurx, Merlijn/0000-0002-5559-1798",,,,,62,0,0,0,1,UBIQUITY PRESS LTD,LONDON,"2N, 6 OSBORNE ST, LONDON, E1 6TD, ENGLAND",2050-5833,,,ARCHIT HIST-LONDON,Archit.

Principal Components Analyses demonstrates similar patterns of change in the elemental and non-pollen palynomorph (NPP) datasets between the springs, implying regional drivers are responsible for changes in these proxies. By comparison, the pollen records differ between each of the springs, with the assemblage at each thought to be influenced by spring recharge and evolution rather than climate variability. In order to empirically and objectively assess the synchronicity of changes, we applied Monte Carlo empirical orthogonal function (MCEOF) analysis to one variable in each mu XRF and NPP dataset (Si/Ti ratios and Pseudoschizaea accumulation rates, as these proxies are expected to reflect hydrological conditions in springs) to assess regional patterns of change in site moisture. This analysis revealed periods of increased monsoonal precipitation from similar to 14,500-7500 cal. yr BP corresponding with deglacial sea level rise, high orbital tilt coupled with warmer sea surface temperatures, and with possible links to a southward migration of the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) during the Younger Dryas. Monsoonal precipitation was reduced from 7500 cal. yr BP coinciding with the culmination of deglacial sea level rise and a possible northward shift in the mean position of the ITCZ, in addition to between 2600 and 1000 cal. yr BP corresponding with increased moderate-to-strong ENSO events.

SMIs constitute significant contributors to destination image, yet tourism scholars have not fully explored their persuasive power in framing destinations and affecting potential travellers. This article explores how Iran is framed as a travel destination by SMIs on YouTube by utilizing visual framing theory. As a country subject to both unfavourable framing by Western mainstream media and positive images by SMIs and YouTubers, Iran represents an interesting case study as a destination produced in the cyberworld with multiple and contrasting images and representations. Methodologically, the study integrates netnography and narrative analysis to examine the content of ten travel videos produced by international SMIs. The analysis and interpretation of the visual material unveil the multiple ways of framing Iran by SMIs, which tend to humanize Iran and Iranians, emphasize the country's culture and history, and attribute the misconceptions and fear about Iran to the current global and local political climate. Theoretically, this study advances our understanding of destination image through visual framing theory, which has rarely been applied to explore travel videos.","[Motahar, Pooya Saeidi] Taylors Univ, Sch Hospitality Tourism & Events, Fac Social Sci & Leisure Management, Subang Jaya, Selangor, Malaysia; [Tavakoli, Rokhshad] Sultan Qaboos Univ, Coll Art & Social Sci, Dept Tourism, Muscat, Oman; [Mura, Paolo] Zayed Univ, Coll Commun & Media Sci, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates",Taylor's University; Sultan Qaboos University; Zayed University,"Tavakoli, R (corresponding author), Sultan Qaboos Univ, Coll Art & Social Sci, Dept Tourism, Muscat, Oman.",r.tavakoli@squ.edu.om,"Tavakoli, Rokhshad/D-1273-2018","Tavakoli, Rokhshad/0000-0002-3185-2463; Saeidi Motahar, Pooya/0000-0002-3148-3274; Mura, Paolo/0000-0001-6260-4991","Taylor's University Malaysia; Faculty of Social Sciences and Leisure Management, Taylor's University, Malaysia","Taylor's University Malaysia; Faculty of Social Sciences and Leisure Management, Taylor's University, Malaysia","Taylor's University Malaysia supported this work through its TAYLOR'S RESEARCH SCHOLARSHIP Programme.

Soil hydrology can be strongly affected by land management. Therefore, investigations aimed at assessing the impact of land management changes on soil hydrology are necessary, especially with a view to optimize water resources. This Special Issue collects 12 original contributions addressing the state of the art of soil hydrology for sustainable land management. These contributions cover a wide range of topics including (i) effects of land-use change, (ii) water use efficiency, (iii) erosion risk, (iv) solute transport, and (v) new methods and devices for improved characterization of soil physical and hydraulic properties. They involve both field and laboratory experiments, as well as modelling studies. Also, different spatial scales, i.e., from the field- to regional-scales, as well as a wide range of geographic regions are also covered. The collection of these manuscripts presented in this Special Issue provides a relevant knowledge contribution for effective saving water resources and sustainable land management.","[Di Prima, Simone] Univ Sassari, Agr Dept, Viale Italia 39, I-07100 Sassari, Italy; [Di Prima, Simone] Univ Lyon 1, CNRS, ENTPE, Univ Lyon,Ecol Hydrosyst Nat & Anthropises UMR502, 3 Rue Maurice Audin, F-69518 Vaulx En Velin, France; [Castellini, Mirko] Res Ctr Agr & Environm CREA AA, Council Agr Res & Econ Res, Via C Ulpiani, I-570125 Bari, Italy; [Rodrigo-Comino, Jesus; Cerda, Artemi] Univ Valencia, Dept Geog, Soil Eros & Degradat Res Grp, Valencia 46010, Spain; [Rodrigo-Comino, Jesus] Trier Univ, Phys Geog, D-54286 Trier, Germany",University of Sassari; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; Consiglio per la Ricerca in Agricoltura e L'analisi Dell'economia Agraria (CREA); University of Valencia; Universitat Trier,"Castellini, M (corresponding author), Res Ctr Agr & Environm CREA AA, Council Agr Res & Econ Res, Via C Ulpiani, I-570125 Bari, Italy.",sdiprima@uniss.it; mirko.castellini@crea.gov.it; rodrigo-comino@uma.es; artemio.cerda@uv.es,"Rodrigo-Comino, Jesús/L-4535-2016; Cerda, Artemi/I-4670-2013; Di Prima, Simone/I-8514-2014; Castellini, Mirko/K-1144-2015","Rodrigo-Comino, Jesús/0000-0002-4823-0871; Cerda, Artemi/0000-0001-5326-4489; Di Prima, Simone/0000-0002-5066-3430; Castellini, Mirko/0000-0001-9836-6569",,,,,19,0,0,4,13,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,APR,2020,4,,,,,,1109,10.3390/w12041109,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w12041109,,,5,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,LX0JR,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000539527500186,View Full Record in Web of Science

We argue that while the proliferation of combustible materials has been shaped by cost-cutting and risk-shifting by construction firms, these practices did not on their own transfer the responsibility of remediation to consumers. Examining the attempts of one densifying nation, Australia, to locate responsibility for combustible cladding through two parliamentary inquiries, we analyse witness testimonies to show how public policies encouraged materials substitution, removed on-site inspection and protected corporations from litigation. Moving beyond neoliberalism, these policy reforms leveraged information asymmetries and the material complexity of residential high-rise to create a climate of imperceptibility towards unsafe materials. Together, material, financial and policy dimensions intersected to enable capital accumulation through the expansion of consumer harm in high-rise housing markets. We conclude that construction materials and processes are an overlooked, yet critical domain of governance in financialised housing regimes.","[Cook, Nicole] Univ Wollongong, Sch Geog & Sustainable Communities, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia; [Taylor, Elizabeth J.] Monash Univ, Art Design & Architecture, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",University of Wollongong; Monash University,"Cook, N (corresponding author), Univ Wollongong, Sch Geog & Sustainable Communities, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia.",ncook@uow.edu.au,,"Cook, Nicole/0000-0003-3008-3719; Taylor, Elizabeth/0000-0001-5189-9480",,,,,68,0,0,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1403-6096,1651-2278,,HOUS THEORY SOC,Hous.

Environmental conditions can simultaneously shape the spatial distribution and the temporal dynamics of a population, which together can trigger changes in the functional structure of communities. Here, we developed a comprehensive framework based on complementary multivariate statistical methodologies to simultaneously investigate the effects of environmental conditions on the spatial, temporal and functional dynamics of species assemblages. The framework is tested using survey data collected during more than 4000 fisheries hauls over the Baltic Sea between 2001 and 2016. The approach revealed the Baltic fish community to be structured into three sub-assemblages along a strong and temporally stable salinity gradient decreasing from West to the East. Additionally, we highlight a mismatch between species and functional richness associated with a lower functional redundancy in the Baltic Proper compared with other sub-areas, suggesting an ecosystem more susceptible to external pressures. Based on a large dataset of community data analysed in an innovative and comprehensive way, we could disentangle the effects of environmental changes on the structure of biotic communities-key information for the management and conservation of ecosystems.","[Frelat, Romain; Otto, Saskia A.; Sguotti, Camilla; Moellmann, Christian] Univ Hamburg, Inst Hydrobiol & Fisheries Sci, Ctr Earth Syst Res & Sustainabil CEN, Gross Elbstr 133, D-22767 Hamburg, Germany; [Orio, Alessandro; Casini, Michele] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Inst Marine Res, Dept Aquat Resources, Turistgatan 5, S-45330 Lysekil, Sweden; [Lehmann, Andreas] GEOMAR Helmholtz Ctr Ocean Res, Dusternbrooker Weg 20, D-24105 Kiel, Germany; [Merigot, Bastien] Univ Montpellier, CNRS, IFREMER, IRD,UMR Marbec, Av Jean Monnet, F-34203 Sete, France",University of Hamburg; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Helmholtz Association; GEOMAR Helmholtz Center for Ocean Research Kiel; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Ifremer; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite de Montpellier,"Frelat, R (corresponding author), Univ Hamburg, Inst Hydrobiol & Fisheries Sci, Ctr Earth Syst Res & Sustainabil CEN, Gross Elbstr 133, D-22767 Hamburg, Germany.",romain.frelat@uni-hamburg.de,"Orio, Alessandro/O-4136-2019; Mérigot, Bastien/H-7754-2018; Mérigot, Bastien/M-7052-2019; Möllmann, Christian/C-4788-2011; Romain, Frelat/G-9930-2018; Lehmann, Andreas/B-6175-2014","Orio, Alessandro/0000-0002-5566-6139; Mérigot, Bastien/0000-0001-5264-4324; Mérigot, Bastien/0000-0001-5264-4324; Möllmann, Christian/0000-0001-9161-6342; Romain, Frelat/0000-0002-8631-4398; Lehmann, Andreas/0000-0001-5618-6105; Sguotti, Camilla/0000-0002-3019-6273",European Union [675997]; German Science Foundation; BONUS INSPIRE project - Joint Baltic Sea Research and Development Programme BONUS - EU [Art 185]; Swedish Research Council Formas,European Union(European Commission); German Science Foundation(German Research Foundation (DFG)); BONUS INSPIRE project - Joint Baltic Sea Research and Development Programme BONUS - EU; Swedish Research Council Formas(Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council Formas),"The authors are grateful to all contributors of the DATRAS database who collected and took part in the Baltic International Trawl Survey, and to ICES who merged, cleaned and made the data open access.

Given the growing interest in the development of new chemical recycling approaches, it is critical to evaluate the economics, energy use, greenhouse gas emissions, and other life cycle inventory metrics for emerging processes, relative to the incumbent, linear manufacturing practices employed today. Here we offer specific definitions for classes of chemical recycling and upcycling and describe general process concepts for the chemical recycling of mixed plastics waste. We present a framework for techno-economic analysis and life cycle assessment for both closed- and open-loop chemical recycling. Rigorous application of these process analysis tools will be required to enable impactful solutions for the plastics waste problem.","[Nicholson, Scott R.] Natl Renewable Energy Lab, Grid Planning & Anal Ctr, Golden, CO 80401 USA; [Nicholson, Scott R.; Singh, Avantika; Konev, Mikhail O.; Rorrer, Nicholas A.; Carpenter, Alberta C.; Beckham, Gregg T.] BOTTLE Consortium, Golden, CO 80401 USA; [Rorrer, Julie E.; Roman-Leshkov, Yuriy] MIT, Dept Chem Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Singh, Avantika] Natl Renewable Energy Lab, Carbon Catalyt Transformat & Scale Up Ctr, Golden, CO USA; [Konev, Mikhail O.; Rorrer, Nicholas A.; Beckham, Gregg T.] Natl Renewable Energy Lab, Renewable Resources & Enabling Sci Ctr, Golden, CO USA; [Carpenter, Alberta C.] Natl Renewable Energy Lab, Strateg Energy Anal Ctr, Golden, CO USA; [Jacobsen, Alan J.] Amazon, Seattle, WA USA",United States Department of Energy (DOE); National Renewable Energy Laboratory - USA; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); United States Department of Energy (DOE); National Renewable Energy Laboratory - USA; United States Department of Energy (DOE); National Renewable Energy Laboratory - USA; United States Department of Energy (DOE); National Renewable Energy Laboratory - USA; Amazon.com,"Nicholson, SR (corresponding author), Natl Renewable Energy Lab, Grid Planning & Anal Ctr, Golden, CO 80401 USA.;Nicholson, SR (corresponding author), BOTTLE Consortium, Golden, CO 80401 USA.",,,,"US Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Advanced Manufacturing Office (AMO); US Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Bioenergy Technologies Office (BETO); AMO; BETO [DE-AC36-08GO28308]; National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL); Massachusetts Institute of Technology [DE-AC36-08GO28308]; Arnold O.

Problems are often observed with carbon-based support materials, due to their limited electrochemical stability. The emphasis is therefore on fabricating high-performance, stable non-carbon alternatives that exhibit advantageous electrochemical properties compared to conventional carbon black, and are thus regarded as ideal electrocatalyst support materials. In this work, we investigated the influence of dopants, and the morphology of conductive, porous doped tin-based oxides, on corrosion resistance and electrical conductivity for fuel cell electrode applications. Among the various doping elements, fluorine anion doping into tin oxide plays a key role in the formation of such structures as a complexing agent for improving electrical conductivity and suppressing electrochemical dissolution processes. When used in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells with platinum electrocatalyst loading, fluorine tin oxide nanotubes exhibit not only cell performance comparable to that of state-of-the-art commercial Pt/C, but also excellent cycling stability. The superior electrochemical performance and stability of this novel non-carbon support material is due to its unique features, i.e., excellent electrical conductivity, electrochemical corrosion resistance, and electronic and compressive strain effects due to strong metal-support interactions.","[Kim, Jong Min; Lee, Yeo Jin; Kim, Seung-hoon; Lee, Kyung Ah; Byeon, Ayeong; Kang, Yun Sik; Park, Hee-Young; Ham, Hyung Chul; Kim, Jin Young] KIST, Ctr Hydrogen Fuel Cell Res, 14 Gil 5 Hwarang Ro, Seoul 02792, South Korea; [Lee, Yeo Jin] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Energy Sci, Suwon 16419, South Korea; [Kim, Seung-hoon] Korea Univ, Grad Sch Energy & Environm, Green Sch, Seoul 02841, South Korea; [Chae, Keun-Hwa; Cho, Min Kyung] KIST, Adv Anal Ctr, 14 Gil 5 Hwarang Ro, Seoul 02792, South Korea; [Yoon, Ki Ro] Korea Inst Ind Technol KITECH, Tech Text & Mat R&D Grp, 143 Hanggaul Ro, Ansan 15588, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea; [Byeon, Ayeong] LG Chem Res Pk, IT&E Mat R&D, 188 Munji Ro, Daejeon 34122, South Korea; [Kang, Yun Sik] Hyundai Mobis, Fuel Cell Engn Team, Uiwang 16082, Gyeonggi, South Korea",Korea Institute of Science & Technology (KIST); Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU); Korea University; Korea Institute of Science & Technology (KIST); Korea Institute of Industrial Technology (KITECH); LG Chem; Hyundai Mobis,"Kim, JY (corresponding author), KIST, Ctr Hydrogen Fuel Cell Res, 14 Gil 5 Hwarang Ro, Seoul 02792, South Korea.",jinykim@kist.re.kr,"Park, Hee-Young/AAS-3590-2021; Park, Hee-Young/D-8852-2013","Park, Hee-Young/0000-0002-7000-7369; Kim, Seung-hoon/0000-0002-5990-0738","KIST Institutional Program [2E29600]; Global Frontier R&D Program on Center for Multiscale Energy System - National Research Foundation under the Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning, Korea [2016M3A6A7945505]; Technology Development Program to Solve Climate Changes of the National Research Foundation (NRF) - Ministry of Science, ICT, & Future Planning [NRF-2015M1A2A2056690]","KIST Institutional Program(Korea Institute of Science & Technology (KIST)); Global Frontier R&D Program on Center for Multiscale Energy System - National Research Foundation under the Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning, Korea; Technology Development Program to Solve Climate Changes of the National Research Foundation (NRF) - Ministry of Science, ICT, & Future Planning","This work was supported by the KIST Institutional Program (2E29600).

Using super resolution methods, high resolution image is obtained from a set of low resolution images, after it had undergone two main processes; image registration process based on Keren algorithm and image reconstruction process based on Projection onto Convex Set (POCS) on frequency domain.

It has been shown that asphaltene deposition on conductive surfaces can be controlled by the application of an electric field. The electric field has been used to either inhibit or accelerate asphaltene deposition. This paper reviews asphaltene behavior in an electric field. It describes the structure and electric properties of asphaltenes as well as their electrokinetic behavior. State-of-the-art asphaltene electrodeposition and separation from both model and crude oils using electric fields are also discussed. The influence of parameters such as asphaltene chemistry, crude oil composition, pH, electric field strength, and flow conditions on the asphaltene electrodeposition process is addressed, and the effect of asphaltene interactions with themselves and other crude oil components is evaluated. A comprehensive literature survey reported the electrodeposition on both positive and negative electrodes, which suggests the complexity of the process. It has been shown that asphaltene charges can be tailored by changing the process parameters. Because of the high energy efficiency and relatively simple process, asphaltene electrodeposition is currently a key solution for removal of asphaltenes from crude oils. This review also highlights the main challenges and knowledge gaps associated with the asphaltene electrodeposition process.","[Laedre, Sigrid] SINTEF Ind, Dept Mat & Nanotechnol, NO-7465 Trondheim, Norway; [Gawel, Kamila] SINTEF Ind, Dept Petr, NO-7465 Trondheim, Norway; [Farooq, Umer] SINTEF Ocean, Dept Climate & Environm, NO-7465 Trondheim, Norway",SINTEF; SINTEF; SINTEF,"Farooq, U (corresponding author), SINTEF Ocean, Dept Climate & Environm, NO-7465 Trondheim, Norway.",umer.farooq@sintef.no,,"FAROOQ, UMER/0000-0001-8310-446X; Gawel, Kamila/0000-0002-3694-2804",SINTEF Industry project SIP Electrophoresis,SINTEF Industry project SIP Electrophoresis(SINTEF),Financial support from the internally funded SINTEF Industry project SIP Electrophoresis is gratefully acknowledged.,,157,6,6,1,6,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0887-0624,1520-5029,,ENERG FUEL,Energy Fuels,6-May,2021,9,,,,7285,7304,,10.1021/acs.energyfuels.0c03962,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.0c03962,,21-Apr,20,"Energy & Fuels; Engineering, Chemical",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Energy & Fuels; Engineering,RZ8VX,,"Green Published, hybrid",,,12/21/22,WOS:000648878900024,View Full Record in Web of Science

Synthesis strategies are used to steer MoP selectivity toward higher alcohols by investigating the promotion effects of alkali (K) and CO-dissociating (Co, Ni) and non-CO-dissociating (Pd) metals. A systematic study with transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) showed that critical parameters governing the activity of MoP catalysts are P/Mo ratio and K loading, both facilitating MoP formation. The kinetic studies of mesoporous silica-supported MoP catalysts show a twofold role of K, which also acts as an electronic promoter by increasing the total alcohol selectivity and chain length. Palladium (Pd) increases CO conversion, but decreases alcohol chain length. The use of mesoporous carbon (MC) support has the most significant effect on catalyst performance and yields a KMoP/MC catalyst that ranks among the state-of-the-art in terms of selectivity to higher alcohols.","[ten Have, Iris C.; Valle, Eduardo; Gallo, Alessandro; Snider, Jonathan L.; Duyar, Melis S.; Jaramillo, Thomas F.] Stanford Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [ten Have, Iris C.; Valle, Eduardo; Gallo, Alessandro; Snider, Jonathan L.; Duyar, Melis S.; Jaramillo, Thomas F.] SLAC Natl Accelerator Lab, SUNCAT Ctr Interface Sci & Catalysis, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA; [ten Have, Iris C.] Univ Utrecht, Inorgan Chem & Catalysis, Debye Inst Nanomat Sci, Utrecht, Netherlands",Stanford University; Stanford University; United States Department of Energy (DOE); SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory; Utrecht University,"Duyar, MS; Jaramillo, TF (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.;Duyar, MS; Jaramillo, TF (corresponding author), SLAC Natl Accelerator Lab, SUNCAT Ctr Interface Sci & Catalysis, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA.",melis@stanford.edu; jaramillo@stanford.edu,"Jaramillo, Thomas F/C-4174-2014","Jaramillo, Thomas F/0000-0001-9900-0622; Gallo, Alessandro/0000-0003-4687-8188; ten Have, Iris/0000-0001-7863-6197; Duyar, Melis/0000-0002-9891-5932","Global Climate & Energy Project (GCEP) at Stanford University; US Department of Energy, Chemical Sciences, Geosciences, and Biosciences (CSGB) Division of the Office of Basic Energy Sciences [DE-AC02-76SF00515]; National Science Foundation [ECCS-1542152]; US Department of Energy, Office of Basic Energy Sciences [DE-AC02-76SF00515]","Global Climate & Energy Project (GCEP) at Stanford University; US Department of Energy, Chemical Sciences, Geosciences, and Biosciences (CSGB) Division of the Office of Basic Energy Sciences(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); US Department of Energy, Office of Basic Energy Sciences(United States Department of Energy (DOE))","I.C.t.H. and E.V. contributed equally to this work.

These models now exhibit fast, short-term volume changes, in line with current observations of mass loss. Coupling with ocean models is currently on its way and applied to key areas of the Antarctic ice sheet. New model intercomparisons have been launched, focusing on ice/ocean interaction (MISMIP+, MISOMIP) or ice-sheet model initialization and multi-ensemble projections (ISMIP6).

In the Southern Hemisphere (SH), the stratospheric ozone depletion leads to a cooler and stronger Antarctic stratosphere, while the stratospheric ozone recovery has the opposite effects. In the Northern Hemisphere (NH), the impacts of the stratospheric ozone depletion on polar stratospheric temperature are not opposite to that of the stratospheric ozone recovery; i.e., the stratospheric ozone depletion causes a weak cooling and the stratospheric ozone recovery causes a statistically significant cooling. The stratospheric ozone depletion leads to a weakening of the Arctic polar vortex, while the stratospheric ozone recovery leads to a strengthening of the Arctic polar vortex. The cooling of the Arctic polar vortex is found to be dynamically induced viamodulating the planetary wave activity by stratospheric ozone increases. Particularly interesting is that stratospheric ozone changes have opposite effects on the stationary and transient wave fluxes in the NH stratosphere. The analysis of the wave refractive index and Eliassen-Palm flux in the NH indicates (1) that the wave refraction in the stratosphere cannot fully explain wave flux changes in the Arctic stratosphere and (2) that stratospheric ozone changes can cause changes in wave propagation in the northern midlatitude troposphere which in turn affect wave fluxes in the NH stratosphere. In the SH, the radiative cooling (warming) caused by stratospheric ozone depletion (recovery) produces a larger (smaller) meridional temperature gradient in the midlatitude upper troposphere, accompanied by larger (smaller) zonal wind vertical shear and larger (smaller) vertical gradients of buoyancy frequency. Hence, there are more (fewer) transient waves propagating into the stratosphere. The dynamical warming (cooling) caused by stratospheric ozone decreases (increases) partly offsets their radiative cooling (warming).","[Hu, Dingzhu; Tian, Wenshou; Wang, Chunxiao; Zhang, Jiankai] Lanzhou Univ, Coll Atmospher Sci, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China; [Hu, Dingzhu] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Minist Educ, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Xie, Fei] Beijing Normal Univ, Coll Global Change & Earth Syst Sci, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Xie, Fei] Joint Ctr Global Change Studies, Beijing, Peoples R China",Lanzhou University; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Beijing Normal University,"Tian, WS (corresponding author), Lanzhou Univ, Coll Atmospher Sci, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China.",wstian@lzu.edu.cn,"Zhang, Jiankai/N-8781-2019; Zhang, Jiankai/AAR-3510-2020; Xie, Fei/I-9766-2016","Zhang, Jiankai/0000-0002-8491-0225; Xie, Fei/0000-0003-2891-3883","National Science Foundation of China [41225018, 2014CB441202, 41175042]",National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This work was supported by the National Science Foundation of China (41225018, 2014CB441202, and 41175042).

The building HVAC system consists of a radiant cooling system to cover the sensible load and either a 2-fluid or 3-fluid M-LDAC system to meet the latent load. The systems are simulated over the warmest week of the year using TRNSYS simulation software and modelled using a previously developed analytical model for the 2-fluid M-LDAC system and empirical models for the 3-fluid M-LDAC systems. Sensitivity studies are performed where the systems are evaluated under different latent load conditions due to different occupant densities and infiltration rates. The 2-fluid and 3-fluid M-LDAC systems can meet the latent loads at lower occupant densities and infiltration rates but fail to provide thermal comfort conditions as occupancy and infiltration rates increase. It is concluded that the 3-fluid M-LDAC system uses less energy to meet the latent load than the 2-fluid M-LDAC system.

The mechanisms by which soil moisture contributes such skill are examined here with a simple water balance-based model that captures the essence of soil moisture behavior in a state-of-the-art subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) forecasting system. The simple model successfully transforms initial soil moisture contents into average forecast evapotranspiration (ET) values at 16-30-day lead that agree well, during summer, with the values forecast by the full NASA GEOS S2S system, indicating that soil moisture initialization dominates over forecast meteorological conditions in determining ET fluxes at subseasonal leads. When the simple model's ET anomalies are interpreted in terms of T2M anomalies, a similar conclusion is reached for T2M: soil moisture initialization explains much (about 50% in the eastern half of the continental United States) of the T2M anomaly values produced by the full GEOS S2S system at 16-30-day lead, and the T2M forecasts produced by the simple model capture about one-half of the skill attained by the full system. The simple model's framework is particularly conducive to an analysis of uncertainty in forecasts. Drier soils are generally found to induce larger uncertainty in ET (and thus T2M) forecasts, a result linked to the functional form relating ET to soil moisture in the simple model and verified by an analysis of the ensemble spreads within the forecasts produced by the full GEOS S2S system.","[Koster, Randal D.; Schubert, Siegfried D.; Molod, Andrea M.; Mahanama, Sarith P.] NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Global Modeling & Assimilat Off, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; [Schubert, Siegfried D.; DeAngelis, Anthony M.; Mahanama, Sarith P.] Sci Syst & Applicat Inc, Lanham, MD USA",National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; Science Systems and Applications Inc,"Koster, RD (corresponding author), NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Global Modeling & Assimilat Off, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA.",randal.d.koster@nasa.gov,"Koster, Randal D/F-5881-2012","Koster, Randal D/0000-0001-6418-6383","NASAMAP program [NNG17HP01C, WBS802678.02.17.01.33]; NOAA MAPP program [NA14OAR4310221]; NASA MAP program",NASAMAP program(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); NOAA MAPP program; NASA MAP program(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)),"This work was supported by the NASAMAP(NNG17HP01C andWBS802678.02.17.01.33) and NOAA MAPP (NA14OAR4310221) programs.

Arid and semi-arid areas of East Asia are one of the important dust source regions thus it is crucial to understand dust mobilization and accurately estimate dust emissions in East Asia. However, present dust models still contain large uncertainties with dust emissions that remain a significant contributor to the overall uncertainties in the model. In this study, we attempt to reduce these uncertainties by using an inverse modeling technique and obtain optimized dust emissions. We use Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) aerosol optical depths (AODs) and groundbased mass concentrations of particles less than 10 mu m in aerodynamic diameter (PM10) observations over East Asia in May 2007. The MODIS AODs are validated with AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) AODs. The inversion uses the maximum a posteriori method and the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model (CTM) as a forward model. The model error is large over dust source regions including the Gobi Desert and Mongolia. We find that inverse modeling analyses from the MODIS and PM10 observations consistently result in decrease of dust emissions over Mongolia and the Gobi Desert. Whereas over the Taklamakan Desert and Manchuria, the inverse modeling analyses from both observations yield contrast results such as increase of dust sources using MODIS AODs, while decrease of those using PM10 observations. We discuss some limitations of both observations to obtain the optimized dust emissions and suggest several strategies for the improvement of dust emission estimates in the model.","[Ku, Bonyang; Park, Rokjin J.] Seoul Natl Univ, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Seoul 151742, South Korea; [Ku, Bonyang] Natl Inst Meteorol Res, Seoul, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU),"Park, RJ (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, 1 Gwanak Ro, Seoul 151742, South Korea.",rjpark@snu.ac.kr,"Park, Rokjin J./I-5055-2012","Park, Rokjin J./0000-0001-8922-0234",Korea Meteorological Administration Research and Development Program [CATER 2012-6121],Korea Meteorological Administration Research and Development Program(Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA)),This study was funded by the Korea Meteorological Administration Research and Development Program under Grant CATER 2012-6121.

Here we use skull length measurements (as a surrogate for body mass) from five Australian marsupial species to test the primary hypotheses of geographic variation in body size (relating to ambient temperature, productivity, and seasonality). We used a revised articulation of Bergmann's rule, wherein evidence for thermoregulation (heat dissipation or heat conservation) is considered supportive of Bergmann's rule. We modeled the skull lengths of four Petaurid glider species and the common brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) as a function of indices of ambient temperature, productivity, and seasonality. The skull length of Petaurus ariel, P. notatus, and the squirrel glider (P. norfolcensis), increased with increasing winter minimum temperature, while that of T. vulpecula decreased with increasing summer maximum temperature. The skull length of P. ariel decreased with indices of productivity, falsifying the productivity hypothesis. Only P. ariel met the hypothesis of seasonality, as skull length increased with increasing seasonality. Thermoregulation was the most consistently supported driver of geographic variation in body size, as we found evidence of either heat conservation or heat dissipation in four of the five species examined. We found the geographic range of the individual species and the climate space in which the species occurred was integral to understanding the species' responses to climate variables. Future studies should use specimens that are representative of a species' entire geographic range, encompass a variety of climatic regions, and use consistent methodologies and terminology when testing drivers of geographic variation in body size.","[Stobo-Wilson, Alyson M.; Cremona, Teigan; Murphy, Brett P.; Carthew, Susan M.] Charles Darwin Univ, Res Inst Environm & Livelihoods, Casuarina, NT 0909, Australia",Charles Darwin University,"Stobo-Wilson, AM (corresponding author), Charles Darwin Univ, Res Inst Environm & Livelihoods, Casuarina, NT 0909, Australia.",alyson.stobowilson@gmail.com,"Stobo-Wilson, Alyson/AAV-1910-2021; Murphy, Brett Patrick/A-3991-2011","Stobo-Wilson, Alyson/0000-0002-3880-2442; Murphy, Brett Patrick/0000-0002-8230-3069",Holsworth Wildlife Research Endowment; Australian Research Council [LP150100615],Holsworth Wildlife Research Endowment; Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"We thank Rachel Correll, Thomas Prowse, and Gavin Prideaux, for making their data on T. vulpecula publicly available and supporting our use of them.

For example, a growing literature is exploring the relationship between greenspace and crime in cities, yielding mixed results. To address this question on a larger scale across diverse contexts, we used a multilevel modeling approach to investigate the relationship between different types of crime and urban greenspace in 59,703 census block groups within the 301 largest cities in the United States. After accounting for potential covariates of crime, including demographic, socioeconomic, and climate variables, we found that, on average, census block groups with more greenspace (measured by NDVI) had lower risk of both property (beta = -0.66 [-0.70 to -0.61]) and violent crime (beta = -0.25 [-0.28 to -0.22]). For property crime, this significant negative relationship held for all but one city in the sample (Cape Coral, FL), and no cities displayed a significant positive relationship. For violent crime a negative relationship was found for 289 cities and only three cities displayed a significant positive relationship (Chicago, IL, Detroit, MI, and Newark, NJ). Further research could strive to investigate the mechanisms fueling these significant and consistent trends and explore relationships between different types of crime and specific components and seasonal variations of greenspace.","[Ogletree, S.

The future of agricultural territories, especially around large cities, is thus questioned considering increasing urbanization, degradation of natural resources and socio-economic transformations. In order to anticipate what changes rural areas could experience, a process of territorial foresight was conducted on the southern Niayes area in Senegal. It enabled the local experts who engaged in this process to identify factors of change and to co-elaborate plausible scenarios of change in the territory. Regulations, governance and demography are the three major factors affecting land allocation over time. These factors determine how space is shared and natural resources are used, harmoniously or through conflict.

While Icelandic heated greenhouses enable a larger variety of crops to be grown, their upkeep is labor and resource intensive, and the associated costs can be prohibitive. Professor Robert Dell, Director of the Laboratory for Energy Reclamation and Innovation (LERI) at the Cooper Union has developed an intensive cascade utilization system using waste steam condensate and hot water as a working fluid that creates an outdoor shallow network of plastic pipes for heating garden soil. This research and development, which began in 2007 in New York City and 2009 in Iceland, compares plant growth between heated and control gardens. Previous studies' test beds used municipal district heated wastewater, waste fluid from a geothermal heated swimming pool, and waste hot water from a traditional heated greenhouse. This paper analyzes the results of enhanced outdoor crop production using a new small-scale, high yield garden from the 2019 growing season at the Agricultural University of Iceland (Landbunaoarhaskoli Islands). The plants studied include turnips, zucchinis, tomatoes, oregano, and a variety of peppers. A plant growth index was developed for analytical purposes. It takes the weighted average of measurements of plant height and the two widest stem spread diameters to quantify growth before the harvest. The plants in heated gardens grew approximately 45% taller and wider on average than those in unheated beds.","[Mignano, Christopher; Dushaj, Enea] Cooper Union Adv Sci & Art, Mech Engn, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Unnthorsson, Runar] Univ Iceland, Fac Ind Engn, Mech Engn & Comp Sci, Reykjavik, Iceland; [Dell, Robert] Cooper Union Adv Sci & Art, Lab Energy Reclamat & Innovat, Mech Engn, New York, NY USA; [Dell, Robert] Univ Iceland, Low Temp Cascade Energy Utilizat Grp, Reykjavik, Iceland",University of Iceland; University of Iceland,"Mignano, C (corresponding author), Cooper Union Adv Sci & Art, Mech Engn, New York, NY 10003 USA.",cmignano13@gmail.com; eneadushaj@gmail.com,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,0,AMER SOC MECHANICAL ENGINEERS,NEW YORK,"THREE PARK AVENUE, NEW YORK, NY 10016-5990 USA",,,978-0-7918-8563-5,,,,2021,,,,,,,V08AT08A033,,,,,8,"Energy & Fuels; Engineering, Multidisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Energy & Fuels; Engineering,BU1YR,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000883346700033,View Full Record in Web of Science

Understanding how interacting top-down and bottom-up factors influence phytoplankton cell size in different aquatic environments is still a challenge. Structural equation modeling (SEM) is a comprehensive multivariate statistical tool for detecting cause-effect relationship among different variables and their hierarchical structure in complex networks (e.g. trophic interactions in ecosystems). Here, several SEM models were employed to investigate the direct and indirect interaction pathways affecting the phytoplankton size structure in 44 mostly eutrophic and hypereutrophic permanent lakes in western Turkey. Among the 15 environmental variables tested, only rotifers and Carlson's Trophic Index (TSI) had significant direct positive effect on the mean phytoplankton size and size variance, respectively. The results indicate that both bottom-up and top-down factors significantly affect phytoplankton community size structure in eutrophic and hypereutrophic lakes in warm climates. Rotifer grazing increased the abundance of large-sized phytoplankton species, such as filamentous and colonial cyanobacteria and TSI affected phytoplankton size variance, with a higher size variance in hypereutrophic lakes.","[Erdogan, Seyda] Yozgat Bozok Univ, Fac Sci & Art, Dept Biol, Erdogan Akdag Kampusu Ataturk Yolu 7 Km, TR-66900 Yozgat, Turkey; [Erdogan, Seyda; Beklioglu, Meryem; Levi, Eti E.; Bucak, Tuba; Tavsanoglu, Ulku Nihan] Middle East Tech Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Limnol Lab, Dumlupinar Bulvari 1, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey; [Beklioglu, Meryem] Middle East Tech Univ, Ecosyst Res & Implementat Ctr EKOSAM, Dept Biol Sci, Dumlupinar Bulvari 1, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey; [Litchman, Elena] Michigan State Univ, WK Kellogg Biol Stn, 3700 East Gull Lake Dr, Hickory Corners, MI 49060 USA; [Litchman, Elena] Michigan State Univ, Program Ecol Evolutionary Biol & Behav, 293 Farm Lane, E Lansing, MI 48840 USA; [Miller, Elizabeth T.] Univ Oregon, Inst Ecol & Evolut, Dept Biol, 272 Onyx Bridge, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Levi, Eti E.] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, Nordre Ringgade 1, DK-8000 Silkeborg, Denmark; [Bucak, Tuba] Nat Conservat Ctr DKM, Cigdem Mahallesi 1594, TR-06460 Ankara, Turkey; [Tavsanoglu, Ulku Nihan] Cankiri Karatekin Univ, Eldivan Vocat Sch Hlth Serv, Dept Environm Hlth Program, Cay Mahallesi Gaziosmanpa Caddesi 4, TR-18100 Cankiri, Turkey",Bozok University; Middle East Technical University; Middle East Technical University; Michigan State University; Michigan State University; University of Oregon; Aarhus University; Cankiri Karatekin University,"Erdogan, S (corresponding author), Yozgat Bozok Univ, Fac Sci & Art, Dept Biol, Erdogan Akdag Kampusu Ataturk Yolu 7 Km, TR-66900 Yozgat, Turkey.;Erdogan, S; Beklioglu, M (corresponding author), Middle East Tech Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Limnol Lab, Dumlupinar Bulvari 1, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey.;Beklioglu, M (corresponding author), Middle East Tech Univ, Ecosyst Res & Implementat Ctr EKOSAM, Dept Biol Sci, Dumlupinar Bulvari 1, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey.;Litchman, E (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, WK Kellogg Biol Stn, 3700 East Gull Lake Dr, Hickory Corners, MI 49060 USA.;Litchman, E (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Program Ecol Evolutionary Biol & Behav, 293 Farm Lane, E Lansing, MI 48840 USA.",ERDOGAN.SEYDA@GMAIL.COM,,"Erdogan, Seyda/0000-0001-7729-7664","Turkish Scientific and Research Council (TUBITAK) [CAYDAG105Y332, 110Y125]; BAP research grant; METU-DPT OYP programme of Turkey [DPT-2011-1786]; National Science Foundation [DEB-1754250]; TUB.ITAK 2214-A (2014-2) National Scholarship Programme for PhD Students",Turkish Scientific and Research Council (TUBITAK)(Turkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Arastirma Kurumu (TUBITAK)); BAP research grant; METU-DPT OYP programme of Turkey(Middle East Technical University); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); TUB.ITAK 2214-A (2014-2) National Scholarship Programme for PhD Students,Turkish Scientific and Research Council (TUBITAK) (CAYDAG105Y332 and 110Y125).

The accuracy of the models was calculated using spatially independent test data by the area under the curve (AUC) of a receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) plot. The mean AUC values of the geomorphological models varied between 0.711 and 0.755 based on single-model techniques, whereas the corresponding values based on consensus methods ranged from 0.752 to 0.782. The weighted average consensus method had the highest predictive performance of all methods. It improved the accuracy of 11 predictions out of 12. The results of this study suggest that the consensus methods have clear advantages over single-model predictions. The simplicity of the consensus methods makes it straightforward to implement them in predictive modelling studies in geomorphology. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Also, most inversions place CO(2)release from fossil fuel combustion and biospheric sources entirely at the surface. However, a non-negligible portion of the emissions actually occurs in the form of reduced carbon species, which are eventually oxidized to CO(2)downwind. Omission of this 'chemical pump' can result in a significant redistribution of the inferred total carbon fluxes among regions. We assess the impacts of different prescriptions of fossil fuel emissions and accounting for the chemical pump on flux estimation, with a novel aspect of conducting both satellite CO(2)observation-based and surfacein situ-based inversions. We apply 3-D carbon monoxide (CO) loss rates archived from a state-of-the-art GEOS chemistry and climate model simulation in a forward transport model run to simulate the distribution of CO(2)originating from oxidation of carbon species. We also subtract amounts from the prior surface CO(2)fluxes that are actually emitted in the form of fossil and biospheric CO, methane, and non-methane volatile organic compounds (VOCs). We find that the posterior large-scale fluxes are generally insensitive to the finer-scale spatial differences between the ODIAC and CDIAC fossil fuel CO(2)gridded datasets and assumptions about international bunker emissions. However, accounting for 3-D chemical CO(2)production and the surface correction shifts the global carbon sink, e.g. from land to ocean and from the tropics to the north, with a magnitude and even direction that depend on assumptions about the surface correction. A GOSAT satellite-based inversion is more sensitive to the chemical pump than one usingin situobservations, exhibiting substantial flux impacts of 0.28, 0.53, and -0.47 Pg C yr(-1)over tropical land, global land, and oceans, due to differences in the horizontal and vertical sampling of the two observation types. Overall, the biases from neglecting the chemical pump appear to be minor relative to the flux estimate uncertainties and the differences between thein situand GOSAT inversions, but their relative importance will grow in the future as observational coverage further increases and satellite retrieval biases decrease.","[Wang, James S.; Oda, Tomohiro; Strode, Sarah A.] Univ Space Res Assoc, Goddard Earth Sci Technol & Res, Columbia, MD 21046 USA; [Wang, James S.; Oda, Tomohiro; Kawa, S.

Here, we analysed a database of 115'686 non-forest trees (1'025 species) to quantify the present contributions of native and non-native trees to biodiversity (taxonomic richness) in the metropolitan area of Geneva, Switzerland. Non-native trees made up 90 % of species and 40 % of individuals. A subset of these individuals with more detailed phenotypic information (N = 50'718 trees; 527 species) was used to quantify five regulating ecosystem services (micro-particle capture, carbon sequestration, water interception, microclimatic cooling, and support for pollinators), three cultural ecosystem services (natural heritage, recreational, and aesthetic value) and two disservices (allergies and biological invasiveness). Non-native and native trees generated roughly identical regulating services, on a per-tree basis, as these are linked primarily to tree morphology rather than to tree-origin. Non-native trees generated cultural ecosystem services that were greater than native trees, on a per-tree basis, with the exception of the notion of natural heritage. For example, 79 % (163/207) of trees independently identified as remarkable by the canton of Geneva were non-native. Our results illustrate that non-native trees represent a significant source of biodiversity and ecosystem services both in absolute terms and on a per-tree basis. Given the empirical importance of non-native trees in many cities, and the likelihood that their importance will increase with future climate change, we suggest that non-native trees be considered in conservation assessments and strategic planning both for intrinsic reasons and for their contributions to human well-being.","[Schlaepfer, Martin A.; Guinaudeau, Benjamin P.] Univ Geneva, Inst Environm Sci, 66 Blvd Carl Vogt, CH-1205 Geneva, Switzerland; [Schlaepfer, Martin A.; Guinaudeau, Benjamin P.] Univ Geneva, Fac Sci, 66 Blvd Carl Vogt, CH-1205 Geneva, Switzerland; [Martin, Pascal; Wyler, Nicolas] Conservatory & Bot Garden City Geneva, Chemin Imperatrice 1 Case Postale 71, CH-1292 Chambesy, Switzerland",University of Geneva; University of Geneva,"Schlaepfer, MA (corresponding author), Univ Geneva, Inst Environm Sci, 66 Blvd Carl Vogt, CH-1205 Geneva, Switzerland.;Schlaepfer, MA (corresponding author), Univ Geneva, Fac Sci, 66 Blvd Carl Vogt, CH-1205 Geneva, Switzerland.",martin.schlaepfer@unige.ch; benjamin.guinaudeau@gmail.com; pascal.martin@ville-ge.ch; nicolas.wyler@ville-ge.ch,,,G'innove Fund (City of Geneva),G'innove Fund (City of Geneva),"We thank the group GE-21 for their intellectual support as well as two anonymous reviewers for their very detailed and constructive feedback.

We hypothesized increasing amounts and declining turnover times of soil organic matter (SOM) under permanent grassland with increasing elevation and decreasing temperature. Samples from an irrigated transect in the Swiss Alps (880 to 2200m elevation, mean annual temperatures +8.9 to +0.9 degrees C) were analyzed. Soil C stocks ranged from 49 to 96 t Cha(-1) (0-20 cm) and were not related to elevation, though the highest site stored least C. Particulate organic carbon (POC) increased significantly with elevation and accounted for >80% of the total soil C at 2200m (0-5 cm). Mean residence times (MRTs) of POC computed by means of radiocarbon dating were in the order of years to decades and were positively related to elevation in the topsoil. At higher elevations, the estimated total C flux through the soil profile mainly depended on this fraction. MRT of mineral-associated matter ranged from decades to centuries and was not systematically related to elevation, but positively related to the soil mineral surface area and it increased with soil depth. Turnover rates from simulations with the soil C model RothC exceeded those from (14)C measurements by a factor of 1.7-3.3 which suggests that C dynamics at these sites is overestimated by the model. Size of model pools and amount of C in soil fractions were only weakly correlated, thereby challenging previously postulated hypotheses concerning the correspondence of pools and fractions for grasslands at higher elevations.","[Leifeld, Jens; Fuhrer, Juerg] Agroscope Reckenholz Tanikon Res Stn ART, Air Pollut Climate Grp, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland; [Zimmermann, Michael] Sch Geosci, Inst Geog, Edinburgh EH8 9XP, Midlothian, Scotland; [Conen, Franz] Univ Basel, Inst Environm Geosci, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Research Station Agroscope; Swiss Federal Research Station for Agroecology & Agriculture; University of Edinburgh; University of Basel,"Leifeld, J (corresponding author), Agroscope Reckenholz Tanikon Res Stn ART, Air Pollut Climate Grp, Reckenholzstr 191, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland.",jens.leifeld@art.admin.ch,"Zimmermann, Michael/F-7547-2010; Leifeld, Jens/A-3298-2014; Leifeld, Jens/GYR-0349-2022","Zimmermann, Michael/0000-0002-5162-2008; Leifeld, Jens/0000-0002-7245-9852; Leifeld, Jens/0000-0002-7245-9852; Conen, Franz/0000-0003-4821-5775",Swiss Federal Office for the Environment,Swiss Federal Office for the Environment,"We thank Sabine Fenner and Robin Giger for their help with the laboratory work and Pierluigi Calanca for providing meteorological data.

Increased HABs have also been linked to climate change, with ocean warming predicted to lead to increased prevalence and earlier timing of HABs. Testing the predictions of warming to HABs is difficult due to the lack of long-term observations across spatial scales. Here, we use a 45 year (1970-2015) record of the occurrence and duration of HABs along Chinese coast to show that the HAB frequency has increased at a rate of 40 +/- 4% decade(-1), with earlier timing by 5.50 +/- 1.78 days decade(-1). The increasing frequency of blooms varied with latitude and is significantly correlated with warming at an average rate of 0.17 +/- 0.03 degrees C decade(-1), with the positive relationship being strongest in more eutrophic provinces. HAB frequency increased with elevated dissolved inorganic nutrient concentration, but this increase was amplified further with warming. Warming and eutrophication showed additive roles in triggering HABs. Swift action to mitigate eutrophication is essential to avoid a sharp increase in the HABs in coastal waters with further warming.","[Xiao, Xi; Pan, Yaoru; Yu, Yan; Wu, Jiaping] Zhejiang Univ, Ocean Coll, 1 Zheda Rd, Zhoushan 316021, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Agusti, Susana; Duarte, Carlos M.] KAUST, RSRC, Thuwal 239556900, Saudi Arabia",Zhejiang University; King Abdullah University of Science & Technology,"Xiao, X (corresponding author), Zhejiang Univ, Ocean Coll, 1 Zheda Rd, Zhoushan 316021, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",prana@zju.edu.cn,"xiao, xi/K-1027-2014; Duarte Quesada, Carlos Manuel/ABD-6208-2021; Duarte, Carlos M/A-7670-2013; Wu, Jiaping/AAD-8800-2022; Xiao, Xi/M-4661-2019; Agusti, Susana/G-2864-2017","xiao, xi/0000-0002-9753-6586; Duarte, Carlos M/0000-0002-1213-1361; Xiao, Xi/0000-0002-9753-6586; Wu, Jiaping/0000-0002-1785-4403; Agusti, Susana/0000-0003-0536-7293","National Natural Science Foundation of China [21677122, 21876148]; International Science and Technology Cooperation Program of China from Ministry of Science and Technology, China [2015DFA01410]; King Abdullah University of Science and Technology","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); International Science and Technology Cooperation Program of China from Ministry of Science and Technology, China; King Abdullah University of Science and Technology(King Abdullah University of Science & Technology)","The authors thank Dr. Li Hongjun, Dr. Shao Kuishuang, and Li Dongmei at the National Marine Environment Monitoring Centre, SOA, for valuable information and discussion regarding monitoring programs conducted, by their agencies, and Xu Caicai at Zhejiang University for her assistance in drawing Figures 3, and 4.

Currently, performance -based urban and building design relies on a time-consuming numerical simulation process, hindering perfor-mance optimization early in the design process. This paper proposes an automated design process that applies generative adversarial network (GAN) as a surrogate model to accelerate environmental performance-driven urban design. Parameterized urban blocks are designed for random sampling and constructing a numerical simulation database. The GAN model was trained to predict pedestrian level wind (PLW), annual cumulative solar radiation (Radiation) and Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) in real-time. The GAN-based surrogate model is combined with a multi-objective genetic algorithm to achieve real-time optimization of urban morphology. The results show that on the test set, the pix2pix model using a specific encoding method predicts the R2 of 0.70, 0.86 and 0.80 for PLW, Radiation and UTCI, respectively, while the method can speed up 120-240 times compared to the numerical simulation method. The optimization results show that NSGA-II combined with global averaging pooling achieves the best optimization results. When the number of optimized samples exceeds 174, the proposed method has a time advantage over traditional methods for outdoor environment optimization in urban design.","[Huang, Chenyu] North China Univ Technol, Sch Architecture & Art, Beijing 100144, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Gengjia] Tamkang Univ, Dept Architecture, Taipei City 25137, Taiwan; [Yao, Jiawei; An, Na] Tongji Univ, Coll Architecture & Urban Planning, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China; [Yao, Jiawei] Tongji Univ, Key Lab Ecol & Energy Saving Study Dense Habitat, Minist Educ, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xiaoxin] Wuhan City Coll, Fac Urban Architecture, Wuhan 430075, Peoples R China; [Calautit, John Kaiser] Univ Nottingham, Dept Architecture & Built Environm, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Zhao, Cairong] Tongji Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Technol, Shanghai 201804, Peoples R China; [Peng, Xi] Univ Stuttgart, Fac Architecture & Urban Planning, Keplerstr 11, D-70174 Stuttgart, Germany",North China University of Technology; Tamkang University; Tongji University; Tongji University; University of Nottingham; Tongji University; University of Stuttgart,"Yao, JW (corresponding author), Tongji Univ, Coll Architecture & Urban Planning, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China.;Yao, JW (corresponding author), Tongji Univ, Key Lab Ecol & Energy Saving Study Dense Habitat, Minist Educ, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China.",jiawei.yao@tongji.edu.cn,"YAO, JIAWEI/AAA-1344-2020","YAO, JIAWEI/0000-0001-7321-3128; AN, Na/0000-0001-6537-3973; Huang, Chenyu/0000-0002-6360-638X",National Natural Science Foundation of China; Shanghai Municipal Science and Technology Major Project;  [51908410];  [2021SHZDZX0100],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Shanghai Municipal Science and Technology Major Project; ; ,"Acknowledgements This research was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant NO. 51908410; the Shanghai Municipal Science and Technology Major Project under Grant NO. 2021SHZDZX0100 Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Uni- versities.

In that respect, in the recent years we have applied advanced atomistic simulation methods to investigate various properties of these materials on the atomic scale. In particular, we computed several structural, thermochemical, thermodynamic and radiation damage related parameters. From a theoretical point of view, these materials turn out to be excellent systems for testing quantum mechanics-based computational methods for strongly correlated electronic systems. On the other hand, by conducting joint atomistic modeling and experimental research, we have been able to obtain enhanced understanding of the properties of lanthanide phosphates. Here we discuss joint initiatives directed at understanding the thermodynamically driven long-term performance of these materials, including long-term stability of solid solutions with actinides and studies of structural incorporation of f elements into these materials. In particular, we discuss the maximum load of Pu into the lanthanide-phosphate monazites.

For absorbing aerosols (here soot and biomass burning aerosol with single-scattering albedos of about 0.2 and 0.74 at 550 nm), LOPES was combined with a TSI 3563 nephelometer to determine the wavelength-dependent absorption coefficients from the difference of the extinction and scattering coefficients. These absorption coefficients were found to agree with the measurements by two state-of-the-art absorption techniques, the multiangle absorption photometry ( MAAP) and photoacoustic spectrometry (PAS), which measure the absorption coefficient at the single wavelength of 532 nm and 670 nm, respectively.

Chenopodium quinoa Willd. was cultivated by pre-Hispanic cultures, but it disappeared in this region since the Spanish conquest. Two quinoa landraces (Don Javi and Palmilla) were re-introduced from lowlands of central Chile (34 degrees S) evaluating seed saponin content and grain yields under low irrigation. Replicated assays were conducted in two sites with distinct microclimates after august (end of the rains in 2004 and 2005). Treatments included low (40-75 mm) and high (150-250 mm) irrigation and were distributed along the five cultivation months. Fertilization, with the humus of the worms, was carried out in the second season, as soils are poor in organic matter. Results showed significantly higher saponin content in the seeds of Don Javi landrace (1.2 %) with respect to Palmilla seeds (0.3 %). However, grain yields were not different between landraces under the same treatments. Yields were instead affected by microclimate, irrigation and fertilization. Although higher yields corresponded with higher irrigation, 2.6 tons ha(-1) was obtained under high irrigation, but surprisingly, also under low irrigation in the more humid site. Yields of 2006 harvesting season (ca. 7 tons ha(-1)) were higher than that of the previous season (ca. 5.5 tons ha(-1)), mainly because of the addition of organic matter. We suggest that re-introduction of Quinoa in arid Chile is feasible even under the prevailing conditions of low rainfall and deficient soils, but better yields will need some irrigation and addition of organic matter.","[Martinez, E.

The existing buildings needs to be retrofitted and heated by renewable energy sources. However, this may lead to conflicts with other sustainability goals, such as the preservation of cultural heritage values within the built environment. The design of the legal system can be assumed to have a decisive role in well-developed Rechtsstaats in how these conflicts are handled. One important criterion for the achievement of overall sustainability objectives is that the legal system as a whole is coherent and without deficits, loopholes, and conflicts contradicting goal fulfilment. Moreover, the norms must be effectively applied and complied with. This article presents and elaborates on deficits in the legal system and its application, in particular within the land use planning and building legislation and the heritage protection law, in handling the conflicts between reaching energy goals while preserving heritage values and achieving a sustainable development. The important deficits identified include the lack of legal requirements on the adoption of holistic approaches and the assurance of adequate knowledge in the planning and building processes.

The properties of the material itself have been investigated in detail. However, the evaluation of LNC97 air electrodes in practical SOCs is still at a very early stage. In the present study, SOCs were prepared based on LNC97 air electrodes. The I-U performance of the SOCs in both solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) and solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) modes, i.e. reversible SOCs (r-SOCs), was investigated systematically for different air-electrode designs, temperatures and fuel gases. In general, the performance of the r-SOCs tested in the present study is higher than the published results of other LaFeO3-LaCoO3-LaNiO3-based SOCs and is comparable to or even better than state-of-the-art La1-xSrxFe1-yCoyO3 (LSCF)-based SOCs. Mid-term operation of about 1000 h for SOCs in both SOFC and SOEC modes primarily proved the stability of LNC97-based air electrodes. Impedance spectra were systematically applied to understand the polarization processes of the SOCs. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

This new style was, in his vision, destined to replace the project of architectural (and urban) Modernism, including further transitory stages (Deconstructivism/Post-Modernism). However, despite such bold claims, neither practice nor theoretical premises of Parametricism provide any reasons to consider this form of computer aided design as the manifestation of a new and great architectural style. In analysing the theoretical framework of this architectural phenomenon, the author suggests that despite obvious stylistic innovations made possible through various computer-aided design technologies, Parametricism remains just one more ideology closely connected to those previous architectural trends that came into being following the gradual demise of Modernism. The very fact that a theory has been constructed to present Parametricism as a seemingly novel architectural discourse and practice, as it continues to pursue a neo-liberal agenda that is influential not because of the soundness of its foundation, but because contemporary cultural climate is held under the spell of post-Modernist dogmatism illustrates the premise of this paper. Parametricism's geometry and morphology have very little meaning or purpose behind its technological promiscuity. Thus, Parametricism is nothing more than ideology disguised as aesthetic theory to serve purposes other than sustainability, equity or making the built environment more humane. As a discourse and practice, it is an avatarof globalization contributing to the homogenization of urban environments.","[Samalavicius, Almantas] Vilnius Gediminas Tecn Univ, Dept Architectural Fundamentals Theory & Art, 1 Traku St, LT-01132 Vilnius, Lithuania",,"Samalavicius, A (corresponding author), Vilnius Gediminas Tecn Univ, Dept Architectural Fundamentals Theory & Art, 1 Traku St, LT-01132 Vilnius, Lithuania.",almantsam@yahoo.com,,"Samalavicius, Almantas/0000-0001-8753-407X",,,,,16,0,0,1,1,SYMMETRION,BUDAPEST,"29 ETVS ST, BUDAPEST, 1067, HUNGARY",0865-4824,2226-1877,,SYMMETRY-BUDAPEST,Symmetry,,2020,3,,,,353,364,,10.26830/symmetry_2020_3_353,http://dx.doi.org/10.26830/symmetry_2020_3_353,,,12,"Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Mathematics,PZ1VD,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000612526800007,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this perspective, power intermingles with mobility itself and mobility's situated meanings as these are pushed by experiences and representations of movement, mobile urban lives, and mobile subjects, rather than being inherently linked to automobility. Bike mobility is presented as a form of transport which in a Scandinavian urban context fulfills norms of automobility such as freedom, speed, the frictionless, flexibility, cosmopolitanism, diversity, and individualism, and additionally is adhering to postmodern markers such as identity, authenticity, environment/climate concerns, health, fragmentation, and community.

In all cases, EO products are calibrated against soil samples collected from bare soil locations. Results indicate a moderate correlation of observed ECe values with the investigated remote sensing parameters. Regarding sensitivity to saline soil, the yellow band displays higher values. Comparison between methods used in the literature shows that those developed specifically for soil salinity, and especially index S5, perform better.

The main advantage of the spectral model is its treatment of turbulent kinetic energy spectra as the sum of buoyancy and a shear produced part, modelling each one separately. The formulation represents both shear and buoyant turbulent mechanisms characterizing the various regimes of the Planetary Boundary Layer, and gives continuous values at any elevation and all stability conditions from unstable to stable. As a consequence, both the wind variance and the Lagrangian integral time scales in the dispersion parameters are more general than those found in literature, because they are not derived from diffusion experiments as most parameterizations. Furthermore, they provide a formulation continuous for the whole boundary layer resulting more physically consistent. The alpha(y), alpha(z) parameters, included in a Gaussian model have been tested and compared with a dispersion scheme reported in the literature, using experimental data in different emission conditions (low and tall stacks) and in several meteorological conditions ranging from stable to convective. Results show that the dispersion model with the sigmas parameterisation included, produces a good fitting of the measured ground-level concentration data in all the experimental conditions considered, performing slightly better than other state-of-art models.","CNR, ISAC, Inst Atmospher Sci & Climate, I-73100 Lecce, Italy; Univ Fed Santa Maria, Dept Fis, BR-97119900 Santa Maria, RS, Brazil",Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Scienze dell'Atmosfera e del Clima (ISAC-CNR); Universidade Federal de Santa Maria (UFSM),"Mangia, C (corresponding author), CNR, ISAC, Inst Atmospher Sci & Climate, I-73100 Lecce, Italy.",u.rizza@isac.cnr.it,"mangia, cristina/B-3468-2012; Degrazia, Gervásio A/F-4445-2014; Tirabassi, Tiziano/AAE-8681-2020; Rizza, Umberto/AAD-9996-2022; Tirabassi, Tiziano/G-7815-2015","Rizza, Umberto/0000-0002-7633-3878; Degrazia, Gervasio Annes/0000-0002-4304-1748; Tirabassi, Tiziano/0000-0003-0266-599X",,,,,38,1,1,0,0,SOC ITALIANA FISICA,BOLOGNA,"VIA SARAGOZZA, 12, I-40123 BOLOGNA, ITALY",1124-1896,,,NUOVO CIMENTO C,Nuovo Cimento Soc.

For the present day, global TP emissions are calculated to be roughly 1.33 Tg-P yr(-1), with the mineral sources contributing more than 80% to these emissions. The P solubilization from mineral dust under acidic atmospheric conditions is also parameterized in the model and is calculated to contribute about one-third (0.14 Tg-P yr(-1) /of the global DP atmospheric source. To our knowledge, a unique aspect of our global study is the explicit modeling of the evolution of phosphorus speciation in the atmosphere. The simulated present-day global annual DP deposition flux is 0.45 Tg-P yr(-1) (about 40% over oceans), showing a strong spatial and temporal variability. Present-day simulations of atmospheric P aerosol concentrations and deposition fluxes are satisfactory compared with available observations, indicating however an underestimate of about 70% on current knowledge of the sources that drive the P atmospheric cycle. Sensitivity simulations using preindustrial (year 1850) anthropogenic and biomass burning emission scenarios showed a present-day increase of 75% in the P solubilization flux from mineral dust, i.e., the rate at which P is converted into soluble forms, compared to preindustrial times, due to increasing atmospheric acidity over the last 150 years. Future reductions in air pollutants due to the implementation of air-quality regulations are expected to decrease the P solubilization flux from mineral dust by about 30% in the year 2100 compared to the present day. Considering, however, that all the P contained in bioaerosols is readily available for uptake by marine organisms, and also accounting for all other DP sources, a total bioavailable P flux of about 0.17 Tg-P yr(-1) to the oceans is derived. Our calculations further show that in some regions more than half of the bioavailable P deposition flux to the ocean can originate from biological particles, while this contribution is found to maximize in summer when atmospheric deposition impact on the marine ecosystem is the highest due to ocean stratification. Thus, according to this global study, a largely unknown but potentially important role of terrestrial bioaerosols as suppliers of bioavailable P to the global ocean is also revealed. Overall, this work provides new insights to the atmospheric P cycle by demonstrating that biological materials are important carriers of bioavailable P, with very important implications for past and future responses of marine ecosystems to global change.","[Myriokefalitakis, Stelios; Mihalopoulos, Nikolaos; Kanakidou, Maria] Univ Crete, Dept Chem, Environm Chem Proc Lab, POB 2208, Iraklion 70013, Greece; [Nenes, Athanasios] FORTH, Inst Chem Engn Sci ICE HT, POB 1414, Patras 26504, Greece; [Nenes, Athanasios] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Earth & Atmospher Sci, 311 Ferst Dr, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Nenes, Athanasios] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Chem & Biomol Engn, 311 Ferst Dr, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Nenes, Athanasios; Mihalopoulos, Nikolaos] Natl Observ Athens, Inst Environm Res & Sustainable Dev, Athens, Greece; [Baker, Alex R.] Univ East Anglia, Ctr Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Sch Environm Sci, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England",University of Crete; Foundation for Research & Technology - Hellas (FORTH); Institute of Chemical Engineering Sciences (ICE-HT); University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology; University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology; National Observatory of Athens; University of East Anglia,"Myriokefalitakis, S; Kanakidou, M (corresponding author), Univ Crete, Dept Chem, Environm Chem Proc Lab, POB 2208, Iraklion 70013, Greece.",stelios@uoc.gr; mariak@chemistry.uoc.gr,"Myriokefalitakis, Stelios/J-3701-2014; Mihalopoulos, Nikolaos/ABF-2255-2020; Nenes, Athanasios/ABE-6478-2020; Baker, Alex R/D-1233-2011; Kanakidou, Maria/D-7882-2012","Myriokefalitakis, Stelios/0000-0002-1541-7680; Nenes, Athanasios/0000-0003-3873-9970; Baker, Alex R/0000-0002-8365-8953; Kanakidou, Maria/0000-0002-1724-9692",European Union (European Social Fund - ESF); Greek national funds through the Operational Program Education and Lifelong Learning of the NSRF - Research Funding Program: ARISTEIA - PANOPLY grant; European FP7 collaborative project BACCHUS (Impact of Biogenic versus Anthropogenic emissions on Clouds and Climate: towards a Holistic UnderStanding),European Union (European Social Fund - ESF)(European Social Fund (ESF)European Commission); Greek national funds through the Operational Program Education and Lifelong Learning of the NSRF - Research Funding Program: ARISTEIA - PANOPLY grant; European FP7 collaborative project BACCHUS (Impact of Biogenic versus Anthropogenic emissions on Clouds and Climate: towards a Holistic UnderStanding),"This research has been co-financed by the European Union (European Social Fund - ESF) and Greek national funds through the Operational Program Education and Lifelong Learning of the National Strategic Reference Framework (NSRF) - Research Funding Program: ARISTEIA - PANOPLY (Pollution Alters Natural Aerosol Composition: implications for Ocean Productivity, cLimate and air qualitY) grant.

To prevent non-target pest outbreaks and to retain the biological control function provided by predators and parasitoids, the potential risk that Bt crops may pose to non-target arthropods is addressed prior to their commercialization. Aphids play an important role in agricultural systems since they serve as prey or host to a number of predators and parasitoids and their honeydew is an important energy source for several arthropods. To explore possible indirect effects of Bt crops we here examined the impact of Bt cotton on aphids and their honeydew. In climate chambers we assessed the performance of cotton aphids, Aphis gossypii Glover (Hemiptera: Aphididae) when grown on three Indian Bt (Cry1Ac) cotton varieties (MECH 12, MECH 162, MECH 184) and their non-transformed near isolines. Furthermore, we examined whether aphids pick up the Bt protein and analyzed the sugar composition of aphid honeydew to evaluate its suitability for honeydew-feeders. Plant transformation did not have any influence on aphid performance. However, some variation was observed among the three cotton varieties which might partly be explained by the variation in trichome density. None of the aphid samples contained Bt protein. As a consequence, natural enemies that feed on aphids are not exposed to the Cry protein. A significant difference in the sugar composition of aphid honeydew was detected among cotton varieties as well as between transformed and non-transformed plants. However, it is questionable if this variation is of ecological relevance, especially as honeydew is not the only sugar source parasitoids feed on in cotton fields. Our study allows the conclusion that Bt cotton poses a negligible risk for aphid antagonists and that aphids should remain under natural control in Bt cotton fields.","[Lawo, Nora C.; Romeis, Jorg] Agroscope Reckenholz Tanikon Res Stn ART Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland; [Wackers, Felix L.] Univ Lancaster, Lancaster LA1 4YW, England",Swiss Federal Research Station Agroscope; Lancaster University,"Lawo, NC (corresponding author), Agroscope Reckenholz Tanikon Res Stn ART Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.",joerg.romeis@art.admin.ch,"Romeis, Joerg/J-5360-2013","Romeis, Joerg/0000-0003-3652-8360","Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) in Berne, Switzerland; Department of Biotechnology (DBT) in Delhi, India","Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) in Berne, Switzerland; Department of Biotechnology (DBT) in Delhi, India(Department of Biotechnology (DBT) India)","The study was compiled within the Pulse Network of the Indo-Swiss Collaboration in Biotechnology (ISCB).

They are essential to understand and predict ecosystem dynamics and provision of ecosystem services. Paradoxically, utilization of food web knowledge in marine environmental conservation and resource management is limited. To better understand the use of knowledge and barriers to incorporation in management, we assess its application related to the management of eutrophication, chemical contamination, fish stocks, and non-indigenous species. We focus on the Baltic, a severely impacted, but also intensely studied and actively managed semi-enclosed sea. Our assessment shows food web processes playing a central role in all four areas, but application varies strongly, from formalized integration in management decisions, to support in selecting indicators and setting threshold values, to informal knowledge explaining ecosystem dynamics and management performance. Barriers for integration are complexity of involved ecological processes and that management frameworks are not designed to handle such information. We provide a categorization of the multi-faceted uses of food web knowledge and benefits of future incorporation in management, especially moving towards ecosystem-based approaches as guiding principle in present marine policies and directives. We close with perspectives on research needs to support this move considering global and regional change.","[Eero, Margit; MacKenzie, Brian R.; Ojaveer, Henn; Koster, Friedrich Wilhelm] Tech Univ Denmark, Natl Inst Aquat Resources, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark; [Dierking, Jan] GEOMAR Helmholtz Ctr Ocean Res Kiel, Marine Evolutionary Ecol, DE-24105 Kiel, Germany; [Humborg, Christoph; Undeman, Emma] Stockholm Univ, Baltic Sea Ctr, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Ojaveer, Henn] Univ Tartu, Parnu Coll, EE-80012 Parnu, Estonia; [Salo, Tiina] Abo Akad Univ, Environm & Marine Biol, FI-20520 Turku, Finland",Technical University of Denmark; Helmholtz Association; GEOMAR Helmholtz Center for Ocean Research Kiel; Stockholm University; University of Tartu; Abo Akademi University,"Koster, FW (corresponding author), Tech Univ Denmark, Natl Inst Aquat Resources, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark.",fwk@aqua.dtu.dk,"MacKenzie, Brian R./T-9379-2019; Humborg, Christoph/C-4756-2015; Ojaveer, Henn/K-2160-2016","MacKenzie, Brian R./0000-0002-4798-0363; Eero, Margit/0000-0002-1848-0597; Humborg, Christoph/0000-0002-0649-5599; Koster, Friedrich Wilhelm/0000-0001-9953-6814; Ojaveer, Henn/0000-0003-2742-6063; Salo, Tiina/0000-0002-5409-2612; Dierking, Jan/0000-0002-4660-6919",BONUS (Art 185) - EU; BONUS (Art 185) - German Federal Ministry of Education and Research; Academy of Finland; Estonian Research Council; Innovation Fund Denmark,BONUS (Art 185) - EU; BONUS (Art 185) - German Federal Ministry of Education and Research; Academy of Finland(Academy of Finland); Estonian Research Council(Estonian Research Council); Innovation Fund Denmark,"This work was part of the BONUS XWEBS project, supported by BONUS (Art 185), funded jointly by the EU and the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research, the Academy of Finland, and the Estonian Research Council.

There is a change in the average VC values of fauna in the Holocene, and there is also a significant reduction in delta(15)N values of herbivore bone collagen towards the end of the last glaciation, with a subsequent recovery soon after the start of the Holocene. This change is observed for several species and is restricted to those regions most affected by the glacial advance. Comparison with ice core data shows that there is a strong correlation between the average delta(13)C values of three herbivore species and ice core CO2 concentration.

Fuel cells, based on solid oxide technology, convert hydrogen or hydrogen-rich fuels into electrical energy, with potential applications in stationary power generation. Conversely, solid oxide electrolysers convert electricity into chemical energy, thereby offering the potential to store energy from transient resources, such as wind turbines and other renewable technologies. For solid oxide cells to displace conventional energy conversion devices in the marketplace, reliability must be improved, product lifecycles extended, and unit costs reduced. Mathematical models can provide qualitative and quantitative insight into physical phenomena and performance, over a range of length and time scales. The purpose of this paper is to provide the reader with a summary of the state-of-the art of solid oxide cell models. These range from: simple methods based on lumped parameters with little or no kinetics to detailed, time-dependent, three-dimensional solutions for electric field potentials, complex chemical kinetics and fully-comprehensive equations of motion based on effective transport properties. Many mathematical models have, in the past, been based on inaccurate property values obtained from the literature, as well as over-simplistic schemes to compute effective values. It is important to be aware of the underlying experimental methods available to parameterise mathematical models, as well as validate results. In this article, state-of-the-art techniques for measuring kinetic, electric and transport properties are also described. Methods such as electrochemical impedance spectroscopy allow for fundamental physicochemical parameters to be obtained. In addition, effective properties may be obtained using micro-scale computer simulations based on digital reconstruction obtained from X-ray tomography/focussed ion beam scanning electron microscopy, as well as percolation theory. The cornerstone of model validation, namely the polarisation or current-voltage diagram, provides necessary, but insufficient information to substantiate the reliability of detailed model calculations. The results of physical experiments which precisely mimic the details of model conditions are scarce, and it is fair to say there is a gap between the two activities. The purpose of this review is to introduce the reader to the current state-of-the art of solid oxide analysis techniques, in a tutorial fashion, not only numerical and but also experimental, and to emphasise the cross-linkages between techniques.

Blue carbon habitats and pathways can also facilitate biodiversity retention, aiding sustainable fisheries and island economies. However, robust blue carbon research is often limited at the scale of regional governance and management, lacking both incentives and facilitation of policy-integration. The remote and highly biodiverse coastal ecosystems and surrounding continental shelf can be used to better inform long-term ecosystem-based management in the vast South Atlantic Ocean and sub-Antarctic, to synergistically protect both unique biodiversity and inform on the magnitude of nature-based benefits they provide. Understanding key ecosystem information such as their location, extent, and condition of habitat types, will be critical in understanding carbon pathways to sequestration, threats to this, and vulnerability. This paper considers the current status of blue carbon data and information available, and what is still required before blue carbon can be used as a conservation management tool integrated in national Marine Spatial Planning (MSP) initiatives. Our research indicates that the data and information gathered has enabled baselines for a number of different blue carbon ecosystems, and indicated potential threats and vulnerability that need to be managed. However, significant knowledge gaps remain across habitats, such as salt marsh, mudflats and the mesophotic zones, which hinders meaningful progress on the ground where it is needed most.","[Bax, Narissa] Univ Tasmania, Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, Ctr Marine Socioecol, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Bax, Narissa; Pearman, Tabitha; Carter, Stefanie; Brickle, Paul; Baylis, Alastair M.

In this study, the performance of nine operational global ensemble prediction systems (EPSs) is analyzed relative to climatology-based forecasts for 1-5-day accumulated precipitation based on the monsoon seasons during 2007-14 for three regions within northern tropical Africa. To assess the full potential of raw ensemble forecasts across spatial scales, state-of-the-art statistical post-processing methods were applied in the form of Bayesian model averaging (BMA) and ensemble model output statistics (EMOS), and results were verified against station and spatially aggregated, satellite-based gridded observations. Raw ensemble forecasts are uncalibrated and unreliable, and often underperform relative to climatology, independently of region, accumulation time, monsoon season, and ensemble. The differences between raw ensemble and climatological forecasts are large and partly stem from poor prediction for low precipitation amounts. BMA and EMOS postprocessed forecasts are calibrated, reliable, and strongly improve on the raw ensembles but, somewhat disappointingly, typically do not outperform climatology. Most EPSs exhibit slight improvements over the period 2007-14, but overall they have little added value compared to climatology. The suspicion is that parameterization of convection is a potential cause for the sobering lack of ensemble forecast skill in a region dominated by mesoscale convective systems.","[Vogel, Peter; Knippertz, Peter; Fink, Andreas H.; Schlueter, Andreas] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Karlsruhe, Germany; [Vogel, Peter; Gneiting, Tilmann] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Stochast, Karlsruhe, Germany; [Gneiting, Tilmann] Heidelberg Inst Theoret Studies, Heidelberg, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; Heidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies,"Vogel, P (corresponding author), Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Karlsruhe, Germany.;Vogel, P (corresponding author), Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Stochast, Karlsruhe, Germany.",p.vogel@kit.edu,"Fink, Andreas H./F-3024-2017; Knippertz, Peter/D-5861-2016; Gneiting, Tilmann/A-8773-2009","Fink, Andreas H./0000-0002-5840-2120; Knippertz, Peter/0000-0001-9856-619X; Gneiting, Tilmann/0000-0001-9397-3271; Schlueter, Andreas/0000-0002-5398-8150",German Science Foundation (DFG) [SFB/TRR 165]; Klaus Tschira Foundation,German Science Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Klaus Tschira Foundation,"The research leading to these results has been accomplished within project C2 Prediction of wet and dry periods of the West African Monsoon'' of the Transregional Collaborative Research Center SFB/TRR 165 Waves to Weather'' funded by the German Science Foundation (DFG).

It is well known that pedogenic carbonate is less soluble than evaporate salts and commonly forms in natural drylands. However, few studies have evaluated how irrigation loads dissolved calcium and bicarbonate to agricultural fields, accelerating formation rates of secondary calcite and simultaneously releasing abiotic CO2 to the atmosphere. This study reports one of the first geochemical and isotopic studies of such anthropogenic pedogenic carbonates and CO2 from irrigated drylands of southwestern United States. A pecan orchard and an alfalfa field, where flood-irrigation using the Rio Grande river is a common practice, were compared to a nearby natural dryland site. Strontium and carbon isotope ratios show that bulk pedogenic carbonates in irrigated soils at the pecan orchard primarily formed due to flood-irrigation, and that approximately 20-50% of soil CO2 in these irrigated soils is calcite-derived abiotic CO2 instead of soil-respired or atmospheric origins. Multiple variables that control the salt buildup in this region are identified and impact the crop production and soil sustainability regionally and globally. Irrigation intensity and water chemistry (irrigation water quantity and quality) dictate salt loading, and soil texture governs water infiltration and salt leaching. In the study area, agricultural soils have accumulated up to 10 wt% of calcite after just about 100 years of cultivation. These rates will likely increase in the future due to the combined effects of climate variability (reduced rainfall and more intense evaporation), use of more brackish groundwater for irrigation, and reduced porosity in soils. The enhanced accumulation rates of pedogenic carbonate are accompanied by release of large amounts of abiotic CO2 from irrigated drylands to atmosphere. Extensive field studies and modelling approaches are needed to further quantify these effluxes at local, regional and global scales.","[Ortiz, Anna C.; Jin, Lixin; Ma, Lin] Univ Texas El Paso, Dept Geol Sci, 500 W Univ Ave, El Paso, TX 79968 USA; [Ogrinc, Nives; Krajnc, Bor] Jozef Stefan Inst, Dept Environm Sci, Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Kaye, Jason] Penn State Univ, Dept Ecosyst Sci & Management, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas El Paso; Slovenian Academy of Sciences & Arts (SASA); Jozef Stefan Institute; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park,"Jin, LX (corresponding author), Univ Texas El Paso, Dept Geol Sci, 500 W Univ Ave, El Paso, TX 79968 USA.",ljin2@utep.edu,"Ortiz, Anna Cristina/AAE-1672-2022","Ortiz, Anna/0000-0002-7516-9498","National Science Foundation [1853680]; Slovenian Research Agency (ARRS) [P1-0143, J1-1716]",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Slovenian Research Agency (ARRS)(Slovenian Research Agency - Slovenia),"Financial support for this study is from the National Science Foundation under award #1853680.

Among multiple retrieval techniques, hybrid approaches have been found to provide outstanding accuracy, for instance, for the inference of leaf area index (LAI), fractional vegetation cover (fCover), and leaf and canopy chlorophyll content (LCC and CCC). The combination of radiative transfer models (RTMs) and data-driven models creates an advantage in the use of hybrid methods. Through this review paper, we aim to provide state-of-the-art hybrid retrieval schemes and theoretical frameworks. To achieve this, we reviewed and systematically analyzed publications over the past 22 years. We identified two hybrid-based parametric and hybrid-based nonparametric regression models and evaluated their performance for each variable of interest. From the results of our extensive literature survey, most research directions are now moving towards combining RTM and machine learning (ML) methods in a symbiotic manner. In particular, the development of ML will open up new ways to integrate innovative approaches such as integrating shallow or deep neural networks with RTM using remote sensing data to reduce errors in crop trait estimations and improve control of crop growth conditions in very large areas serving precision agriculture applications.","[Abdelbaki, Asmaa; Udelhoven, Thomas] Trier Univ, Earth Observat & Climate Proc, D-54286 Trier, Germany; [Abdelbaki, Asmaa] Fayoum Univ, Fac Agr, Soils & Water Sci Dept, Al Fayyum 63514, Egypt",Universitat Trier; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Fayoum University,"Abdelbaki, A (corresponding author), Trier Univ, Earth Observat & Climate Proc, D-54286 Trier, Germany.;Abdelbaki, A (corresponding author), Fayoum Univ, Fac Agr, Soils & Water Sci Dept, Al Fayyum 63514, Egypt.",ama09@fayoum.edu.eg; udelhove@uni-trier.de,,"Abdelbaki, Asmaa/0000-0002-3448-0415",,,,,245,1,1,30,30,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2072-4292,,REMOTE SENS-BASEL,Remote Sens.,AUG,2022,15,,,,,,3515,10.3390/rs14153515,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs14153515,,,39,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,3S6CM,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000839682500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Cyanobacteria, major constituents of HABs, can cause ecological, economic, and human health problems, configuring a dark side requiring management attention. Their growth can be potentiated by climate change consequences, highlighting further the urgency of improving HABs management strategies to ensure water quality. An innovative perspective for cyanobacteria management is the exploitation of their bright side. Several exploitable products produced by cyanobacteria (e.g., bioactive pigments, lipids, proteins) present high market value. Thus, this work provides a critical perspective on how HABs management may be connected with biotechnology in the future. We propose the use of the biomass of cyanobacteria blooms physically removed in traditional control actions (much needed to ensure environmental and even human health safety) as a feedstock for future valorization, thus allying profit to water quality management, in a win-win relationship between economics and environmental sustainability. Such a proposal was validated with an economic analysis, which evidenced a relevant potential for a positive return (hence rendering profit likely to occur), both considering only the delivery of harvested biomass to production units and the full valuation route from harvesting to the selling of the extracted/purified product using phycocyanin as a model.","[Macario, Ines P.

These findings hold roughly also for passenger cars whose energy consumption tends to increase 0.6 +/- 0.1 kWh/100 km with each 100 kg of vehicle mass. Battery capacity and vehicle mass are closely related. A 10 kWh increase in battery capacity increases the mass of electric cars by 15 kg, their drive range by 40-50 km, and their energy consumption by 0.7-1.0 kWh/100 km. Mass-produced state-of-the-art electric passenger cars are 2.1 +/- 0.8 kWh/100 km more efficient than first-generation vehicles, produced at small scale. Conclusion Efficiency trade-offs in electric vehicles differ from those in conventional cars-the latter showing a strong dependency of fuel consumption on rated engine power. Mass-related efficiency trade-offs in electric vehicles are large and could be tapped by stimulating mode shift from passenger cars to light electric road vehicles. Electric passenger cars still offer potentials for further efficiency improvements. These could be exploited through a dedicated energy label with battery capacity as utility parameter.","[Weiss, Martin; Cloos, Kira Christina; Helmers, Eckard] Univ Appl Sci Trier, Environm Planning & Technol Dept, Environm Campus Birkenfeld,POB 1380, D-55761 Birkenfeld, Germany",,"Weiss, M; Helmers, E (corresponding author), Univ Appl Sci Trier, Environm Planning & Technol Dept, Environm Campus Birkenfeld,POB 1380, D-55761 Birkenfeld, Germany.",weisstn@mailbox.org; e.helmers@umwelt-campus.de,,,,,,,53,37,37,3,28,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",2190-4707,2190-4715,,ENVIRON SCI EUR,Environ.

The plants in the Persian gardens have always been native and in full harmony with their context and climate. This has contributed to the stability and continuity of Iranian gardens over time and across geographical regions and has created a sense of belonging to them. Much of the usefulness and stability of Iranian gardens can be attributed to these native plants that have therapeutic, healing, and semantic functions. These plants have a special place in Iranian culture. Unfortunately, today, inadequate knowledge of native plants that are compatible with the conditions of Iran has made these species extinct. Iranian parks and urban landscapes have been filled with foreign and non-original plants that are inconsistent with the climatic and cultural contexts of Iranian regions. Due to rapid and unpleasant changes in the present era, the native plants have been forgotten. The purpose of this study seeks to introduce and identify the characteristics of the musk rose, one of the original and native flowers planted in Iranian gardens and houses. The concern is that this flower has been overlooked for many years and no longer can be seen in parks and green spaces. Even knowledge of this flower is scanty. Information about this flower is limited to some travelogues. However, not much is available on the features of this flower, and only its name has been mentioned as one of the native flowers of Iran. The required data for this study were gathered through a bibliographical method, field studies, and interviews with residents of the cities and villages of Yazd and Kerman, and the head of botanical garden research. The results of these studies show the physical, semantic, and functional characteristics of this flower and confirm that this flower design has been used in some decorations. During the field research, data about this flower was found in the central regions of Iran.","[Shokouh, Sara] Persian Gulf Univ, Sch Art & Architecture, Bushehr, Iran; [Javadi, Shohreh] Univ Tehran, Adv Studies Art, Tehran, Iran; [Dehghan, Farzaneh Sadat] Tech & Vocat Univ, Yazd, Iran; [Hosseinzadeh, Zia] Univ Tehran, Fac Fine Arts, Dept Architecture, Landscape Architecture, Tehran, Iran; [Forghani, Keyvan] Azad Islamic Univ Yazd, Fac Art & Architecture, Yazd, Iran",Persian Gulf University; University of Tehran; University of Tehran,"Shokouh, S (corresponding author), Persian Gulf Univ, Sch Art & Architecture, Bushehr, Iran.",shokouh.sara@ut.ac.ir,,,,,,,8,0,0,2,2,NAZAR RESEARCH CENTER ART ARCHITECTURE & URBANISM,TEHRAN,"NO 23, DR QARIB ST AZADI AVE, TEHRAN, 14198-43311, IRAN",2008-7446,2008-2169,,MANZAR,Manzar,SPR,2022,58,,,,28,35,,10.22034/MANZAR.2021.251505.2094,http://dx.doi.org/10.22034/MANZAR.2021.251505.2094,,,8,Architecture,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Architecture,0H1HZ,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000778491200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

A relatively less experienced/first time student forecaster (SF) skill, based upon the funnel approach to weather forecasting, is compared with the then state-of-the-art mesoscale operational numerical weather prediction (NWP) model outputs and the observations. Several measures of the forecast skills are employed to illustrate the intercomparison of the different aspects of performance of the game players for a conventional forecast game setup in an educational environment, after paying particular attention to the associated sampling uncertainty in the analysis of the forecast game. Bootstrap resampling based confidence intervals are computed and compared for the SF and NWP model forecasts and the observations to quantify the relative accuracies of the forecasts. The SF performed quite comparable to the NWP models, and better than the climatology and the persistence, for the next-day forecasts of temperature and precipitation, when the forecast skill scores of the game players were averaged over the period of the forecast game. These observations support the judgement that the contribution of human forecasters, even in the contemporary era of progressively improving and fully automated NWP model outputs, remained a crucial one.","[Athar, H.] King Abdulaziz Univ, Dept Meteorol, Ctr Excellence Climate Change Res, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia; [Sara, A.] Hai Ul Jamai, Shara Al Maajem, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia",King Abdulaziz University,"Athar, H (corresponding author), King Abdulaziz Univ, Dept Meteorol, Ctr Excellence Climate Change Res, POB 80208, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia.",ahussain1@kau.edu.sa,"Hussain, Athar/X-8239-2019; Hussain, Athar/J-2405-2012","Hussain, Athar/0000-0001-9816-2451",,,,,44,3,3,0,9,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1350-4827,1469-8080,,METEOROL APPL,Meteorol.

The interaction between an egg and its environment likely drives selection that will shape eggs across evolutionary time. For example, eggs incubated in hot, arid regions face acute exposure to harsh climatic conditions relative to those in temperate zones, and this exposure will differ across nest types, with eggs in open nests being more exposed to direct solar radiation than those in enclosed nests. We examined the idea that the geographical distribution of both egg shapes and nest types should reflect selective pressures of key environmental parameters, such as ambient temperature and the drying capacity of air. We took a comparative approach, using 310 passerine species from Australia, many of which are found in some of the most extreme climates on earth. We found that, across the continent, egg elongation decreases and the proportion of species with domed nests with roofs increases in hotter and drier areas with sparse plant canopies. Eggs are most spherical in open nests in the hottest environments, and most elongate in domed nests in wetter, shadier environments. Our findings suggest that climatic conditions played a key role in the evolution of passerine egg shape.","[Duursma, Daisy Englert; Gallagher, Rachael V.; Griffith, Simon C.] Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, N Ryde, NSW, Australia; [Price, J.

With the growing capacity of localized renewable energy sources surpassing the gigawatt range, a storage system of equal magnitude is required. PEM electrolysis provides a sustainable solution for the production of hydrogen, and is well suited to couple with energy sources such as wind and solar. However, due to low demand in electrolytic hydrogen in the last century, little research has been done on PEM electrolysis with many challenges still unexplored. The ever increasing desire for green energy has rekindled the interest on PEM electrolysis, thus the compilation and recovery of past research and developments is important and necessary. In this review, PEM water electrolysis is comprehensively highlighted and discussed. The challenges new and old related to electrocatalysts, solid electrolyte, current collectors, separator plates and modeling efforts will also be addressed. The main message is to clearly set the state-of-the-art for the PEM electrolysis technology, be insightful of the research that is already done and the challenges that still exist. This information will provide several future research directions and a road map in order to aid scientists in establishing PEM electrolysis as a commercially viable hydrogen production solution.

Abandonment of mountain grassland promotes accumulation of aboveground biomass and litter, but related responses of soil organic matter (SOM) dynamics are uncertain. To determine SOM-C turnover we sampled 0-10 cm of soils in the European Alps along two land-use gradients (hay meadows, grazed pastures and abandoned grasslands) of different management intensity. A first land-use gradient was located at Stubai Valley (MAT: 3 degrees C, MAP: 1097 mm) in Austria and a second at Matsch Valley (MAT: 6.6 degrees C, MAP: 527 mm) in Italy. We estimated C input and decomposition rates of water-floatable and free particulate organic matter (wPOM, fPOM <1.6 g cm(-3)) and aggregate-occluded particulate and mineral-associated organic matter (oPOM <1.6 g cm(-3), mOM >1.6 g cm(-3)) using bomb radiocarbon. In mountain grasslands average C turnover increased from roots (3 yr) < wPOM (5 yr) < fPOM (80 yr) < oPOM (108 yr) < mOM (192 yr). Among SOM fractions the turnover of fPOM-C varied most in relation to management. Along both land-use gradients C input pathways shifted from root-derived towards litter-derived C. The C input rates of both wPOM-C and fPOM-C were affected by land management at both sites. In contrast, oPOM-C and mOM-C dynamics remained relatively stable in response to grassland abandonment. Carbon accumulation rates of free POM decreased strongly with time since LUC (10, 25 and 36 yr). For wPOM-C, for example, it decreased from 7.4 > 2.2 > 0.8 g C m(-2) yr(-1). At both sites, most C was sequestered in the first years after LUC and free POM reached new steady state within 20-40 yr. We conclude that w-and fPOM-C vs. oPOM-C dynamics respond differently to grassland management change and thus POM does not represent a homogeneous SOM fraction. Sequestered C is stored in the labile POM and not stabilized in the long-term. Thus, it is unlikely that abandonment, the dominant form of LUC in the European Alps, provides a substantial net soil C sink.","[Meyer, S.; Leifeld, J.; Fuhrer, J.] Agroscope Res Stn Reckenholz Tanikon ART, Air Pollut Climate Grp, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland; [Bahn, M.] Univ Innsbruck, Inst Ecol, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria",Swiss Federal Research Station Agroscope; University of Innsbruck,"Leifeld, J (corresponding author), Agroscope Res Stn Reckenholz Tanikon ART, Air Pollut Climate Grp, Reckenholzstr 191, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland.",jens.leifeld@art.admin.ch,"Bahn, Michael/I-3536-2013; Leifeld, Jens/A-3298-2014; Leifeld, Jens/GYR-0349-2022","Bahn, Michael/0000-0001-7482-9776; Leifeld, Jens/0000-0002-7245-9852; Leifeld, Jens/0000-0002-7245-9852",Swiss Federal Office for Education and Science [C07.0031]; Federal Office of the Environment [09.0015.KP/I175-0721],Swiss Federal Office for Education and Science; Federal Office of the Environment,"This work was funded by the Swiss Federal Office for Education and Science (C07.0031) in the framework of COST Action 639, and by the Federal Office of the Environment (09.0015.KP/I175-0721).

S. Department of Energy's Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) program has led to significant improvements in longwave radiative transfer modeling over the last decade. These improvements, which have generally come in small incremental changes, were made primarily in the water vapor self- and foreign-broadened continuum and the water vapor absorption line parameters. These changes, when taken as a whole, result in up to a 6 W m(-2) improvement in the modeled clear-sky downwelling longwave radiative flux at the surface and significantly better agreement with spectral observations. This paper provides an overview of the history of ARM with regard to clear-sky longwave radiative transfer, and analyzes remaining related uncertainties in the ARM state-of-the-art Line-by-Line Radiative Transfer Model (LBLRTM). A quality measurement experiment (QME) for the downwelling infrared radiance at the ARM Southern Great Plains site has been ongoing since 1994. This experiment has three objectives: 1) to validate and improve the absorption models and spectral line parameters used in line-by-line radiative transfer models, 2) to assess the ability to define the atmospheric state, and 3) to assess the quality of the radiance observations that serve as ground truth for the model. Analysis of data from 1994 to 1997 made significant contributions to optimizing the QME, but is limited by small but significant uncertainties and deficiencies in the atmospheric state and radiance observations. This paper concentrates on the analysis of QME data from 1998 to 2001, wherein the data have been carefully selected to address the uncertainties in the 1994-97 dataset. Analysis of this newer dataset suggests that the representation of self- broadened water vapor continuum absorption is 3%-8% too strong in the 750-1000 cm(-1) region. The dataset also provides information on the accuracy of the self- and foreign-broadened continuum absorption in the 1100-1300 cm(-1) region. After accounting for these changes, remaining differences in modeled and observed downwelling clear-sky fluxes are less than 1.5 W m(-2) over a wide range of atmospheric states.","Pacific NW Natl Lab, Climate Phys Grp, Richland, WA 99352 USA; Univ Wisconsin, Cooperat Inst Meteorol Satellite Studies, Madison, WI USA; Florida State Univ, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; Atmospher & Environm Res Inc, Lexington, MA USA; NASA, Langley Res Ctr, Hampton, VA 23665 USA",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Pacific Northwest National Laboratory; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; State University System of Florida; Florida State University; Atmospheric & Environmental Research; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Langley Research Center,"Turner, DD (corresponding author), Pacific NW Natl Lab, Climate Phys Grp, MS K9-24,POB 999, Richland, WA 99352 USA.",dave.turner@pnl.gov,"Turner, David D/E-5180-2016","Turner, David D/0000-0003-1097-897X",,,,,67,92,93,0,5,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0022-4928,1520-0469,,J ATMOS SCI,J.

However, it is unclear to what extent reducing nutrients would also lower fish production and fisheries yields. Empirical examples of changes in nutrient loads and concurrent fish production can provide useful insights to this question. In this paper, we investigate to what extent a multi-fold increase in nutrient loads from the 1950s to 1980s enhanced forage fish production in the Baltic Sea. We use monitoring data on fish stock dynamics covering the period of the nutrient increase, combined with nutrient concentrations from a 3-dimensional coupled physical-biogeochemical ocean model. The results suggest that nutrient enrichment enhanced the biomass level of forage fish by up to 50 % in some years and areas due to increased body weight of fish. However, the trends in fish biomasses were generally decoupled from changes in nutrient concentrations.","[Eero, Margit; MacKenzie, Brian R.] Tech Univ Denmark, Natl Inst Aquat Resources, Jaegersborg Alle 1, DK-2920 Charlottenlund, Denmark; [Andersson, Helen C.; Almroth-Rosell, Elin] Swedish Meteorol & Hydrol Inst, S-60176 Norrkoping, Sweden",Technical University of Denmark; Swedish Meteorological & Hydrological Institute,"Eero, M (corresponding author), Tech Univ Denmark, Natl Inst Aquat Resources, Jaegersborg Alle 1, DK-2920 Charlottenlund, Denmark.",mee@aqua.dtu.dk; helen.andersson@smhi.se; elin.almroth.rosell@smhi.se; brm@aqua.dtu.dk,"Eero, Margit/AAK-2845-2021; MacKenzie, Brian R./T-9379-2019","Eero, Margit/0000-0002-1848-0597; MacKenzie, Brian R./0000-0002-4798-0363","European Community [266445]; BONUS - EU; Innovation Fund Denmark; Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning (Formas) [219-2013-2041]; Norden Top-level Research Initiative sub-programme Effect Studies and Adaptation to Climate Change through the Nordic Centre for Research on Marine Ecosystems and Resources under Climate Change (NorMER)","European Community(European Commission); BONUS - EU; Innovation Fund Denmark; Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning (Formas)(Swedish Research Council Formas); Norden Top-level Research Initiative sub-programme Effect Studies and Adaptation to Climate Change through the Nordic Centre for Research on Marine Ecosystems and Resources under Climate Change (NorMER)","This work was supported by the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) under Grant Agreement No. 266445 for the project Vectors of Change in Oceans and Seas Marine Life, Impact on Economic Sectors (VECTORS) and resulted from the BONUS BIO-C3 project supported by BONUS (Art 185), funded jointly by the EU and Innovation Fund Denmark and the Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning (Formas) (219-2013-2041).

In this context, the integration of optimized Semi-Transparent Photovoltaic (STPV) elements seems to present a promising energy saving potential, leading to significant reductions of the heating, cooling and lighting loads while the on-site electricity generation is supplied. In mild climate areas, building glazings are required to perform as solar control systems with a low solar factor in order to avoid overheating. However, g-value is frequently unavailable in the data sheet of the STPV elements, making it difficult to design the optimal building solution. In the present work, an indoor testing facility to analyze the solar factor of STPV elements has been further developed and validated. The operating principles of the calorimetric system as well as the experimental data obtained in the validation stage are presented. Results show that the system accuracy and sensitivity are fully adequate to perform detailed analyses of the solar factor of STPV glazings. Furthermore, g-value variations with the transparency degree have been analyzed over different electrical operating points. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

A first analysis on projections of the SAT by the state-of-the-art regionally coupled atmosphere-ocean model ROM, including exchanges of momentum, heat, and water fluxes between the atmosphere (Regional Model) and ocean (Max Planck Institute Ocean Model) models, shows the following results: (i) In both seasons, the highest SAT occurs over the southern coastal area while the lowest over the northern mountains. The highest warming magnitudes are located in the northwestern part of the ICP. The regionally averaged SAT over the ICP increases by 2.61 degrees C in the wet season from short- to long-term future, which is slightly faster than that of 2.50 degrees C in the dry season. (ii) During the short-term future, largest SAT trends occur over the southeast and northwest ICP in wet and dry seasons, respectively. On regional average, the wet season is characterized by a significant warming rate of 0.22 degrees C decade(-1), while it is non-significant with 0.11 degrees C decade(-1)for the dry season. For the long-term future, the rapid warming is strengthened significantly over whole ICP, with trends of 0.51 degrees C decade(-1)and 0.42 degrees C decade(-1)in wet and dry seasons, respectively. (iii) In the long-term future, more conspicuous warming is noted, especially in the wet season, due to the increased downward longwave radiation. Higher CO(2)concentrations enhancing the greenhouse effect can be attributed to the water vapor-greenhouse feedback, which, affecting atmospheric humidity and counter radiation, leads to the rising SAT.","[Zhu, Shoupeng; Pan, Mengting; Fraedrich, Klaus; Zhi, Xiefei] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteoro, Minist Educ, Key Lab Meteorol Disasters, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Ge, Fei] Chengdu Univ Informat Technol, Sch Atmospher Sci, Plateau Atmosphere & Environm Key Lab Sichuan Pro, Joint Lab Climate & Environm Change, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Shoupeng; Ge, Fei; Fraedrich, Klaus] Max Planck Inst Meteorol, Hamburg, Germany; [Sielmann, Frank] Univ Hamburg, Meteorol Inst, Hamburg, Germany; [Zhu, Shoupeng; Ge, Fei; Pan, Mengting; Zhi, Xiefei] WeatherOnline Inst Meteorol Applicat, Wuxi, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Remedio, Armelle Reca C.; Jacob, Daniela] Helmholtz Ctr Mat & Coastal Res, Climate Serv Ctr Germany, Hamburg, Germany; [Sein, Dmitry, V] Helmholtz Ctr Polar & Marine Res, Alfred Wegener Inst, Bremerhaven, Germany; [Wang, Hao] Chengdu Univ Informat Technol, Coll Atmospher Sounding, Chengdu, Peoples R China","Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Chengdu University of Information Technology; Max Planck Society; University of Hamburg; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Zentrum Geesthacht - Zentrum fur Material- und Kustenforschung; Helmholtz Association; Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar & Marine Research; Chengdu University of Information Technology","Zhi, XF (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteoro, Minist Educ, Key Lab Meteorol Disasters, Nanjing, Peoples R China.;Ge, F (corresponding author), Chengdu Univ Informat Technol, Sch Atmospher Sci, Plateau Atmosphere & Environm Key Lab Sichuan Pro, Joint Lab Climate & Environm Change, Chengdu, Peoples R China.;Ge, F (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Meteorol, Hamburg, Germany.;Ge, F; Zhi, XF (corresponding author), WeatherOnline Inst Meteorol Applicat, Wuxi, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",figo@cuit.edu.cn; zhi@nuist.edu.cn,"Sein, Dmitry/AAI-1352-2021; Sein, Dmitry V/GLS-0252-2022; Zhi, Xiefei/AGU-6880-2022; Sein, Dmitry V./P-6419-2018","Sein, Dmitry/0000-0002-1190-3622; Zhi, Xiefei/0000-0003-4414-0497; Sein, Dmitry V./0000-0002-1190-3622; Zhu, Shoupeng/0000-0002-4741-1179","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41805056, 41776002, 41875102, 41875169]; National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFC1502002, 2018YFC1505702, 2018YFC1506104]; Application and Basic Research of Sichuan Department of Science and Technology [2019YJ0316]; Sichuan Science and Technology Program [2020JDJQ0050]; Postgraduate Research & Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province [KYCX17_ 0875]; Scientific Research Foundation of Chengdu University of Information Technology [KYTZ201730]; Scientific Research Fund of Sichuan Provincial Education Department [18ZB0112]; Open Research Fund Program of KLME, NUIST [KLME201809]; China Scholarship Council [201608320193, 201808510009]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key R&D Program of China; Application and Basic Research of Sichuan Department of Science and Technology; Sichuan Science and Technology Program; Postgraduate Research & Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province; Scientific Research Foundation of Chengdu University of Information Technology; Scientific Research Fund of Sichuan Provincial Education Department; Open Research Fund Program of KLME, NUIST; China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council)","The authors received joint financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41805056, 41776002, 41875102, and 41875169), the National Key R&D Program of China (2017YFC1502002, 2018YFC1505702, and 2018YFC1506104), the Application and Basic Research of Sichuan Department of Science and Technology (2019YJ0316), the Sichuan Science and Technology Program (2020JDJQ0050), the Postgraduate Research & Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province (KYCX17_ 0875), the Scientific Research Foundation of Chengdu University of Information Technology (KYTZ201730), the Project Supported by Scientific Research Fund of Sichuan Provincial Education Department (18ZB0112), the Open Research Fund Program of KLME, NUIST (KLME201809), and the China Scholarship Council (201608320193 and 201808510009).",,64,10,10,0,10,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0177-798X,1434-4483,,THEOR APPL CLIMATOL,Theor.

To investigate the efficacy of bio-mediated ground improvement for reducing the impact of extreme events such as hurricanes, a near-prototype-scale experiment was performed. In the experiment, a model sand dune was constructed in a large wave flume and divided into treated and untreated zones which were instrumented with pressure and moisture sensors. One of the treated sections was subjected to a surface-spray technique to apply bio-cementation. Afterward, the dune was subjected to a discretized severe storm event (a scaled Hurricane Sandy) consisting of 25 trials. Surge runup and drawdown cause surface erosion and also internal instability due to liquefaction. Pore pressure sensors were embedded in different depths of the dune to study the pressure fluctuations during the wave action and the consequent momentary liquefaction phenomenon. Momentary liquefaction leads to detachment of fine sand particles and the initiation of internal erosion and sediment transport. In this project, remote assessment technology (lidar) was used between each trial to evaluate the performance of the dune under the surge flow by detecting the eroded volume of the sand. To better quantify material properties in-situ, a series of triaxial experiments were conducted on bio-cemented cores taken from the formed crust. The strength and stiffness of the cemented sand were measured under different drainage conditions. Element test results indicate a significant increase in critical bed shear stress (tau(c)) due to cementation.","[Yazdani, E.; Wengrove, M.; Evans, T.

The energy efficiency of a BLTN strongly depends on the heating and cool-ing demands of the connected buildings and their simultaneity. In order to evaluate the efficiency of a BLTN, a novel metric, called Demand Overlap Coefficient (DOC), is presented in this paper. The DOC can be calculated for individual buildings or a district and describes which proportion of heating and cooling demands can be balanced inside buildings and between buildings. The DOC is calculated with time series for heating and cooling demands, taking special account of their simultaneity. For a real-world use case in Germany, it is shown that 25% of heating and cooling demands can be balanced in buildings and 45% can be balanced by the BLTN between buildings. The DOC is evaluated for 63 demand scenarios. Correlations show that for districts with a DOC larger than 0.45, BLTNs have lower annualized costs than a state-of-the-art heating and cooling system. BLTNs have higher exergy efficiencies for districts with DOCs larger than 0.3. With the derived correlations, the DOC serves as a practical metric in the planning process of BLTNs in order to identify and assemble building clusters with complementary demand profiles.

Fortifications could be meta-physical, where it solidifies as an interface, a borderline, the boundary itself. This paper brings discourse into interpretation of fortification, from prior related knowledge to understand the concept of it from each individual within the city structure, which affects the values (actions and behaviors) of the residents differently. The context of urbanism to be discussed refers to studies of urbanity, architecture and urban design. The discussion ranges from the most relevant initial study, significant to the topic built on the presence of fortification, the context of urbanism, space and plot (urban space), and also the boundaries and scope of the research topic. The author sees a phenomenon related to the development of real-estate in Indonesia in the form of the flourishing gated community settlements and exclusive high density urban business entities.

An Arabian winter monsoon index (AWMI) is defined to highlight the Arabian Peninsula as the most representative region for the Northern Hemispheric winter dominating the summer rainfall. The observations show that the rainfall variability is relatively large over the northeast of the Arabian Peninsula. The correlation coefficient between the Nino3.4 index and rainfall in this region is 0.33, statistically significant at the 90% level, suggesting potentially some modest predictability, and indicating that El Nino increases and La Nina decreases the rainfall. Regression analysis shows that upper-level cyclonic circulation anomalies that are forced by El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) are responsible for the winter rainfall anomalies over the Arabian region. The stronger (weaker) mean transient-eddy activity related to the upper-level trough induced by the warm (cold) sea-surface temperatures during El Nino (La Nina) tends to increase (decrease) the rainfall in the region. The model hindcast dataset reproduces the ENSO-rainfall connection. The seasonal mean predictability of the northeast Arabian rainfall index is 0.35, statistically significant at the 95% level. It is shown that the noise variance is larger than the signal over the Arabian Peninsula region, which tends to limit the prediction skill. The potential predictability is generally increased in ENSO years and is, in particular, larger during La Nina compared to El Nino years in the region. Furthermore, central Pacific ENSO events and ENSO events with weak signals in the Indian Ocean tend to increase predictability over the Arabian region.","[Abid, Muhammad Adnan; Kucharski, Fred; Almazroui, Mansour; Kang, In-Sik] King Abdulaziz Univ, Dept Meteorol, CECCR, POB 80208, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia; [Kucharski, Fred] Abdus Salaam Int Ctr Theoret Phys, Earth Syst Phys Sect, Trieste, Italy; [Kang, In-Sik] Seoul Natl Univ, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Seoul 151, South Korea",King Abdulaziz University; Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP); Seoul National University (SNU),"Abid, MA (corresponding author), King Abdulaziz Univ, Dept Meteorol, CECCR, POB 80208, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia.",mabid@kau.edu.sa,"Almazroui, Mansour/D-9708-2011; Abid, Muhammad Adnan/L-1845-2013","Almazroui, Mansour/0000-0002-3962-4588; Abid, Muhammad Adnan/0000-0002-7389-7977","Center of Excellence for Climate Change Research (CECCR), Department of Meteorology; Deanship of Graduate Studies, King Abdulaziz University (KAU), Jeddah, Saudi Arabia","Center of Excellence for Climate Change Research (CECCR), Department of Meteorology; Deanship of Graduate Studies, King Abdulaziz University (KAU), Jeddah, Saudi Arabia","The ECMWF-Sys4 dataset has been provided as a contribution to the ICTP Targeted Training Program.

It forms a particular type of landscape and affects the traffic system and urban microclimate. However, the influence of city square spatial morphological indicators on the thermal environment at pedestrian height has not been studied well. This study took the most representative Zhongshan Square of Dalian as the case, the city with the most squares in China. The measurement analysis found that the central air temperature of the square is severe higher than the fixed points 250 m away, with a difference between 4.5 degrees C and 1.7 degrees C. The road location in the same orientation was the primary factor affecting the air temperature by 1.0 degrees C in the 500 m range by mobile measurement. The air temperature in the east-west was higher than in the north-south. The simulation results within 500 m proved that road orientation also affects air temperature. In the same direction, three types of roads with a significant height difference of buildings, broad streets, and straight roads will be conducive to ventilating and create a better thermal environment. This work contributes to urban planning development and decision-making around similar city squares with mad networks.","[Su, Yuan; Wang, Chanjuan] Dalian Univ Technol, Sch Architecture & Fine Art, Dalian 116024, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yupeng; Zhou, Dian] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Human Settlements & Civil Engn, Xian 710049, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Qinfeng] Univ Kitakyushu, Sch Environm Engn, Kitakyushu 8080135, Japan; [He, Yingdong] Univ Calif Berkeley, Ctr Built Environm CBE, Berkeley, CA USA; [Zhou, Nan] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Berkeley, CA 94530 USA",Dalian University of Technology; Xi'an Jiaotong University; University of Kitakyushu; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory,"Su, Y (corresponding author), Dalian Univ Technol, Sch Architecture & Fine Art, Dalian 116024, Peoples R China.",suyuan@dlut.edu.cn; wang-yupeng@xjtu.edu.cn; 1220781811@mail.dlut.edu.cn; b0dbb414@eng.kitakyu-u.ac.jp; heyingdong2017@berkeley.edu; Dian-z@mail.xjtu.edu.cn; NZhou@lbl.gov,,"Su, Yuan/0000-0001-9958-9107",National Natural Science Foundation of China [52278093]; Liaoning Province Economic and Social Development Research Project [2023lslybkt-028]; Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China [2013FY112500]; China Scholarship Council [201906065035],"National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Liaoning Province Economic and Social Development Research Project; Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China(Ministry of Science and Technology, China); China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council)","This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant number 52278093) , Liaoning Province Economic and Social Development Research Project (Grant number 2023lslybkt-028) , the Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China (Grant number 2013FY112500) and China Scholarship Council (Grant number 201906065035)",,65,0,0,12,12,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-0955,,,URBAN CLIM,Urban CLim.,SEP,2022,,,,,,,101280,10.1016/j.uclim.2022.101280,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.uclim.2022.101280,,,19,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,4T1FS,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000857873100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

A way to potentially mitigate this is by including environmental considerations during building design through the concept known as eco-design. Despite the multiple available approaches of eco-design, the latter is not easily achieved in the building sector. The objective of this paper is to identify and discuss what barriers are currently hindering the implementation of eco-design in the building sector and by which measures building designers can include environmental considerations in their design process. Through a systematic literature review, several barriers to implementation were identified, the main ones being lack of suitable legislation, lack of knowledge amongst building designers, and lack of suitable tools for designers to use. Furthermore, two specific tools were identified that allow the inclusion of environmental consideration in building design, along with nine design strategies providing qualitative guidance on how to potentially minimize energy and material consumption, as well as waste generation. This paper contributes a holistic overview of the major barriers to and existing tools and method for the eco-design of buildings, and provides guidance for both future research and practice.","[Ipsen, Kikki Lambrecht; Amor, Ben] Univ Sherbrooke, Interdisciplinary Res Lab Sustainable Engn & Ecod, Civil & Bldg Engn Dept, Sherbrooke, PQ J1K 2R1, Canada; [Pizzol, Massimo] Aalborg Univ, Dept Planning, Rendsburggade 14, DK-9000 Aalborg, Denmark; [Birkved, Morten] Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Green Technol, Campusvej 55, DK-5230 Odense M, Denmark",University of Sherbrooke; Aalborg University; University of Southern Denmark,"Ipsen, KL (corresponding author), Univ Sherbrooke, Interdisciplinary Res Lab Sustainable Engn & Ecod, Civil & Bldg Engn Dept, Sherbrooke, PQ J1K 2R1, Canada.",kikki.lambrecht.ipsen@usherbrooke.ca; massimo@plan.aau.dk; morb@kbm.sdu.dk; Ben.Mourad.Amor@USherbrooke.ca,"Pizzol, Massimo/A-2485-2011; Birkved, Morten/O-8585-2018","Pizzol, Massimo/0000-0002-7462-2668; Birkved, Morten/0000-0001-6989-1647; Lambrecht Ipsen, Kikki/0000-0002-3416-421X; Amor, Ben/0000-0002-0389-5685",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [514294-17],Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR),The authors would like to thank the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (grant ID: RDC #514294-17) for funding the project.,,128,3,3,3,13,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2413-8851,,URBAN SCI,Urban Sci.,MAR,2021,1,,,,,,20,10.3390/urbansci5010020,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/urbansci5010020,,,23,Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies; Geography; Regional & Urban Planning; Urban Studies,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geography; Public Administration; Urban Studies,RG5RC,,"Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000635594200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study provides a consolidated synthesis of CH4 and N2O emissions with consistently derived state-of-the-art bottom-up (BU) and top-down (TD) data sources for the European Union and UK (EU27 C UK). We integrate recent emission inventory data, ecosystem process-based model results and inverse modeling estimates over the period 1990-2017. BU and TD products are compared with European national greenhouse gas inventories (NGHGIs) reported to the UN climate convention UNFCCC secretariat in 2019. For uncertainties, we used for NGHGIs the standard deviation obtained by varying parameters of inventory calculations, reported by the member states (MSs) following the recommendations of the IPCC Guidelines. For atmospheric inversion models (TD) or other inventory datasets (BU), we defined uncertainties from the spread between different model estimates or model-specific uncertainties when reported. In comparing NGHGIs with other approaches, a key source of bias is the activities included, e.g., anthropogenic versus anthropogenic plus natural fluxes. In inversions, the separation between anthropogenic and natural emissions is sensitive to the geospatial prior distribution of emissions. Over the 2011-2015 period, which is the common denominator of data availability between all sources, the anthropogenic BU approaches are directly comparable, reporting mean emissions of 20.8 TgCH(4) yr (-1) (EDGAR v5.0) and 19.0 TgCH(4) yr(-1) (GAINS), consistent with the NGHGI estimates of 18.9 +/- 1.7 TgCH(4) yr(-1). The estimates of TD total inversions give higher emission estimates, as they also include natural emissions. Over the same period regional TD inversions with higher-resolution atmospheric transport models give a mean emission of 28.8 TgCH(4) yr(-1). Coarser-resolution global TD inversions are consistent with regional TD inversions, for global inversions with GOSAT satellite data (23.3 TgCH(4) yr(-1)) and surface network (24.4 TgCH(4) yr (-1)). The magnitude of natural peatland emissions from the JSBACH-HIMMELI model, natural rivers and lakes emissions, and geological sources together account for the gap between NGHGIs and inversions and account for 5.2 TgCH(4) yr(-1). For N2O emissions, over the 2011-2015 period, both BU approaches (EDGAR v5.0 and GAINS) give a mean value of anthropogenic emissions of 0.8 and 0.9 TgN(2)Oyr(-1), respectively, agreeing with the NGHGI data (0.9 0.6 TgN(2)Oyr(-1)). Over the same period, the average of the three total TD global and regional inversions was 1.3 +/- 0.4 and 1.3 +/- 0.1 TgN(2)Oyr(-1), respectively. The TD and BU comparison method defined in this study can be operationalized for future yearly updates for the calculation of CH4 and N2O budgets both at the EU CUK scale and at the national scale.","[Petrescu, Ana Maria Roxana; Dolman, Albertus Johannes] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Earth Sci, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Qiu, Chunjing; Ciais, Philippe; Peylin, Philippe; McGrath, Matthew J.; Saunois, Marielle; Brockmann, Patrick] Lab Sci Climat & Environm, F-91190 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Thompson, Rona L.; Zwaaftink, Christine D.

We find that between 2010 and 2016, the prices and price differentials relative to conventional cars declined at learning rates of 23 +/- 2% and 32 +/- 2% for electric cars and 6 +/- 1% and 37 +/- 2% for plug-in hybrids. If trends persist, price beak-even with conventional cars may be reached after another 7 +/- 1 million electric cars and 5 +/- 1 million plug-in hybrids are produced. The user costs of electric and plug-in hybrid cars relative to their conventional counterparts are declining annually by 14% and 26%. Also the costs for mitigating CO2 and air pollutant emissions through the deployment of electrified cars tend to decline. However, at current levels, NOx and particle emissions are still mitigated at lower costs by state-of-the-art after-treatment systems than through the electrification of powertrains.

However, climate, soil and management systems are quite different in tropical regions. Therefore, crop growth models in tropical regions require extended testing under a range of climatic, soil and management conditions. Multi-location calibration and validation of the EPIC (Environmental Policy Integrated Climate) model for maize production has been carried out using data sets from 22 sites in the semi-arid and sub-humid tropics in West Africa and North-East Brazil. The data sets originated from field experiments on research stations as well as on-farm trials with various treatments over one to four cropping seasons. The calibration procedure revealed the necessity to distinguish between local and improved varieties and to take into account specific parameterization requirements of hydromorphic soils influenced by groundwater or water-logging. Validation with grain yield data from 141 cropping seasons proved to be satisfactory with a mean error (ME) of 0.01 t ha(-1) and a mean relative error (MIRE) of 4%. However, the coefficient of determination for the regression between simulated and observed maize yields was quite low with a R-2-value of 0.69. Detailed analysis of the validation data set showed that model performance depends partially on soil acidity, with the poorest R-2-value of 0.40 on highly acidic soils with aluminum saturation of more than 35% (Alumi-Haplic Acrisols, Ferralsols and Ferralic Cambisols). When data of the other sites were pooled the R-2-value of the regression between simulated and observed maize yields was 0.79, which means that the model explained about 80% of the variance in crop yield. It is concluded that upscaling of the model to the regional scale requires the quantification of the usage of improved varieties and information about the extent of highly acid soils in the target region.

Therefore, building performance simulation models need to be consistently validated in order to assure good prognoses regarding buildings' thermal energy demands. Purpose of this paper is to check the reliability of the AixLib high-order models (HOMs) as well as TDA, a simulation tool for determination of buildings' thermal demands. The HOMs and TDA will be checked by implementing a validation technique according to ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 140-2017 through comparing simulation results to measurement data and comparative test cases. Results of comparative testing show close agreement for most of the 25 implemented cases and 4 freefloating cases. Only three test cases are not within the given statistical acceptance ranges, mostly with insignificant deviations. Empirical validation findings depict average discrepancies between simulated and measured room air temperatures of approximately +/- 1 K. Overall, the achieved results imply accurate and reliable prognoses through the use of the HOMs and TDA due to close agreement with existing reference data and performances in accordance to the state of the art.

This is especially true for sea ice volume, as long-term and large scale sea ice thickness observations are inexistent. Results from the Ocean ReAnalyses Intercomparison Project (ORA-IP) are presented, with a focus on Arctic sea ice fields reconstructed by state-of-the-art global ocean reanalyses. Differences between the various reanalyses are explored in terms of the effects of data assimilation, model physics and atmospheric forcing on properties of the sea ice cover, including concentration, thickness, velocity and snow. Amongst the 14 reanalyses studied here, 9 assimilate sea ice concentration, and none assimilate sea ice thickness data. The comparison reveals an overall agreement in the reconstructed concentration fields, mainly because of the constraints in surface temperature imposed by direct assimilation of ocean observations, prescribed or assimilated atmospheric forcing and assimilation of sea ice concentration. However, some spread still exists amongst the reanalyses, due to a variety of factors. In particular, a large spread in sea ice thickness is found within the ensemble of reanalyses, partially caused by the biases inherited from their sea ice model components. Biases are also affected by the assimilation of sea ice concentration and the treatment of sea ice thickness in the data assimilation process. An important outcome of this study is that the spatial distribution of ice volume varies widely between products, with no reanalysis standing out as clearly superior as compared to altimetry estimates. The ice thickness from systems without assimilation of sea ice concentration is not worse than that from systems constrained with sea ice observations. An evaluation of the sea ice velocity fields reveals that ice drifts too fast in most systems. As an ensemble, the ORA-IP reanalyses capture trends in Arctic sea ice area and extent relatively well. However, the ensemble can not be used to get a robust estimate of recent trends in the Arctic sea ice volume. Biases in the reanalyses certainly impact the simulated air-sea fluxes in the polar regions, and questions the suitability of current sea ice reanalyses to initialize seasonal forecasts.","[Chevallier, Matthieu] Meteo France, CNRM, CNRS, UMR3589, Toulouse, France; [Smith, Gregory C.; Lemieux, Jean-Francois] Environm & Changement Climat Canada, Rech Previs Numer Environm, Dorval, PQ, Canada; [Dupont, Frederic] Environm & Changement Climat Canada, Serv Meteorol Canada, Dorval, PQ, Canada; [Forget, Gael] MIT, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Fujii, Yosuke; Toyoda, Takahiro; Kuragano, Tsurane; Tsujino, Hiroyuki] Japan Meteorol Agcy, MRI, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Hernandez, Fabrice; Ferry, Nicolas; Garric, Gilles] Mercator Ocean, Ramonville St Agne, France; [Hernandez, Fabrice] IRD, Toulouse, France; [Msadek, Rym] NOAA, GFDL, Princeton, NJ USA; [Msadek, Rym] CERFACS, Toulouse, France; [Peterson, K.

(1997), Alfaro and Gomes (2001) (hereinafter referred to as MBA) and Shao (2001, 2004) into a regional climate model with a size-distributed active aerosol algorithm, NARCM (Northern Aerosol Regional Climate Model), an assessment of dust emission schemes in the simulation of east Asian dust storms for March 2002 was carried out. Sensitivity of the parameters used for both the MBA and Shao schemes is first analyzed with a box version of the NARCM, where the wind erosion threshold friction velocities for both schemes are in good agreement for soil grain size range in diameter from 40 mm to 400 mm but differ for other size ranges. Although the impacts of clay, silt, loam and sand contents on vertical dust fluxes show a similar trend, their dependences on friction velocity vary substantially as the correction factors in each scheme to the threshold friction velocity, soil moisture and vegetation cover present a different degree of impact on vertical dust fluxes with wind friction velocity. One specific parameter, soil plastic pressure p, required by the Shao scheme varies between 10(3) Pa for loose surfaces and 10(5) Pa for hard crusted surfaces, which controls significantly emission flux. On the basis of the comparison of dust emission with the MBA scheme in the box model, the soil plastic pressure p applicable to Asian deserts for the Shao scheme is set to be 1000 Pa for sandy, 5000 Pa for loamy and silty and 10,000 Pa for clay soil in March 2002. In 3-D simulations, both schemes captured the dust mobilization episodes during this period in east Asia and produced the similar spatial distributions of Asian dust column loading. Compared with the MBA scheme, the Shao scheme predicted much lower dust emission and surface concentration in eastern Mongolia and eastern and central north China and slightly higher with some additional dust emission sources in north western China, eastern Kazakhstan and western Mongolia. The key parameters responsible for the differences between the MBA and Shao emission schemes are the surface and soil-related factors including soil moisture and vegetation coverage.","Meteorol Serv Canada, Air Qual Res Branch, Toronto, ON M3H 5T4, Canada; China Meteorol Adm, Chinese Acad Meteorol Sci, Ctr Atmosphere Watch & Serv, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; Univ Gothenburg, Dept Chem, Atmospher Sci Grp, SE-41296 Gothenburg, Sweden; City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Phys & Mat Sci, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Environment & Climate Change Canada; Meteorological Service of Canada; China Meteorological Administration; Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences (CAMS); University of Gothenburg; City University of Hong Kong,"Zhao, TL (corresponding author), Meteorol Serv Canada, Air Qual Res Branch, 4905 Dufferin St, Toronto, ON M3H 5T4, Canada.",sunling.gong@ec.gc.ca,"ZHANG, Xiao-Ye/C-8707-2012; Shao, Yaping/G-3606-2013; Chen, Jianmeng/G-2001-2011","ZHANG, Xiao-Ye/0000-0003-1802-3385; Shao, Yaping/0000-0002-2041-5479; ",,,,,35,39,40,1,22,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",2169-897X,2169-8996,,J GEOPHYS RES-ATMOS,J.

This study leveraged two recent Landsat-derived global river width databases and created a reach-level width dataset to measure the validity of model parameterizations at similar to 1.6 million kilometers of rivers in length. By showing state-of-the-art parameterization schemes only capture 30-40% of the width variance globally, we developed a machine learning (ML) approach surveying 16 environmental covariates, which considerably improved the predictive power (R-2 = 0.81 and 0.77 for two testing cases). Beyond the commonly discussed upstream basin conditions, ML revealed that local physiographic factors and human interference are also important covariates for width variability. Finally, we applied the ML model to estimate bankfull river width, creating a new reach-level dataset for use in global hydrodynamic modeling. Plain Language Summary Large-scale river models typically parameterize channel shapes (e.g., bankfull width) based on discharge or drainage area with a power law model or stream order with look-up tables. These highly simplified representations reflect our limited understanding of spatial variability of channel shapes, leading to great uncertainty in global river modeling. Using the most up-to-date global snapshots of channel planform geometry derived from satellite images, this study revisited state-of-the-art channel shape parameterizations used in large-scale river models.

To reach the planned goals, the most promising approach is working both on ships improvement and ports redesign. The latter must enable the new green ships supply with sustainable electrical energy, by integrating shore connection systems, local renewables, and energy storage systems. In this paper, a methodology to obtain such an objective is proposed, capable of taking into account both ships' and ports' characteristics. The methodology workflow is explained through a case study, where two shore connection power sizes and two different operative approaches for recharging the ship onboard energy storage are considered. A discussion about the most suitable energy storage technologies is also provided. The case study shows how the methodology can be applied, as well as demonstrating that the port infrastructure has a direct effect on the ship environmental performance.","[Vicenzutti, Andrea; Sulligoi, Giorgio] Univ Trieste, Dept Engn & Architecture, I-34127 Trieste, Italy",University of Trieste,"Vicenzutti, A (corresponding author), Univ Trieste, Dept Engn & Architecture, I-34127 Trieste, Italy.",avicenzutti@units.it; gsulligoi@units.it,,,European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) [10044221],European Regional Development Fund (ERDF)(European Commission),"The research was funded by European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), through the 2014-2020 Interreg V-A, Italy-Croatia CBC Programme, by means of the 2017 Standard call research project METRO-Maritime Environment-friendly TRanspOrt systems (Project ID: 10044221), Priority Axis: Maritime transport.",,52,0,0,7,15,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1996-1073,,ENERGIES,Energies,NOV,2021,21,,,,,,7240,10.3390/en14217240,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en14217240,,,24,Energy & Fuels,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Energy & Fuels,WX3HW,,"Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000718492200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In recent years, researchers and architects have conducted different studies that represent the principles of Iran's climate-responsive architecture. Yazd traditional buildings are examples of Iranian architecture that bear characteristics of environmentally friendly buildings. Thermal performance and comfort condition of these buildings in summer have been the matter of interest in recent studies. In this article, summer sections of Yazd traditional homes and their thermal behavior were studied. Yazd is located in hot and arid regions of Iran. EnergyPlus software program was used to investigate the thermal behavior of this house. To validate the developed model, a field study was carried out with lascar electronics data logger. The results reveal that internal temperature of summer sections in all seasons has less fluctuation than the outdoor temperature. Also, weather temperature in underground spaces is closer to the comfort temperature in comparison with spaces near to the ground floor. Therefore, to provide thermal comfort condition in these homes the least amount of non-renewable energy is needed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In particular, wildlife appears to function as a reservoir and vector for antimicrobial-resistant bacteria as well as resistance genes. In the present study, the occurrence of antimicrobial-resistant Escherichia coli was determined in marine mammals and various fish species of the North and Baltic Seas. Rectal or faecal swabs were collected from 66 live-caught or stranded marine mammals and 40 fish specimens. The antimicrobial resistance phenotypes and genotypes of isolated E. coli were determined using disk diffusion tests and PCR assays. Furthermore, isolates were assigned to the four major phylogenetic groups of E. coli. Additionally, post mortem examinations were performed on 41 of the sampled marine mammals. The investigations revealed resistant E. coli in 39.4% of the marine mammal samples, while no resistant isolates were obtained from any of the fish samples. The obtained isolates most frequently exhibited resistance against aminoglycosides, followed by beta-lactams. Of the isolates, 37.2% showed multidrug resistance. Harbour porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) mainly carried E. coli isolates belonging to the phylogenetic group B1, while seal isolates were most frequently assigned to group B2. Regarding antimicrobial resistance, no significant differences were seen between the two sampling areas or different health parameters, but multidrug-resistant isolates were more frequent in harbour porpoises than in the sampled seals. The presented results provide information on the distribution of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria in the North and Baltic Seas, and highlight the role of these resident marine mammal species as sentinels from a One Health perspective.","[Gross, Stephanie; Siebert, Ursula] Univ Vet Med Hannover, Inst Terr & Aquat Wildlife Res, Werftstr 6, D-25761 Busum, Germany; [Mueller, Anja; Kehrenberg, Corinna] Justus Liebig Univ Giessen, Inst Vet Food Sci, Frankfurter Str 92, D-35392 Giessen, Germany; [Seinige, Diana] Minist Lower Saxony Food Agr & Consumer Protect, Off Vet Affairs & Consumer Protect, Alte Grenze 7, D-29221 Celle, Germany; [Wohlsein, Peter] Univ Vet Med Hannover, Dept Pathol, Bunteweg 17, D-30559 Hannover, Germany; [Oliveira, Manuela] Univ Lisbon, Fac Vet Med, CIISA Ctr Interdisciplinary Res Anim Hlth, Ave Univ Tecn, P-1300477 Lisbon, Portugal; [Oliveira, Manuela] Associate Lab Anim & Vet Sci AL4Anim, Ave Univ Tecn, P-1300477 Lisbon, Portugal; [Steinhagen, Dieter] Univ Vet Med Hannover, Fish Dis Res Unit, Bunteweg 17, D-30559 Hannover, Germany","University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover, Foundation; Justus Liebig University Giessen; University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover, Foundation; Universidade de Lisboa; University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover, Foundation","Siebert, U (corresponding author), Univ Vet Med Hannover, Inst Terr & Aquat Wildlife Res, Werftstr 6, D-25761 Busum, Germany.",ursula.siebert@tiho-hannover.de,,"Wohlsein, Peter/0000-0001-9184-4134; Oliveira, Manuela/0000-0002-3910-1525; Gross, Stephanie/0000-0002-7734-1466; Steinhagen, Dieter/0000-0002-2303-8533","BONUS BaltHealth; BONUS (art. 185) by the EU; BONUS (art. 185) by the Innovation Fund Denmark [6180-00001B, 6180-00002B]; Forschungszentrum Julich GmbH; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research [FKZ 03F0767A]; Academy of Finland [311966]; Swedish Foundation for Strategic Environmental Research; Ministry of Energy Transition, Climate Protection, the Environment, and Nature of Schleswig (MEKUN SH)","BONUS BaltHealth; BONUS (art. 185) by the EU; BONUS (art. 185) by the Innovation Fund Denmark; Forschungszentrum Julich GmbH; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); Academy of Finland(Academy of Finland); Swedish Foundation for Strategic Environmental Research(Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research); Ministry of Energy Transition, Climate Protection, the Environment, and Nature of Schleswig (MEKUN SH)","This study was financed by BONUS BaltHealth.

Not considered in this scenario are other ways of looking at, being moved by, thinking about, going with and feeling through images, which I will unfold in this paper. Starting with filmmaker Merata Mita from Aotearoa New Zealand, who contrasts living images of her ancestors in documentaries, 'very much alive' to her, with outsiders' selective collecting of those images (Mita,1992); linking with Natalie Robertson's (2019) tracing oftakiaho(relational cords), by which descendants keep connections with their ancestors in film fragments alive; I will also remember Aby Warburg's notion ofNachleben- the 'survival', 'continuity' and 'metamorphosis' of images and motifs (Didi-Huberman et al.,2003, p. 273), and finally engage Mitchell's (2009) consideration of a road not taken by Ranciere in contemplatingThe future of the image. The paper explores a range of experiences, actions, reflections and emotions bundled in the termsappropriationandiconicity:from engaged encounters to consumptive misuse in the first case, from fleeting celebrity fame to a particular form of material presence that contributes to identification and community building (Bartmanski & Alexander,2012; Engels-Schwarzpaul,2017; Refiti,2015) in the latter. By bringing Maori and Pacific ways of thinking together with minor European thought traditions the paper shows that images, as appearance into visibility and doability, can not only connect the imagination with reality. They can also open up new and old realms of possibilities through affective and effective iconicity. Whether or not this can happen depends on the prevailing kind of belonging.","[Engels-Schwarzpaul, A-Chr] Auckland Univ Technol, Sch Art & Design, Aotearoa, New Zealand",Auckland University of Technology,"Engels-Schwarzpaul, AC (corresponding author), Auckland Univ Technol, Sch Art & Design, Spatial Design Postgrad Studies, Private Bag 92006, Aotearoa 1142, New Zealand.",tina.engels@aut.ac.nz,,"Engels-Schwarzpaul, A.-Chr./0000-0003-1382-6621",,,,,61,0,0,0,1,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-1857,1469-5812,,EDUC PHILOS THEORY,Educ.

State-of-the-art supervised methods typically take a two-stage strategy that suffers from the loss of original image features and the introduction of noise on the transferred images. This paper proposes a domain adaptation-based multi-source change detection network (DA-MSCDNet) suitable to process heterogeneous optical and SAR images. DA-MSCDNet employs feature-level transformation to align inconsistent deep feature spaces in heterogeneous data. Feature space transformation and change detection are bridged within the network to encourage task communication. Experiments are conducted on two public datasets based on Sentinel-1A and Landsat-8 imagery acquired over the Sacramento, Yuba, and Sutter Counties (California, USA), and QuickBird-2 and TerraSAR-X imagery over Gloucester (UK), as well as one new large-scale dataset of Sentinel-2 and COSMOSkyMed imagery over Wuhan (China). Compared with other six supervised and unsupervised approaches, the proposed method achieves the highest performance with an average precision of 80.81%, recall of 84.39%, mIOU of 73.67% and F1 score of 82.58%, beating the state-of-the-art method with 5.42% improvements on F1 score and 10 times efficiency on training time cost on the large-scale change detection task.","[Zhang, Chenxiao; Feng, Yukang; Hu, Lei; Pan, Li; Yue, Peng] Wuhan Univ, Sch Remote Sensing & Informat Engn, 129 Luoyu Rd, Wuhan 430079, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Tapete, Deodato] Italian Space Agcy ASI, Via Politecn snc, I-00133 Rome, Italy; [Liang, Zheheng] South Digital Technol Co Ltd, 4-F Surveying Bldg,24-26 Ke Yun Rd, Guangzhou 510665, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Cigna, Francesca] Inst Atmospher Sci & Climate ISAC, Natl Res Council CNR, Via Fosso Cavaliere 100, I-00133 Rome, Italy; [Yue, Peng] Wuhan Univ, Hubei Prov Engn Ctr Intelligent Geoproc HPECIG, 129 Luoyu Rd, Wuhan 430079, Hubei, Peoples R China",Wuhan University; Agenzia Spaziale Italiana (ASI); Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Scienze dell'Atmosfera e del Clima (ISAC-CNR); Wuhan University,"Feng, YK (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ, Sch Remote Sensing & Informat Engn, 129 Luoyu Rd, Wuhan 430079, Hubei, Peoples R China.",fengyukang2016@whu.edu.cn,"Tapete, Deodato/AAB-7528-2021; Cigna, Francesca/B-9173-2015","Tapete, Deodato/0000-0002-7242-4473; Cigna, Francesca/0000-0001-8134-1576",China National Postdoctoral Program for Innovative Talents [BX2021223]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2021 M702510]; Hubei Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China [2020CFA001],China National Postdoctoral Program for Innovative Talents; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); Hubei Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"The work was supported by China National Postdoctoral Program for Innovative Talents (No. BX2021223) , China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (No. 2021 M702510) , Hubei Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 2020CFA001) .

The pervasive use of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning has now all but usurped those functions. Once a primary mediator between the body and environment, clothing has come to occupy a subordinate role to that of mechanical climate-control systems; all too often it appears ephemeral and insubstantial, a signifier of wealth, taste, and status. Such is the power of the fashion industry, moreover, that vast populations around the globe dress observing an etiquette originating in Western Europe. Fashion designers take as given the standard environmental context: 64 degrees F (18 degrees C); however, if the colonization of sub-tropical regions of the United States (focusing on these areas with a view to the world-at-large) is to continue as resources to support such artificial lifestyles diminish, the relationship between body and environment will be radically reassessed and models for sustainable modes of living will have to be borrowed and invented. This essay situates the rationale for a collection of regionally specific clothing that mitigates the effects of the environment on the body, functions as an anticipatory model fostering alternate ways of being and doing, and explores opportunities for local manufacturing and regionally sourced materials.","[Catterall, Kate] Univ Texas Austin, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Catterall, Kate] Glasgow Sch Art Scotland, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Catterall, K (corresponding author), Univ Texas Austin, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",katecat@utexas.edu,,,"University of Texas, Austin","University of Texas, Austin","Funding to support the design and development of Para-Sol was received from The University of Texas, Austin.",,26,0,0,1,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1756-9370,1756-9389,,FASHION PRACT,Fash.

Advanced technologies impress people's imagination demonstrating the latest achievements (materials, methods, systems, technologies, devices etc.) that dramatically change the world. This, first of all, concerns nanotechnological inventions designed by scientists, engineers and specialists from different countries. Main part. The article provides an abstract overview of inventions of scientists, engineers and specialists from different countries: Germany, Iraq, China, Russia, USA, Ukraine, Sweden, Japan et al. The results of the creative activity of scientists, engineers and specialists, including inventions in the field of nanotechnology and nanomaterials allow, when introduced to industry, achieving a significant effect in construction, housing and communal services, and related sectors of the economy. For example, the invention Nanomodified building mortar refers to construction materials and can be used in masonry of ceramic stones, ceramic bricks, hollow bricks in dry and hot climate. The novelty, in respect to the existing construction mortars, is the combination of known components of Portland cement, sand for construction works, amorphous nanomodified silica dioxide, superplasticizer.-3, cure retarders of Portland cement, air-entraining resin. The given qualitative and quantitative composition of nanomodified construction mortar makes it possible to obtain the mentioned mixtures in a simple way: for example, in gravity mixer, with evenly distributed components in volume, which is characterized with specified flowability, water-retaining property, controlled hardening period and can be used in dry and hot climate with air temperature up to 40-50 degrees C. The following inventions in the field of nanotechnology can also be interesting for specialists: a composition of self-compacting construction concrete on the basis of cement matrix, a method of producing polarization-sensitive nanocomposite film on the basis of copper selenide, a method of producing porous moulded article in the form of insulation plaster layer, a method to obtain amorphous nanostructured diamond-like coating, a method of cement surface modification, a system to produce carbon nanotubes, et al. Conclusion. One of the most challenging tasks the economy of every country faces is to increase industrial competitiveness through technological upgrade. From the side of the state and companies the principal object to control in this process are the people and enterprises dealing with introduction of inventions and new technologies.","[Ivanov, Leonid A.] Russian Acad Engn, Moscow, Russia; [Xu, Li D.] Old Domin Univ, Norfolk, VA USA; [Bokova, Elena S.] AN Kosygin Russian State Univ, Technol Design Art, Moscow, Russia; [Ishkov, Aleksandr D.] Natl Res Univ, Moscow State Univ Civil Engn, Moscow, Russia; [Borisova, Oksana N.] Russian State Univ Tourism & Serv, Cherkizovo, Moscow, Russia",Old Dominion University; Kosygin State University of Russia; Moscow State University of Civil Engineering; Russian State University of Tourism & Service,"Ivanov, LA (corresponding author), Russian Acad Engn, Moscow, Russia.",L.a.ivanov@mail.ru,,"Ivanov, Leonid/0000-0001-9513-8712; Ishkov, Alexander/0000-0002-1709-0175",,,,,33,2,2,0,0,NANOSTROITEL STVO,MOSCOW,"GAZETNYI PER-K, DOM 9, STR 4, MOSCOW, 125009, RUSSIA",2075-8545,,,NANOTECHNOL CONSTR,Nanotechnol.

Here the two leading modes of subseasonal variability of surface air temperature over the extratropical Northern Hemisphere in boreal winter are identified with pentad (5days) averaged data. They are well separated geographically, dominating temperature variability in North America and Eurasia, respectively. There exists a two-pentad lagged correlation between these two modes, implying an intercontinental link of temperature variability. Forecast skill of these two modes is evaluated based on three operational subseasonal prediction models. The results show that useful forecasts of the Eurasian mode (EOF2) can be achieved four pentads in advance, which is more skillful than the North American mode (EOF1). EOF2 is found to benefit from the Madden-Julian Oscillation signal in the initial condition. Plain Language Summary In this study, the two leading modes of temperature variability in wintertime Northern Hemisphere are identified. They are well separated to represent dominant subseasonal variability in North America and Eurasia, respectively. They account for more than 60% of the local variance. Also, it is found that there exists an intercontinental connection of temperature variability as these two modes are correlated with a time lag of about 10days. Sources of variability for these two modes are found to be located in the high-latitude regions. Three state-of-the-art operational subseasonal-to-seasonal prediction systems are evaluated for their performance on predicting these two leading temperature variability modes. The Eurasian mode, which is closely associated with cold surges in East Asia, is found to be more predictable than the North American mode. Contributions of several important sources of predictability are explored such as air-sea coupling and the Madden-Julian Oscillation. The results are of great value for future development of subseasonal predictions.","[Lin, Hai] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Rech Previs Numer Atmospher, Dorval, PQ, Canada",Environment & Climate Change Canada; Meteorological Service of Canada; Recherche en Prevision Numerique (RPN),"Lin, H (corresponding author), Environm & Climate Change Canada, Rech Previs Numer Atmospher, Dorval, PQ, Canada.",hai.lin@canada.ca,,"Lin, Hai/0000-0003-4353-0426",,,,,31,21,22,4,13,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",0094-8276,1944-8007,,GEOPHYS RES LETT,Geophys.

Incorporating spatial features within the classification scheme have been mainly carried out by applying just low-level features, which have shown improvement in the classification result. By contrast, the application of high-level spatial features for classification of satellite imagery has been underrepresented. This study aims to address the lack of high-level features by proposing a classification framework based on convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn deep spatial features for wetland mapping using optical remote sensing data. Designing a fully trained new convolutional network is infeasible due to the limited amount of training data in most remote sensing studies. Thus, we applied fine tuning of a pre-existing CNN. Specifically, AlexNet was used for this purpose. The classification results obtained by the deep CNN were compared with those based on well-known ensemble classifiers, namely random forest (RF), to evaluate the efficiency of CNN. Experimental results demonstrated that CNN was superior to RF for complex wetland mapping even by incorporating the small number of input features (i.e., three features) for CNN compared to RF (i.e., eight features). The proposed classification scheme is the first attempt, investigating the potential of fine-tuning pre-existing CNN, for land cover mapping. It also serves as a baseline framework to facilitate further scientific research using the latest state-of-art machine learning tools for processing remote sensing data.","[Rezaee, Mohammad; Zhang, Yun] Univ New Brunswick, Dept Geodesy & Geomat Engn, CRC Lab Adv Geomat Image Proc, Fredericton, NB E3B 5A3, Canada; [Mahdianpari, Masoud; Salehi, Bahram] Mem Univ Newfoundland, C CORE, St John, NF A1B 3X5, Canada; [Mahdianpari, Masoud; Salehi, Bahram] Mem Univ Newfoundland, Dept Elect Engn, St John, NF A1B 3X5, Canada",University of New Brunswick; Memorial University Newfoundland; Memorial University Newfoundland,"Rezaee, M (corresponding author), Univ New Brunswick, Dept Geodesy & Geomat Engn, CRC Lab Adv Geomat Image Proc, Fredericton, NB E3B 5A3, Canada.",mrezaee@unb.ca; m.mahdianpari@mun.ca; yunzhang@unb.ca; bsalehi@mun.ca,"Mahdianpari, Masoud/L-7491-2019; Salehi, Bahram/AAC-9970-2019","Salehi, Bahram/0000-0002-7742-5475; Mahdianpari, Masoud/0000-0002-7234-959X; Rezaee, Mohammad/0000-0001-6547-9612","Government of Canada through the federal Department of Environment and Climate Change, Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [NSERC RGPIN-2015-05027]; Research and Development Corporation of Newfoundland and Labrador [RDC-5404-2108-101]","Government of Canada through the federal Department of Environment and Climate Change, Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Research and Development Corporation of Newfoundland and Labrador","This project was undertaken with the financial support of the Government of Canada through the federal Department of Environment and Climate Change, Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC RGPIN-2015-05027), and the Research and Development Corporation of Newfoundland and Labrador (RDC-5404-2108-101).

This phenomenon contributes to increase the outdoor pollutants concentration and the energy demand for air conditioning. Indoor microclimate conditions depend on several parameters related mainly to the building destination, envelope materials and orientation, its technological equipment, and to the specific region climate. The use of green shading can induce energy savings also in winter, by reducing heat losses from the external surface during mainly the night. An experimental study was carried out at the University of Bari ( Italy, 41 degrees 05 'N, 16 degrees 53 'E) from June 2014 to April 2015 with the aim of investigating the effective influences of this green passive system on a building vertical wall. Three vertical walls were built and equipped with a sealed structure on the backside; the walls were made with perforated bricks. The walls were covered with different evergreen climbing plants: Pandorea jasminoides variegated for the first wall and Rhyncospermum jasminoides for the second one. A third wall was kept uncovered and used as control. A data logger and sensors were used to measure and collect the temperature of the wall, on the surface exposed to the solar radiation and on the inner surface protected by the sealed structure, the external air temperature, the wind speed and direction, the solar radiation falling on the wall. The experimental tests showed that during the daytime of warmest periods the use of the green walls allowed a reduction of the external surface temperature registered on the walls shielded by the green systems: the temperatures observed were lower than the respective temperatures of the control wall of about 3-4.5 degrees C. During the nighttime of coldest periods the use of the green wall allowed to keep the external surface temperature of the walls shielded by the green systems at values higher than the control wall ones: the temperatures observed were higher than the respective temperatures of the control wall of about 2-3 degrees C.

The potential of porphyrin derivatives as hole-transporting materials (HTMs) for perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has recently been demonstrated, but knowledge of the relationships between the porphyrin structure and device performance remains insufficient. In this work, a series of novel zinc porphyrin (PZn) derivatives has been developed and employed as HTMs for low-temperature processed PSCs. Key to the design strategy is the incorporation of an electron-deficient pyridine moiety to down-shift the HOMO levels of porphyrin HTMs. The porphyrin HTMs incorporating diphenyl-2-pyridylamine (DPPA) have HOMO levels that are in good agreement with the perovskite active layers, thus facilitating hole transfers from the perovskite to the HTMs. The DPPA-containing zinc porphyrin-based PSCs gave the best performance, with efficiency levels comparable to those of PSCs using spiro-OMeTAD, a current state-of-the-art HTM. In particular, PZn-DPPA-based PSCs show superior air stability, in both doped and undoped forms, to spiro-OMeTAD based devices.","[Lee, Un-Hak; Eom, Seung Hun; Yoon, Sung Cheol] Korea Res Inst Chem Technol, Div Adv Mat, Daejeon 34114, South Korea; [Lee, Un-Hak; Yoon, Sung Cheol] Univ Sci & Technol, Chem Convergence Mat, Daejeon 34113, South Korea; [Azmi, Randi; Sinaga, Septy; Jang, Sung-Yeon; Jung, In Hwan] Kookmin Univ, Dept Chem, 77 Jeongneung Ro, Seoul 02707, South Korea; [Hwang, Sunbin; Kim, Tae-Wook] Korea Inst Sci & Technol, Inst Adv Composite Mat, Appl Quantum Composites Res Ctr, Seoul 565905, South Korea",Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology (KRICT); University of Science & Technology (UST); Kookmin University; Korea Institute of Science & Technology (KIST),"Yoon, SC (corresponding author), Korea Res Inst Chem Technol, Div Adv Mat, Daejeon 34114, South Korea.;Yoon, SC (corresponding author), Univ Sci & Technol, Chem Convergence Mat, Daejeon 34113, South Korea.;Jang, SY; Jung, IH (corresponding author), Kookmin Univ, Dept Chem, 77 Jeongneung Ro, Seoul 02707, South Korea.",yoonsch@krict.re.kr; syjang@kookmin.ac.kr; ihjung@kookmin.ac.kr,"HWANG, SUNBIN/AIA-8499-2022; AZMI, RANDI/K-2720-2019","HWANG, SUNBIN/0000-0002-1411-7117; AZMI, RANDI/0000-0002-8518-9388","New and Renewable Energy Core Technology Program of the Korea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation and Planning (KETEP) from the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, Republic of Korea [20163030013960]; Technology Innovation Program - MOTIE, Korea [10077471]; Technology Development Program to Solve Climate Changes of the National Research Foundation (NRF) - Ministry of Science, ICT AMP; Future Planning [NRF-2016M1A2A2940912]; National Research Foundation (NRF) grant - Korean Government (MSIP) [2016R1A5A1012966, 2017R1A2B2009178, 2017M2A2A6A01020854, 2017R1C1B2010694]; Global Scholarship Program for Foreign Graduate Students at Kookmin University in Korea","New and Renewable Energy Core Technology Program of the Korea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation and Planning (KETEP) from the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, Republic of Korea; Technology Innovation Program - MOTIE, Korea; Technology Development Program to Solve Climate Changes of the National Research Foundation (NRF) - Ministry of Science, ICT AMP; Future Planning; National Research Foundation (NRF) grant - Korean Government (MSIP); Global Scholarship Program for Foreign Graduate Students at Kookmin University in Korea","The authors gratefully acknowledge support from the New and Renewable Energy Core Technology Program of the Korea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation and Planning (KETEP), granted financial resources from the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, Republic of Korea (No. 20163030013960), the Technology Innovation Program (No. 10077471) funded By MOTIE, Korea, the Technology Development Program to Solve Climate Changes of the National Research Foundation (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning (NRF-2016M1A2A2940912), the National Research Foundation (NRF) grant funded by the Korean Government (MSIP, No. 2016R1A5A1012966, No. 2017R1A2B2009178, No. 2017M2A2A6A01020854 and No. 2017R1C1B2010694), and the Global Scholarship Program for Foreign Graduate Students at Kookmin University in Korea.",,38,29,29,12,100,WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH,WEINHEIM,"POSTFACH 101161, 69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY",1864-5631,1864-564X,,CHEMSUSCHEM,ChemSusChem,9-Oct,2017,19,,,,3780,3787,,10.1002/cssc.201701526,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/cssc.201701526,,,8,"Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Chemistry; Science & Technology - Other Topics,GA6EF,28875552,Bronze,,,12/21/22,WOS:000428425000013,View Full Record in Web of Science

Observed daily rainfall data from the Ghana Meteorological Agency (GMet) spanning 1980 - 2015 was deployed to study the spatio-temporal rainfall trend in the Odaw river basin (ORB) in Accra. Using Mann-Kendall (MK), Sen's slope and set of homogeneity tests, the monthly, annual and decadal rainfall variability based on the indices - rainfall total, daily maximum and rainy/wet day count were examined. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and wavelet (WT) analysis were applied on the monthly time series in order to verify the spatio-temporal variability. It was observed that a mean value ranging from 760 to 1200 mm, 77.1-94.4 mm and 56-90 day count were recorded for Annual Rainfall Total (ART), Annual Daily Maximum (ADM) and Annual Rainy Days (ARD) respectively in the ORB. Mann-Kendal test recorded an overall non-significant positive trend in the Odaw basin for ART and ARD with an average positive slope of 3.7 mm/year and 0.23 wet days/year and a significant positive trend with slope value of 0.55 mm/year for ADM in the basin. On the monthly scale, a significant upward trend was observed for the dry seasonal months; December, January and February for the Monthly Rainfall Total (MRT) and Monthly Daily Maximum (MDM) rainfall series during the period at all stations. Homogeneity for both annual and monthly rainfall time series were observed over the stations in the basin by the Pettitt, Alexandersson's SNHT and Buishand's tests. PCA revealed that the spatial variability of rainfall in ORB is very diverse with 55.9% of the variability located in the middle to highland part while 44.0% of the variation is occurring mostly in the low-lying area at the southeastern part of the ORB. The wavelet analysis also revealed a strong annual periodicity at all the selected stations in the basin. The outcome of this study provides valuable information to formulate adaptation measures through appropriate strategies for managing flood in the study area.","[Ackom, Edward Kofi; Adjei, Kwaku Amaning; Odai, Samuel Nii] KNUST, Reg Water & Environm Sanitat Ctr Kumasi RWESCK, Dept Civil Engn, Coll Engn, Kumasi, Ghana; [Ackom, Edward Kofi] Community Water & Sanitat Agcy, Accra, Ghana; [Odai, Samuel Nii] Accra Tech Univ, Accra, Ghana",Kwame Nkrumah University Science & Technology,"Ackom, EK (corresponding author), KNUST, Reg Water & Environm Sanitat Ctr Kumasi RWESCK, Dept Civil Engn, Coll Engn, Kumasi, Ghana.;Ackom, EK (corresponding author), Community Water & Sanitat Agcy, Accra, Ghana.",ackomek@gmail.com,"Ackom, Edward/AAO-5175-2021","Ackom, Edward Kofi/0000-0002-7408-7247","Regional Water and Environmental Sanitation Centre, Kumasi (RWESCK) at the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, Kumasi; Government of Ghana; World Bank under the Africa Centre's of Excellence project'","Regional Water and Environmental Sanitation Centre, Kumasi (RWESCK) at the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, Kumasi; Government of Ghana; World Bank under the Africa Centre's of Excellence project'","This study was funded by the Regional Water and Environmental Sanitation Centre, Kumasi (RWESCK) at the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, Kumasi with funding from Government of Ghana and the World Bank under the Africa Centre's of Excellence project'.

We gathered data from China's most popular community question-answering (CQA) site-Zhihuand analysed how Chinese Internet users discuss May. The research findings suggest that Chinese Internet users often deploy gendered discourses in discussing May and that these gendered discourses often contain sub-textual commentary on international politics more broadly. We, therefore, point to gendered mediation of Chinese political discourses, which is shaped by the current political climate and revival of patriarchy in Chinese society. This research contributes to feminist media studies by providing a Chinese example of the growing misogynistic voices in politics across the world and highlighting the role of gendered discourses in political commentary.","[Peng, Altman Yuzhu] Newcastle Univ, Sch Arts & Cultures, Media Culture & Heritage, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England; [Cummings, James] Univ East Anglia, Sch Art Media & Amer Studies, Film Televis & Media Studies, Norwich, Norfolk, England; [Li, Yang] Newcastle Univ, Sch Geog Polit & Sociol, Sociol, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England",Newcastle University - UK; University of East Anglia; Newcastle University - UK,"Peng, AY (corresponding author), Newcastle Univ, Sch Arts & Cultures, Media Culture & Heritage, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England.",altman.peng@ncl.ac.uk,,"Peng, Altman Yuzhu/0000-0002-3440-0761; Li, Yang/0000-0003-3511-326X",,,,,47,6,7,2,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1468-0777,1471-5902,,FEM MEDIA STUD,Fem.

To estimate the potential of wildfires to influence metal remobilization from the burned soil due to the changes in cation exchange capacity (CEC) after organic matter combustion and mineral alteration and degradation, changes in soil properties after exposure to different temperatures was investigated. This was accomplished through analysis of geochemical, mineralogical and surface physicochemical properties of a soil sample exposed to different temperatures in a laboratory. Heating the soil sample at 200 degrees C, 500 degrees C and 850 degrees C resulted in an increase in pH (from 5.9 to 12.3), decrease in cation exchange capacity (from 47.2 to 7.3 cmol(+)kg(-1)) and changes in the specific surface area (observed only at 500 degrees C), that are associated with structural modifications of clay minerals and ferromagnetic minerals. Extraction analysis showed the increase in the concentration of almost all analysed elements (Al, Cd, Co, Cr, Fe, Mn and Zn) in soil eluates. The observed increase, following high- temperature heating (500 degrees C and 850 degrees C), was as much as 15 times higher (e.g., Al), compared to the native soil sample (25 degrees C). This strongly indicates that wildfire can act as a trigger for remobilization of heavy metals.","[Fajkovic, Hana; Kampic, Stefica; Vazdar, Dana Leontic] Univ Zagreb, Fac Sci, Dept Geol, Horvatovac 102a, Zagreb 10000, Croatia; [Ivanic, Maja] Rudjer Boskovic Inst, Div Marine & Environm Res, Bijenicka C 54, Zagreb 10000, Croatia; [Nemet, Ivan; Roncevic, Sanda] Univ Zagreb, Fac Sci, Dept Chem, Horvatovac 102a, Zagreb 10000, Croatia",University of Zagreb; Rudjer Boskovic Institute; University of Zagreb,"Ivanic, M (corresponding author), Rudjer Boskovic Inst, Div Marine & Environm Res, Bijenicka C 54, Zagreb 10000, Croatia.",mivanic@irb.hr,,,Croatian Academy of Science and Art [10-102/414-281-2018]; COST Action [CA18135],Croatian Academy of Science and Art; COST Action(European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST)),This research was partially supported by the Croatian Academy of Science and Art (Grant No. 10-102/414-281-2018).

Cellulose yield and stable isotopic compositions (delta C-13, delta O-18, and delta D) were analyzed on leaf cellulose. All parameters unequivocally define a juvenile and a mature period in the foliar expansion of each species. The accompanying shifts of the delta C-13-values are in agreement with the transition from remobilized carbohydrates (juvenile period), to current photosynthates (mature phase). While the opponent seasonal trends of delta O-18 of blade and vein cellulose are in perfect agreement with the state-of-art mechanistic understanding, the lack of this discrepancy for delta D, documented for the first time, is unexpected. For example, the offset range of 18 permil (oak veins) to 57 permil (oak blades) in delta D may represent a process driven shift from autotrophic to heterotrophic processes. The shared pattern between blade and vein found for both oak and beech suggests an overwhelming metabolic isotope effect on delta D that might be accompanied by proton transfer linked to the Calvin-cycle. These results provide strong evidence that hydrogen and oxygen are under different biochemical controls even at the leaf level.","[Kimak, Adam; Leuenberger, Markus] Univ Bern, Inst Phys, Climate & Environm Phys, Bern, Switzerland; [Kimak, Adam; Leuenberger, Markus] Univ Bern, Oeschger Ctr Climate Change Res, Bern, Switzerland; [Kern, Zoltan] Hungarian Acad Sci MTA, Res Ctr Astron & Earth Sci, Inst Geol & Geochem Res, Budapest, Hungary",University of Bern; University of Bern; Eotvos Lorand Research Network; Hungarian Academy of Sciences; Hungarian Research Centre for Astronomy & Earth Sciences; Institute for Geological & Geochemical Research - HAS,"Kern, Z (corresponding author), Hungarian Acad Sci MTA, Res Ctr Astron & Earth Sci, Inst Geol & Geochem Res, Budapest, Hungary.",kern@geochem.hu,"Kern, Zoltan/C-8449-2013; Leuenberger, Markus C/K-9655-2016","Kern, Zoltan/0000-0003-4900-2587; Leuenberger, Markus C/0000-0003-4299-6793",Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF-iTREE) [136295]; Scientific Exchange Programme [10.255]; Lenthilet program of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences [LP2012-27/2012],Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF-iTREE)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Scientific Exchange Programme; Lenthilet program of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences,"AK and ML acknowledge the financial support for the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF-iTREE, project number: 136295).

Deliberate creation of a market for ecosystem services [e.g., a payments for ecosystem services (PES) scheme] can close the gap. The new ecosystem service market alters behaviors and quantities of ecosystem service provided and reveals prices for the ecosystems service: a market-clearing equilibrium. Assessing the potential for PES programs, which often act as ecological infrastructure investment mechanisms, requires forecasting the market-clearing equilibrium. Forecasting the equilibrium is complicated, especially at relevant social and ecological scales. It requires greater disciplinary integration than valuing ecosystem services or computing the marginal cost of making a land-use change to produce a service. We conduct an ex ante benefit-cost assessment and forecast market-clearing prices and quantities for ecological infrastructure investment contracts in the Panama Canal Watershed. The Panama Canal Authority could offer contracts to private farmers to change land use to increase dry-season water flow and reduce sedimentation. A feasible voluntary contracting system yields a small program of about 1,840 ha of land conversion in a 279,000-ha watershed and generates a 4.9 benefit-cost ratio. Physical and social constraints limit market supply and scalability. Service delays, caused by lags between the time payments must be made and the time services stemming from ecosystem change are realized, hinder program feasibility. Targeting opportunities raise the benefit-cost ratio but reduce the hectares likely to be converted. We compare and contrast our results with prior state-of-the-art assessments on this system.","[Adamowicz, Wiktor] Univ Alberta, Dept Resource Econ & Environm Sociol, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H1, Canada; [Calderon-Etter, Laura; Entem, Alicia; Fenichel, Eli P.; Rad, Mani Rouhi] Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT 06460 USA; [Entem, Alicia; Ogden, Fred L.; Stallard, Robert F.] Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, 084-03092 Apartado, Panama City, Panama; [Hall, Jefferson S.] Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, ForestGEO, 084-03092 Apartado, Panama City, Panama; [Lloyd-Smith, Patrick] Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5A8, Canada; [Lloyd-Smith, Patrick] Univ Saskatchewan, Global Inst Water Secur, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5A8, Canada; [Ogden, Fred L.; Regina, Jason A.] Univ Wyoming, Dept Civil & Architectural Engn, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Ogden, Fred L.] Univ Wyoming, Haub Sch Environm & Nat Resources, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Stallard, Robert F.] US Geol Survey, Water Mission Area, Boulder, CO 80303 USA",University of Alberta; Yale University; Smithsonian Institution; Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute; Smithsonian Institution; Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute; University of Saskatchewan; University of Saskatchewan; Global Institute for Water Security; University of Wyoming; University of Wyoming; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey,"Fenichel, EP (corresponding author), Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT 06460 USA.",eli.fenichel@yale.edu,"Lloyd-Smith, Patrick/ABE-4463-2020; Ogden, Fred L/B-2208-2016","Ogden, Fred L/0000-0001-8289-3233; Adamowicz, Wiktor/0000-0002-7634-2985; Lloyd-Smith, Patrick/0000-0002-0786-0877; Regina, Jason/0000-0002-4091-8647","US National Science Foundation, Water, Sustainability, and Climate Program [1360305, 1360369, 1360384, 1360391]; Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute; Weyerhaeuser Memorial Fund; Silicon Valley Foundation; Stanley Motta; Hoch Family","US National Science Foundation, Water, Sustainability, and Climate Program(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute(Smithsonian InstitutionSmithsonian Tropical Research Institute); Weyerhaeuser Memorial Fund; Silicon Valley Foundation; Stanley Motta; Hoch Family","J.

The training data for ANN were obtained from experimental tests executed in the climate chamber with the implementation of high voltage stress. The parameters predicted in this paper are arc-inception voltage, flashover voltage and surface resistance. A promising application of the ANN model proposed in this paper is the effective prediction of the flashover parameters of polymeric insulators affecting by extreme temperature, humidity and pollution level.

Among these models, Environmental Distance was the best predictor for the potential distribution of G.brimblecombei in new regions. Temperate areas appeared to be more favourable for G.brimblecombei. Regions with highest probability of occurrence in Brazil, in hierarchical order are: the southern part of the Atlantic Forest, Pampa, Caatinga and Cerrado. This modelling procedure provides a useful tool that should be incorporated in future strategies for pest management in eucalypt plantations.","[de Queiroz, Dalva Luiz; Garrastazu, Marilice] Embrapa Florestas, BR-83411000 Colombo, PR, Brazil; [de Queiroz, Dalva Luiz; Majer, Jonathan] Curtin Univ Technol, Curtin Inst Biodivers & Climate, Perth, WA 6845, Australia; [Burckhardt, Daniel] Nat Hist Museum, CH-4001 Basel, Switzerland; [Zanetti, Ronald] Univ Fed Lavras, DEN, BR-37200000 Lavras, MG, Brazil; [Fernandez, Jaime Ivan R.; de Queiroz, Elisiane Castro] Univ Fed Parana, BR-80060000 Curitiba, PR, Brazil; [Fernandez, Jaime Ivan R.] Inst Ecol, La Paz, Bolivia; [Fernandes, Bianca Vique] V&M Florestal, BR-35790000 Curvelo, MG, Brazil; [dos Anjos, Norivaldo] Univ Fed Vicosa, BR-36570000 Vicosa, MG, Brazil",Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuaria (EMBRAPA); Curtin University; Universidade Federal de Lavras; Universidade Federal do Parana; Universidade Federal de Vicosa,"de Queiroz, DL (corresponding author), Embrapa Florestas, Caixa Postal 319, BR-83411000 Colombo, PR, Brazil.",dalva.queiroz@embrapa.br,"Zanetti, Ronald/AAP-1397-2021; Garrastazu, Marilice/ABE-7391-2020","Garrastazu, Marilice Cordeiro/0000-0002-2909-3541; Burckhardt, Daniel/0000-0001-8368-5268; Zanetti, Ronald/0000-0001-5698-1838",CNPq; VM,CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); VM,"We thank all the people and institutions who cooperated and provided valuable information: CNPq and V&M for financial support; the Brazilian companies Arcelor Mittal BioEnergia, Conpacel, Cenibra, Internacional Paper, Plantar, Suzano and V&M for contributing data; the Australian institutions Western Australian Department of Environment and Conservation (Dr Janet Farr, Allan Wills, Tom Burbidge, Alison Pritchard), Bold Park (Veronica Newbury), Kings Park (Ryan Glowacki, Jason Stevens), Australian National Insect Collection, ANIC - CSIRO, Canberra (Beth Mantle, Dr John La Salle), University of Adelaide (Dr Gary Taylor), Queensland Museum, Brisbane (Dr Chris Burwell), Institute of Agricultural Research, School of Agricultural Science, University of Tasmania (Dr Paul Walker), Victorian Department of Primary Industries, Melbourne (Dr Alan Yen), Industry and Investment NSW Primary Industries Agricultural Scientific Collections, Orange (Danuta Knihinicki), Sydney (Dr Christine Stone, Dr Deborah Kent), Museum and Art Gallery Northern Territory, Darwin (Dr Michael Braby), Murdoch University (Francisco 'Paco' Tovar) and, in Brazil, the Industry Pest Management Group, Universidade Federal do Parana (Dr Clerber Nissei).",,38,29,32,1,48,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1326-6756,1440-6055,,AUST J ENTOMOL,Aust.

This has resulted in the adoption of new building typologies, including the German Passivhaus (Passive House) standard. This standard aims to improve occupant comfort and energy efficiency, potentially changing the ways in which homes operate and how occupants interact with them. With increasing construction of low energy dwellings, there is an emerging gap in knowledge in relation to occupant health and wellbeing, thermal comfort, and indoor air quality (IAQ). Using data collected from a two year Building Performance Evaluation (BPE) study funded by Innovate UK, the environmental data (temperature, relative humidity and carbon dioxide concentrations) from five Certified Passive House homes in Scotland was compared. The results demonstrate problems with overheating with peak temperatures exceeding 30 degrees C. Imbalanced mechanical ventilation with heat recovery (MVHR) systems were identified in 80% of the dwellings and inadequate IAQ was found due to poor ventilation. Only one of the Passive Houses studied exhibited thermal conditions and IAQ which were, on the whole within Passive House parameters. This paper outlines the insights and the main issues of Scottish Passive House in the broader context of sustainability.","[Foster, Janice; Sharpe, Tim; Poston, Anna; Morgan, Chris; Musau, Filbert] Glasgow Sch Art, Mackintosh Environm Architecture Res Unit, Glasgow G3 6RQ, Lanark, Scotland; [Poston, Anna] Glasgow Caledonian Univ, Sch Engn & Built Environm, Glasgow G4 0BA, Lanark, Scotland; [Morgan, Chris] 3 John Gilbert Architects, 201 White Studios, Glasgow G40, Lanark, Scotland; [Foster, Janice; Sharpe, Tim; Poston, Anna; Morgan, Chris; Musau, Filbert] Glasgow Sch Art, Mackintosh Environm Architecture Res Unit, 167 Renfrew St, Glasgow G3 6RQ, Lanark, Scotland; [Poston, Anna] Glasgow Caledonian Univ, Sch Engn & Built Environm, 70 Cowcaddens Rd, Glasgow G4 0BA, Lanark, Scotland; [Morgan, Chris] John Gilbert Architects, 201 White Studios, Glasgow G40 1DA, Lanark, Scotland",Glasgow School of Art; Glasgow Caledonian University; Glasgow School of Art; Glasgow Caledonian University,"Foster, J (corresponding author), Glasgow Sch Art, Mackintosh Environm Architecture Res Unit, 167 Renfrew St, Glasgow G3 6RQ, Lanark, Scotland.",j.foster@gsa.ac.uk; t.sharpe@gsa.ac.uk; anna.poston@gcu.ac.uk; chris.morgan@johngilbert.co.uk; F.Musau@gsa.ac.uk,,"Sharpe, Tim/0000-0002-4275-5351; Foster, Janice/0000-0001-8693-440X",Innovate UK,Innovate UK(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Innovate UK),This research was funded by Innovate UK (formerly Technology Strategy Board).

However, in hot and humid climates, liquid regeneration deteriorates the performance of regenerators and limits their applications. Therefore, developing methods to ensure regeneration performance in harsh climates as well as to reduce the droplet splatter is a challenging task that must be undertaken to advance the technology and make it viable. In this study, a novel regeneration method using the direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD) regenerator was applied to the LDAC system. The mathematical model of the DCMD solution regeneration process was developed and verified through PTFE hollow fiber membrane liquid regeneration experiments. The impacts of membrane length, temperature, concentration, and solution volume flow on the temperature and concentration of the resultant solution at the outlet, regeneration capacity mass transfer coefficient, membrane water flux, and heat flow were analyzed. The results indicate that the concentration of the solution at the outlet linearly increases from 34.9% to 35.9% when the solution is heated from 40 to 85 degrees C. However, when the temperature of the solution is less than 45 degrees C, the solution concentration at the outlet is lower than that at the inlet, which indicates that the regeneration capacity is negative. Thus, the solution temperature at the DCMD regenerator inlet should be maintained at >65 degrees C to provide a higher and stable regeneration efficiency. Finally, it was established that a flow rate that is either extremely high or low would impair the DCMD regeneration, whilst a volume flow of 1800 ml min 1 is still most appropriate for the regenerator to regenerate high-concentration solutions. Research on the cold side indicates that when the temperature of the water does not exceed 30 degrees C, the regenerator still has the ability to regenerate, and increasing the volume flow of water can enhance the re generation effect.","[Zhou, Junming; Zhang, Xiaosong] Southeast Univ, Sch Energy & Environm, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Junming; Noor, Nuruzzaman] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Mat Synth & Proc Lab, Inst Text & Clothing, Hung Hom,Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Wang, Faming] Cent South Univ, Sch Architecture & Art, Changsha, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xiaosong] Minist Educ, Engn Res Ctr BEEE, Nanjing, Peoples R China",Southeast University - China; Hong Kong Polytechnic University; Central South University,"Zhang, XS (corresponding author), Southeast Univ, Sch Energy & Environm, Nanjing, Peoples R China.",rachpe@seu.edu.cn,"Wang, Faming/B-7799-2010","Wang, Faming/0000-0002-2945-4685; Zhou, Junming/0000-0001-9244-7130","National Natural Science Foundation of China [51520105009]; Scientific Research Foundation of Graduate School of Southeast University [YBPY1912]; Postgraduate Research & Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province [KYCX19_0100]; ITC, HK PolyU [1-ZVLR]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Scientific Research Foundation of Graduate School of Southeast University; Postgraduate Research & Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province; ITC, HK PolyU","The work of this paper is financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51520105009), the Scientific Research Foundation of Graduate School of Southeast University (No. YBPY1912), Postgraduate Research & Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province (No. KYCX19_0100).

Despite the growing recognition of this reality, public space and its functionality amid socio-natural disasters are usually not considered in risk planning and management. The child population, certainly among the most vulnerable, is equally invisible amid mitigation measures and post-catastrophe reconstruction. Thus, this article seeks to advance the understanding of children's perceptions of public space, focusing on the role it could play in resilient urban development. To this end, a comparative approach was used, based on three public spaces located in the hills of the city of Valparaiso, a territory characterised by its vulnerability to urban fires and earthquakes. Using creative, art-based methods to engage children in participatory workshops reveals differences between the three case studies related to public space design processes and institutional actions.","[Soto Caro, Marcela; Leon Canales, Jorge; Escobar Gueguen, Anne] Federico Santa Maria Thecn Univ, Dept Architecture, Valparaiso, Chile",,"Caro, MS (corresponding author), Federico Santa Maria Thecn Univ, Dept Architecture, Valparaiso, Chile.",marcela.soto@usm.cl,,,"Universidad Tecnica Federico Santa Maria; Direccion de Investigacion, Innovacion y Postgrado of the Universidad Tecnica FedericoSanta Maria","Universidad Tecnica Federico Santa Maria; Direccion de Investigacion, Innovacion y Postgrado of the Universidad Tecnica FedericoSanta Maria","This work was supported by Universidad Tecnica Federico Santa Maria; This investigation was supported by the Direccion de Investigacion, Innovacion y Postgrado of the Universidad Tecnica FedericoSanta Maria, as part of the research project `Los nuevos roles del espacio publico en la construccion y educacion de la civilidad y los riesgosde origen antropico o natural: un enfoque en la ninez'.",,65,0,0,10,34,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1473-3285,1473-3277,,CHILD GEOGR,Child.

Hydrasperman ovules are recognisable from their distinctive pollen chamber organisation, but those previously noted from the Permian floras of Cathaysia are imperfectly characterised and require further study to confirm their affinity and identity. Here we document the hydrasperman ovule Conostoma cf. kestospermum from coal-balls in the early Permian aged Taiyuan Formation of North China for which preliminary findings were previously published in a Chinese language book on the coal-ball floras of China. We provide additional information on the organisation and structure of the ovules and for the first time consider their palaeoecological and palaeogeographical significance. We conclude that significant taxonomic filtering occurred in the migration of wetland plant species between Euramerica and Cathaysia in the late Pennsylvanian, with the majority of hydrasperman pteridosperms going extinct in Euramerica at the end of the Carboniferous as a result of habitat loss and climate change. The few hydrasperman genera and species that persisted into the Cathaysian flora were relicts and a minor component of Permian equatorial wetland floras.","[He, Xiao-Yuan] Yunnan Univ, Inst Palaeontol, Yunnan Key Lab Palaeobiol, MEC Int Joint Lab Palaeobiol & Palaeoenvironm, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [He, Xiao-Yuan] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Spencer, Alan R.

While certain plants exhibit a changeover from escape strategy upon partial submergence to quiescence strategy under complete shallow submergence, it remains unknown whether plants completely submerged at different water depths would adjust their strategies to cope with the change in submergence depth. Alternanthera philoxeroides is an ideal species to explore this adjustment as it is widely distributed in flood-disturbed habitats and exhibits an escape strategy when completely submerged in shallow waters. We investigated the responses of A. philoxeroides in terms of morphology, anatomy, and non-structural carbohydrate metabolism by conducting experiments using a series of submergence depths (0, 2, 5, and 9 m). During the submergence treatment, environmental factors such as light, dissolved oxygen, and temperature for submerged plants were kept constant. The results showed that A. philoxeroides plants submerged at depth of 2 m presented an escape strategy via fast stem elongation, extensive pith cavity development, and small biomass loss. However, the retarded stem elongation, reduced pith cavity transverse area, and increased biomass loss along the water depth gradient indicated that A. philoxeroides altered its growth response as water depth increased from 2 to 9 m. It is found that the changeover of response strategies occurred at higher submergence depths (5-9 m). Based on the results of our experiments, we demonstrated that water depth played an important role in driving the change in strategy. The water-depth-dependent growth performance of A. philoxeroides would benefit the species in habit exploration and exploitation. Further studies should focus on the performances of plants when submerged at varied water depths with different light climates and dissolved oxygen content, and how water depths drive the response behaviors of the submerged plants.","[Jing, Shufang; Zhang, Xiaoping; Niu, Hangang; Lin, Feng; Ayi, Qiaoli; Wan, Binna; Ren, Xinyi; Su, Xiaolei; Shi, Shaohua; Liu, Songping; Zeng, Bo] Southwest Univ, Sch Life Sci, Key Lab Ecoenvironm Three Gorges Reservoir Reg, Chongqing Key Lab Plant Ecol & Resources Three Gor, Chongqing, Peoples R China; [Jing, Shufang] Huanghuai Univ, Sch Art & Design, Zhumadian, Peoples R China",Southwest University - China; Huanghuai University,"Zhang, XP; Zeng, B (corresponding author), Southwest Univ, Sch Life Sci, Key Lab Ecoenvironm Three Gorges Reservoir Reg, Chongqing Key Lab Plant Ecol & Resources Three Gor, Chongqing, Peoples R China.",zxpimmun@swu.edu.cn; bzeng@swu.edu.cn,,,,,,,65,0,0,10,10,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-462X,,,FRONT PLANT SCI,Front.

In the present study, A-site deficiency of LNC is discussed and La0.97Ni0.5Co0.5O3 (LNC97) is selected as the optimal composition. Compatibility of LNC97 with 8 mol % Y2O3 stabilized ZrO2 (8YSZ) is analyzed and compared with that of the state-of-the-art air-electrode La0.58Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF) and 8YSZ. Targeting to the requirements of high-performance SOC air-electrodes (high electronic and ionic conductivity and high catalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction), LNC97-based air electrodes are tailored, characterized and optimized by symmetric-cell tests. Principles of air-electrode design for SOCs are revealed accordingly. Long-term measurement of the symmetric cells over a period of 1000 h is performed and possible degradation mechanisms are discussed. Full cells based on optimized LNC97 air-electrodes are also tested. Lower reactivity with 8YSZ in comparison to LSCF and a similar performance render LNC97 a very competitive candidate to substitute LSCF as air-electrode material of choice for SOCs.","[Ma, Qianli; Tietz, Frank; Menzler, Norbert H.; Guillon, Olivier] Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Energy & Climate Res, Mat Synth & Proc IEK 1, D-52425 Julich, Germany; [Balaguer, Maria; Serra, Jose M.] Univ Politecn Valencia, Inst Tecnol Quim, Consejo Super Invest Cient, Ave Naranjos S-N, E-46022 Valencia, Spain; [Perez-Coll, Domingo; Mather, Glenn C.] CSIC, Inst Ceram & Vidrio, Madrid 28049, Spain; [de Haart, Lambertus G.

The framework is based on networks of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with different sensors including cameras. The framework represents a holistic approach that exploits the distributed architecture of clusters of UAVs and cloud computing resources located on the ground. The proposed framework is characterized by the hierarchical organization among framework elements. In such a framework, each UAV is assumed to be fully autonomous and locally implements a state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms for real-time route planning, obstacle avoidance and object detection on aerial images. The main operating modules of the proposed framework have been presented, with the emphasis on the improvements which the proposed framework can bring in terms of event detection time and accuracy, energy consumption and reliability of application in disaster management systems. The proposed framework can serve as the foundation for the development of more reliable, faster in terms of disaster event detection and energy-efficient disaster management systems based on UAV networks.","[Lorincz, Josip] Univ Split, FESB, Split, Croatia; [Tahirovic, Adnan] Univ Sarajevo, ETF SA, Sarajevo, Bosnia & Herceg; [Stojkoska, Biljana Risteska] Ss Cyril & Methodius Univ, FINKI, Skopje, North Macedonia",University of Split; University of Sarajevo; Saints Cyril & Methodius University of Skopje,"Lorincz, J (corresponding author), Univ Split, FESB, Split, Croatia.",josip.lorincz@fesb.hr; atahirovic@etf.unsa.ba; biljana.stojkoska@finki.ukim.mk,"Lorincz, Josip/D-8869-2017","Lorincz, Josip/0000-0001-7691-582X",,,,,21,0,0,2,2,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-1-6654-2585-8,,,,2021,,,,,,,,10.1109/TELFOR52709.2021.9653238,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TELFOR52709.2021.9653238,,,4,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,BT5TR,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000838086600027,View Full Record in Web of Science

The empirical methodology act as an important tool to understand the relative relief asymmetries with respect to area and enlightens neotectonic controls. Present study on 19 RBs implies that underlying structures control the hypsometric curve (HC). Regression analysis of the basin areas (BA) and hypsometric integrals (HI) showed a positive correlation (R-2 = 0.536) for BAs of 500 km(2) (n = 4, P = 0.01), the relation becomes weak or negative. Inflection (I) points on the hypsometric curve (HC) of RBs showed least variation implying a slight disparity between the aspect of landform and its evolutionary state. For apprehending the RB evolution, the RBs have been classified into three zones based on major tectonic features. The expedient outcome of this study is the potential and rewarding application in the design and implementation of measures for conserving soil and water in RBs considered. This hypsometric analysis along with neotectonic evidence is together endowed best tool to understand the river basin behaviour and their response to various calamities.

We conducted a climate-controlled experiment in winter. The air temperatures were 12, 15, 18, 21, and 24 degrees C, and the relative humidity was set to 60%. During exposure (140 min), the subjects were in a sedentary state, and their thermal sensation, comfort, and acceptability of perceived thermal environments were documented many times. iButton instruments were used to continuously and automatically record skin temperatures on the forehead, nose, right ear, right cheek, left cheek, left ear, and chin. The measurement accuracy of the corrected skin temperature was within 0.1 degrees C after calibrating each i-Button. The experimental results showed that the skin temperatures at different measurement points varied significantly. The forehead skin temperature was the highest, whereas the nose, being the facial part, exhibited the lowest skin temperature (except 24 degrees C). The uneven degree of the skin temperature distribution increased as air temperature decreased. Correlation analysis confirmed that the facial skin temperature can be used to evaluate thermal sensation. Nose skin temperature and the average skin temperature of the forehead, nose, and chin are the most suitable indicators of thermal sensation. The correlation between facial skin temperature and the thermal sensation was significantly higher after 15 min of exposure time than that during 0-15 min. This study provides a theoretical basis for using facial skin temperature to dynamically monitor thermal sensations.","[Tian, Xiaoyu; Yu, Junyu] Cent South Univ, Sch Energy Sci & Engn, Changsha, Peoples R China; [Liu, Weiwei] Cent South Univ, Sch Architecture & Art, Changsha 410083, Hunan, Peoples R China",Central South University; Central South University,"Liu, WW (corresponding author), Cent South Univ, Sch Architecture & Art, Changsha 410083, Hunan, Peoples R China.",wliu@csu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [51978661, 52278132]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"The project was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51978661, 52278132).

The calibration accuracy of the state-of-the-art MWR HATPRO-G2 (Humidity And Temperature Profiler - Generation 2) was investigated during the second phase of the Radiative Heating in Underexplored Bands Campaign (RHUBC-II) in northern Chile (5320 m above mean sea level, 530 hPa) conducted by the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) program conducted between August and October 2009. This study assesses the quality of the two frequently used liquid nitrogen and tipping curve calibrations by performing a detailed error propagation study, which exploits the unique atmospheric conditions of RHUBC-II. Both methods are known to have open issues concerning systematic offsets and calibration repeatability. For the tipping curve calibration an uncertainty of +/-0.1 to +/-0.2 K (K-band) and +/-0.6 to +/-0.7 K (V-band) is found. The uncertainty in the tipping curve calibration is mainly due to atmospheric inhomogeneities and the assumed air mass correction for the Earth curvature. For the liquid nitrogen calibration the estimated uncertainty of +/-0.3 to +/-1.6 K is dominated by the uncertainty of the reflectivity of the liquid nitrogen target. A direct comparison between the two calibration techniques shows that for six of the nine channels that can be calibrated with both methods, they agree within the assessed uncertainties. For the other three channels the unexplained discrepancy is below 0.5 K. Systematic offsets, which may cause the disagreement of both methods within their estimated uncertainties, are discussed.","[Maschwitz, G.; Loehnert, U.; Crewell, S.] Univ Cologne, Inst Geophys & Meteorol, Cologne, Germany; [Rose, T.] Radiometer Phys GmbH, Meckenheim, Germany",University of Cologne,"Maschwitz, G (corresponding author), Univ Cologne, Inst Geophys & Meteorol, Cologne, Germany.",maschwitz@radiometer-physics.de,"Löhnert, Ulrich/C-3303-2013; Turner, David D/E-5180-2016; Crewell, Susanne/O-1640-2013","Löhnert, Ulrich/0000-0002-9023-0269; Turner, David D/0000-0003-1097-897X; Crewell, Susanne/0000-0003-1251-5805","US DOE, Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research, Climate and Environmental Sciences Division; German Science Foundation (DFG) [INST 216/519-1FU66]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG);  [SFB/TR 32]","US DOE, Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research, Climate and Environmental Sciences Division(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); German Science Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); ","The data used in this paper were collected as part of the ARM Program sponsored by the US DOE, Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research, Climate and Environmental Sciences Division.

An even more challenging task is the prediction of the future relative gain of companies. We here develop a novel combination of product text analysis, network theory and topological based machine learning to study the future performance of companies in financial markets. Our network links are based on the similarity of firms' products and constructed using the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) filings of US listed firms. We find that several topological features of this network can serve as good precursors of risks or future gain of companies. We then apply machine learning to network attributes vectors for each node to predict successful and failing firms. The resulting accuracies are much better than current state of the art techniques. The framework presented here not only facilitates the prediction of financial markets but also provides insight and demonstrates the power of combining network theory and topology based machine learning.","[Fan, Jingfang; Meng, Jun] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany; [Fan, Jingfang; Shekhtman, Louis M.; Havlin, Shlomo] Bar Ilan Univ, Dept Phys, IL-52900 Ramat Gan, Israel; [Cohen, Keren; Louzoun, Yoram] Bar Ilan Univ, Dept Math, IL-52900 Ramat Gan, Israel; [Liu, Sibo] Lingnan Univ, Dept Econ, Tuen Mun, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; Bar Ilan University; Bar Ilan University; Lingnan University,"Fan, JF (corresponding author), Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany.;Fan, JF; Havlin, S (corresponding author), Bar Ilan Univ, Dept Phys, IL-52900 Ramat Gan, Israel.;Louzoun, Y (corresponding author), Bar Ilan Univ, Dept Math, IL-52900 Ramat Gan, Israel.",j.fang.fan@gmail.com; louzouy@math.biu.ac.il; havlin@ophir.ph.biu.ac.il,"Fan, Jingfang/GLS-9790-2022",,Italy-Israel project OPERA; Israel-Italian collaborative project NECST; Israel Science Foundation; ONR; Japan Science Foundation; BSF-NSF; DTRA [HDTRA-1-10-1-0014]; ARO; EPICC,Italy-Israel project OPERA; Israel-Italian collaborative project NECST; Israel Science Foundation(Israel Science Foundation); ONR(Office of Naval Research); Japan Science Foundation; BSF-NSF; DTRA(United States Department of DefenseDefense Threat Reduction Agency); ARO; EPICC,"We acknowledge the Italy-Israel project OPERA, the Israel-Italian collaborative project NECST, the Israel Science Foundation, ONR, Japan Science Foundation, BSF-NSF, and DTRA (Grant no.

A multi-model ensemble of 14 OH fields was analyzed and aggregated into 64 scenarios to force the offline atmospheric chemistry transport model LMDz (Laboratoire de Meteorologic Dynamique) with a standard CH4 emission scenario over the period 2000-2016. The multi-model simulated global volume-weighted tropospheric mean OH concentration ([OH]) averaged over 2000-2010 ranges between 8.7 x 10(5) and 12.8 x 10(5) molec cm(-3) . The inter-model differences in tropospheric OH burden and vertical distributions are mainly determined by the differences in the nitrogen oxide (NO) distributions, while the spatial discrepancies between OH fields are mostly due to differences in natural emissions and volatile organic compound (VOC) chemistry. From 2000 to 2010, most simulated OH fields show an increase of 0.1-0.3 x 10(5) molec cm(-3) in the tropospheric mean [OH], with year-to-year variations much smaller than during the historical period 1960-2000. Once ingested into the LMDz model, these OH changes translated into a 5 to 15 ppbv reduction in the CH4 mixing ratio in 2010, which represents 7 %-20 % of the model-simulated CH4 increase due to surface emissions. Between 2010 and 2016, the ensemble of simulations showed that OH changes could lead to a CH4 mixing ratio uncertainty of > +/- 30 ppbv. Over the full 2000-2016 time period, using a common stateof-the-art but nonoptimized emission scenario, the impact of [OH] changes tested here can explain up to 54 % of the gap between model simulations and observations. This result emphasizes the importance of better representing OH abundance and variations in CH4 forward simulations and emission optimizations performed by atmospheric inversions.","[Zhao, Yuanhong; Saunois, Marielle;

In these simulations, more than 80% of the initiations occur within large-scale (300 x 300 km) convergence, with some 20% in large-scale divergence, and almost all cases occur within local scale (60 x 60 km) convergence. The behavior alters in a simulation with a convection scheme and a grid spacing of 12 km; initiation is less frequent over convergence lines, and there is less dependency on high-magnitude low-level local convergence.","[Birch, Cathryn E.] Univ Leeds, MetOff Leeds, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Marsham, John H.; Parker, Douglas J.] Univ Leeds, Inst Climate & Atmospher Sci, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Taylor, Christopher M.] Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Wallingford, Oxon, England",University of Leeds; University of Leeds; UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (UKCEH),"Birch, CE (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, MetOff Leeds, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England.",cathryn.birch@metoffice.gov.uk,"Taylor, Chris/K-2319-2012; Birch, Cathryn/P-4228-2014; Parker, Douglas/O-8051-2015; Taylor, Christopher/Y-7529-2019; Marsham, John/AAA-2277-2020","Taylor, Chris/0000-0002-0120-3198; Parker, Douglas/0000-0003-2335-8198; Marsham, John/0000-0003-3219-8472","Office of Science and Technology through the EPSRC's High End Computing Programme; UK Department for International Development (DFID); NERC [NE/G018499/1, NE/E003826/1]; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/B505538/1, NE/G015961/1, NE/G018499/1, NE/E00525X/1, earth010002, NE/E003826/1] Funding Source: researchfish; NERC [NE/G015961/1, earth010002, NE/E00525X/1] Funding Source: UKRI",Office of Science and Technology through the EPSRC's High End Computing Programme(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); UK Department for International Development (DFID); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"Access to the data sets used in this study is available from the corresponding author.

In this study, the individual effects of wind and stratification on surface currents are analyzed in a large lake, Lake Ontario. A state-of-the-art numerical model is applied to explore effects of a common wind scenario (6 m/s eastward) and stratification on surface currents, and their interactions with tributary plumes. For a non-stratified lake, eastward wind accelerates the surface velocities by maximum 23.5 cm/s in nearshore areas, while its effects on current direction are not obvious in the nearshore areas. In mid-lake regions, wind could change the current directions by about 100 degrees counter-clockwise. This eastward wind accelerates the propagation of the Niagara River plume, but decreases its width and bulge area at the river mouth. Lake stratification increases surface velocities in offshore regions and decreases velocities in nearshore regions. The changes of surface current direction by stratification are within 68 degrees in most areas. Tributary plumes are strongly affected by surface currents and the unusual westward Niagara River plume observations could be explained by currents caused by unusual westward wind conditions. Predicting changes in surface currents caused by wind and stratification is important for understanding nutrient dynamics and shedding light on ecological problems such as algal bloom occurrences.","[Hui, Yuan; Zhu, Zhenduo; Atkinson, Joseph F.] SUNY Buffalo, Dept Civil Struct & Environm Engn, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Buffalo,"Hui, Y (corresponding author), SUNY Buffalo, Dept Civil Struct & Environm Engn, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA.",,"Zhu, Zhenduo/I-2736-2017","Zhu, Zhenduo/0000-0002-7711-7632",,,,,19,0,0,1,6,AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,NEW YORK,"UNITED ENGINEERING CENTER, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017-2398 USA",,,978-0-7844-8234-6,,,,2019,,,,,268,277,,,,,,10,"Engineering, Civil; Water Resources",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Engineering; Water Resources,BN0OX,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000473297100047,View Full Record in Web of Science

The importance of temperature is also emerging when applying NLR to crops responding to global climate change. In particular, studies of pathogen effector recognition and autoimmune activity of NLRs in plants can quickly and easily determine their function in tobacco using agro-mediated transient assay. However, there are conditions that should not be overlooked in these cell death-related assays in tobacco. Results Environmental conditions play an important role in the immune response of plants. The system used in this study was to establish conditions for optimal hypertensive response (HR) cell death analysis by using the paired NLR RPS4/RRS1 autoimmune and AvrRps4 effector recognition system. The most suitable greenhouse temperature for growing plants was fixed at 22 degrees C. In this study, RPS4/RRS1-mediated autoimmune activity, RPS4 TIR domain-dependent cell death, and RPS4/RRS1-mediated HR cell death upon AvrRps4 perception significantly inhibited under conditions of 65% humidity. The HR is strongly activated when the humidity is below 10%. Besides, the leaf position of tobacco is important for HR cell death. Position #4 of the leaf from the top in 4-5 weeks old tobacco plants showed the most effective HR cell death. Conclusions As whole genome sequencing (WGS) or resistance gene enrichment sequencing (RenSeq) of various crops continues, different types of NLRs and their functions will be studied. At this time, if we optimize the conditions for evaluating NLR-mediated HR cell death, it will help to more accurately identify the function of NLRs. In addition, it will be possible to contribute to crop development in response to global climate change through NLR engineering.","[Huh, Sung Un] Kunsan Natl Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Gunsan 54150, South Korea",Kunsan National University,"Huh, SU (corresponding author), Kunsan Natl Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Gunsan 54150, South Korea.",sungun@kunsan.ac.kr,,"Huh, Sung Un/0000-0003-2288-9579","Next-Generation BioGreen 21 Program by Rural Development Administration [PJ01365301]; National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korea government (MEST), Republic of Korea [18A18297611]","Next-Generation BioGreen 21 Program by Rural Development Administration; National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korea government (MEST), Republic of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea)","This project was funded by the Next-Generation BioGreen 21 Program (Project No. PJ01365301) by Rural Development Administration and National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korea government (MEST) (No.18A18297611), Republic of Korea.",,145,1,1,2,3,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,1746-4811,,PLANT METHODS,Plant Methods,2-May,2022,1,,,,,,57,10.1186/s13007-022-00893-z,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13007-022-00893-z,,,12,Biochemical Research Methods; Plant Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Plant Sciences,0X6NK,35501866,"Green Published, Green Submitted, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000789820400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Moving beyond human scales to include the evolutionary and the geological, and beyond humans to include other species, demands different approaches and new archives like ice-cores. This paper considers history in the Long Now, and particularly how museums and big public arts institutions develop new sorts of history through practical story-telling, taking seriously the notion that the central role of museums [is] both an expression of cultural identity and. a powerful force for human development and education. The museum has a particular value as slow media, deepening news stories in times of rapid change. The new epoch of Earth, the Anthropocene, where humans have become a geological force, poses challenges for exhibitions, but also reshapes museums themselves. Crucial to managing stories, collections and objects in Anthropocene times is the capacity to change course, to remain open to new developments, using performances, events and pop-up exhibitions alongside traditional museum offerings. New Museology regards stories as the fundamental unit of museums. Thus, the curation of stories is central work.

The monuments introduced uncharacteristically jagged forms, and to an extent the frayed discourses, of transnational counter-memory culture into a landscape largely preoccupied with figuration and heroism. Both Canadian monuments come to us with long and connected formal, conceptual, and socio-historical lineages that follow the transnational evolution of the conjoined and conflated memories of Fascism, Communism, and their accompanying commemorative forms. These forms and tropes, conceived and processed in the specific climate of the German Historikerstreit of the 1980s, are deeply intertwined with a shift towards counter-memory and accusatory rather than celebratory monuments. While potentially productive as embodiments of multidirectional' memory practices, in many ways, the Canadian monuments sublate possibilities for working through the past' into affirmations of nationalism bought at the cost of a productive public discussion about human rights abuses perpetrated in Canada.","[Dolgoy, Rebecca Clare] Carleton Univ, Ctr Transnat Cultural Anal, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Elzanowski, Jerzy] Carleton Univ, Inst Comparat Studies Literature Art & Culture, Sch Indigenous & Canadian Studies, Ottawa, ON, Canada",Carleton University; Carleton University,"Dolgoy, RC (corresponding author), Carleton Univ, Ctr Transnat Cultural Anal, Ottawa, ON, Canada.",rebecca.dolgoy@gmail.com,,,,,,,60,3,3,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1362-1025,1469-3593,,CITIZENSHIP STUD,Citizensh.

This study proposed two new methods (i.e., equal area method and equal radius method) to estimate GCII and compared them with two old methods (i.e., turning point method and fixed radius method) in terms of the GCII magnitudes, spatial variations, relationships with greenspace size, and the estimation of optimal greenspace size in cooling the environment (i.e., threshold value of efficiency (TVoE)). We performed the analysis based on Landsat derived land surface temperature (LST) in seven Chinese cities with varied climate background and geographic variations. The results showed that: (1) Different methods significantly impacted the estimated GCIIs with higher values by the turning point method and lower values by the equal area method. (2) GCIIs by different methods were positively and significantly correlated with each other and characterized similar spatial heterogeneities. (3) GCIIs by all methods showed significantly positive logarithmic relationships with greenspace area with higher R2 observed by the equal area method. (4) The four methods estimated close TVoEs with no significant difference among them.

The human occupations in this site are bracketed between the Pleistocene-Holocene boundary and the mid-Holocene, challenging the idea of a widespread abandonment of the Andes highlands during mid-Holocene due to extreme arid conditions (i.e. the silencio arqueologico or archaeological silence hypothesis). Nine occupational levels have been recognized in the timed span at the site, the result of hunter gatherer activities carried out in a highly oscillating and changing environment. Here we present the mean trends and patterns observed in the full set of lines of inquiry applied in the site: lithic evidence, zooarchaeological analysis, rock art, stratigraphic and spatial analysis, and isotopic data. The outcomes of these studies, together with the site location features, known raw materials sources and regional archaeological evidence, indicate that hunter gatherer groups reduced their residential mobility, and increased the intensity of their occupations and the rate of technological innovations in the arid and unstable mid-Holocene landscapes.

Data from the 2003-2004 Schools and Staffing Survey, a comprehensive nationally representative survey of teachers, principals, and schools conducted by the National Center for Educational Statistics, were examined. Based on logistic regression analysis, the three most significant predictors for teacher attrition risk were (a) being a minority teacher, (b) years of teaching experience, and (c) teacher apathy.

It results in a significant flux depletion in the near-IR and IR parts of their spectra. Because of the extreme conditions of helium-rich atmospheres (where the density can be as high as a few g cm(-3)), this opacity source is expected to undergo strong pressure distortion and the currently used opacities have not been validated at such extreme conditions. To check the distortion of the CIA opacity, we applied state-of-the-art ab initio methods of computational quantum chemistry to simulate the CIA opacity at high densities. The results show that the CIA profiles are significantly distorted above densities of 0.1 g cm(-3) in a way that is not captured by the existing models. The roto-translational band is enhanced and shifted to higher frequencies as an effect of the decrease of the interatomic separation of the H-2 molecule. The vibrational band is blueward shifted and split into Q(R) and Q(P) branches, separated by a pronounced interference dip. Its intensity is also substantially reduced. The distortions result in a shift of the maximum of the absorption from 2.3 mu m to 3-7 mu m, which could potentially explain the spectra of some very cool, helium-rich white dwarfs.","[Blouin, S.; Dufour, P.] Univ Montreal, Dept Phys, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada; [Blouin, S.; Kowalski, P.

Haplic Chernozems occur under kurgans and on the actual land surface. Three kurgan cemeteries, Brut 1, Brut 2 and Beslan, dated from the end of the second to the beginning of the seventh centuries AD have been studied. The cemeteries are situated close to each other under similar lithological and geomorphological conditions but differed in the paleosols' preservation. The Brut 2 site has been recently altered due to annual ploughing and intensive irrigation for more than 30 years. The background soils and paleosols of the Brut 2 site have been compared with synchronous soils of non-irrigated Brut I and Beslan sites to detect pedogenic properties that are less changed by irrigation and thus comprise the soil memory. Stronger black color of humus horizon, increase of humus content and decrease of humus delta C-13 values; clear signs of biological activity, absence of morphological and analytical signs of solonetz properties; diffused carbonate white soft spots in the Bca horizon and decreasing carbonate content are thought to be related to the comparatively humid climatic conditions in the region. On the contrary, relatively low humus content, tongue-like lower boundary of humus horizon, increase of humus delta C-13 values, morphological signs of solonetz properties together with high content of exchangeable Na, relatively large and clearly shaped carbonate white soft spots in the paleosols of the Brut 2 site, as well as increase of density, thickness of the carbonate pseudomicellium and high carbonate content in the upper part of profiles in the paleosols of the non-irrigated Brut 1 site are assumed to be xeromorphic features, indicating comparatively drier climatic conditions. The paleosols of the earliest chronointerval of burial (the end of the second to the beginning of the third centuries AD) demonstrate clear xeromorphic properties which indicate a relatively dry climate with a mean annual precipitation 50-100 mm less than today. The estimated duration of the period with such climatic conditions is thought to be not less than 100 years. In addition, those paleosols have some weak signs of humid conditions indicating that between the end of the first and the middle of the second centuries AD the climate was getting more moist, mean annual precipitation became equal or slightly higher than today. The paleosols buried in the first half of the fifth century AD again demonstrate the gradual enhancement of xeromorphic properties reflecting the next stage of droughts. Thus, the period with favourable humid climate when the Early Alan culture flourished in the Northern Caucasus was relatively short (about 400 years). Studying the detailed chronosequence in the non-irrigated Brut I site the records of intercentennial time scale soil properties variability produced by comparatively fast pedogenic processes typical for the steppe zone i.e., humus formation and accumulation, bioturbation, carbonate accumulation and transformation and solonetzization, have been provided.

The data sets span a period of 150 years and hence represent a unique time series of rich high-altitude mountain observations. Their collection was originally initiated to support scientific investigation of the glaciers Hintereisferner, Kesselwandferner and Vernagtferner. Annual mass balance, glacier front variation, flow velocities and photographic records of the status of these glaciers were recorded. Later, additional measurements of meteorological and hydrological variables were undertaken, and over time a number of autonomous weather stations and runoff gauges were brought into operation; the available data now comprise records of temperature, relative humidity, short-and longwave radiation, wind speed and direction, air pressure, precipitation, and river water levels. Since 2001, a series of distributed (airborne and terrestrial) laser scans is available, along with associated digital surface models. In 2016 a permanent terrestrial laser scanner was installed on Im hintern Eis (3244 m a.s.l.) to continuously observe almost the entire area of Hintereisferner. The data and research undertaken at the sites of investigation in the Rofental area enable combined research of cryospheric, atmospheric and hydrological processes in complex terrain, and support the development of several state-of-the-art glacier mass balance and hydroclimatological models. The institutions taking part in the Rofental research framework promote their site in several international research initiatives.

Led by state-led desalination programs, but also with a strong participation of the private sector, the emergence and development of desalination have been geographically uneven in the last decades. Desalination has its drawbacks, not only in terms of environmental sustainability, because of the intensification of the water-energy nexus, but also due to distributional issues that surround the access to desalinated water. These drawbacks are reviewed in detail and exemplified with reference to the case of Spain. Eventually, this article discusses to what extent desalination constitutes a radical break with the old 20th century hydraulic paradigm and interrogates whether it risks repeating the same mistakes, thus becoming a maladaptive strategy to cope with 21st century global water issues.

This study focuses on the second decadal leading mode (2DLM), accounting for 17.3% of rainfall decadal variance, as distinct from the other two neighboring modes of EAMR, based on the state-of-the-art in-situ rainfall data. This mode is characterized by a South-China-wet-HuaiheRiver-dry pattern, and is dominated by a quasi-30-yr period. Further analysis reveals the 2DLM corresponds to an enhanced lower-level monsoon jet, an eastward extension of the western North Pacific subtropical high, and a weakened East Asian upper-level westerly jet flow. The Tibetan Plateau surface temperature and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) are closely linked with the 2DLM. The regressed SST pattern indicates the PDO-like pattern of sea surface temperature anomalies may have a teleconnection relationship with the 2DLM of EASR.","[Bao Qing; Yu Pei] Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Numer Modeling Atmospher Sci & Geop, Inst Atmospher Phys, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Yu Pei] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Bao, Q (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Numer Modeling Atmospher Sci & Geop, Inst Atmospher Phys, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.",baoqing@mail.iap.ac.cn,"Bao, Qing/A-7765-2012","Bao, Qing/0000-0003-1719-6540","National Basic Research Program (973 Program) [2012CB417203]; R&D Special Fund for Public Welfare Industry (Meteorology) [GYHY201406001]; Strategic Leading Science Projects of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA11010402]; National National Science Foundation of China [91337110, 40805038]",National Basic Research Program (973 Program)(National Basic Research Program of China); R&D Special Fund for Public Welfare Industry (Meteorology); Strategic Leading Science Projects of the Chinese Academy of Sciences; National National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This study was supported by the National Basic Research Program (973 Program, Grant No. 2012CB417203), the R&D Special Fund for Public Welfare Industry (Meteorology) (Grant No. GYHY201406001), Strategic Leading Science Projects of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Grant No. XDA11010402), and the National National Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 91337110 and 40805038).",,21,1,1,0,5,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1674-2834,2376-6123,,ATMOS OCEAN SCI LETT,Atmos.

The primary objective of this research is to take advantage of state-of-art three-dimensional (3D) input/outputs technologies and to develop an avatar-like mechanism to synchronize the physical behavior of an operator with a remote system. Two 3D input/output methods are used in this research: stereoscopic vision and motion tracking. The system is designed to work under closed-loop control involving human feedback. Two cameras that are optimized according to the human eye angle-of-view to accommodate for the perspective of human eyes are used as stereoscopic vision inputs on the unmanned vehicle. At the operator end, a head mounted display is used to display the stereoscopic image and to track the operator's head movement with embedded sensors. The head movement tracldng data are interpreted into control signals and returned to the unmanned vehicle to control a three-axis gimbal mechanism, on which the two cameras are installed. The Teleyes system has been validated using a designed experimental application scenario and compared with current methods using five different operators. On average, the proposed system reduced the distance error of operators by 45.1% and the time usage by 18.2%. The results show that the system has significantly improved the visual experience and operating efficiency, thus having the potential to save resources and expand the application of unmanned vehicle systems (UVSs). The developed system provides the operator with a realistic first-person view of a UVS and a visual experience similar to being onboard.","[Wen, Ming-Chang; Yang, Cheng-Hsuan; Kang, Shih-Chung] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Taipei, Taiwan; [Tsai, Meng-Han] Natl Taiwan Univ, Ctr Weather Climate & Disaster Res, Taipei, Taiwan",National Taiwan University; National Taiwan University,"Tsai, MH (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Ctr Weather Climate & Disaster Res, Taipei, Taiwan.",menghan@caece.net; sckang@ntu.edu.tw,,"Tsai, Meng-Han/0000-0002-2466-6152",,,,,68,1,2,0,20,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0926-5805,1872-7891,,AUTOMAT CONSTR,Autom.

One of the key questions is the presence of fish in the diet. AMS radiocarbon dating of archaeological bone collagen has also been carried out to investigate potential radiocarbon reservoir effects in human skeletal material as a result of an aquatic diet. A fish component has previously been suggested in the diet of Iron Age and Bronze Age humans across Eurasia by isotopic research and radiocarbon dating of contemporaneous human and animal bones. In the North Caucasus however, isotopic data is scant. This study presents a new set of stable isotopic data from several Early Bronze Age sites, mainly belonging to the Maikop culture of the North Caucasus. The results show that the diversity in climate and environment across the northern Caucasus may be a causal factor for the patterns observed in the stable isotope values of terrestrial herbivores. This affects the isotopic values of the humans consuming them. The differences in delta N-15 and delta C-13 ranges of both humans and fauna were found to correlate strongly with geography and climate; the most enriched isotopic values are found in the dry steppe areas to the north. Overall, a relatively high enrichment in delta N-15 values of humans compared to local terrestrial herbivores and carnivores was observed. This indicates that aquatic resources were probably part of the Bronze Age diet in the region although the extent of this needs further investigation. The dramatic effect of environmental factors on isotopic values in the Early Bronze Age of the North Caucasus illustrates how confident conclusions cannot be drawn on the basis of a small number of samples from widely differing regions and time periods. Radiocarbon dating can provide a useful tool for identifying dietary derived reservoir ages in humans, potentially caused by a fish diet. With two possible exceptions, the nine human animal bone pair dated as part of this study showed no consistent indication for a consistent reservoir effect. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

J,"Jung, R; Ehlers, M",,,,"Jung, Richard; Ehlers, Manfred",,,Comparison of two feature selection methods for the separability analysis of intertidal sediments with spectrometric datasets in the German Wadden Sea,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION,,,English,Article,,,,,,ReliefF; Tidal flats; Hyperspectral data; Feature selection; Random forest; Intertidal sediments,FEATURE-EXTRACTION; GRAIN-SIZE; SPECTRAL CHARACTERISTICS; BAND SELECTION; TIDAL FLATS; CLASSIFICATION; VEGETATION; SURFACE,"The spectral features of intertidal sediments are all influenced by the same biophysical properties, such as water, salinity, grain size or vegetation and therefore they are hard to separate by using only multi spectral sensors. This could be shown by a previous study of Jung et al. (2015). A more detailed analysis of their characteristic spectral feature has to be carried out to understand the differences and similarities. Spectrometry data (i.e., hyperspectral sensors), for instance, have the opportunity to measure the reflection of the landscape as a continuous spectral pattern for each pixel of an image built from dozen to hundreds of narrow spectral bands. This reveals a high potential to measure unique spectral responses of different ecological conditions (Hennig et al., 2007). In this context, this study uses spectrometric datasets to distinguish between 14 different sediment classes obtained from a study area in the German Wadden Sea. A new feature selection method is proposed (Jeffries-Matusita distance bases feature selection; JMDFS), which uses the Euclidean distance to eliminate the wavelengths with the most similar reflectance values in an iterative process. Subsequent to each iteration, the separation capability is estimated by the Jeffries-Matusita distance (JMD). Two classes can be separated if the JMD is greater than 1.9 and if less than four wavelengths remain, no separation can be assumed. The results of the JMDFS are compared with a state-of-the-art feature selection method called ReliefF. Both methods showed the ability to improve the separation by achieving overall accuracies greater than 82%. The accuracies are 4%-13% better than the results with all wavelengths applied. The number of remaining wavelengths is very diverse and ranges from 14 to 213 of 703. The advantage of JMDFS compared with ReliefF is clearly the processing time.

It is unclear, from an economic point of view, whether one should test each product line member separately or test just product-specific parts and compose them with tested core assets from family engineering. While the former strategy introduces redundancy in testing, the latter strategy is also more difficult because of genericity. Ideally, we need to carefully calculate cost-benefits of both cases and define a test strategy accordingly. Currently, there is no economic model for testing in the context of product lines. Thus, we introduce an initial economic model, and then perform Monte-Carlo simulations to calculate cost-benefit of the two test strategies. For the Testo product line of climate and flue gas measurement devices, the results showed that, using an infrastructure-focused test strategy, on average a cost saving of 13% can be expected with 87% certainty.","[Ganesan, Dharmalingarn; Knodel, Jens] Fraunhofer Inst Expt Software Engn, Fraunhofer Pl 1, D-67663 Kaiserslautern, Germany; [Kolb, Ronny] Honeywell Int Sarl, CH-1024 Ecublens, Switzerland; [Flaury, Uwe; Meier, Gerald] Testo AG, D-79853 Lenzkirch, Germany",Fraunhofer Gesellschaft; Honeywell,"Ganesan, D (corresponding author), Fraunhofer Inst Expt Software Engn, Fraunhofer Pl 1, D-67663 Kaiserslautern, Germany.",ganesan@iese.fraunhofer.de; knodel@iese.fraunhofer.de; ronny.kolb@honeywell.com,,,German ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) [01 IS F14],German ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),This work was performed in the project ArQuE Architecture-Centric Quality Engineering) which is partially funded by the German ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) under grant number 01 IS F14.,,12,5,5,0,2,IEEE COMPUTER SOC,LOS ALAMITOS,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA",,,978-0-7695-2888-5,,,,2007,,,,,74,+,,10.1109/SPLINE.2007.21,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/SPLINE.2007.21,,,2,"Computer Science, Software Engineering",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BGZ18,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000251450700008,View Full Record in Web of Science

Using the Met Office GloSea5 forecast ensemble, we study the precipitation and circulation differences between these seasons and identify processes relevant to California precipitation predictions. The ensemble mean accurately predicts the midlatitude atmospheric circulation differences between these years, indicating that these differences were predictable responses to the strong oceanic forcing differences. The substantial California precipitation differences were poorly predicted with large uncertainty. Notable differences in high-latitude circulation anomalies associated with internal variability distinguish the ensemble members that successfully simulate precipitation from those that do not. Specifically, accurate representation of the Arctic Oscillation phase differences improves the accuracy of simulated precipitation differences but these differences were not well predicted in the ensemble mean for these seasons. Improved representation of high-latitude processes such as the Arctic Oscillation and polar-midlatitude teleconnections could therefore improve California seasonal predictions. Plain Language Summary California recently experienced two unusual winter seasons. Following a failed rainy season despite the strong 2015-2016 El Nino that typically brings heavy rains, California unexpectedly experienced one of its wettest winter seasons on record during the 2016-2017 La Nina. The seasonal forecast systems were unable to predict these unusual winter precipitation patterns. We examine the ability of a state-of-the-art forecast system to capture the large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns that influence the track of storms, which bring a majority of winter precipitation to California. We show that the seasonal forecast systems can reproduce the large-scale circulation differences in the North Pacific-American domain, but random atmospheric variability can still easily prevent the accurate prediction of regional scale precipitation in extratropical regions such as California. Further, we identify the role of a natural pattern of large-scale variability in the atmosphere that affects weather in the middle and high latitudes, referred to as the Arctic Oscillation, in controlling the accuracy of California precipitation forecasts. Prioritizing improvements in the representation of these patterns, the processes by which they are predicted and their influence over other regions in the forecasts systems can help improve seasonal predictions, which is important for the management of California's water resources and infrastructure.","[Singh, Deepti] Washington State Univ, Sch Environm, Vancouver, WA 98686 USA; [Singh, Deepti; Ting, Mingfang] Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY 10964 USA; [Scaife, Adam A.; Martin, Nicola] Met Off Hadley Ctr, Exeter, Devon, England; [Scaife, Adam A.] Univ Exeter, Coll Engn Math & Phys Sci, Exeter, Devon, England",Washington State University; Columbia University; Met Office - UK; Hadley Centre; University of Exeter,"Singh, D (corresponding author), Washington State Univ, Sch Environm, Vancouver, WA 98686 USA.;Singh, D (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY 10964 USA.",deepti.singh@wsu.edu,,"Ting, Mingfang/0000-0002-4302-4614",Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory Fellowship; Office of Naval Research [N00014-12-1-0911]; NSF [AGS 12-43204]; Joint UK DECC/DEFRA Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme [GA01101],Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory Fellowship; Office of Naval Research(Office of Naval Research); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Joint UK DECC/DEFRA Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme,"Climate Prediction Center U.S. Unified Precipitation data provided by the NOAA/OAR/ESRL PSD, Boulder, Colorado, USA, from their Web site at https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/.We thank Bor-Ting Jong, David DeWitt, and Daniel Swain for helpful discussions.

The SWCF biases are shown to induce surface temperature anomalies localized in the midlatitudes, and are significantly correlated with the mean latitude of the eddy-driven jet, with a negative SWCF bias corresponding to an equatorward jet latitude bias. Aquaplanet model experiments are performed to demonstrate that the jet latitude biases are primarily induced by the midlatitude SWCF anomalies, such that the jet moves toward (away from) regions of enhanced (reduced) temperature gradients.

We have investigated the sensitivity of the cold surface layer thickness to different forcing parameter!; and the causes for an observed thinning of the cold surface layer on Storglaciaren, northern Sweden, between 1989 and 2001 using a one-dimensional thermomechanical model and measurements of ice surface temperature, vertical velocity and net mass balance. Similarities between the spatial patterns of the cold surface layer, net mass balance and emergence velocity together with modelled high sensitivity to variations in emergence velocities suggest that the net ablation and vertical ice advection are the dominant forcing parameters. Results from transient model experiments suggest that the cold surface layer reaches a new equilibrium after a perturbation in the forcing within a few decades. No significant change in ice flow or mass balance has been observed at Storglaciaren in recent decades. Instead, art increase of VC in winter air temperature since the mid-1980s is probably the cause of the observed thinning of the cold surface layer. Increased winter temperatures at the ice surface result in a reduced formation rate of cold ice at the base of the cold surface layer and lead to a larger imbalance between net loss of ice at the surface and freezing of temperate ice at the cold-temperate transition surface. Model results indicate that the cold surface layer is more sensitive to changes in ice surface temperature in areas with lower emergence velocity, which explains the observed complex thinning pattern of the cold surface layer.","Stockholm Univ, Dept Phys Geog & Quaternary Geol, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; St Olaf Coll, Dept Phys, Northfield, MN 55057 USA; Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Sch Architecture Civil & Environ Engn, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland",Stockholm University; Saint Olaf College; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Pettersson, R (corresponding author), Stockholm Univ, Dept Phys Geog & Quaternary Geol, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",petterss@stolaf.edu,"Huwald, Hendrik/C-1746-2012; Huwald, Hendrik/S-3688-2019; Jansson, Peter/B-5761-2012","Huwald, Hendrik/0000-0003-3769-7342; Jansson, Peter/0000-0002-8832-8806",,,,,37,37,37,2,10,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0022-1430,1727-5652,,J GLACIOL,J.

Since the 1990s a number of publications have addressed the equilibrium hygroscopic uptake and the hygro-mechanical deformation of linen canvas, oil paint, animal glue, and ground paint. In order to visualise and quantify the dynamic behaviour of these materials combined in a painting mock-up or reconstruction, we have performed custom-designed experiments with neutron radiography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging. This paper reports how both techniques were used to obtain spatially and temporally resolved information on moisture content, during alternate exposure to high and low relative humidity, or in contact with liquids of varying water activities. We observed how the canvas, which is the dominant component in terms of volumetric moisture uptake, absorbs and dries rapidly, and, due to its low vapour resistance, allows for vapour transfer towards the ground layer. Moisture desorption was generally found to be faster than absorption. The presence of sizing glue leads to a local increase of moisture content. It was observed that lining a painting with an extra canvas results in a damping effect: i.e. absorption and drying are significantly slowed down. The results obtained by NMR are complementary to neutron radiography in that they allow accurate monitoring of water ingress in contact with a liquid reservoir. Quantitative results are in good agreement with adsorption isotherms. The findings can be used for risk analysis of paintings exposed to changing micro-climates or subjected to conservation treatments using water.

Besides a serious cup (transverse distortion), the panel featured an unusual longitudinal distortion, a bow, mostly originating from bending in the proximity of the middle cross beam. Because of its localized occurrence, bending appeared to be caused by the crossbeam somehow pushing on the walls of its channel. Thanks to the cooperation offered by the curator and the restorer, some non-damaging tests were performed to measure the distortions of the panel, with and without the cross beams, after conditioning it in different climates. Processing and analysis of the measurement results demonstrated that the bow of the panel increases as the wood moisture content decreases. This led to the conclusion that the bow is actually produced by forces exerted by the cross beam along the panel's length, according to a mechanism named thrust transformation. By this mechanism the cross beam partly transforms the panel's tendency towards cupping, into a bow distortion.","[Allegretti, Ottaviano] CNR IVALSA, I-38010 San Michele All Adige, Italy; [Fioravanti, Marco; Uzielli, Luca] Univ Florence, GESAAF, Florence, Italy; [Dionisi-Vici, Paolo] Metropolitan Museum Art, New York, NY 10028 USA",Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto per la Valorizzazione del Legno e delle Specie Arboree (IVALSA-CNR); University of Florence; Metropolitan Museum of Art,"Allegretti, O (corresponding author), CNR IVALSA, 75 Via Biasi, I-38010 San Michele All Adige, Italy.",allegretti@ivalsa.cnr.it,"Dionisi-Vici, Paolo/V-1426-2019; Dionisi-Vici, Paolo/G-3829-2011","Dionisi-Vici, Paolo/0000-0002-9692-9695; Dionisi-Vici, Paolo/0000-0002-9692-9695; Uzielli, Luca/0000-0002-0195-4936; Fioravanti, Marco/0000-0002-4590-5044; allegretti, ottaviano/0000-0003-1772-2205",,,,,9,6,6,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0039-3630,2047-0584,,STUD CONSERV,Stud.

The overall objective was to intercompare state-of-the-art and prototype atmospheric hygrometers with each other and with independent humidity standards under controlled conditions. This activity was conducted as a blind intercomparison with coordination by selected referees. The effort was motivated by persistent discrepancies found in atmospheric measurements involving multiple instruments operating on research aircraft and balloon platforms, particularly in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere, where water vapor reaches its lowest atmospheric values (less than 10 ppm). With the AIDA chamber volume of 84 m(3), multiple instruments analyzed air with a common water vapor mixing ratio, by extracting air into instrument flow systems, by locating instruments inside the chamber, or by sampling the chamber volume optically. The intercomparison was successfully conducted over 10 days during which pressure, temperature, and mixing ratio were systematically varied (50 to 500 hPa, 185 to 243 K, and 0.3 to 152 ppm). In the absence of an accepted reference instrument, the absolute accuracy of the instruments was not established. To evaluate the intercomparison, the reference value was taken to be the ensemble mean of a core subset of the measurements. For these core instruments, the agreement between 10 and 150 ppm of water vapor is considered good with variation about the reference value of about +/- 10% (+/- 1 sigma). In the region of most interest between 1 and 10 ppm, the core subset agreement is fair with variation about the reference value of +/- 20% (+/- 1 sigma). The upper limit of precision was also derived for each instrument from the reported data. The implication for atmospheric measurements is that the substantially larger differences observed during in-flight intercomparisons stem from other factors associated with the moving platforms or the non-laboratory environment. The success of AquaVIT-1 provides a template for future intercomparison efforts with water vapor or other species that are focused on improving the analytical quality of atmospheric measurements on moving platforms.","[Fahey, D.

LES is capable of providing benchmark solutions for parameterization development efforts. However, real small-scale atmospheric flows develop in heterogeneous and transient environments with locally varying vertical motions inherent to open multiscale interactive dynamical systems. These variations are often too subtle to detect them by state-of-the-art remote and in situ measurements, and are typically excluded from idealized simulations. The present study addresses the impact of weak [i.e., O(10(-6)) s(-1)] short-lived low-level large-scale convergence/divergence perturbations on continental shallow convection. The results show a strong response of shallow nonprecipitating convection to the applied weak large-scale dynamical forcing. Evolutions of CAPE, mean liquid water path, and cloud-top heights are significantly affected by the imposed convergence/divergence. In contrast, evolving cloud-base properties, such as the area coverage and mass flux, are only weakly affected. To contrast those impacts with microphysical sensitivity, the baseline simulations are perturbed assuming different observationally based cloud droplet number concentrations and thus different rainfall. For the tested range of microphysical perturbations, the imposed convergence/divergence provides significantly larger impact than changes in the cloud microphysics. Simulation results presented here provide a stringent test for convection parameterizations, especially important for large-scale models progressing toward resolving some nonhydrostatic effects.","[Kurowski, Marcin J.; Suselj, Kay; Teixeira, Joao] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Grabowski, Wojciech W.] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [Teixeira, Joao] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Joint Inst Reg Earth Syst Sci & Engn, Los Angeles, CA USA",California Institute of Technology; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL); National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Kurowski, MJ (corresponding author), CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",marcin.j.kurowski@jpl.nasa.gov,,,"National Aeronautics and Space Administration; NASA MAP Program; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Biological and Environmental Research, Earth System Modeling [DE-SC0019242]; ONR Marine Meteorology Program [N000141812432]; National Science Foundation Climate Process Team (CPT) Program [AGS 1916619]; National Science Foundation","National Aeronautics and Space Administration(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); NASA MAP Program(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Biological and Environmental Research, Earth System Modeling(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); ONR Marine Meteorology Program; National Science Foundation Climate Process Team (CPT) Program; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF))","The research was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

Rhino Cave is primarily a Late and Middle Stone Age site located at the Tsodilo Hills in the northwestern Kalahari Desert of Botswana. A secondary precipitate up to 10 cm thick covers many of the 544 cupules engraved into one wall of the cave; this precipitate or coating was removed from two of these depressions. The coatings consisted of calcium phosphate, presumably derived from bat guano or bird droppings above the hollows, that was overlain by calcium carbonate and then silica. Organic material in this precipitate provided minimum calibrated AMS C-14 ages of 6443 to 6204 cal. yr B. P. (5580 +/- 60 C-14 yr B. P.) for one depression, and 3000 to 2761 cal. yr B. P. (2830 +/- 50 C-14 yr B. P.) for the other. The AMS C-14 ages and paleoclimatic data recovered from the cupules are in agreement with the regional paleoclimatic sequence for the Holocene. Specifically, comparison with data from Etosha Pan in Namibia and the Makgadikgadi Pans in Botswana suggests that deposition of the coatings and associated organic matter occurred preferentially during three periods of increased moisture in the region at around 6200, 3700, and 1200 cal. yr B. P. The gradual change from phosphate at the base of the coatings to carbonate and then to silica suggests that the wet intervals were superposed on a long-term trend toward a drier climate in the late Holocene.

In recent years, the grounding line, which separates the grounded ice sheet from the floating ice shelf, has retreated by tens of kilometres(5). At present, the grounding line is crossing a retrograde bedrock slope that lies well below sea level, raising the possibility that the glacier is susceptible to the marine ice-sheet instability mechanism(6-8).

We used the state-of-the-art ECCO2-Darwin coupled ocean-biogeochemistry model to simulate the 2006-2013 period and investigate the impact of changing SIA on the CO2 uptake of the AO. We find that the mean annual CO2 sink of the AO is 153 +/- 14 TgC a(-1) and the CO2 sink decreased at a rate of 3.6 TgC a(-1) even though SIA decreased by 8 x 10(4) km(2) a(-1) over the same period. Extreme SIA loss in 2007 resulted in a 185.4 TgC CO2 sink, an increase similar to 20% over the 2006-2013 mean. In contrast, extreme SIA loss of 2012 resulted in a CO2 sink of the AO of only 146.3 TgC due to two main factors: (1) increased both wind speed and stratification in the Eastern Siberian Sea absorbing less CO2 and (2) decreased primary production and area of air-sea gas exchange in the Chukchi and Nordic Seas. Our model captures a trend of decreasing CO2 sink in most of the Chukchi Sea during fall but does not show the changes in winter CO2 sink in the Nordic and Barents Seas as previous independent studies have suggested. Our results indicate that future AO-atmosphere CO2 exchange will be determined by complex interplay of SIA and other environmental drivers. Plain Language Summary The seasonal process of melting and formation of sea-ice area (SIA) in the Arctic Ocean (AO) is a key factor to control the physical, chemical, and biological processes of the upper ocean. We used a numerical model to understand the potential consequences of two drastic events of SIA reduction in both 2007 and 2012. Our model simulations show that the biological and chemical responses of the AO were different when we compared 2007 versus 2012. In 2007, the severe reduction of SIA was followed by a large uptake of carbon dioxide (CO2 , as also expected from theory) due to the increase in ice-free area and to the enhanced photosynthetic activity. However, in 2012, the response was different due to several factors: (1) increased wind speed and decreased primary production in the Eastern Siberian Sea in the summer causing less CO2 uptake and (2) the increase in the SIA in the fall in the Chukchi sea and in the summer in the Nordic Seas (close to Greenland) inhibiting the air-sea gas CO2 exchange. All these processes, when combined together, yielded a reduced CO2 sink of the AO in 2012 when compared to 2007.","[Manizza, Manfredi] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, Geosci Res Div, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Menemenlis, Dimitris; Zhang, Hong; Miller, Charles E.] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego; Scripps Institution of Oceanography; California Institute of Technology; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL),"Manizza, M (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, Geosci Res Div, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",mmanizza@ucsd.edu,,,NASA Interdisciplinary Research in Earth Science (IDS) Program; National Aeronautics and Space Administration,NASA Interdisciplinary Research in Earth Science (IDS) Program; National Aeronautics and Space Administration(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)),"We sincerely thank Holger Brix for sharing the latest version of the ECCO2-Darwin model code and Junjie Liu for generating the CO<INF>2</INF> atmospheric concentration used to compute air-sea CO<INF>2</INF> fluxes.

In order to overcome these limitations and to improve the performance of solar thermal collectors, a different kind of heat transfer fluid can be proposed. This fluid is based on the exploitation of the latent heat of fusion/solidification of suspended particles, which change their state of aggregation at a micron scale, but maintain the liquid state of the fluid at a macroscopic scale. The so-called slurry phase materials, or PCS, are examples of this kind of material. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of such a concept, a numerical model of a PCS-based flat-plate solar thermal collector has been developed, presented and discussed. This model has been derived from the well-known Hottel-Whillier model, but several changes have been implemented so that a phase change of the heat transfer fluid can be handled, as well as the thermophysical properties of a non Newtonian fluid, such as those of a PCS. The paper presents the main and auxiliary equations that have been introduced to modify the Hottel-Whillier model. A numerical analysis conducted with the newly developed model is also presented in the paper. The aim of these simulations was to test the code and obtain a preliminary evaluation of the performance of the novel concept. Different (dynamic) boundary conditions (location, orientation, PCM concentration) were adopted to evaluate the performance of the PCS-based technology and compare it with that of a conventional solar thermal collector. The outcomes of the simulations have proved model robustness and the possibility of using it for preliminary analysis. It was also shown that the adoption of the PCS as a heat transfer fluid can lead to an increase in solar energy exploitation of different magnitude according to the climate. The greatest benefit can be achieved for cold climates. The limitations of the analysis (e.g. fixed, non-optimal flow rate) are also discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Soil organic carbon (SOC) fractionation helps us to understand better the response of SOC to changes in land use, management or climate. However, fractionation procedures are often poorly defined and there is little information available on their reproducibility in different laboratories. In a ring trial, we assessed the reproducibility of a SOC fractionation method introduced by Zimmermann et al. (2007). The isolated fractions were linked to the model pool sizes of the Rothamsted carbon model (RothC). We found significant differences between six laboratories for all five defined fractions in three different soils with coefficients of variation ranging from 14 to 138%. During ultrasonic dispersion, the output power (energy per unit time) was identified as an important factor controlling the distribution of SOC within these five fractions, while commonly only the output energy is standardized. The amount of water used to wet-sieve dispersed soil slurry significantly influenced the amount of extracted dissolved organic carbon (DOC). We therefore suggest using a fixed amount of power for ultrasonic dispersion (20W) and a minimum amount of water for wet sieving (2000ml). RothC pool sizes were predicted from the measured fractions and compared with RothC equilibrium pool size distributions. This model initialization using measured SOC fractions, however, led to an over-estimation of stable RothC SOC pools when compared with pool size distributions derived from RothC equilibrium runs under a bare fallow soil model simulation. To improve the isolation of particulate organic matter from stable mineral-bound organic matter, we suggest that the density should be increased from 1.8 to 2.0gcm(-3) in the density fractionation step. We formulated a modified fractionation procedure, which aims specifically to enhance reproducibility across laboratories and to improve the match of the isolated SOC fractions with RothC's SOC pools.","[Poeplau, C.; Don, A.] Thuenen Inst Agr Climate Res, Bundesallee 50, D-38106 Braunschweig, Germany; [Dondini, M.] Univ Aberdeen, Sch Biol Sci, Inst Biol & Environm Sci, Aberdeen AB24 3UU, Scotland; [Leifeld, J.] Agroscope Reckenholz Tanikon Res Stn ART, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland; [Nemo, R.] INRA Clermont Ferrand, UREP 5, Clermont Ferrand, France; [Schumacher, J.] Univ Jena, Inst Stochast, D-07751 Jena, Germany; [Senapati, N.] Univ New England, Sch Environm & Rural Sci, Armidale, NSW 2351, Australia; [Wiesmeier, M.] Tech Univ Munich, Wissensch Zentrum Weihenstephan Ernahrung Landnut, Lehrstuhl Bodenkunde, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany",Johann Heinrich von Thunen Institute; University of Aberdeen; Swiss Federal Research Station Agroscope; Swiss Federal Research Station for Agroecology & Agriculture; INRAE; Friedrich Schiller University of Jena; University of New England; Technical University of Munich,"Poeplau, C (corresponding author), Thuenen Inst Agr Climate Res, Bundesallee 50, D-38106 Braunschweig, Germany.",christopher.poeplau@ti.bund.de,"Leifeld, Jens/A-3298-2014; Wiesmeier, Martin/N-3066-2014; Leifeld, Jens/GYR-0349-2022; Don, Axel/A-1618-2009; Dondini, Marta/E-8240-2017; Senapati, Nimai/R-4353-2017","Leifeld, Jens/0000-0002-7245-9852; Wiesmeier, Martin/0000-0003-3981-5461; Leifeld, Jens/0000-0002-7245-9852; Don, Axel/0000-0001-7046-3332; Dondini, Marta/0000-0002-5754-5939; Senapati, Nimai/0000-0002-0238-6694; Poeplau, Christopher/0000-0003-3108-8810",FP7 project GHG-Europe [244122],FP7 project GHG-Europe,This study was financed by the FP7 project GHG-Europe (grant no. 244122).,,33,38,41,6,126,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1351-0754,1365-2389,,EUR J SOIL SCI,Eur.

Advances in modelling system result in the formulation of numerous forest modelling approaches to provide an estimation of forests services. One such useful and straightforward forest modelling approach is process-based modelling, relying on physiological processes and biophysical parameters of forest ecosystems. It is based on parametric calculations and allometric equations, delivering crucial outputs for forest management. The dynamic 3-PG (Physiological Principles in Predicting Growth) is a process-based model (PBM) based on an ecosystem physiological process-based modelling approach. The various applications and flexible nature of the 3-PG model have resulted in its adoption and utilization over several regions of the world. The 3-PGS (Physiological Principles in Predicting Growth with Satellite) model is a modified and spatial version of the 3-PG model that took advantages of remote sensing & GIS (Geographical Information System) for estimation of biophysical variables like FAPAR (Fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation), LAI (Leaf area index), and Canopy water content (CWC), which are tedious and laborious to calculate manually. The integration of remote sensing & GIS with PBMs offers insights to predict forest biomass and productivity at a regional level. Also, coupling of the 3-PG/3-PGS model with other modelling and statistical approaches in a GIS environment provides insights into the prediction of species distributions and potential disturbances due to climatic changes. The 3-PG model was originally designed for relatively homogenous forests; but with the recent development, the 3-PGmix has extended its use to mixed species forests. In this review, we have tried to emphasize the general overview, structure, applications, and efficacy of the process-based 3-PG model for forest management. In future, forests and their ecosystem services are expected to be rigorously influenced by climatic variations. Therefore, it is important to understand the role and effectiveness of the forest growth model 3-PG under the influence of climate change. The 3-PG model performs well for a diverse range of conditions for many forest types and species, and could be integrated with other models and approaches in order to widen its functions and applications. Areas such as Fertility Rating (FR), sensitivity and uncertainty of outputs to the model inputs in the 3-PG model requires attention to remove the weaker side, and to increase the effectiveness and accuracy of model outputs. In addition, the model performance can be improved by calculating its parameters from the population of interest, rather than using default values or values from extant literature. Furthermore, high-resolution remote sensing datasets and accurate input field data could increase the accuracy of the 3-PG/3-PGS model predictions at a broad regional level. In general, the simple forest growth model 3-PG delivers practical outputs, which are directly used in forest management. Additionally, the functions and applications of the 3-PG/3-PGS/3-PGmix model could be explored to deal with the impacts of climate change on forests and to ensure the sustainable management of forests.","[Gupta, Rajit; Sharma, Laxmi Kant] Cent Univ Rajasthan, Dept Environm Sci, NH 8, Ajmer 305817, Rajasthan, India",Central University of Rajasthan (CURAJ),"Sharma, LK (corresponding author), Cent Univ Rajasthan, Dept Environm Sci, NH 8, Ajmer 305817, Rajasthan, India.",2017phdes03@curaj.ac.in; laxmikant_evs@curaj.ac.in,"Gupta, Rajit/GPG-1791-2022; SHARMA, LAXMIKANT/I-4500-2015; Sharma, LaxmiKant/B-8931-2019","SHARMA, LAXMIKANT/0000-0003-2911-2893; ",University Grants Commission (UGC) under UGC NET-JRF fellowship [3551/(NET-JAN2017)],"University Grants Commission (UGC) under UGC NET-JRF fellowship(University Grants Commission, India)",The author wishes to acknowledge the support from the University Grants Commission (UGC) for providing funds under UGC NET-JRF fellowship (Ref no. 3551/(NET-JAN2017).

Consequently, earlier papers reported a soil contamination in the per mille range inside the former factory wall (88 m x 106 m) and up to 10 mg/kg of DDT in the surroundings in 2005-2007. The site within the factory wall was remonitored systematically in 2011 to complement the earlier data as a prerequisite for remediation, to put them in exposure context in a population developing area, and to suggest and evaluate the optimal remediation technique for the site. The contamination was drastically higher than the earlier published data, and the sum of DDT and its metabolites (I DDT) pound was up to 65 % in the soil. Grasses, shrubs, and trees growing in this severely contaminated site had 50-450 mg/kg(dw) of I DDT pound. Thus, people living nearby and husbandry as well as wild animals are heavily exposed to DDT. The semiarid climate favors wind drift and deposition of the pollutant. Additionally, DDT from products of herbivore animals feeding on the contaminated plants will enter the food web. To overcome the exposure and distribution of the DDT, the site within the factory wall was capped with 1.5 m of soil. This remediation technique represents the easiest and least expensive solution. Nevertheless, DDT can still evaporate or leach, and groundwater can rise in this flood-prone area and thereby become contaminated, especially because a binding layer is missing.","[Younas, Asma; Rehman, Shafique ur] Univ Peshawar, Dept Environm Sci, Peshawar 25000, Kpk, Pakistan; [Hilber, Isabel; Bucheli, Thomas D.] Agroscope Reckenholz Tanikon Res Stn ART, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland; [Khwaja, Mahmood] Sustainable Dev Policy Inst, Islamabad 44000, Pakistan",University of Peshawar; Swiss Federal Research Station Agroscope; Swiss Federal Research Station for Agroecology & Agriculture; Sustainable Development Policy Institute - Pakistan,"Hilber, I (corresponding author), Agroscope Reckenholz Tanikon Res Stn ART, Reckenholzstr 191, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland.",isabel.hilber@art.admin.ch,,"Bucheli, Thomas D./0000-0001-9971-3104",Swiss National Science Foundation,Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission),"The authors thank the Swiss National Science Foundation for funding this Joint Research Project between Pakistan and Switzerland.

This method has the great advantages of reducing the amount of industrial residues and creating valuable materials by incorporating CO2. Waste gypsum, industrial waste including flue gas desulfurization (FGD) gypsum (25.27-53.40 wt% of CaO), and phosphogypsum (30.50-39.06 wt% of CaO) can be used for direct MC (conversion rate up to 96%). Mineral carbonation converts waste gypsum into calcium carbonate (CaCO3), which can be recycled during desulfurization. Furthermore, ammonium sulfate ((NH4)(2)SO4), which is used as a fertilizer, can be prepared as a by-product when the carbonation reaction is performed using ammonia (NH3) as a base. In this study, recent progress in the carbonation kinetics and preparation of CaCO3 using FGD gypsum and phosphogypsum with NH3 was investigated. Temperature, CO2 partial pressure, CO2 flow rate, and NH3 concentration were reviewed as factors affecting carbonation kinetics and efficiency. The factors influencing the polymorphs of the prepared CaCO3 were also reviewed and summarized. A state-of-the-art bench-scale plant study was also proposed. In addition, economic feasibility was investigated based on a bench-scale study to analyze the future applicability of this technology.","[Kang, Chan-Ung; Jo, Hwanju] Korea Inst Geosci & Mineral Resources KIGAM, Climate Change Response Div, 124 Gwahak Ro, Daejeon 34132, South Korea; [Ji, Sang-Woo] Korea Inst Geosci & Mineral Resources KIGAM, Policy & Planning Div, 124 Gwahak Ro, Daejeon 34132, South Korea",Korea Institute of Geoscience & Mineral Resources (KIGAM); Korea Institute of Geoscience & Mineral Resources (KIGAM),"Jo, H (corresponding author), Korea Inst Geosci & Mineral Resources KIGAM, Climate Change Response Div, 124 Gwahak Ro, Daejeon 34132, South Korea.",cukang1001@kigam.re.kr; swji@kigam.re.kr; chohwanju@kigam.re.kr,"Kang, Chan-Ung/GQP-3110-2022","Jo, Hwanju/0000-0001-6866-8830; Ji, Sangwoo/0000-0003-0071-2713",Korea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation and Planning (KETEP) - Korea government (MOTIE) [20214710100030],Korea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation and Planning (KETEP) - Korea government (MOTIE),"This work was supported by the Korea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation and Planning (KETEP) grant funded by the Korea government (MOTIE) (20214710100030, Demonstration of mineral carbonation using FGD gypsum and development of CDM methodology).",,77,1,1,24,29,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,APR,2022,8,,,,,,4436,10.3390/su14084436,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14084436,,,13,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,0S3TB,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000786198800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

To overcome this shortcoming, LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3-delta (LNF) has been developed as an alternative cathode material owing to its superior chemical stability in Cr environments. In this study, we develop a hybrid electrochemical deposition technique to fabricate a nanostructured LNF-gadolinium-doped ceria (GDC) (n-LNF-GDC) cathode with enhanced active reaction sites for the oxygen reduction reaction. For this purpose, Fe and Ni cations are co-deposited onto an electrically conductive carbon nanotube-modified GDC backbone by electroplating, whereas La cations are successively deposited through a chemically assisted electrodeposition method. The proposed method involves a low-temperature (900 degrees C) calcination step of electrodeposited cations, which avoids the need of fabricating a GDC diffusion barrier layer which is otherwise needed to avoid the formation of insulating phases (e.g., La2Zr2O7) when fabricating by conventional high-temperature >= 1000 degrees C) sintering. Scanning electron microscopy images reveal a unique nanofibrous structure of n-LNF-GDC, which is believed to play an instrumental role in enhancing the electrochemical characteristics by increasing the active triple-phase boundaries. An anode-supported SOFC with the n-LNF-GDC cathode showed the superior performance of 0.984 W cm(-2) at an intermediate temperature of 750 degrees C as compared to the power densities of 0.495 and 0.874 W cm(-2) produced by LNF-GDC and state-of-the-art La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF)-GDC composite cathodes fabricated by conventional sintering. A short-term accelerated Cr-poisoning durability test indicated good electrochemical stability of n-LNF-GDC, whereas LSCF exhibited severe degradation. The electrochemically engineered nanostructured n-LNF-GDC can serve as an effective cathode for SOFCs to achieve high performance and long-term durability.","[Shaur, Ahmad; Rehman, Saeed Ur; Kim, Hye-Sung; Song, Rak-Hyun; Lim, Tak-Hyoung; Hong, Jong-Eun; Park, Seok-Joo; Lee, Seung-Bok] Korea Inst Energy Res, Fuel Cell Lab, New & Renewable Energy Res Div, Daejeon 34129, South Korea; [Shaur, Ahmad; Song, Rak-Hyun; Lim, Tak-Hyoung; Park, Seok-Joo; Lee, Seung-Bok] Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Adv Energy & Technol, Daejeon 34113, South Korea",Korea Institute of Energy Research (KIER); University of Science & Technology (UST),"Lee, SB (corresponding author), Korea Inst Energy Res, Fuel Cell Lab, New & Renewable Energy Res Div, Daejeon 34129, South Korea.;Lee, SB (corresponding author), Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Adv Energy & Technol, Daejeon 34113, South Korea.",sblee@kier.re.kr,,"Shaur, Ahmad/0000-0002-3963-5818; Lee, Seungbok/0000-0001-9939-0325","Korean government (Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning); Technology Development Program to Solve Climate Changes of the National Research Foundation (NRF) - Korea government (Ministry of Science and ICT) [NRF-2016M1A2A2940138, NRF-2017M1A2A2044926]; Korea Institute of Energy Research [B9-2412]","Korean government (Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning)(Korean Government); Technology Development Program to Solve Climate Changes of the National Research Foundation (NRF) - Korea government (Ministry of Science and ICT); Korea Institute of Energy Research","This work was supported by the Korean government (Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning) and also by the Technology Development Program to Solve Climate Changes of the National Research Foundation (NRF) grant funded by the Korea government (Ministry of Science and ICT) (grants number NRF-2016M1A2A2940138, NRF-2017M1A2A2044926).

This event is known as the Eastern Mediterranean Transient (EMT). We report here a connection between EMT and specific atmospheric conditions which created anomalously large buoyancy fluxes from the Aegean Sea during winters 1991/1992 and 1992/1993 (the enhanced EMT winters). We use newly available, state of the art datasets with high space and time resolution and show that atypical cyclonic activity in the central Mediterranean versus the eastern basin produced the enhanced atmospheric forcing which intensified the EMT. An abatement of the frequency of cyclones in the central Mediterranean during 1992/1993 drastically reduced the northward advection of warm air over the Aegean Sea compared to more typical years, while an increase in the frequency of cyclones in the eastern Mediterranean enhanced the southward advection of cold air over the Aegean Sea, especially during 1991/1992. These changes significantly increased buoyancy flux losses from the Aegean Sea during the enhanced EMT winters, intensifying deep water production. Citation: Romanski, J., A. Romanou, M.

A life cycle assessment approach was adopted to evaluate the cumulative energy demand and climate change impact of using contaminated biomass for energy generation under 4 different scenarios. The industrial hemp supply chain scenarios include analyses of different subsystems (industrial hemp cultivation, seed processing, anaerobic digestion and biomass incineration for electricity generation) and different contaminated products harvested (seeds and straw, dried whole industrial hemp and fresh biomass for silage). As confirmed by a Monte Carlo simulation, the two scenarios that included anaerobic digestion and/or incineration of the contaminated biomass were the most energy-efficient and environmentally sustainable systems and obtained primary energy savings of 25.3 and 36.8 GJ ha(-1), respectively, while avoiding emissions of 579 and 641 kg CO(2)e per reclaimed hectare, respectively. These results demonstrate the great potential of using contaminated areas for bioenergy (electricity) production while decreasing the exploitation of natural resources and pollutant emissions into the environment.

The reliability and extended length of the in situ data collected by a large-scale array of buoys deployed during the Subduction Experiment make this dataset particularly well suited to providing such an assessment. The Subduction Experiment was designed to explore the process by which the mixed layer waters of the eastern subtropical North Atlantic are incorporated into the top of the main thermocline. To this end, an array of five buoys was maintained between 18 degrees-33 degrees N and 22 degrees-34 degrees W from June 1991 to June 1993. In situ dynamic, thermodynamic, and radiometric measurements are utilized along with a state-of-the-art bulk flux algorithm to estimate the time-dependent surface forcing at each of the buoys. The resulting air-sea fluxes are compared to similar quantities offered by the Isemer and Hasse (Bunker) and the Wright-Oberhuber Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set climatological datasets, and global model forecasts from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts and the National Centers for Environmental Prediction. Some substantial differences are exhibited between the surface forcing components garnered from the Subduction Experiment buoys and those of the climatological and model products. The mean net heat flux from the Subduction Experiment buoys exhibits a qualitatively similar spatial gradient to that of the climatological and model products across the array, but generally reflects a greater oceanic heat gain in summer and a smaller oceanic heat loss in winter. On shorter timescales, the models' inability to replicate the hear and radiometric fluxes of the buoys is reflected in large mean standard deviations of the differences between the buoy and model fluxes at 6-h intervals. Some of the observed differences are attributed to differences in bulk formulas and/or differences in the mean variables from which the bulk air-sea fluxes are derived, while others are simply an artifact of the spatial and temporal filtering inherent within the climatological and model products.","WOODS HOLE OCEANOG INST,WOODS HOLE,MA 02543",Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution,,,,,,,,,47,44,46,0,1,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693",0894-8755,,,J CLIMATE,J.

Over the last decade, ambient measurements of refractory black carbon (rBC) mass concentrations based on laser-induced incandescence (LII) have become more common, mostly due to the development of the Single Particle Soot Photometer (SP2) instrument. In this work, EC and rBC mass concentration measurements from field campaigns across several background European sites (Palaiseau, Bologna, Cabauw and Melpitz) have been collated and examined to identify the similarities and differences between BC mass concentrations measured by the two techniques. All EC concentration measurements in PM2:5 were performed with the EUSAAR-2 thermal-optical protocol. All rBC concentration measurements were performed with SP2 instruments calibrated with the same calibration material as recommended in the literature. The observed values of median rBC-to-EC mass concentration ratios on the single-campaign level were 0.53, 0.65, 0.97, 1.20 and 1.29, respectively, and the geometric standard deviation (GSD) was 1.5 when considering all data points from all five campaigns. This shows that substantial systematic bias between these two quantities occurred during some campaigns, which also contributes to the large overall GSD. Despite considerable variability in BC properties and sources across the whole dataset, it was not possible to clearly assign reasons for discrepancies to one or the other method, both known to have their own specific limitations and uncertainties. However, differences in the particle size range covered by these two methods were identified as one likely reason for discrepancies. Overall, the observed correlation between rBC and EC mass reveals a linear relationship with a constant ratio, thus providing clear evidence that both methods essentially quantify the same property of atmospheric aerosols, whereas systematic differences in measured absolute values by up to a factor of 2 can occur. This finding for the level of agreement between two current state-of-the-art techniques has important implications for studies based on BC mass concentration measurements, for example for the interpretation of uncertainties in inferred BC mass absorption coefficient values, which are required for modeling the radiative forcing of BC. Homogeneity between BC mass determination techniques is also very important for moving towards a routine BC mass measurement for air quality regulations.","[Pileci, Rosaria E.; Modini, Robin L.; Berto, Michele; Yuan, Jinfeng; Corbin, Joel C.; Baltensperger, Urs; Gysel-Beer, Martin] Paul Scherrer Inst PSI, Lab Atmospher Chem, CH-5232 Villigen, Switzerland; [Marinoni, Angela] Italian Natl Res Council CNR ISAC, Inst Atmospher Sci & Climate, Via Gobetti 101, I-40129 Bologna, Italy; [Henzing, Bas; Moerman, Marcel M.] Netherlands Org Appl Sci Res TNO, NL-3584 Utrecht, Netherlands; [Putaud, Jean P.] European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr JRC, I-21027 Ispra, Italy; [Spindler, Gerald; Wehner, Birgit; Mueller, Thomas; Tuch, Thomas] Leibniz Inst Tropospher Res TROPOS, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany; [Trentini, Arianna] Reg Agcy Prevent Environm & Energy, I-40122 Bologna, Italy; [Zanatta, Marco] Helmholtz Ctr Polar & Marine Res, Alfred Wegener Inst, D-27515 Bremerhaven, Germany; [Corbin, Joel C.] Natl Res Council Canada, Metrol Res Ctr, Ottawa, ON K1A 0R6, Canada","Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Paul Scherrer Institute; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Scienze dell'Atmosfera e del Clima (ISAC-CNR); Netherlands Organization Applied Science Research; European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site; Leibniz Institut fur Tropospharenforschung (TROPOS); Helmholtz Association; Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar & Marine Research; National Research Council Canada","Modini, RL; Gysel-Beer, M (corresponding author), Paul Scherrer Inst PSI, Lab Atmospher Chem, CH-5232 Villigen, Switzerland.",robin.modini@psi.ch; martin.gysel@psi.ch,"Modini, Rob L./AAF-6036-2019; Gysel-Beer, Martin/C-3843-2008; Wehner, Birgit/C-2650-2014","Modini, Rob L./0000-0002-2982-1369; Gysel-Beer, Martin/0000-0002-7453-1264; Wehner, Birgit/0000-0003-0611-4466; Corbin, Joel C./0000-0002-2584-9137; Henzing, Bas/0000-0001-6456-8189; Pileci, Rosaria Erika/0000-0002-4104-4718","ERC [ERC-CoG-615922-BLACARAT]; ACTRIS-2 project (EU H2020-INFRAIA-2014-2015) [654109]; ACTRIS-2 project (Swiss State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation) [15.0159-1]; Transnational Access scheme of the ACTRIS-2 project; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) within the Transregional Collaborative Research Centre ArctiC Amplification: Climate Relevant Atmospheric and SurfaCe Processes and Feedback Mechanisms (AC)3 [268020496 -TRR 172]","ERC(European Research Council (ERC)European Commission); ACTRIS-2 project (EU H2020-INFRAIA-2014-2015); ACTRIS-2 project (Swiss State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation); Transnational Access scheme of the ACTRIS-2 project; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) within the Transregional Collaborative Research Centre ArctiC Amplification: Climate Relevant Atmospheric and SurfaCe Processes and Feedback Mechanisms (AC)3(German Research Foundation (DFG))","This work received financial support from the ERC (grant ERC-CoG-615922-BLACARAT) and from the ACTRIS-2 project (EU H2020-INFRAIA-2014-2015, grant agreement no. 654109, and Swiss State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation, contract number 15.0159-1).

As regards the deployment, use and system integration of these technologies, spatio-temporal modeling of PV power production and EV charging is of importance for several purposes such as urban planning and power grid design and operation. There is an abundance of studies and reviews on modeling of PV power production and EV charging available in the literature. However, there is a lack of studies that review the opportunities for combined modeling of the power consumption and production associated with these technologies. This paper aims to fill this research gap by presenting a review of previous research regarding modeling of spatio-temporal PV power production and charging load of EVs. The paper provides a summary of previous work in both fields and the combination of the fields. Finally, research gaps that need to be further explored are identified. This survey revealed some research gaps that need to be further addressed. Improving the accuracy of PV power production ramp-rate modeling in addition to quantifying the aggregate clear-sky index on city-scale are two priorities for the PV potential studies. For the EV charging load models, differences in model assumptions, such as charging locations, charging powers and charging profiles, need to be studied more extensively. Moreover, there is an imminent need for metering the load of charging stations. This is essential in developing accurate models and time series forecasting techniques. For studies exploring both the PV and EV impacts, local weak points in a spatial network need to be discovered, especially for the city-scale studies. Cooperation between eminent researchers in the PV and EV fields might propagate state-of-the-art models from the separate fields to the combined studies.","[Shepero, Mahmoud; Munkhammar, Joakim; Widen, Joakim] Uppsala Univ, Dept Engn Sci, POB 534, SE-75121 Uppsala, Sweden; [Bishop, Justin D.

J,"Gullo, P",,,,"Gullo, Paride",,,Impact and quantification of various individual thermodynamic improvements for transcritical R744 supermarket refrigeration systems based on advanced exergy analysis,ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,Advanced exergetic analysis; CO2; Exergy destruction; Overfed evaporator; Parallel compression; Two-phase ejector,,"Climate change mitigation actions have led transcritical R744 refrigeration systems to take center stage in supermarket applications worldwide. Various measures aimed at making these solutions highly performing in any climate context, in fact, have been developed in the last few years. However, their benefits have been evaluated and quantified almost uniquely with the aid of conventional tools, e.g. energy and environmental assessments. Therefore, in this work the most power thermodynamic tool for such a purpose, i.e. the advanced exergy analysis, was applied to the state-of-the-art transcritical R744 supermarket refrigeration systems for the first time ever. Three advanced solutions, namely R744 unit with parallel compression and a R744 system using parallel compression and overfed evaporators with and without two-phase ejectors, were selected in addition to two baselines, being conventional and improved basic R744 units. The investigation was based on the outdoor temperature of 40.C and operating conditions derived from field measurements. The results obtained suggested that the conventional basic R744 unit features total irreversibilities of 194.49 kW and total unavoidable irreversibilities of 81.96 kW, whereas total irreversibilities and total unavoidable irreversibilities respectively amounted to 168.80 kW and 81.44 kW for the improved basic R744 system. As parallel compression was considered, potential reductions from 143.30 kW down to 67.20 kW, i.e. approximately 18% lower in comparison with the conventional basic unit and the improved basic system, were assed. The use of overfed evaporators was found to lead to potential decrements in total irreversibilities down to 63.79 kW, which were around 5% lower in comparison with parallel compression and 22% lower than with the conventional basic unit and the improved basic system. In addition, the outcomes associated with advanced exergy analysis implementation revealed the need to adopt two-phase ejectors as well as more efficient parallel compressors. The first measure would permit decreasing the total irreversibilities potentially from 115.04 kW down to 44.35 kW, resulting in decrement by about 46% compared to conventional and improved basic R744 systems, 34% in relation to the unit with parallel compressors and 30.5% over the solution with parallel compressors and overfed evaporators. Also, if 10% more efficient parallel compressors had been available, total irreversibilities, total unavoidable irreversibilities and total avoidable irreversibilities of the solution with two-phase ejectors would have been further reducible by 9.3%, 2.6% and 13.5%, respectively. It could be concluded that ejector-based transcritical R744 supermarket refrigeration systems possibly with high performing parallel compressors are capable of providing great thermodynamic performance at high sink temperatures. In addition, the vapour ejectors were found to be responsible for 22.9% of the total avoidable inefficiencies. These irreversibilities could be decremented by almost uniquely enhancing the performance of the ejectors themselves. However, unlike the results derived from conventional energy and environmental analyses, the outcomes of the advanced exergy methodology did not reveal a significant contribution on the part of the overfed evaporators to the thermodynamic performance enhancement of transcritical R744 supermarket refrigerating plants.","[Gullo, Paride] Tech Univ Denmark DTU, Dept Mech Engn, Nils Koppels Alle,Bldg 403, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark",Technical University of Denmark,"Gullo, P (corresponding author), Tech Univ Denmark DTU, Dept Mech Engn, Nils Koppels Alle,Bldg 403, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark.",parigul@mek.dtu.dk,"Gullo, Paride/A-8720-2019","Gullo, Paride/0000-0001-9256-875X",,,,,43,13,13,0,7,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0196-8904,1879-2227,,ENERG CONVERS MANAGE,Energy Conv.

How can we restore the natural balance? If cyberspace did not exist without electricity, humanity could not survive without water. It is possible to take advantage of using electric grid for helping improve water resources. Transmission towers' structure with an additional structural reinforcement could provide support to a network of artificial clouds made of light galvanized steel bars and strings, nebulizers system and silver iodide canyons. Under these clouds there are closed and open water reservoirs with shade balls depending on topography, climate and soil conditions and they are connected from mountains to the city. Electric lines are much like water pipes. In the case of transmission lines, the higher the voltage, the more electricity that can be transmitted, just like a wide water pipe can carry a larger volume of water. Electrical transmission lines operate at high voltages and carry large amounts of electricity over long distances. New water networks would make use of topography, soil permeability and existing infrastructure. These micro-clouds are also important to reduce fire risk, one of the consequences of droughts. Nature's endorsement of tensegrity structures are efficient because per unit mass, spider fibber is the strongest natural fibber and these structures are transferrable from nano-to mega scale. This is a great challenge to develop scientific procedures to create smart tensegrity structures that can regulate the flux of water resources, as well as thermal, mechanical and electrical energy in a material system by proper choice of material, geometry and controls.","[Jorge, Cristina] Alcala de Henares Univ, Sch Architecture, Alcala De Henares, Spain",Universidad de Alcala,"Jorge, C (corresponding author), Alcala de Henares Univ, Sch Architecture, Alcala De Henares, Spain.",,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,4,LATVIA UNIV AGRICULTURE-LATVIJAS LAUKSAIMNIECIBAS UNIV,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",2255-8632,2255-8640,,LANDSC ARCHIT ART,Landsc.

PyRQA overcomes their limitations by conducting the RQA computations in a highly parallel manner. Building on the OpenCL framework, PyRQA leverages the computing capabilities of a variety of parallel hardware architectures, such as GPU5. The underlying computing approach partitions the RQA computations and enables to employ multiple compute devices at the same time.

However, long-term yield simulation is often regarded as a weakness of such versatile models. In this context, we present a multiple response evaluation of the modular, process-based forest growth model MoBiLE-PDT based on mensurational data from 38 permanent sample plots in commercial Eucalyptus globulus plantations in Australia followed from establishment to 8 years of stand age. MoBiLE-PDT is based on the PnET-N-DNDC model and considers nitrogen availability and drought stress dynamically in dependence on tree and stand properties as well as on climate and deposition. New tree dimensions are calculated directly from carbon allocated to sapwood and mortality is derived from stand density. Towards the end of the rotation, model efficiency E was 0.58 for stand volume (m(3) ha(-1)) and 0.54 for aboveground biomass (t C ha(-1)). In a comparison with similar forest growth models evaluated against the same data only one had a better model efficiency, whereas MoBiLE-PDT was the most versatile model for the analyses of ecosystem services. Due to its modular structure, further model extensions for more ecological applications are easily possible.","[Miehle, Peter; Arndt, Stefan K.] Univ Melbourne, Dept Forest & Ecosyst Sci, Richmond, Vic 3121, Australia; [Grote, Ruediger] Forschungszentrum Karlsuhe, IMK IFU, Garmisch Partenkirchen, Germany; [Battaglia, Michael] CSIRO Forest Biosci, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Battaglia, Michael; Feikema, Paul M.] Cooperat Res Ctr Forestry, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Feikema, Paul M.] Univ Melbourne, Dept Forest & Ecosyst Sci, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia",University of Melbourne; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); University of Melbourne,"Miehle, P (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Dept Forest & Ecosyst Sci, 500 Yarra Blvd, Richmond, Vic 3121, Australia.",pmiehle@unimelb.edu.au,"Grote, Rüdiger/A-7350-2013; Battaglia, MIchael/A-5545-2011; Feikema, Paul/H-8007-2012; Arndt, Stefan/G-5021-2013","Grote, Rüdiger/0000-0001-6893-6890; Battaglia, MIchael/0000-0003-0144-5442; Arndt, Stefan/0000-0001-7086-9375; Feikema, Paul/0000-0002-0993-282X",DFG-Forschergruppe [FOR 788],DFG-Forschergruppe(German Research Foundation (DFG)),This study was funded by the Victorian Greenhouse Strategy and supported by the DFG-Forschergruppe FOR 788: 'Competitive Mechanisms of Water and Nitrogen Partitioning in Beech-Dominated Deciduous Forests'.,,79,15,18,0,25,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1612-4669,,,EUR J FOREST RES,Eur.

It is critical for estimating various land use changes and their ecological effects, but the previous studies have failed to decouple the respective and the combined effects of different land use changes on ecosystem services. Net primary productivity (NPP) could be used to indicate many ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration and storage. Here, we employed a light use efficiency model to estimate the spatial and temporal dynamics of NPP in the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) area from 2000 to 2015, and designed four scenarios to analyze the relative roles of afforestation, urbanization and storing water on NPP dynamics. Our results documented that terrestrial NPP of the TGR area increased from 547.40 gC center dot m(-2) to 629.96 gC center dot m(-2), and carbon sequestration capacities were 31.66 TgC (1Tg = 10(12)g) and 36.79 TgC in 2000 and 2015, respectively. Climate change and land use change both could contribute to carbon sequestration with 4.08 TgC and 1.05 TgC. Among these land use changes, only afforestation could sequester carbon with 2.04 TgC, while urbanization-induced and impoundment-induced emissions were 0.12 TgC and 0.32 TgC, respectively, and other land use changes also could release 0.55 TgC of carbon. This finding suggested that although positive and negative environmental effects happened simultaneously over the past decades, green infrastructure could effectively offset the carbon emissions from urbanization and storing water in the TGR area, which provides some fundamental supports for further ecological restoration and contributes to empowering land use policies towards carbon sequestration and storage at the regional scale.","[Liao, Qipeng; Wang, Zhe] China Univ Geosci, Sch Arts & Commun, Wuhan 430078, Peoples R China; [Liao, Qipeng] Univ Barcelona, Fac Fine Art, Barcelona 08028, Spain; [Huang, Chunbo] China Univ Geosci, Res Ctr Spatial Planning & Human Environm Syst Si, Sch Geog & Informat Engn, Wuhan 430078, Peoples R China",China University of Geosciences; University of Barcelona; China University of Geosciences,"Huang, CB (corresponding author), China Univ Geosci, Res Ctr Spatial Planning & Human Environm Syst Si, Sch Geog & Informat Engn, Wuhan 430078, Peoples R China.",liaoqp@cug.edu.cn; 18222933115@163.com; huangchunbo@cug.edu.cn,,"Huang, Chunbo/0000-0001-6222-215X",Natural Science Foundation of China [42001218]; National Social Science Fund of China [19BG133],Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Social Science Fund of China,This work is sponsored by the Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant number 42001218) and the National Social Science Fund of China (Grant number 19BG133).,,54,12,12,2,17,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

The determination of the Village Regulation is an elaboration of the various authorities which are owned by the Village which refers to the provisions of the higher legislation. As a legal product, Village Regulation should not conflict with the higher regulations and should not harm the public interest, or the general interest as mentioned in Act Number 6 2014 on Villages which are: a. the disruption of communal harmony; b. the disruption of access to public services; c. the disruption of public order and tranquillity; d. the disruption of economic activities to improve the welfare of village communities; and e. the discrimination against tribe, religion, belief, race, intergroup, and gender. Village Regulations govern the village authority based on the right of origin and village local-scale authority. The implementation is supervised by the village communities and Village Consultative Body. It is intended to make the implementation of the Village Regulation always monitored continuously by local villagers because village regulations are set for the benefit of the village community as a whole. The provisions on the right of origin are explained as the right of origin which is a living legacy and the initiative of the village or the initiative of the village's society in accordance with the development of community life, including indigenous peoples' organisational systems, institutions, customary law, the ground of the village's treasury, and agreements in village life as well. The meaning of village-scale local authority is the authority to regulate and manage the interests of the village community that has is conducted by the village, is able and effective when conducted by the village or what has arisen because of the development of the village and the village community, such as boat moorings, the village market, public baths, irrigation canals, environmental sanitation, pre- and postnatal health care and information, art and learning centres, and village libraries, village retention basins, and village roads. In the context of good village governance, the village regulations should reflect: 1) Participation; 2) Law enforcement (rule of law); 3) Transparency; 4) Responsive; 5) Consensus orientation; 6) Equity; 6) Effectiveness and efficiency and 7) Accountability and strategic vision.

From the countercultural music festival circuits of the 1970s to the peace camps of the early 1980s, and on to the anti-road and no-border camps of the 1990s, the encampments form a tradition built on shared aesthetics and new popular forms of leisured mobility. A recent surge in the occurrence of political campsites in Europe and across the world prompts a reflection on this form of mobility in the context of the new mobilities regime. Drawing on data from activist encampments around anti-G8 protests in the UK and Germany and the Camps for Climate Action in the UK, this chapter discusses protests camps in the context of the formation of new mobilities regimes. While social movement research often reflects camps as merely instrumental forms of the organization of protest, the understanding of protest camps as mobilities makes it possible to place them in the context of a broader notion of camps and camping histories.","Univ Leicester, Sch Management, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England",University of Leicester,"Frenzel, F (corresponding author), Univ Leicester, Sch Management, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England.",,,,,,,,33,2,2,0,2,ASHGATE PUBLISHING LTD,ALDERSHOT,"GOWER HOUSE, CROFT ROAD, ALDERSHOT GU11 3HR, ENGLAND",,,978-1-4094-5093-1; 978-1-4094-5092-4,,,,2013,,,,,225,+,,,,,,13,Demography; Geography,Book Citation Index – Social Sciences & Humanities (BKCI-SSH),Demography; Geography,BA9XC,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000339947400017,View Full Record in Web of Science

In the face of marginalization in predominantly white, elite spaces Latino students strategically search for new community and comfort, which in turn influence how they perceive their identities, encouraging a broadening of boundaries to include both panethnic and minority alliances. By documenting the experiences of Latino students in two stages of the educational pipeline, we show how elite institutions influence identity talk lead students to cultivate a sense of shared fate with other Latino-origin individuals and at times, people of color in general.","[Pan, Yung-Yi Diana] CUNY, Brooklyn, NY 11210 USA; [Reyes, Daisy Verduzco] Univ Connecticut, Storrs, CT USA",City University of New York (CUNY) System; University of Connecticut,"Pan, YYD (corresponding author), CUNY, Brooklyn Coll, Dept Sociol, 2900 Bedford Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11210 USA.",ypan@brooklyn.cuny.edu,,,Research Foundation of CUNY-PSC-CUNY; Society for the Study of Social Problems; University of California; All Campus Consortium on Research for Diversity (UC/ACCORD); University of California-Irvine; University of California-Irvine's Center for Research on Latinos in Global Society; University of California-Irvine's Center for Study of Democracy; University of California-Irvine's Center for Organizational Research,Research Foundation of CUNY-PSC-CUNY; Society for the Study of Social Problems; University of California(University of California System); All Campus Consortium on Research for Diversity (UC/ACCORD); University of California-Irvine(University of California System); University of California-Irvine's Center for Research on Latinos in Global Society; University of California-Irvine's Center for Study of Democracy; University of California-Irvine's Center for Organizational Research,"This research was funded by the Research Foundation of CUNY-PSC-CUNY, The Society for the Study of Social Problems, University of California, All Campus Consortium on Research for Diversity (UC/ACCORD), University of California-Irvine, and University of California-Irvine's Centers for Research on Latinos in Global Society, the Study of Democracy, and Organizational Research.",,75,3,3,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-0245,1475-682X,,SOCIOL INQ,Sociol.

Tour operators like Thomas Cook arrived in Italy only in the second half of the nineteenth century when the 'Grand Tour' was declining. The 'Grand Tour', starting from the 17th century, was considered as a long journey across continental Europe made by the wealthy young aristocrats of Britain who intended to complete their education by visiting major cities and sites, with start and finish in the same city. This trip could last from a few months to 8 years. The main destinations were France, Holland, Germany, but it had as a special stage Italy and Rome, and normally included stops in Venice, Florence, Bologna, Pisa and Naples. During the Tour, young people learned about the politics, culture, art and antiquities of European countries. They spent their time sightseeing, studying and making purchases. Italy, with its legacy of ancient Rome, and with its monuments, became one of the most popular places to visit. In addition to knowledge of the ancient world, the British were in contact with the works of Palladio and Neoclassicism. Naples, particularly when it became the capital of Southern Italy with the ascendance of the Bourbon dynasty to the throne, was among the final stages of the 'Grand Tour'. Besides the natural beauty and the warmth of the mild climate throughout the year, the European cultural elite was interested in the history and art of the southern peninsula. Southern Italy continued the legacy of the Magna Graecia and the influences of the Roman Empire, which could be seen both east and west of the city. But there were also the Vesuvius, the Solfatara, the Campi Flegrei, places related to impressive events and not understood scientifically, which aroused the curiosity of naturalists, scholars of flora and fauna, but also painters and artists. You could come to Naples by land or sea although both routes of communication had its drawbacks. The sea route was crossed by boats inappropriate for passenger transportation, often subject to weather conditions and the danger of attacks by Barbary pirates. Even the land route was not immune from danger from bandits, but along the way the traveller could stay at inns where food and rest was available. Travellers entering or leaving the Kingdom of Naples had an obligation to provide an identification document which from the beginning of the eighteenth century was the passport. It was brought to the Prefecture where records were filled in with all information from the documents and personally from the traveller. Today, these records can be found at the State Archives in Naples. They have permission to process some data from the first series (1848) covering 11 years. Thanks to these records, it is now possible to understand the type of traveller of the period, why he was in the Kingdom, what his nationality was, where he stayed, how he arrived in the Kingdom and other information that can be found in the article.","[Avallone, Paola] CNR, ISSM, Rome, Italy",Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Studi Sulle Societa Del Mediterraneo (ISSM-CNR),"Avallone, P (corresponding author), CNR, ISSM, Rome, Italy.",avallone@issm.cnr.it,,,,,,,24,0,0,0,1,"UNIV STUDI NAPOLI FEDERICO II, DIPT PIANIFICAZIONE & SCIENZA TERRITORIO",NAPLES,"PIAZZALE TECCHIO 80, NAPLES, 80125, ITALY",1970-9889,1970-9870,,TEMA,TeMA,SEP,2010,3,,,,73,84,,,,,,12,Urban Studies,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Urban Studies,V1P8R,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000217126000007,View Full Record in Web of Science

This method, named IMPACT World+, is the update of the IMPACT 2002+, LUCAS, and EDIP methods. This paper first presents the IMPACT World+ novelties and results and then analyzes the spatial variability for each regionalized impact category. Methods With IMPACT World+, we propose a midpoint-damage framework with four distinct complementary viewpoints to present an LCIA profile: (1) midpoint impacts, (2) damage impacts, (3) damages on human health, ecosystem quality, and resources & ecosystem service areas of protection, and (4) damages on water and carbon areas of concerns. Most of the regional impact categories have been spatially resolved and all the long-term impact categories have been subdivided between shorter-term damages (over the 100 years after the emission) and long-term damages. The IMPACT World+ method integrates developments in the following categories, all structured according to fate (or competition/scarcity), exposure, exposure response, and severity: (a) Complementary to the global warming potential (GWP100), the IPCC Global Temperature Potentials (GTP100) are used as a proxy for climate change long-term impacts at midpoint. At damage level, shorter-term damages (over the first 100 years after emission) are also differentiated from long-term damages. (b) Marine acidification impact is based on the same fate model as climate change, combined with the H+ concentration affecting 50% of the exposed species. (c) For mineral resources depletion impact, the material competition scarcity index is applied as a midpoint indicator. (d) Terrestrial and freshwater acidification impact assessment combines, at a resolution of 2 degrees x 2.5 degrees (latitude x longitude), global atmospheric source-deposition relationships with soil and water ecosystems' sensitivity. (e) Freshwater eutrophication impact is spatially assessed at a resolution grid of 0.5 degrees x 0.5 degrees, based on a global hydrological dataset. (f) Ecotoxicity and human toxicity impact are based on the parameterized version of USEtox for continents. We consider indoor emissions and differentiate the impacts of metals and persistent organic pollutants for the first 100 years from longer-term impacts. (g) Impacts on human health related to particulate matter formation are modeled using the USEtox regional archetypes to calculate intake fractions and epidemiologically derived exposure response factors. (h) Water consumption impacts are modeled using the consensus-based scarcity indicator AWARE as a proxy midpoint, whereas damages account for competition and adaptation capacity. (i) Impacts on ecosystem quality from land transformation and occupation are empirically characterized at the biome level. Results and discussion We analyze the magnitude of global potential damages for each impact indicator, based on an estimation of the total annual anthropogenic emissions and extractions at the global scale (i.e., doing the LCA of the world). Similarly with ReCiPe and IMPACT 2002+, IMPACT World+ finds that (a) climate change and impacts of particulate matter formation have a dominant contribution to global human health impacts whereas ionizing radiation, ozone layer depletion, and photochemical oxidant formation have a low contribution and (b) climate change and land use have a dominant contribution to global ecosystem quality impact. (c) New impact indicators introduced in IMPACT World+ and not considered in ReCiPe or IMPACT 2002+, in particular water consumption impacts on human health and the long-term impacts of marine acidification on ecosystem quality, are significant contributors to the overall global potential damage. According to the areas of concern version of IMPACT World+ applied to the total annual world emissions and extractions, damages on the water area of concern, carbon area of concern, and the remaining damages (not considered in those two areas of concern) are of the same order of magnitude, highlighting the need to consider all the impact categories. The spatial variability of human health impacts related to exposure to toxic substances and particulate matter is well reflected by using outdoor rural, outdoor urban, and indoor environment archetypes. For human toxicity cancer impact of substances emitted to continental air, the variability between continents is of two orders of magnitude, which is substantially lower than the 13 orders of magnitude total variability across substances. For impacts of water consumption on human health, the spatial variability across extraction locations is substantially higher than the variations between different water qualities. For regionalized impact categories affecting ecosystem quality (acidification, eutrophication, and land use), the characterization factors of half of the regions (25th to 75th percentiles) are within one to two orders of magnitude and the 95th percentile within three to four orders of magnitude, which is higher than the variability between substances, highlighting the relevance of regionalizing. Conclusions IMPACT World+ provides characterization factors within a consistent impact assessment framework for all regionalized impacts at four complementary resolutions: global default, continental, country, and native (i.e., original and non-aggregated) resolutions. IMPACT World+ enables the practitioner to parsimoniously account for spatial variability and to identify the elementary flows to be regionalized in priority to increase the discriminating power of LCA.","[Bulle, Cecile] ESG UQAM, CIRAIG, Dept Strategy & Corp Social Responsibil, CP 8888,Succ Ctr Ville, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada; [Bulle, Cecile; Boulay, Anne-Marie; Bourgault, Guillaume; De Bruille, Vincent; Viet Cao; Levasseur, Annie; Liard, Gladys; Roy, Pierre-Olivier] Polytech Montreal, CIRAIG, Dept Chem Engn, CP 6079,Succ Ctr Ville, Montreal, PQ H3C 3A7, Canada; [Margni, Manuele; Patouillard, Laure; Kashef-Haghighi, Sormeh] Polytech Montreal, CIRAIG, Math & Ind Engn Dept, CP 6079,Succ Ctr Ville, Montreal, PQ H3C 3A7, Canada; [Patouillard, Laure] IFP Energies Nouvelles, 1-4 Ave Bois Preau, F-92852 Rueil Malmaison, France; [Bourgault, Guillaume] Ecoinvent, Technopk Str 1, CH-8005 Zurich, Switzerland; [Hauschild, Michael; Laurent, Alexis; Fantke, Peter] Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Engn Management, Div Quantitat Sustainabil Assessment, Lyngby, Denmark; [Henderson, Andrew; Shaked, Shanna; Jolliet, Olivier] Univ Michigan, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Environm Hlth Sci, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Henderson, Andrew] Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr Houston, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Environm & Occupat Hlth, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Humbert, Sebastien; Kounina, Anna] Quantis, EPFL Innovat Pk,Batiment D, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Levasseur, Annie] Ecole Technol Super, Dept Construct Engn, 1100 Notre Dame O, Montreal, PQ H3C 1K3, Canada; [Rosenbaum, Ralph K.] Univ Montpellier, ELSA Res Grp, Montpellier SupAgro, ITAP,Irstea, Montpellier, France; [Rosenbaum, Ralph K.] Univ Montpellier, ELSA PACT Ind Chair, Montpellier, France",Universite de Montreal; University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal; Universite de Montreal; Polytechnique Montreal; Universite de Montreal; Polytechnique Montreal; IFP Energies Nouvelles; Technical University of Denmark; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Texas System; University of Texas Health Science Center Houston; University of Texas School Public Health; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne; University of Quebec; Ecole de Technologie Superieure - Canada; INRAE; Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; Universite de Montpellier; Universite de Montpellier,"Bulle, C (corresponding author), ESG UQAM, CIRAIG, Dept Strategy & Corp Social Responsibil, CP 8888,Succ Ctr Ville, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada.;Bulle, C (corresponding author), Polytech Montreal, CIRAIG, Dept Chem Engn, CP 6079,Succ Ctr Ville, Montreal, PQ H3C 3A7, Canada.",bulle.cecile@uqam.ca,"Laurent, Alexis/E-4747-2010; Fantke, Peter/N-2704-2015; Margni, Manuele/A-4579-2013; Henderson, Andrew D/AGI-7633-2022; Fantke, Peter/GRO-6285-2022; Patouillard, Laure/V-1950-2019; Fantke, Peter/N-3617-2019; Rosenbaum, Ralph K./AGE-3200-2022; Hauschild, Michael Zwicky/L-6059-2015","Laurent, Alexis/0000-0003-0445-7983; Fantke, Peter/0000-0001-7148-6982; Henderson, Andrew D/0000-0003-2436-7512; Fantke, Peter/0000-0001-7148-6982; Patouillard, Laure/0000-0002-7814-3365; Rosenbaum, Ralph K./0000-0002-7620-1568; Jolliet, Olivier/0000-0001-6955-4210; Bulle, Cecile/0000-0002-7323-046X; Hauschild, Michael Zwicky/0000-0002-8331-7390","Alcoa foundation; Total Sustainability Consortium; ArcelorMittal, Bombardier; Mouvement des caisses Desjardins; Hydro-Quebec; LVMH; Michelin; Nestle; RECYC-QUEBEC; SAQ; Solvay; Total; Umicore; Veolia","Alcoa foundation; Total Sustainability Consortium(Total SA); ArcelorMittal, Bombardier; Mouvement des caisses Desjardins; Hydro-Quebec; LVMH; Michelin; Nestle(Nestle SA); RECYC-QUEBEC; SAQ; Solvay(Solvay SA); Total(Total SA); Umicore; Veolia","The financial support of the Alcoa foundation, of the Total Sustainability Consortium, and of CIRAIG industrial partners (ArcelorMittal, Bombardier, Mouvement des caisses Desjardins, Hydro-Quebec, LVMH, Michelin, Nestle, RECYC-QUEBEC, SAQ, Solvay, Total, Umicore, and Veolia) to the IMPACT World+ project is very much appreciated.",,75,140,142,20,108,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0948-3349,1614-7502,,INT J LIFE CYCLE ASS,Int.

The project field campaign was held during the 2014 XXII Olympic and XI Paralympic Winter Games and preceding test events in Sochi, Russia. An enhanced network of in situ and remote sensing observations supported weather predictions and their verification. Six nowcasting systems (model based, radar tracking, and combined nowcasting systems), nine deterministic mesoscale numerical weather prediction models (with grid spacings down to 250 m), and six ensemble prediction systems (including two with explicitly simulated deep convection) participated in FROST-2014. The project provided forecast input for the meteorological support of the Sochi Olympic Games. The FROST-2014 archive of winter weather observations and forecasts is a valuable information resource for mesoscale predictability studies as well as for the development and validation of nowcasting and forecasting systems in complex terrain. The resulting innovative technologies, exchange of experience, and professional developments contributed to the success of the Olympics and left a post-Olympic legacy.","[Kiktev, Dmitry; Tsyrulnikov, Michael; Astakhova, Elena; Bundel, Anastasia; Muravyev, Anatoly; Rivin, Gdaly; Rozinkina, Inna] Hydrometctr Russia, Moscow, Russia; [Joe, Paul; Isaac, George A.; Reid, Janti] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Montani, Andrea; Paccagnella, Tiziana] Reg Agcy Prevent Environm & Energy Emilia Romagna, Bologna, Italy; [Frogner, Inger-Lise; Nipen, Thomas] MET Norway, Oslo, Norway; [Nurmi, Pertti] Finnish Meteorol Inst, Helsinki, Finland; [Bica, Benedikt; Wang, Yong] Cent Inst Meteorol & Geodynam, Vienna, Austria; [Milbrandt, Jason; Belair, Stephane] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Dorval, PQ, Canada; [Pyle, Matthew] Natl Ctr Environm Predict, College Pk, MD USA; [Ahn, Kwang-Deuk] Natl Inst Meteorol Sci, Seogwipo, South Korea",Environment & Climate Change Canada; Regional Environmental Protection Agency - Italy; Norwegian Meteorological Institute; Finnish Meteorological Institute; Environment & Climate Change Canada; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Institute of Meteorological Sciences,"Kiktev, D (corresponding author), Hydrometctr Russia, Moscow, Russia.",kiktev@mecom.ru,"Rivin, Gdaliy/AAN-3930-2020; Tsyrulnikov, Michael/R-2305-2017; Kiktev, Dmitry/AAG-1863-2019","Tsyrulnikov, Michael/0000-0002-7357-334X; paccagnella, tiziana/0000-0001-6422-7341",,,,,51,12,22,0,19,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0003-0007,1520-0477,,B AM METEOROL SOC,Bull.

This reform represents a crucial challenge for the electrical and transport sectors largely dependent on fossil energy since Mexico is the ninth-largest oil producer in the world. Local industry and academic sectors are called to lead the introduction of renewable energy sources, and particularly to enhance the share of energy from biomass in the local energy basket. Thus, this paper outlines the baseline on regulatory, energy, and carbon markets, and the scientific capacity to increase bioenergy utilization in Mexico. Furthermore, it opens a discussion about the steps forward with regard to sustainability and research needs, emphasizing some priorities and principles to develop a bioenergy system environmentally compatible in this country.

Whilst evidence of such benefits is rapidly accumulating, we still know relatively little about the role of wildlife encounters in shaping the well-being potential of people's routine green/blue space interactions, particularly amongst non-specialists. This article addresses this conceptual gap, drawing on the findings of a three-stage, qualitative, interpretive study which sought to understand and situate people's natural environment well-being experiences within their everyday lives. Wildlife encounters were emphasised by study participants in the context of four types of well-being experience: social, immersive, symbolic and achievement oriented. These are explored within this paper, before discussing the influence of past experiences and current life circumstances on participants' wildlife relationships. Consideration is also given to how environmental managers might focus activity and investment to balance opportunities for such wildlife experiences with the ongoing priorities of delivering socially inclusive, ecologically rich and climate change-resilient green spaces.","[Bell, Sarah L.; Lovell, Rebecca; Wheeler, Benedict W.] Univ Exeter, European Ctr Environm & Human Hlth, Knowledge Spa, Sch Med, Truro, England; [Westley, Michael] Plymouth Univ, Sch Art Design & Architecture, Plymouth, Devon, England",University of Exeter; University of Plymouth,"Bell, SL (corresponding author), Univ Exeter, European Ctr Environm & Human Hlth, Knowledge Spa, Sch Med, Truro, England.",Sarah.Bell@exeter.ac.uk,"Wheeler, Benedict/G-1711-2012","Wheeler, Benedict/0000-0001-9404-5936; Lovell, Rebecca/0000-0002-6962-0350",European Social Fund [11200NCO5],European Social Fund(European Social Fund (ESF)),This work was supported by European Social Fund [11200NCO5].,,48,41,41,5,66,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0142-6397,1469-9710,,LANDSCAPE RES,Landsc.

Oleaster presents a higher genetic variability compared to the cultivated olive and some wild trees were found adapted to particularly harsh conditions; therefore, the role of oleaster in the future of olive cultivation may be crucial. Despite the great potential, only recently the need to deeply characterize and adequately preserve the wild olive resources drew the attention of researchers. In this review, we summarized the most important morphological and genetic studies performed on oleaster trees collected in different countries of the Mediterranean Basin. Moreover, we reviewed the strategies introduced so far to preserve and manage the oleaster germplasm collections, giving a future perspective on their role in facing the future agricultural challenges posed by climatic changes and new emerging diseases.","[Fanelli, Valentina; Mascio, Isabella; Miazzi, Monica Marilena; Montemurro, Cinzia] Univ Bari Aldo Moro, Dept Soil Plant & Food Sci, I-70125 Bari, Italy; [Falek, Wahiba] Ecole Natl Super Biotechnol, Constantine 251000, Algeria; [Montemurro, Cinzia] Univ Bari Aldo Moro, Spin Sinagri srl, I-70125 Bari, Italy; [Montemurro, Cinzia] Natl Res Council Italy CNR, Inst Sustainable Plant Protect, Support Unit Bari, I-70125 Bari, Italy",Universita degli Studi di Bari Aldo Moro; Universita degli Studi di Bari Aldo Moro; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto per la Protezione Sostenibile delle Piante (IPSP-CNR),"Fanelli, V; Miazzi, MM (corresponding author), Univ Bari Aldo Moro, Dept Soil Plant & Food Sci, I-70125 Bari, Italy.",valentina.fanelli@uniba.it; mascioisa@gmail.com; wfalek@ymail.com; monicamarilena.miazzi@uniba.it; cinzia.montemurro@uniba.it,"Mascio, Isabella/GLV-4225-2022; Miazzi, Monica Marilena/C-6337-2013","Mascio, Isabella/0000-0001-6133-2920; Miazzi, Monica Marilena/0000-0002-8038-3587; Fanelli, Valentina/0000-0002-2454-864X; Montemurro, Cinzia/0000-0002-3748-2539",Apulia Region Project Approcci di Next Generation Sequencing per l'analisi di variabilita e di espressione genica in genotipi di olivo autoctoni pugliesi [67]; MIUR-PON Ricerca e Innovazione 2014-2020 [AIM1809249-attivita 2],Apulia Region Project Approcci di Next Generation Sequencing per l'analisi di variabilita e di espressione genica in genotipi di olivo autoctoni pugliesi; MIUR-PON Ricerca e Innovazione 2014-2020,"This research was funded by: Apulia Region Project Approcci di Next Generation Sequencing per l'analisi di variabilita e di espressione genica in genotipi di olivo autoctoni pugliesi L.R. 28 December 2018 n. 67, art. 37.

High-rate anaerobic digestion (AD) has revolutionised the sustainability of industrial wastewater treatment and could additionally provide an alternative for municipal wastewater. While AD of dilute municipal wastewater is common in tropical regions, the low temperatures of temperate climates has resulted in slow uptake. Here, we demonstrate for the first time, direct, high-rate, low-temperature AD of low-strength municipal wastewater at full-scale. An 88 m(3) hybrid reactor was installed at the municipal wastewater treatment plant in Builth Wells, UK and operated for 290 days. Ambient temperatures ranged from 2 to 18 degrees C, but remained below 15 degrees C for > 100 days. Influent BOD fluctuated between 2 and 200 mg L-1. However, BOD removal often reached > 85%. 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing of DNA from the biomass revealed a highly adaptable core microbiome.

Such an extreme weakening of solar activity could cause severe climate, causing massive reductions in crop yields in some regions. During the past decade, the Sun's activity has tended to decline, raising concerns that the Sun might be heading for the next grand minimum. However, we still have an underdeveloped understanding of solar dynamo mechanisms and hence precise prediction of near-future solar activity is not attained. Here we show that the 11-year solar cycles were significantly lengthened before the onset of the Maunder Minimum (1645-1715 CE) based on unprecedentedly high-precision data of carbon-14 content in tree rings. It implies that flow speed in the convection zone is an essential parameter to determine long-term solar activity variations. We find that a 16 year-long cycle had occurred three solar cycles before the onset of prolonged sunspot disappearance, suggesting a longer-than-expected preparatory period for the grand minimum. As the Sun has shown a tendency of cycle lengthening since Solar Cycle 23 (1996-2008 CE), the behavior of Solar Cycle 25 can be critically important to the later solar activity.","[Miyahara, Hiroko] Musashino Art Univ, Humanities & Sci Museum Careers, Tokyo 1878505, Japan; [Tokanai, Fuyuki; Sakurai, Hirohisa] Yamagata Univ, Fac Sci, Yamagata 9908560, Japan; [Tokanai, Fuyuki; Moriya, Toru; Takeyama, Mirei] Yamagata Univ, Ctr Accelerator Mass Spectrometry, Yamagata 9993101, Japan; [Horiuchi, Kazuho] Hirosaki Univ, Grad Sch Sci & Technol, Hirosaki, Aomori 0368561, Japan; [Hotta, Hideyuki] Chiba Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Phys, Inage Ku, 1-33 Yayoi Cho, Chiba 2638522, Japan",Yamagata University; Yamagata University; Hirosaki University; Chiba University,"Miyahara, H (corresponding author), Musashino Art Univ, Humanities & Sci Museum Careers, Tokyo 1878505, Japan.",miyahara@musabi.ac.jp,"Miyahara, Hiroko/GPX-4725-2022","Miyahara, Hiroko/0000-0001-6787-443X; Takeyama, Mirei/0000-0001-7003-321X","JSPS KAKENHI [25287051, 25247082, 15H05816]","JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","We thank Prof. Yasushi Muraki and Prof. Keiji Takemura for providing the tree samples.

However, a major drawback to this development in the region is the intense cloud cover that reduces the incoming solar radiation when present and causes fluctuations in solar power production. Therefore, understanding the occurrence of clouds and their link to the surface solar radiation in the region is important for making plans to manage future solar energy production. In this study, we use the state-of-the-art European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts ReAnalysis (ERA5) dataset to examine the occurrence and persistence of cloudy and clear-sky conditions in the region. Then, we investigate the effects of cloud cover on the quantity and variability of the incoming solar radiation. The cloud shortwave radiation attenuation (CRASW down arrow) is used to quantify the amount of incoming solar radiation that is lost due to clouds. The results showed that the attenuation of incoming solar radiation is stronger in all months over the southern part of WA near the Guinea Coast. Across the whole region, the maximum attenuation occurs in August, with a meanCRASW down arrow of about 55% over southern WA and between 20% and 35% in the Sahelian region. Southern WA is characterized by a higher occurrence of persistent cloudy conditions, while the Sahel region and northern WA are associated with frequent clear-sky conditions. Nonetheless, continuous periods with extremely low surface solar radiation were found to be few over the whole region. The analysis also showed that the surface solar radiation received from November to April only varies marginally from one year to the other. However, there is a higher uncertainty during the core of the monsoon season (June to October) with regard to the quantity of incoming solar radiation. The results obtained show the need for robust management plans to ensure the long-term success of solar energy projects in the region.","[Danso, Derrick Kwadwo; Anquetin, Sandrine; Diedhiou, Arona] Univ Grenoble Alpes, IRD, CNRS, Grenoble INP,IGE, F-38000 Grenoble, France; [Danso, Derrick Kwadwo; Diedhiou, Arona] Univ Felix Houphouet Boigny, Lab Phys Atmosphere & Mecan Fluides LAPAMF, BP 582, Abidjan 22, Cote Ivoire; [Adamou, Rabani] Univ Abdou Moumouni, Fac Sci & Tech, WASCAL GRP Climate Change & Energy, Niamey 10662, Niger",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Institut National Polytechnique de Grenoble; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD),"Danso, DK (corresponding author), Univ Grenoble Alpes, IRD, CNRS, Grenoble INP,IGE, F-38000 Grenoble, France.;Danso, DK (corresponding author), Univ Felix Houphouet Boigny, Lab Phys Atmosphere & Mecan Fluides LAPAMF, BP 582, Abidjan 22, Cote Ivoire.",derrick.danso@univ-grenoble-alpes.fr; sandrine.anquetin@univ-grenoble-alpes.fr; arona.diedhiou@ird.fr; adamrabani@yahoo.fr,"DIEDHIOU, Arona/D-2719-2009; Danso, Derrick K./GQP-1456-2022","DIEDHIOU, Arona/0000-0003-3841-1027; Danso, Derrick/0000-0001-7141-7530; Anquetin, Sandrine/0000-0001-5127-1650","French National Research Institute for Sustainable Development IRD (Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement, France)","French National Research Institute for Sustainable Development IRD (Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement, France)","The research leading to this publication has been supported by the French National Research Institute for Sustainable Development IRD (Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement, France).",,45,4,4,0,5,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4433,,ATMOSPHERE-BASEL,Atmosphere,AUG,2020,8,,,,,,857,10.3390/atmos11080857,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos11080857,,,18,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,NH4VA,,"gold, Green Published",,,12/21/22,WOS:000564668300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

These large-scale problems can be directly decomposed into smaller subproblems, in the absence of time-coupling constraints and variables. However, time-coupling is common in energy systems, e.g. due to (seasonal) energy storage and peak-power prices. To solve time-coupled long-term operational optimization problems, we propose the method DeLoop for the Decomposition-based Long-term operational optimization of energy systems with time-coupling. DeLoop calculates feasible solutions (upper bounds) by decomposing the operational optimization problem into smaller subproblems. The solutions of these subproblems are recombined to obtain a feasible solution for the original long-term problem. To evaluate the quality of the feasible solutions, DeLoop computes lower bounds by linear programming relaxation. DeLoop iteratively decreases the number of subproblems and employs the Branch-and-Cut procedure to tighten the bounds. In a case study of an energy system, DeLoop converges fast, outperforming a commercial state-of-the-art solver by a factor of 32. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Seawater conditions are currently changing at an unprecedented rate as a consequence of ocean acidification (OA). Sperm are thought to be particularly vulnerable to these changes and may be exposed to external environmental conditions for variable periods of time between spawning and fertilisation. Here, we undertook a mechanistic investigation of sperm swimming performance in the coastal polychaete Arenicola marina during an extended exposure to OA conditions (pH(NBS) 7.77,1000 mu atm pCO(2)). We found that key fitness -related aspects of sperm functioning declined faster under OA conditions i.e. impacts became apparent with exposure time. Sperm swimming speed (VCL), the number of motile sperm and sperm path linearity all dropped significantly after 4 h under OA conditions whilst remaining constant under ambient conditions at this time point. Our results highlight the importance of sperm exposure duration in ocean acidification experiments and may help towards explaining species specific differences in response. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The novel aspect and main advantage of the extended model is an integrated consideration of hydrological processes, vegetation dynamics and biogeochemical cycles (soil carbon, phosphorus, and nitrogen) in semi-closed systems (river basins) under environmental change. Thereby the extension was designed to integrate present-day understanding of soil organic matter dynamics under the constraints of data availability for parameterisation. at the regional scale. A major advantage is less data and parameter necessary to run the model compared to state of the art SOC models and the availability of direct measurements of soil C carbon contents to test and validate the model. The model extension was tested regarding primary organic matter decomposition and long-term SOC dynamics using observed data sets. This test delivered similar quality as other SOC models. The new SOC model extension adequately represents these processes when compared to observed data on experimental field sites and literature studies. Application of the extended model to assess impacts of land management practices (different organic and inorganic fertilisation schemes, different crop rotations, inclusion of cover crops and harvest by-product returns) on long-term SOC dynamics is presented here at the experimental field and river basin scale. The simulated quantification at the field scale of different fertilisation regimes led to changes from -0.13 to +0.1 t Cha(-1) year(-1) in SOC, different types of crop rotations and cover crop impacts changed SOC between -0.13 and +0.07 t Cha(-1) year(-1) and incorporation of harvest by-products (grain straw residuals) led to changes between -0.1 and +0.027 t C ha(-1) year(-1) in SOC. It is shown on the river basin scale that harvest by-products quantity remaining on the field significantly impact regional SOC dynamics (loss of 0.26 t C ha(-1) year(-1) when exporting all harvest by-products). The modelled results are in general agreement with studies reported in literature. The extended model is hence able to quantify the impacts of selected land management practices on long-term SOC dynamics and allows land management practices and their impacts on water availability, water quality, carbon storage in soils, and vegetation growth to be assessed in an integrated way.

They are regions of immense societal importance through the goods and services they provide, hazards they pose and their role in global-scale processes and cycles, e.g. carbon fluxes and dense water formation. However, they are poorly represented in the current generation of global ocean models. In this contribution, we aim to briefly characterise the problem, and then to identify the important physical processes, and their scales, needed to address this issue in the context of the options available to resolve these scales globally and the evolving computational landscape. We find barotropic and topographic scales are well resolved by the current state-of-the-art model resolutions, e.g. nominal 1/12 degrees, and still reasonably well resolved at 1/4 degrees; here, the focus is on process representation. We identify tides, vertical coordinates, river inflows and mixing schemes as four areas where modelling approaches can readily be transferred from regional to global modelling with substantial benefit. In terms of finer-scale processes, we find that a 1/2 degrees, global model resolves the first baroclinic Rossby radius for only similar to 8% of regions < 500 m deep, but this increases to similar to 70% for a 1/72 degrees model, so resolving scales globally requires substantially finer resolution than the current state of the art. We quantify the benefit of improved resolution and process representation using 1/12 degrees global- and basin-scale northern North Atlantic nucleus for a European model of the ocean NEMO) simulations; the latter includes tides and a k-epsilon vertical mixing scheme. These are compared with global stratification observations and 19 models from CMIP5. In terms of correlation and basin-wide rms error, the high-resolution models outperform all these CMIP5 models. The model with tides shows improved seasonal cycles compared to the high-resolution model without tides. The benefits of resolution are particularly apparent in eastern boundary upwelling zones. To explore the balance between the size of a globally refined model and that of multiscale modelling options (e.g. finite element, finite volume or a two- way nesting approach), we consider a simple scale analysis and a conceptual grid refining approach. We put this analysis in the context of evolving computer systems, discussing model turnaround time, scalability and resource costs. Using a simple cost model compared to a reference configuration (taken to be a 1/4 degrees global model in 2011) and the increasing performance of the UK Research Councils' computer facility, we estimate an unstructured mesh multiscale approach, resolving process scales down to 1.5 km, would use a comparable share of the computer resource by 2021, the two-way nested multiscale approach by 2022, and a 1/72 degrees global model by 2026. However, we also note that a 1/12 degrees global model would not have a comparable computational cost to a 1 degrees global model in 2017 until 2027. Hence, we conclude that for computationally expensive models (e.g. for oceanographic research or operational oceanography), resolving scales to similar to 1.5 km would be routinely practical in about a decade given substantial effort on numerical and computational development. For complex Earth system models, this extends to about 2 decades, suggesting the focus here needs to be on improved process parameterisation to meet these challenges.","[Holt, Jason; Harle, James; Liu, Hedong] Natl Oceanog Ctr, 6 Brownlow St, Liverpool L3 5DA, Merseyside, England; [Hyder, Patrick; Hewitt, Helene T.; Siddorn, John; Wood, Richard] Met Off Hadley Ctr, FitzRoy Rd, Exeter EX1 3PB, Devon, England; [Ashworth, Mike; Pickles, Stephen; Porter, Andrew] Sci Tech Daresbury, STFC Daresbury Lab, Warrington WA4 4AD, Cheshire, England; [New, Adrian L.; Popova, Ekaterina] Natl Oceanog Ctr, European Way, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, England; [Allen, J.

They perpetuate a sense of identity, prestige and community. Many heritage buildings however tend to be energy inefficient and the scope for retrofitting such buildings is paramount. Heritage buildings require ratification from planning bodies in order to undertake any alteration on the building. This tends to create a bottleneck in the retrofitting of heritage office buildings. The paper aims to discuss this issue. Design/methodology/approach - This study utilises a case study building in Scotland to evaluate the potential for retrofitting in a UK heritage office building. Building energy simulation software is used to generate the energy data in different retrofit options. A scenario analysis on the heritage status of the building is also undertaken. Findings - The costs, energy consumption and carbon emission levels are evaluated and compared. It was found that the differential in annual energy savings achieved, based on the proportion of capital cost to operational cost, is 14.6 per cent in the heritage building, compared to 24.6 per cent in the non-heritage building. Originality/value - The study suggests that government and other stakeholders should seek for ways of incentivising retrofit investments in heritage buildings. This will provide an effective way of minimising the contributions of the built environment to global warming and climate change.","[Tokede, Olubukola; Udawatta, Nilupa; Luther, Mark] Deakin Univ, Sch Architecture & Built Environm, Geelong, Vic, Australia",Deakin University,"Udawatta, N (corresponding author), Deakin Univ, Sch Architecture & Built Environm, Geelong, Vic, Australia.",nilupa.udawatta@deakin.edu.au,"Udawatta, Nilupa/F-8058-2019","Udawatta, Nilupa/0000-0002-0290-3065; Tokede, Olubukola/0000-0002-5116-3390",,,,,39,2,2,1,11,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",2044-124X,2044-1258,,BUILT ENVIRON PROJ A,Built Environ.

Utilising local residual biomass as a raw material may be advantageous in terms of sustainability. This study investigated the environmental and energy balances of using biowaste and biomass from landscape management for micropollutant removal at a commercial scale WWTP. Both residual biomasses were processed using the integrated generation of solid fuel and biogas from biomass (IFBB) technique to obtain a press cake that was used as feedstock for AC production. The results showed a lower global warming potential (GWP) and cumulative energy demand in comparison to a fossil-based conventional AC Differences in GWP between residual and fossil ACs were enhanced when the end-of-life incineration step was considered, and residual AC had a lower social risk associated with its production. Energy efficiency of AC production was substantially increased by utilising waste heat generated in the pyrolysis process of biochar production and by using electricity generated in a combined heat and power plant using biogas from the methanation of IFBB press fluids. Converting residual biomass into activated carbon using IFBB and a state-of-the-art pyrolysis and activation unit along with energy recovery would improve WWTP sustainability and self-sufficiency in terms of the raw materials required.","[Joseph, Ben; Kaetzl, Korbinian; Hensgen, Frank; Wachendorf, Michael] Univ Kassel, Grassland Sci & Renewable Plant Resources, Witzenhausen, Germany; [Kaetzl, Korbinian] Univ Kassel, Competence Ctr Climate Change Mitigat & Adaptat C, Kassel, Germany; [Schaefer, Bernhard] Eigenbetrieb Umwelttech Baden Baden, Baden Baden, Germany",Universitat Kassel; Universitat Kassel,"Kaetzl, K (corresponding author), Univ Kassel, Grassland Sci & Renewable Plant Resources, Witzenhausen, Germany.;Kaetzl, K (corresponding author), Univ Kassel, Competence Ctr Climate Change Mitigat & Adaptat C, Kassel, Germany.",kaetzl@uni-kassel.de,"Kaetzl, Korbinian/T-2663-2017; Joseph, Ben/AAW-1318-2021; Wachendorf, Michael/ABG-9819-2020","Kaetzl, Korbinian/0000-0002-6157-7191; Wachendorf, Michael/0000-0002-2840-7086; Joseph, Ben/0000-0001-8394-9171; Hensgen, Frank/0000-0001-8735-7544",European Union [NWE 294]; German Federal Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF) within the research initiative Stadt-Land-Plus [033L206]; Open Access Publication Fund of the Universitat Kassel,European Union(European Commission); German Federal Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF) within the research initiative Stadt-Land-Plus(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); Open Access Publication Fund of the Universitat Kassel,"The authors would like to acknowledge the European Union for financing the Re-Direct project (NWE 294) through the INTERREG European regional development fund and the German Federal Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF) for financing the CoAct project within the research initiative Stadt-Land-Plus (Grant Number 033L206).

As this fundamental task becomes crucial for stream processing, single-pass algorithms were introduced to enable a stream-oriented hardware design. However, most single-pass CCA algorithms in the literature inhibit maximum streaming throughput as additional time such as horizontal blanking period is required to resolve label equivalence. This paper proposes a novel single-pass CCA algorithm, using a combination of linked list and run-length-based techniques to label and resolve equivalences as well as extracting the object features in a single raster scan. The proposed algorithm involves a label recycling scheme which attains low memory requirement design. Experimental results show the implementation of the proposed CCA achieves one cycle per pixel throughput and surpasses the most memory-efficient state-of-the-art work up to 25 % reduction in memory usage for pixels image.","[Tang, Jia Wei; Shaikh-Husin, Nasir; Sheikh, Usman Ullah; Marsono, M.

Histogram equalization is then separately performed on the two sub-histograms to yield a clean and enhanced image. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method, a total of 190 test images are used in simulation and comparison, in which 72 of them are standard test images, while the remainder are made up of real natural images obtained from personal digital camera. The simulation results show that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, both in terms of visual and runtime comparison.

Their effectiveness with respect to protecting existing biodiversity has been less investigated. Biodiversity and landscape protection effects can be expected in marginal agricultural areas, where farming has been less intensive. We investigated (i) the effectiveness of the Ecological Compensation Area (ECA) scheme for biodiversity protection according to different evaluation criteria and (ii) how the effectiveness of the scheme was influenced by climate, socio-economic conditions and farming structures. Vegetation surveys were carried out in 18 municipalities across the Swiss Alps on 162 randomly selected meadows managed as ECAs and on 162 conventionally managed meadows. Average species richness of ECA-meadows per municipality ranged between 27 and 46 vascular plant species per 25m(2) (conventionally managed meadows: 16-35 species per 25 m(2)). In lower altitude municipalities (mainly fulltime farming) where ECA meadows constituted 20% of farmland, the difference in species richness between the two land-use types was highly significant and the contribution of ECA-meadows to the grassland species pool was highest. In higher altitude municipalities (mainly part-time farming) where ECA meadows constituted at least 40% of farmland, higher species richness was found. This was associated with a strong botanical similarity of ECA and conventionally managed meadows. We conclude that at lower altitudes, where farming is relatively intensive, the ECA scheme protects a few, economically marginal, species rich and botanically complementary sites, important for maintaining the species pool.

As it is more efficient to protect than to restore biodiversity, the protection effect of agri-environmental schemes needs to be adequately recognized. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Most models project an enhanced surface response to the QBO via a strengthened HT relationship in the future. Specifically, the North Atlantic Oscillation-like response is projected to double and shift eastward in the future in the high-end emission scenarios compared with the historical simulation. This strengthening occurs even as the amplitude of the QBO in the tropical stratosphere weakens from the historical simulation to the future projections. The seemingly contradictory projections of future changes in the QBO and the HT relationship might imply that the HT relationship changes nonlinearly with the QBO intensity, and the coherent changes in the background circulation structure should also be highlighted.","[Rao, Jian; Garfinkel, Chaim, I; White, Ian P.] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Fredy & Nadine Herrmann Inst Earth Sci, Edmond J Safra Campus, Jerusalem, Israel; [Rao, Jian] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Joint Int Res Lab Climate & Environm Change ILCEC, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteoro, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster,Minist Educ KLME, Nanjing, Peoples R China",Hebrew University of Jerusalem; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology,"Rao, J (corresponding author), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Fredy & Nadine Herrmann Inst Earth Sci, Edmond J Safra Campus, Jerusalem, Israel.;Rao, J (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Joint Int Res Lab Climate & Environm Change ILCEC, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteoro, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster,Minist Educ KLME, Nanjing, Peoples R China.",jian.rao@mail.huji.ac.il,"garfinkel, chaim I/AAA-1134-2020; Rao, Jian/O-3392-2019","garfinkel, chaim I/0000-0001-7258-666X; Rao, Jian/0000-0001-5030-0288",National Key R&D Program of China [2016YFA0602104]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41705024]; ISF-NSFC joint research program [3259/19]; European Research Council starting grant under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [677756],National Key R&D Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); ISF-NSFC joint research program; European Research Council starting grant under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme,"J.

In this introductory chapter, we develop an overview of where the emerging microfoundational agenda in institutional theory stands and in which direction it is moving. We discuss the questions of what microfoundations of institutions are, what the micro in microfoundations represents, why we use the plural form (microfoundations vs microfoundation), why microfoundations of institutions are needed, and how microfoundations can be studied. Specifically, we highlight that there are several traditions of microfoundational research, and we outline a cognitive, a communicative and a behavioral perspective. In addition, we explain that scholars tend to think of microfoundations in terms of an agency, levels, or mechanisms argument. We delineate key challenges and opportunities for future research and explain why we believe that the debate on microfoundations will become a defining element in the further development of institutional theory.","[Haack, Patrick] Univ Lausanne, HEC Lausanne, Strategy, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Sieweke, Jost] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Management & Org, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Wessel, Lauri] Univ Bremen, Management & Org, Bremen, Germany",University of Lausanne; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; University of Bremen,"Haack, P (corresponding author), Univ Lausanne, HEC Lausanne, Strategy, Lausanne, Switzerland.",,,"Sieweke, Jost/0000-0003-4676-747X",German Research Foundation,German Research Foundation(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"We thank Vern Glaser, Derek Harmon, and Oliver Schilke for their comments on an earlier draft of this introduction.

Different measures are currently being evaluated in order to further improve the efficiency, especially with respect to different ambient and therefore, different operating conditions. The systems turn more and more into integrated solutions, for low-and medium temperature load as well as air conditioning and heating, in order to cope efficiently with different ambient conditions and offering at the same time high annual energy efficiencies. Perfect interaction between and control of the individual system components are the basis for optimum system efficiency throughout the entire year for a given location. An important factor in this respect is the intermediate pressure inside the receiver and its effect on the overall efficiency of the system. This paper provides an analytical and experimental study of different control strategies and their effects on the annual energy efficiency.

Single daily profile precision uncertainty, when taking the ascending-descending (day-night) difference, was found to be up to 40 pptv while systematic error biases were estimated to be less than about 3 pptv.

The article questions the common assumption that 'more (disciplines) is better' to address complex social, economic and environmental problems. It highlights the ways in which interdisciplinary and industry-led projects can inadvertently silo the doctoral candidate and the problem to be 'solved' within dominant ontological, epistemological and political frameworks. The article calls on supervisors and candidates to adopt the role of negotiators and translators in complex research relationships.

Here, we present an updated chronology for the site based on high-resolution AMS radiocarbon dates and Bayesian and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) methods. We draw on broader anthropological approaches to lithic evidence and behavioural modelling to test hypotheses about hunter-gatherer provisioning and mobility systems across the Maloti-Drakensberg Escarpment environmental transect. We compare the modelled ages and stone tool evidence from Rose Cottage Cave to other well-dated archaeological sequences in the region, including the comparably well-dated site of Sehonghong in highland Lesotho, as well as Ha Makotoko, Ntloana Tgoana, and Strathalan sites A and B. These comparisons reveal differences in the organization of lithic technologies and activity traces across the region, which can be explained by a combination of responses in hunter-gatherer mobility to local environmental gradients and climate shifts during the climatically variable late Pleistocene. Our results shed light on the relationship between patterns of behavioural change and palaeoenvironmental variability in southeastern southern Africa specifically, and on hunter-gatherer behavioural variability in montane environments more generally.","[Loftus, Emma] Univ Cambridge, McDonald Inst Archaeol Res, Cambridge, England; [Pargeter, Justin] NYU, Dept Anthropol, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Pargeter, Justin] Univ Johannesburg, Palaeores Inst, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Mackay, Alex] Univ Wollongong, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Ctr Archaeol Sci, Wollongong, NSW, Australia; [Mackay, Alex] Univ Cape Town, Dept Archaeol, Rondebosch, South Africa; [Stewart, Brian A.] Univ Michigan, Museum Anthropol Archaeol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Stewart, Brian A.] Univ Michigan, Dept Anthropol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Stewart, Brian A.] Univ Witwatersrand, Rock Art Res Inst, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Mitchell, Peter] Univ Oxford, Sch Archaeol, Oxford, England; [Mitchell, Peter] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Geog Archaeol & Environm Studies, Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Cambridge; New York University; University of Johannesburg; University of Wollongong; University of Cape Town; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Witwatersrand; University of Oxford; University of Witwatersrand,"Loftus, E (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, McDonald Inst Archaeol Res, Cambridge, England.",e1485@cam.ac.uk,,"Stewart, Brian/0000-0002-2284-7136; Pargeter, Justin/0000-0001-6536-8568; Loftus, Emma Jessica/0000-0003-4442-8511","Natural Environment Research Council Radiocarbon Facility award [NF/2016/1/2]; National Science Foundation of the United States of America [DDIG 72177]; Leakey Foundation (Mosher Baldwin Fellowship); Dan David Foundation; Merton College, Oxford; Leverhulme Trust; Isaac Newton Trust, Cambridge; NERC [NRCF010002] Funding Source: UKRI","Natural Environment Research Council Radiocarbon Facility award; National Science Foundation of the United States of America(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Leakey Foundation (Mosher Baldwin Fellowship); Dan David Foundation; Merton College, Oxford; Leverhulme Trust(Leverhulme Trust); Isaac Newton Trust, Cambridge; NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC))","The dates reported here were obtained using a grant awarded by a Natural Environment Research Council Radiocarbon Facility award to PM (NF/2016/1/2).

A significant part of this effort has been the collection and documentation of extensive aerosol physical and optical property data sets. However, the data sets present significant interpretive challenges because of the diverse nature of these measurements. Among the longest continuous records is that by the spaceborne Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment (SAGE) II. Although SAGE tropospheric measurements are restricted to the middle and upper troposphere, they may be able to provide significant insight into the nature and variability of tropospheric aerosol, particularly when combined with ground and airborne observations. This paper demonstrates the capacity of aerosol products from SAGE II and its follow-on experiment SAGE III to describe the temporal and vertical variations of Arctic aerosol characteristics. We find that the measurements from both instruments are consistent enough to be combined. Using this combined data set, we detect a clear annual cycle in the aerosol extinction for the middle and upper Arctic troposphere.","Alfred Wegener Inst Polar & Marine Res, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany; NASA, Langley Res Ctr, Hampton, VA 23681 USA; Stockholm Univ, Dept Appl Environm Sci, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; Alfred Wegener Inst Polar & Marine Res, D-27570 Bremerhaven, Germany; Natl Inst Polar Res, Tokyo 1738515, Japan","Helmholtz Association; Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar & Marine Research; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Langley Research Center; Stockholm University; Helmholtz Association; Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar & Marine Research; Research Organization of Information & Systems (ROIS); National Institute of Polar Research (NIPR) - Japan","Treffeisen, RE (corresponding author), Alfred Wegener Inst Polar & Marine Res, Telegrafenberg A45, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany.",rtreff@awi-potsdam.de; l.w.thomason@nasa.gov; johan@itm.su.se; aherber@awi-bremerhaven.de; yamanou@pmg.nipr.ac.jp,"Yamanouchi, Takashi/P-2041-2015","Thomason, Larry/0000-0002-1902-0840; Burton, Sharon/0000-0002-4905-6852",,,,,48,12,13,0,8,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",2169-897X,2169-8996,,J GEOPHYS RES-ATMOS,J.

By analyzing this in-situ observation dataset and the numerical simulation, we investigated the source of the uncertainty of the current algorithms for Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for Earth observation system (AMSR-E) and AMSR2 to retrieve SSM and vegetation dynamics. Our findings are: (1) the microwave radiative transfer at C-band and X-band is not strongly affected by the shape of vegetation and the existing algorithm can be applied to a wide variety of plant types; (2) the diversity of surface soil roughness significantly affects the indices which are used by the current algorithms and addressing the uncertainty of surface soil roughness is necessary to improve the retrieval algorithms; (3) At C-band, SSM of the homogeneous vegetated land surfaces can be detected only when their VWC is less than approximately 0.25 (kg/m(2)); (4) the state-of-the-art Radiative Transfer Model (RTM) can predict our observed dataset although we have some biases in simulating brightness temperatures at a higher frequency. The new in-situ observation dataset produced by this study can be the guideline for both developers and users of passive microwave land observations to consider the uncertainties of their products.","[Sawada, Yohei; Koike, Toshio] Univ Tokyo, Dept Civil Engn, Tokyo 1138656, Japan; [Sawada, Yohei] RIKEN, Adv Inst Computat Sci, Data Assimilat Res Team, Kobe, Hyogo 6500047, Japan; [Sawada, Yohei] Japan Meteorol Agcy, Meteorol Res Inst, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050052, Japan; [Tsutsui, Hiroyuki] Japan Aerosp Explorat Agcy, Earth Observat Res Ctr, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058505, Japan; [Koike, Toshio] Int Ctr Water Hazard & Risk Management ICHARM, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058516, Japan",University of Tokyo; RIKEN; Japan Meteorological Agency; Meteorological Research Institute - Japan; Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA),"Sawada, Y (corresponding author), Univ Tokyo, Dept Civil Engn, Tokyo 1138656, Japan.;Sawada, Y (corresponding author), RIKEN, Adv Inst Computat Sci, Data Assimilat Res Team, Kobe, Hyogo 6500047, Japan.;Sawada, Y (corresponding author), Japan Meteorol Agcy, Meteorol Res Inst, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050052, Japan.",ysawada@mri-jma.go.jp; tsutsui.hiroyuki@jaxa.jp; koike@icharm.org,"Koike, Toshio/AAC-8548-2020","Tsutsui, Hiroyuki/0000-0003-1000-1237",Japan Society of Promotion of Science (JSPS) [255893]; Japan Aerospace eXploration Agency (JAXA); Research Program on Climate Change Adaptation (RECCA); JSPS KAKENHI [JP17K18352]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [17K18352] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Japan Society of Promotion of Science (JSPS)(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Japan Aerospace eXploration Agency (JAXA); Research Program on Climate Change Adaptation (RECCA); JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","Yohei Sawada has been supported by Japan Society of Promotion of Science (JSPS) (255893).

Such observations are urgently required in efforts to predict future climate and environmental conditions and to support spaceborne remote sensing (ground truth activities). The lidar observations were performed in the framework of the Central Asian Dust Experiment (CADEX) at Dushanbe, Tajikistan, from March 2015 to August 2016. An AERONET (AErosol RObotic NETwork) sun photometer was operated at the lidar field site. During the 18-month campaign, mixtures of continental aerosol pollution and mineral dust were frequently detected from ground to cirrus height level. Regional sources of dust and pollution as well as long-range transport of mineral dust mainly from Middle Eastern and the Saharan deserts determine the aerosol conditions over Tajikistan. In this study, we summarize our findings and present seasonally resolved statistics regarding aerosol layering (main aerosol layer depth, lofted layer occurrence); optical properties (aerosol and dust optical thicknesses at 500-532 nm, vertically resolved light-extinction coefficient at 532 nm); profiles of dust and non-dust mass concentrations and dust fraction; and profiles of particle parameters relevant for liquid water, mixed-phase cloud, and cirrus formation such as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and ice-nucleating particle (INP) concentrations. The main aerosol layer over Dushanbe typically reaches 4-5 km height in spring to autumn. Frequently lofted dust-containing aerosol layers were observed at heights from 5 to 10 km, indicating a sensitive potential of dust to influence cloud ice formation. Typical dust mass fractions were of the order of 60%-80%. A considerable fraction is thus anthropogenic pollution and biomass burning smoke. The highest aerosol pollution levels (in the relatively shallow winter boundary layer) occur during the winter months. The seasonal mean 500 nm AOT (aerosol optical thickness) ranges from 0.15 in winter to 0.36 in summer during the CADEX period (March 2015 to August 2016); DOTs (dust optical thicknesses) were usually below 0.2; seasonally mean particle extinction coefficients were of the order of 100-500 Mm(-1) in the main aerosol layer during the summer half year and about 100-150 Mm(-1) in winter but were mainly caused by anthropogenic haze. Accordingly, the highest dust mass concentrations occurred in the summer season (200-600 mu g m(-3)) and the lowest during the winter months (20-50 mu g m(-3)) in the main aerosol layer. In winter, the aerosol pollution mass concentrations were 20-50 mu g m(-3), while during the summer half year (spring to autumn), the mass concentration caused by urban haze and biomass burning smoke decreases to 10-20 mu g m(-3) in the lower troposphere. The CCN concentration levels are always controlled by aerosol pollution. The INP concentrations were found to be high enough in the middle and upper troposphere to significantly influence ice formation in mixed-phase and ice clouds during spring and summer seasons.","[Hofer, Julian; Ansmann, Albert; Althausen, Dietrich; Engelmann, Ronny; Baars, Holger] Leibniz Inst Tropospher Res, Leipzig, Germany; [Abdullaev, Sabur F.; Makhmudov, Abduvosit N.] Acad Sci Tajikistan, Phys Tech Inst, Dushanbe, Tajikistan",Leibniz Institut fur Tropospharenforschung (TROPOS); Academy of Sciences of Republic of Tajikistan; S.U.

Hydrogen-deficient white dwarfs are characterized by very dense, fluid-like atmospheres of complex physics and chemistry that are still poorly understood. The incomplete description of these atmospheres by the models results in serious problems with the description of spectra of these stars and subsequent difficulties in derivation of their surface parameters. Here, we address the problem of infrared (IR) opacities in the atmospheres of cool white dwarfs by direct ab initio simulations of IR absorption of dense helium. Methods. We applied state-of-the-art density functional theory-based quantum molecular dynamics simulations to obtain the time evolution of the induced dipole moment. The IR absorption coefficients were obtained by the Fourier transform of the dipole moment time autocorrelation function. Results. We found that a dipole moment is induced due to three-and more-body simultaneous collisions between helium atoms in highly compressed helium. This results in a significant IR absorption that is directly proportional to rho(3)(He), where rho(He) is the density of helium. To our knowledge, this absorption mechanism has never been measured or computed before and is therefore not accounted for in the current atmosphere models. It should dominate the other collisionally induced absorptions (CIA), arising from H-He and H-2-He pair collisions, and therefore shape the IR spectra of helium-dominated and pure helium atmosphere cool white dwarfs for He/H > 10(4). Conclusions. Our work shows that there exists an unaccounted IR absorption mechanism arising from the multi-collisions between He atoms in the helium-rich atmospheres of cool white dwarfs, including pure helium atmospheres. This absorption may be responsible for a yet unexplained frequency dependence of near- and mid-IR spectra of helium-rich stars.","Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Energy & Climate Res IEK 6, D-52425 Julich, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Research Center Julich,"Kowalski, PM (corresponding author), Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Energy & Climate Res IEK 6, Wilhelm Johnen Str, D-52425 Julich, Germany.",p.kowalski@fz-juelich.de,"Kowalski, Piotr M/L-7411-2013","Kowalski, Piotr M/0000-0001-6604-3458",,,,,27,16,16,0,7,EDP SCIENCES S A,LES ULIS CEDEX A,"17, AVE DU HOGGAR, PA COURTABOEUF, BP 112, F-91944 LES ULIS CEDEX A, FRANCE",0004-6361,1432-0746,,ASTRON ASTROPHYS,Astron.

The construction of green roofs is an important means to optimize the urban thermal environment, especially in high-density urban areas. However, the cooling effect of green roofs in different urban spatial forms varies. Thus, the quantitative evaluation of the cooling effect of green roofs is significant for the scientific and effective mitigation of the UHI effect. This study took the central district of Chengdu City as a typical area, clearly classified urban spatial form types based on the LCZ theory, and quantified the relative land surface temperature (RLST) difference between before (2014) and after (2018) the implementation of green roofs based on Landsat 8 remote sensing image retrieval. Numerical analysis methods were used to statistically evaluate the cooling effect of green roofs under different urban spatial form types by GIS. The results showed that (1) the cooling effect of green roofs varied significantly among different urban spatial form types; (2) the best performance of the cooling effect of green roofs was in Compact Highrise (LCZ1), which could reduce RLST by 0.94 degrees C, while the worst was in Lightweight Lowrise (LCZ7). Based on the above performance of the cooling effect of green roofs, the construction of green roofs can be prioritized and zoned, and the design strategies of green roofs under different urban spatial form types can be proposed. Our study will provide a basis for developing design guidance for green roofs and scientific support for mitigating the urban thermal environment.","[Zuo, Jin; Ma, Jiahe] Tianjin Univ, Sch Architecture, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China; [Zuo, Jin; Ma, Jiahe] Tianjin Lab Creat Urban Design, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China; [Lin, Tao; Lin, Meixia] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Urban Environm, Key Lab Urban Environm & Hlth, Xiamen 361021, Peoples R China; [Lin, Tao; Luo, Jiancheng] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Dong, Jing] Dalian Univ Technol, Sch Architecture & Fine Art, Dalian 116085, Peoples R China; [Luo, Jiancheng] Chinese Acad Sci, Aerosp Informat Res Inst, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China","Tianjin University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Urban Environment, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Dalian University of Technology; Chinese Academy of Sciences","Zuo, J (corresponding author), Tianjin Univ, Sch Architecture, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China.",zuojin0117@tju.edu.cn,"Luo, jian/HGE-7331-2022","Ma, Jiahe/0000-0003-1222-1081","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFC0502903]; Major Special Project-the China High-Resolution Earth Observation System [30-Y30F06-9003-20/22]; International Partnership Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences [132C35KYSB20200007]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [42071316]; Seed Foundation of Tianjin University [2022XSC-0028, 2022XSC-0025]",National Key Research and Development Program of China; Major Special Project-the China High-Resolution Earth Observation System; International Partnership Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Seed Foundation of Tianjin University,"This research was funded by the National Key Research and Development Program of China, grant number 2016YFC0502903; Major Special Project-the China High-Resolution Earth Observation System grant number 30-Y30F06-9003-20/22; the International Partnership Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences, grant number 132C35KYSB20200007, the National Natural Science Foundation of China, grant number 42071316; and the Seed Foundation of Tianjin University, grant number 2022XSC-0028, 2022XSC-0025.",,45,1,1,44,44,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0360-1323,1873-684X,,BUILD ENVIRON,Build.

In this method, the variation of emissivity with wavelength for different surface targets was not taken into consideration. Based on state-of-the-art laboratory measurements of reflectance spectra of terrestrial materials by Salisbury and D'Aria, it is found that the brightness temperature differences between the 8- and 11-mum bands for soils, rocks and minerals, and dry vegetation can vary between approximately -8 and +8 K due solely to surface emissivity variations. The large brightness temperature differences are sufficient to cause false detection of cirrus clouds from remote sensing data acquired over certain surface targets using the 8-11-12-mum method directly. It is suggested that the 8-11-12-mum method should be improved to include the surface emissivity effects. In addition, it is recommended that in the future the variation of surface emissivity with wavelength should be taken into account in algorithms for retrieving surface temperatures and low-level atmospheric temperature and water vapor profiles.","NASA,GODDARD SPACE FLIGHT CTR,CLIMATE & RADIAT BRANCH,GREENBELT,MD 20771",National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center,"GAO, BC (corresponding author), NASA,GODDARD SPACE FLIGHT CTR,UNIV SPACE RES ASSOC,CODE 913,GREENBELT,MD 20771, USA.",,"Wiscombe, Warren J/D-4665-2012","Wiscombe, Warren J/0000-0001-6844-9849",,,,,6,8,8,0,2,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693",0894-8763,,,J APPL METEOROL,J.

Two adult and seven juvenile springbok (Antidorcas marsupialis) teeth from the archaeological site SK400 were analyzed. This site, located in the Namaqualand desert on the west coast of South Africa has yielded a large number of small-medium bovids, likely all springbok. These springbok were killed in a single episode between 1438 and 1641 CE, during the Little Ice Age (LIA). The juvenile springbok were significantly more depleted in C-13 and enriched in N-15 compared with the adults. During the four to six months over which their teeth developed, the juveniles consumed a higher proportion of C-3 plants and were exposed to greater aridity than the adults at equivalent ages. Based on dental wear, the adults are estimated to be between 3.5 and 7.5 years old at death, so the isotope values in their teeth record diet and environmental conditions several years earlier. In addition, the juveniles (but not the adults) show a trend towards more negative delta C-13 values and very high delta N-15 (up to + 18.9 parts per thousand) during the period of tooth formation, truncated by the animals' death. We infer that the animals were killed during an extreme drought. Informed by the archaeological evidence, we surmise that this was probably a herd of springbok on 'trek' in search of food and water, as this species is known to do during droughts. Although palaeoenvironmental proxies for the region as a whole suggest that Namaqualand was cool and wet during the Little Ice Age, this study indicates at least one period of drought, contributing to the developing picture of highly variable climates in southern Africa during the Holocene.","[Hopper, Courtneay; Dewar, Genevieve] Univ Toronto, Dept Anthropol, 19 Russell St, Toronto, ON M5S 2S2, Canada; [Sealy, Judith C.] Univ Cape Town, Dept Archaeol, Private Bag X3, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa; [Dewar, Genevieve] Univ Witwatersrand, Rock Art Res Inst, Private Bag X3, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Toronto; University of Cape Town; University of Witwatersrand,"Hopper, C (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Anthropol, 19 Russell St, Toronto, ON M5S 2S2, Canada.",courtneay.hopper@mail.utoronto.ca,,"Dewar, Genevieve/0000-0003-3202-4720; Sealy, Judith/0000-0001-5071-8211",University of Toronto; South African Research Chairs Initiative of the Department of Science and Technology; National Research Foundation of South Africa [84407],University of Toronto(University of Toronto); South African Research Chairs Initiative of the Department of Science and Technology; National Research Foundation of South Africa(National Research Foundation - South Africa),"We thank the following at the Archaeology Department and Stable Light Isotope Laboratory at the University of Cape Town for assistance: Lynn Cable, Louisa Hutten, John Lanham, Julie Luyt, Ian Newton, and Deano Stynder.

In the case of megafauna, it remains challenging to disentangle climate change and the activities of Palaeolithic hunter-gatherers as the main cause. In contrast, the impact of humans on rodent populations is likely to be negligible. This study investigated which climatic and/or environmental factors affect the population dynamics of the common vole. This temperate rodent is widespread across Europe and was one of the most abundant small mammal species throughout the Late Pleistocene. Location Europe. Taxon Common vole (Microtus arvalis). Methods We generated a dataset comprised of 4.2 kb long fragment of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from 148 ancient and 51 modern specimens sampled from multiple localities across Europe and covering the last 60 thousand years (ka). We used Bayesian inference to reconstruct their phylogenetic relationships and to estimate the age of the specimens that were not directly dated. Results We estimated the time to the most recent common ancestor of all last glacial and extant common vole lineages to be 90 ka ago and the divergence of the main mtDNA lineages present in extant populations to between 55 and 40 ka ago, which is earlier than most previous estimates. We detected several lineage turnovers in Europe during the period of high climate variability at the end of Marine Isotope Stage 3 (MIS 3; 57-29 ka ago) in addition to those found previously around the Pleistocene/Holocene transition. In contrast, data from the Western Carpathians suggest continuity throughout the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) even at high latitudes. Main Conclusions The main factor affecting the common vole populations during the last glacial period was the decrease in open habitat during the interstadials, whereas climate deterioration during the LGM had little impact on population dynamics. This suggests that the rapid environmental change rather than other factors was the major force shaping the histories of the Late Pleistocene faunas.","[Baca, Mateusz; Popovic, Danijela] Univ Warsaw, Ctr New Technol, Warsaw, Poland;

Toward more effective and integrated drought management, we introduce a conceptual drought diagnosis framework inspired by diagnostic concepts from the field of medicine. This framework comprises five steps: 1. Initial diagnostic assessment; 2. Diagnostic testing; 3. Consultation; 4. Communication of the diagnosis; and 5. Treatment and prognosis. To illustrate the need for the proposed approach, four case studies of recently drought-affected regions were selected: the city of Cape Town, the state of California, the Northeast region of Brazil, and the Horn of Africa. Contrasting elements for these cases include the geographic extent and political boundaries, climate, socio-economics, and the relevance of different water resources (e.g., rainfall, reservoirs, and aquifers). For each case, we identified documented practices and policies and reflected on them in terms of drought misdiagnosis or incomplete diagnosis that have aggravated socio-economic and environmental drought impacts. A common example is the preference for technical solutions (e.g., installing infrastructure to augment water supply), rather than measures that reduce vulnerability. Analysis of these four drought case studies confirmed the anticipated need for a comprehensive approach to drought diagnosis for more successful treatment and prevention of drought. Using an analogy with medical science can be helpful toward comprehensively diagnosing droughts for a variety of contexts and assessing the effectiveness of proposed interventions. This framework can help drought managers to be more proactive in enabling drought-affected regions to become more drought resilient in the future.","[Walker, David W.; Kchouk, Sarra; Van Oel, Pieter R.] Wageningen Univ, Water Resources Management Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Cavalcante, Louise; Dewulf, Art] Wageningen Univ, Publ Adm & Policy Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Ribeiro Neto, Germano G.; Melsen, Lieke A.] Wageningen Univ, Hydrol & Quantitat Water Management Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Gondim, Rubens S.] Embrapa Agroind Trop, Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil; [Rodrigues Martins, Eduardo S.

But it is also intricate since biogenic contaminants are harmful to state-of-the-art anode materials. In this work the influence of phenol as a biogenic model contaminant on the performance of single solid oxide fuel cells was studied under realistic conditions. For this purpose Ni/YSZ anode supported cells were operated with simulated bio-syngas, applying an electrical load of 0.34 A/cm(2). Over a duration of several hundreds of hours phenol was periodically added to the fuel gas. The tests showed that for the lowest concentration of phenol no accelerated degradation could be observed regarding cell potential and electrical impedance measurements, but disintegration of the Ni/YSZ support took place. Metal dusting of the anode support was found to be the most important mechanism of degradation. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

To make this substitution the use of PCM (phase change materials) panels incorporated into external wall structure are considered. The analysis of wall structures is carried out by modeling the energy balance of a room concentrating on the heat gains and losses through the walls. The resulting dynamic building model has been used in numerical simulations. Simulation studies have been performed for different types of wall structure under changing weather conditions. A wall with external PCM composite panel and its dynamic thermal performance is simulated and results analyzed thermally. The results show that in a high latitude climate external light mass walls should contain insulation in an external layer if it is combined with a PCM panel Such lightweight external walls can substitute standard heavy mass walls comprised of insulation and brick (or concrete or other standard high thermal mass structure).

However, understanding the quantitative contribution of particular coastal systems to adult fish populations is of utmost importance to secure sustainable fish resources. Routinely, marker elements indicating certain hydrological conditions, which are incorporated into calcified structures, the so-called otoliths, are used to trace the origin of fish. However, as in the Baltic Sea, small and large scale salinity gradients potentially masking specific salinity signals. Based on the entire elemental inventory of the otolith core region, indicating the chemical signature of the spawning area, we developed a unique elemental fingerprinting index (EFI), allowing comparisons of multi-elemental chemical signatures from within and between herring juvenile areas. Our results show significantly distinct chemical fingerprints on the scale of particular bays and estuaries, which were not detectable with the usual marker elements. We further demonstrate that heavy metals levels drive the potential to distinguish natal origin of herring. These findings provide an essential baseline for further studies on the impact of small scale productivity for exploited fish resources and central components of marine food webs.","[Moll, Dorothee; von Nordheim, Lena; Polte, Patrick] Thunen Inst Baltic Sea Fisheries, Rostock, Germany; [Moll, Dorothee; Kotterba, Paul; von Nordheim, Lena] Univ Hamburg, Inst Marine Ecosyst & Fisheries Sci, Hamburg, Germany; [Jochum, Klaus Peter] Max Planck Inst Chem, Dept Climate Geochem, Mainz, Germany",Johann Heinrich von Thunen Institute; University of Hamburg; Max Planck Society,"Moll, D (corresponding author), Thunen Inst Baltic Sea Fisheries, Rostock, Germany.;Moll, D (corresponding author), Univ Hamburg, Inst Marine Ecosyst & Fisheries Sci, Hamburg, Germany.",dorothee.moll@thuenen.de,,,"BONUS INSPIRE; BONUS BIO-C3; BONUS - European Union [Art 185, BMBF 03F0681, 03F0682]; BONUS - Federal Ministry of Education and Research of Germany [Art 185, BMBF 03F0681, 03F0682]; German Federal Environmental Foundation (DBU); EU Data Collection Framework (DCF); Thunen Institute of Baltic Sea Fisheries, Rostock, Germany","BONUS INSPIRE; BONUS BIO-C3; BONUS - European Union; BONUS - Federal Ministry of Education and Research of Germany; German Federal Environmental Foundation (DBU); EU Data Collection Framework (DCF); Thunen Institute of Baltic Sea Fisheries, Rostock, Germany","The research leading to these results received funding from BONUS INSPIRE (DM) and BONUS BIO-C3 (PK), the joint Baltic Sea research and development program by BONUS (Art 185), funded jointly by the European Union and the Federal Ministry of Education and Research of Germany (BMBF 03F0681; 03F0682).

We explore the effects of dynamic forcing, ice nucleation mechanisms, and ice crystal growth rate on the evolution and distribution of water vapor and cloud properties in nighttime cirrus clouds using a one-dimensional cloud model with bin microphysics and remote sensing measurements obtained at the Department of Energy's Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Climate Research Facility located near Lamont, OK. We forced the model using both large-scale vertical ascent and, for the first time, mean mesoscale velocity derived from radar Doppler velocity measurements. Both heterogeneous and homogeneous nucleation processes are explored, where a classical theory heterogeneous scheme is compared with empirical representations. We evaluated model simulations by examining both bulk cloud properties and distributions of measured radar reflectivity, lidar extinction, and water vapor profiles, as well as retrieved cloud microphysical properties. Our results suggest that mesoscale variability is the primary mechanism needed to reproduce observed quantities. Model sensitivity to the ice growth rate is also investigated. The most realistic simulations as compared with observations are forced using mesoscale waves, include fast ice crystal growth, and initiate ice by either homogeneous or heterogeneous nucleation. Simulated ice crystal number concentrations (tens to hundreds particles per liter) are typically two orders of magnitude smaller than previously published results based on aircraft measurements in cirrus clouds, although higher concentrations are possible in isolated pockets within the nucleation zone.","[Comstock, Jennifer M.] Pacific NW Natl Lab, Atmospher Sci & Global Change Div, Richland, WA 99352 USA; [Lin, Ruei-Fong] Univ Maryland, NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Goddard Earth Sci & Technol Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; [Starr, David O'C.] NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Atmospher & Space Phys Lab, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; [Yang, Ping] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Pacific Northwest National Laboratory; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Comstock, JM (corresponding author), Pacific NW Natl Lab, Atmospher Sci & Global Change Div, POB 999,MSIN K9-24, Richland, WA 99352 USA.",jennifer.comstock@pnl.gov,"Yang, Ping/B-4590-2011","Yang, Ping/0000-0001-6803-9903; Comstock, Jennifer/0000-0002-4183-7355",DOE Office of Science; Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program,DOE Office of Science(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program,"Research performed by Jennifer M.

Consequently, artistic output of the period is more easily examined in terms of iconography, patronage, and wider social and historical trends. This article, however, considers a unique but neglected corpus of tiny inscriptions hidden in miniatures painted by assistants of the Bourges-based book illuminator Jean Colombe (ca. 1430-93) and his sons Philibert and Francois in order to understand the temperament of these often voiceless and nameless artisans. The minute strings of text, found within a closely connected group of illuminated vernacular history texts, contain complaints in French about wasted time, labor without profit, and days lost in loyal service. A careful examination of the manuscripts has revealed additional inscriptions of this type beyond those already noted. In terms of content, these inscriptions are virtually unprecedented in the history of manuscript illumination, though they are representative of wider patterns of social discord between masters and journeymen at the end of the Middle Ages. By situating these complaints within both the immediate context of the overburdened Colombe workshop and the wider cultural and economic climate, this investigation provides new insight into the concerns, grievances, and preoccupations of artists at the close of the fifteenth century. The article problematizes the idea of a monolithic and harmonious workplace while shedding light on an otherwise lost network of artistic relationships.</p>","[Herman, Nicholas] Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Pennsylvania,"Herman, N (corresponding author), Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",,,"Herman, Nicholas/0000-0003-0216-9849",,,,,190,0,0,0,1,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0016-920X,2169-3099,,GESTA,Gesta- Int.

Mountain forests are ideal for providing forest baths because of their large area and ecological environment. The regulatory mechanism of a mountain forest plant community in a microenvironment conducive to forest bathing is the theoretical basis for promoting physical and mental health through forest bathing in mountain forests. Based on field investigations and measurements, differences in the daily universal thermal climate index (UTCI), negative air ion (NAI), and airborne particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) levels in nine elevation gradients, six plant community types, and six plant community canopy parameter gradients were quantitatively analyzed. In addition, the correlations between these variables and various canopy parameters were further established. The results showed the following: (1) Altitude had a significant influence on the daily UTCI, NAI, PM2.5, and PM10 levels in the summer. The daily UTCI, NAI, PM2.5, and PM10 levels gradually decreased with the increase in altitude. For every 100 m increase in altitude, the daily UTCI decreased by 0.62 degrees C, the daily NAI concentration decreased by 108 ions/cm(3), and the daily PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations decreased by 0.60 and 3.45 mu g/m(3), respectively. (2) There were significant differences in the daily UTCI, NAI, PM2.5, and PM10 levels among different plant communities in the summer. Among the six plant communities, the Quercus variabilis forest (QVF) had the lowest daily UTCI and the best thermal comfort evaluation. The QVF and Pinus tabuliformis forest (PTF) had a higher daily NAI concentration and lower daily PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations. (3) The characteristics of the plant community canopy, canopy density (CD), canopy porosity (CP), leaf area index (LAI), and sky view factor (SVF), had significant effects on the daily UTCI and NAI concentration, but had no significant effects on the daily PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations in the summer. The plant community with higher CD and LAI, but lower CP and SVF, showed a higher daily UTCI and a higher daily NAI concentration. In conclusion, the QVF and PTF plant communities with higher CD and LAI but lower CP and SVF at lower elevations are more suitable for forest bathing in the summer in mountainous forests at lower altitudes. The results of this study provide an economical, feasible, and sustainable guide for the location of forest bathing activities and urban greening planning to promote people's physical and mental health.","[Wang, Rui; Wang, Dexiang] Northwest Agr & Forestry Univ, Coll Forestry, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Chen, Qi] Northwest Agr & Forestry Univ, Coll Landscape Architecture & Art, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China",Northwest A&F University - China; Northwest A&F University - China,"Wang, DX (corresponding author), Northwest Agr & Forestry Univ, Coll Forestry, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",wangrui_nwafu@163.com; chenqi0174@163.com; wangdx6666@163.com,,,National 12th Five-Year Scientific and Technological Support Plan [2015BAD07B06],National 12th Five-Year Scientific and Technological Support Plan,This research was funded by the National 12th Five-Year Scientific and Technological Support Plan (grant no. 2015BAD07B06).,,56,0,0,7,14,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,APR,2022,7,,,,,,3882,10.3390/su14073882,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14073882,,,22,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,0K9TV,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000781130300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the relatively recent discovery of direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET) brings a new opportunity to improve the efficiency of biogas technology. DIET may replace mediated interspecies electron transfer (MIET) by efficient electron transfer between exoelectrogens and electrotrophic methanogens, thereby enhancing yields and rates of biogas production. Ethanol, as the initial electron donor in the discovery of the DIET pathway, is now a hot topic in the literature. Recent studies have indicated that ethanol in AD functions not only as the substrate, but also as the precursor to stimulate DIET by enriching exoelectrogens and electrotrophic methanogens for co-digesting complex organic wastes. This review aims to highlight the state of the art and recent advances in ethanol-based DIET in AD. The DIET associated reactions of ethanol oxidation and carbon dioxide reduction are assessed by thermodynamic analysis to reveal the extent of the potential for improvement of the AD processes that utilizes DIET pathways. Three ethanol-based DIET strategies are discussed: (1) ethanol as the sole substrate supplemented with conductive materials in AD, (2) ethanol co-digestion with complex substrates and (3) ethanol-type fermentation prior to AD. This review aims to chart the pathways for improved AD performance by utilizing ethanol-based DIET in specific treatments of biological wastes.","[Feng, Dong; Guo, Xiaobo; Xia, Ao; Huang, Yun; Liao, Qiang; Zhu, Xianqing; Zhu, Xun] Chongqing Univ, Key Lab Low Grade Energy Utilizat Technol & Syst, Minist Educ, Chongqing 400044, Peoples R China; [Feng, Dong; Guo, Xiaobo; Xia, Ao; Huang, Yun; Liao, Qiang; Zhu, Xianqing; Zhu, Xun] Chongqing Univ, Sch Energy & Power Engn, Inst Engn Thermophys, Chongqing 400044, Peoples R China; [Lin, Richen; Murphy, Jerry D.] Univ Coll Cork, MaREI Ctr, Environm Res Inst, Cork, Ireland; [Lin, Richen; Murphy, Jerry D.] Univ Coll Cork, Civil Struct & Environm Engn, Sch Engn & Architecture, Cork, Ireland",Chongqing University; Chongqing University; University College Cork; University College Cork,"Xia, A (corresponding author), Chongqing Univ, Key Lab Low Grade Energy Utilizat Technol & Syst, Minist Educ, Chongqing 400044, Peoples R China.",aoxia@cqu.edu.cn,"Murphy, Jerry D/ABH-3038-2020","Murphy, Jerry D/0000-0003-2120-1357","National Natural Science Foundation of China [52022015, 51876016]; Fundamental Research Funds for Central Universities [2020CDJQY-A054]; State Key Program of National Natural Science of China [51836001]; Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) through the MaREI Centre for Energy, Climate, and Marine [12/RC/2302_P2, 16/SP/3829]; Environmental Protection Agency - Ireland [2018-RE-MS-13]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); State Key Program of National Natural Science of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) through the MaREI Centre for Energy, Climate, and Marine(Science Foundation Ireland); Environmental Protection Agency - Ireland(United States Environmental Protection Agency)","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 52022015, 51876016), the Fundamental Research Funds for Central Universities (2020CDJQY-A054), and the State Key Program of National Natural Science of China (No. 51836001).

This study investigates one of the most severe forecast busts for Europe in the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts integrated forecasting system (IFS) in recent years. The forecast bust occurred in March 2016 and was associated with a misforecast of the onset of a blocking regime. We investigate the evolution of the forecast error in the IFS ensemble by employing a potential vorticity perspective combined with Lagrangian diagnostics. We show that the error grows rapidly from an initially small perturbation in the detailed structure of an upper-level trough near Newfoundland. This trough triggers strong diabatic warm conveyor belt activity in the North Atlantic region. The misrepresentation of this warm conveyor belt activity in the ensemble forecast amplifies the initial condition error and communicates it downstream into Europe. Specifically, the ensemble underestimates poleward warm conveyor belt ascent and associated warm conveyor belt outflow into high latitudes. Instead, all ensemble members forecast too strong warm conveyor belt outflow further to the south, which ultimately results in a wrong forecast of the upper-level Rossby wave pattern over Europe. This case study shows that warm conveyor belts and the associated latent heat release in slantwise ascending air can trigger a nonlinear feedback mechanism that amplifies forecast error strongly and communicates it into regions far downstream. It corroborates the fact that multiscale interactions and moist-and dry-dynamical processes ranging from microphysical to synoptic scales need to be represented accurately in numerical weather prediction, in order to predict the extratropical large-scale circulation correctly.","[Grams, Christian M.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, Zurich, Switzerland; [Grams, Christian M.] KIT, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, IMK, TRO, Karlsruhe, Germany; [Magnusson, Linus] European Ctr Medium Range Weather Forecasts ECMWF, Reading, Berks, England; [Madonna, Erica] Univ Bergen, Geophys Inst, Bergen, Norway; [Madonna, Erica] Univ Bergen, Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, Bergen, Norway",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF); University of Bergen; Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research; University of Bergen,"Grams, CM (corresponding author), KIT, Inst Meteorol & Klimaforsch, Postfach 3640, D-76021 Karlsruhe, Germany.",grams@kit.edu,"Grams, Christian M/E-5331-2016","Grams, Christian M/0000-0003-3466-9389; Madonna, Erica/0000-0002-8656-8187; Magnusson, Linus/0000-0003-4707-2231",Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) Ambizione fellowship [PZ00P2_148177/1]; Helmholtz Young Investigator Group grant [VH-NG-1243]; Research Council of Norway project jetSTREAM [231716],Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) Ambizione fellowship(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Helmholtz Young Investigator Group grant; Research Council of Norway project jetSTREAM,"We thank three anonymous reviewers for their critical comments, which helped to improve the presentation of our results.

The study revealed that there are three types of floating islands in KVWE which vary considerably in their origin, development, species composition, community and physical structure and sustenance even though there are common vegetation elements. Among the three types the type-1 which formed in deep excavated portions of abandoned rice fields is found as the biotic climax in the ecological succession. Continuous abandoning of rice fields, stagnation, nutrient enrichment, proliferation of exotic invasive plants and less salinity and tidal flow are the major ecological factors which are found promoting this recent formation of floating islands here indicating the level of deterioration of the ecosystem. KVWE is one of the fast changing wetland sites of the world located in the State of Kerala, India with well developed and ancient culture, economy, art and rich biodiversity.

Consequently, this tephra offers great potential to assess any leads and lags in environmental responses to this abrupt climatic transition. New grain-specific glass analysis (EMPA and LA-ICP-MS) of the type locality Y-3 tephra recorded in the Ionian Sea confirms its origin from Campi Flegrei (CF) but reveals that it is compositionally different from the previously suggested proximal equivalent the VRa eruptive unit (Verdolino Valley, CF). Consequently, the Ar-40/Ar-39 age of the VRa should not be exported distally to the Y-3 tephra. Instead, we propose a new robust age for the Y-3 tephra following its identification in the Tenaghi Philippon sedimentary record, NE Greece. A Bayesian-based C-14 age model from Tenaghi Philippon provides a distal age of 28,680-29,420 cal yrs BP for the Y-3 tephra. The identification of this tephra in NE Greece markedly extends its known eastern dispersal. Whilst its stratigraphic position falls within the latter part of a period of low tree pollen percentages related to dry stadial conditions. This new age and environmental context suggest that this marker postdates the onset of HS3 in the eastern Mediterranean region by similar to 2300 years. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Current opinions about this episode expose the contrast between those who see H. erectus as a highly social, cooperative species seeking out new ecological opportunities to exploit, and those preferring a passive, climate driven explanation for such an event. By using geostatistics techniques and probabilistic models, we characterised the ecological context of H. erectus dispersal, from its East African origin to the colonization of Eurasia, taking into account both the presence of other large mammals and the physical characteristics of the landscape as potential factors. Our model indicated that H. erectus followed almost passively the large herbivore fauna during its dispersal. In Africa, the dispersal was statistically associated with the presence of large freshwater bodies (Rift Valley Lakes). In Eurasia, the presence of H. erectus was associated with the occurrence of geological outcrops likely yielding unconsolidated flint. During the early phase of dispersal, our model indicated that H. erectus actively avoided areas densely populated by large carnivores. This pattern weakened as H. erectus dispersed over Europe, possibly because of the decreasing presence of carnivores there plus the later acquisition of Acheulean technology. During this later phase, H. erectus was associated with limestone and shaley marl, and seems to have been selecting for high-elevation sites. While our results do not directly contradict the idea that H. erectus may have been an active hunter, they clearly point to the fact that predator avoidance may have conditioned its long-distance diffusion as it moved outside Africa. The modelled dispersal route suggests that H. erectus remained preferentially associated with low/middle latitude (i.e., comparatively warm) sites throughout its colonization history.

At the core of this technology is the electrolyte, and whether this is acidic or alkaline affects the reaction mechanisms, gas purities and is of significant importance for the stability and activity of the electrocatalysts. This article presents a simple but precise physical model to describe the voltage-current characteristic, heat balance, gas crossover and cell efficiency of water electrolyzers. State-of-the-art water electrolysis cells with acidic and alkaline electrolyte are experimentally characterized in order to parameterize the model. A rigorous comparison shows that alkaline water electrolyzers with Ni-based catalysts but thinner separators than those typically used is expected be more efficient than acidic water electrolysis with Ir and Pt based catalysts. This performance difference was attributed mainly to a similar conductivity but approximately 38-fold higher diffusivities of hydrogen and oxygen in the acidic polymer electrolyte membrane (Nafion) than those in the alkaline separator (Zirfon filled with a 30 wt% KOH solution). With reference to the detailed analysis of the cell characteristics, perspectives for the improvement of the efficiency of water electrolyzers are discussed. (C) The Author(s) 2016. Published by ECS.

However, hybrid DA requires a separate ensemble DA to estimate the uncertainty in the deterministic variational DA, which can be suboptimal both technically and scientifically. A new framework called the ensemble variational integrated localized (EVIL) data assimilation addresses this inconvenience by updating the ensemble analyses using information from the variational deterministic system. The goal of EVIL is to encompass and generalize existing ensemble Kalman filter methods in a variational framework. Particular attention is devoted to the affordability and efficiency of the algorithm in preparation for operational applications.","[Auligne, Thomas; Menetrier, Benjamin] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [Auligne, Thomas] Univ Maryland, Joint Ctr Satellite Data Assimilat, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Auligne, Thomas] Univ Maryland, Earth Syst Sci Interdisciplinary Ctr, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Lorenc, Andrew C.] Met Off, Exeter, Devon, England; [Buehner, Mark] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Data Assimilat & Satellite Meteorol Res Sect, Dorval, PQ, Canada",National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; Met Office - UK; Environment & Climate Change Canada,"Auligne, T (corresponding author), Joint Ctr Satellite Data Assimilat, DSRC Bldg 33,325 Broadway, Boulder, CO 80305 USA.",thomas.auligne@noaa.gov,"Ménétrier, Benjamin/ABG-7190-2021","Ménétrier, Benjamin/0000-0002-2593-3398; Buehner, Mark/0000-0001-5555-0411",Air Force Weather Agency; Div Atmospheric & Geospace Sciences [0939961] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,Air Force Weather Agency; Div Atmospheric & Geospace Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)),"Authors would like to thank Chris Snyder (NCAR), Yann Michel (CNRM-GAME/Meteo-France), and Marc Bocquet (CEREA/INRIA) for numerous fruitful discussions during the development of EVIL and Luke Peffers (US Air Force) for his early contribution.

Here we present a novel framework for spatial conservation prioritization based on reinforcement learning that consistently outperforms available state-of-the-art software using simulated and empirical data. Our methodology, conservation area prioritization through artificial intelligence (CAPTAIN), quantifies the trade-off between the costs and benefits of area and biodiversity protection, allowing the exploration of multiple biodiversity metrics. Under a limited budget, our model protects significantly more species from extinction than areas selected randomly or naively (such as based on species richness). CAPTAIN achieves substantially better solutions with empirical data than alternative software, meeting conservation targets more reliably and generating more interpretable prioritization maps. Regular biodiversity monitoring, even with a degree of inaccuracy characteristic of citizen science surveys, further improves biodiversity outcomes. Artificial intelligence holds great promise for improving the conservation and sustainable use of biological and ecosystem values in a rapidly changing and resource-limited world. Artificial intelligence methods can help biodiversity conservation planning in a rapidly evolving world. A framework based on reinforcement learning quantifies the trade-off between the costs and benefits of area and biodiversity protection and achieves better solutions with empirical data than alternative methods.","[Silvestro, Daniele] Univ Fribourg, Dept Biol, Fribourg, Switzerland; [Silvestro, Daniele] Swiss Inst Bioinformat, Fribourg, Switzerland; [Silvestro, Daniele; Antonelli, Alexandre] Univ Gothenburg, Gothenburg Global Biodivers Ctr, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Goria, Stefano] Thymia, London, England; [Sterner, Thomas] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Antonelli, Alexandre] Univ Oxford, Dept Plant Sci, Oxford, England; [Antonelli, Alexandre] Royal Bot Gardens, Richmond, England","University of Fribourg; Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics; University of Gothenburg; University of Gothenburg; University of Oxford; Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew","Silvestro, D (corresponding author), Univ Fribourg, Dept Biol, Fribourg, Switzerland.;Silvestro, D (corresponding author), Swiss Inst Bioinformat, Fribourg, Switzerland.;Silvestro, D; Antonelli, A (corresponding author), Univ Gothenburg, Gothenburg Global Biodivers Ctr, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, Gothenburg, Sweden.;Antonelli, A (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Dept Plant Sci, Oxford, England.;Antonelli, A (corresponding author), Royal Bot Gardens, Richmond, England.",daniele.silvestro@unifr.ch; a.antonelli@kew.org,"Antonelli, Alexandre/A-5353-2011","Antonelli, Alexandre/0000-0003-1842-9297; Silvestro, Daniele/0000-0003-0100-0961","Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research [FFL15-0196]; Swedish Research Council [VR 2019-05191, VR: 2019-04739]; Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew; Strategic Research Area Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services in a Changing Climate, BECC - Swedish government; Swiss National Science Foundation [PCEFP3_187012]","Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research(Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research); Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research CouncilEuropean Commission); Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew; Strategic Research Area Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services in a Changing Climate, BECC - Swedish government; Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission)","We thank K.

This fact will lead to a severe shortage of civil engineers in the coming years. However these professionals will be especially needed to tackle infrastructure construction and rehabilitation on a context of climate change and increased world population. Part of the explanation for the low attraction capability of civil engineering relates to the fact that this course is viewed as low tech. A scientific and technical upgrade of the civil engineering curriculum is, therefore, needed. Nano and biotech based materials and technologies for the smart built environment could refresh the attraction of this area. The environmental challenges faced by a Planet that has about 220,000 new inhabitants each day and that will have more than 9,7 billion people by 2050 and 11,2 billion by 2100 means that a strong eco-efficiency focus of the new curriculum is also needed.

Batches of up to 10(5) genetically identical sporophyte seedlings can be produced at any time in the laboratory and explanted in the field for production of biomass. Sexual crosses of selected Macrocystis pyrifera gametophyte parents of different geographic origin along the coast of Chile showed heterosis and produced sporophyte batches with superior growth performance. Starting from zygotes, after 10 weeks in the laboratory and 5 months in the sea, our best hybrid genotypes grew up to 11 kg fresh weight per frond, which corresponds to 66 kg m(-1) of line in a commercial mariculture installation. In contrast, average yields of 14.4 and 22 kg m(-1) are reported in the literature for traditional methods. Additional experiments, including inter-specific crosses M. pyrifera x M. integrifolia and their performance in different climate zones of Chile, confirm that heterosis is a powerful tool for crop improvement in Macrocystis.

Understanding charge-transfer reactions at the anodeelectrolyte interface is the key to develop high-performance cells. By employing in-situ electrochemical atomic force microscopy (in-situ EC-AFM), in-depth insight into the electrochemically induced surface reaction processes on iron in concentrated alkaline electrolyte is obtained. The results highlight the formation and growth of the redox-layer on iron over the course of several oxidation/reduction cycles. By this means, a direct correlation between topography changes and the corresponding electrochemical reactions at the nanoscale could unambiguously be established. Here, the twofold character of the nanoparticulate redox-layer in terms of its passivating character and its contribution to the electrochemical reactions is elucidated. Furthermore, the evolution of single nanoparticles on the iron electrode surface is evaluated in unprecedented and artifact-free detail. Based on the dedicated topography analysis, a detailed structural model for the evolution of the redoxlayer which is likewise elementary for corrosion science and battery research is derived.","[Weinrich, Henning; Tempel, Hermann; Kungl, Hans; Eichel, Ruediger-A.] Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Energy & Climate Res, Fundamental Electrochem IEK 9, D-52425 Julich, Germany; [Come, Jeremy; Balke, Nina] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Ctr Nanophase Mat Sci, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA; [Weinrich, Henning; Eichel, Ruediger-A.] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Inst Phys Chem, Landoltweg 2, D-52074 Aachen, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Research Center Julich; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Oak Ridge National Laboratory; Center for Nanophase Materials Sciences; RWTH Aachen University,"Weinrich, H (corresponding author), Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Energy & Climate Res, Fundamental Electrochem IEK 9, D-52425 Julich, Germany.;Balke, N (corresponding author), Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Ctr Nanophase Mat Sci, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA.",h.weinrich@fz-juelich.de; balken@ornl.gov,"Balke, Nina/AAX-5523-2021; Eichel, Rüdiger-A./AAD-3521-2019; Balke, Nina/Q-2505-2015; Tempel, Hermann/D-8529-2012","Balke, Nina/0000-0001-5865-5892; Eichel, Rüdiger-A./0000-0002-0013-6325; Balke, Nina/0000-0001-5865-5892; Tempel, Hermann/0000-0002-9794-6403; Weinrich, Henning/0000-0001-9946-6078","German Federal Ministry of Education and Research [03EK3032]; Scientific User Facilities Division, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)","German Federal Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); Scientific User Facilities Division, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)(United States Department of Energy (DOE))","The authors are grateful for the financial support from the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research within the project 'High Temperature and Energy Materials - Resource-Efficient Metal-Air Batteries with High Energy Density' Project No. 03EK3032.

Using the Baltic Sea as a case study, a region of significant socio-economic importance in the northern hemisphere, we systematically synthesized the primary literature and summarized the current knowledge on ecosystem services derived from seagrass, macroalgae, and mussels (see animated video summary of the manuscript: Video abstract). We found 1740 individual ecosystem service records (ESR), 61% of which were related to macroalgae, 26% to mussel beds and 13% to seagrass meadows. The most frequently reported ecosystem services were raw material (533 ESR), habitat provision (262 ESR) and regulation of pollutants (215 ESR). Toxins (356 ESR) and nutrients (302 ESR) were the most well-documented pressures to services provided by coastal ecosystems. Next, we assessed the current state of knowledge as well as knowledge transfer of ecosystem services to policies through natural, social, human and economic dimensions, using a systematic scoring tool, the Eco-GAME matrix. We found good quantitative information about how ecosystems generated the service but almost no knowledge of how they translate into socio-economic benefits (8 out of 657 papers, 1.2%). While we are aware that research on Baltic Sea socio-economic benefits does exist, the link with ecosystems providing the service is mostly missing. To close this knowledge gap, we need a better analytical framework that is capable of directly linking existing quantitative information about ecosystem service generation with human benefit.

The methodological approach is based on the application of the state-of-the art Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model to R&D. By endogenizing R&D in global CGE models, it is possible to assess the impact of different public R&D policies on the food availability and food access of food security. This study found that R&D investments bring positive effects on the food access dimension of food security, particularly in places such as Sub-Saharan Africa where prices are expected to grow significantly by 2050, as agricultural land becomes scarcer and more expensive. Doubling the R&D intensity would soften the land constraints and substantially decelerate food prices, thus preventing the deterioration of living standards of rural households and leading to a gain in daily caloric consumption. The impact of alternative agricultural R&D policies on the various dimensions of food security has not been analyzed using a CGE framework, which enables capturing both the benefits and costs from R&D investments. Modeling the dynamic accumulation of R&D stocks makes it possible to analyze the effects of R&D on food security over time.","[Kristkova, Zuzana Smeets; van Dijk, Michiel; van Meijl, Hans] Wageningen Econ Res, Dept Int Policy, NL-2585 DB The Hague, Netherlands; [Kristkova, Zuzana Smeets] Czech Univ Life Sci, Fac Econ & Management, Prague 16521, Czech Republic; [van Dijk, Michiel] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Ecosyst Serv & Management Program, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria",Wageningen University & Research; Czech University of Life Sciences Prague; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA),"Kristkova, ZS (corresponding author), Wageningen Econ Res, Dept Int Policy, NL-2585 DB The Hague, Netherlands.;Kristkova, ZS (corresponding author), Czech Univ Life Sci, Fac Econ & Management, Prague 16521, Czech Republic.",Zuzana.Kristkova@wur.nl; vandijkm@iiasa.ac.at; hans.vanmeijl@wur.nl,"van Dijk, Michiel/AAE-8203-2019; van Meijl, Hans/G-6223-2015","van Dijk, Michiel/0000-0002-5207-7304; van Meijl, Hans/0000-0002-2455-6869; Smeets Kristkova, Zuzana/0000-0003-3100-7945",,,,,32,4,4,2,5,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY, W YORKSHIRE BD16 1WA, ENGLAND",1574-8715,,978-1-78714-515-3; 978-1-78714-516-0,FRONT ECON GLOBAL,,,2017,,,,,1,17,,10.1108/S1574-871520170000017001,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/S1574-871520170000017001,10.1108/S1574-8715201717,,17,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Development Studies; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Economics,Book Citation Index – Social Sciences & Humanities (BKCI-SSH); Book Citation Index – Science (BKCI-S),Agriculture; Development Studies; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Business & Economics,BM6DL,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000466470900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

So far, uncertainties in water management have mostly been assessed from a scientific point of view, and in quantitative terms. In this paper, we focus on the perspectives from water management practice, adopting a qualitative approach. We consider it important to know how uncertainties are framed in water management practice in order to develop practice relevant strategies for dealing with uncertainties. Framing refers to how people make sense of the world. With the aim of identifying what are important parameters for the framing of uncertainties in water management practice, in this paper we analyze uncertainty situations described by decision-makers in water management. The analysis builds on a series of Uncertainty Dialogues carried out within the NeWater project with water managers in the Rhine, Elbe and Guadiana basins in 2006. During these dialogues, representatives of these river basins were asked what uncertainties they encountered in their professional work life and how they confronted them. Analysing these dialogues we identified several important parameters of how uncertainties get framed. Our assumption is that making framing of uncertainty explicit for water managers will allow for better dealing with the respective uncertainty situations.","[Isendahl, Nicola; Brugnach, Marcela; Moellenkamp, Sabine; Pahl-Wostl, Claudia] Univ Osnabruck, Inst Environm Syst Res USF, Osnabruck, Germany; [Dewulf, Art] Wageningen Univ, Publ Adm & Policy Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Francois, Greet] Catholic Univ Louvain, Res Grp Work Org & Personnel Psychol, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium",University Osnabruck; Wageningen University & Research; Universite Catholique Louvain,"Isendahl, N (corresponding author), Univ Osnabruck, Inst Environm Syst Res USF, Osnabruck, Germany.",Nicola.Isendahl@usf.uos.de,"Dewulf, Art/C-1271-2010; Dewulf, Art/ABA-7434-2020; Brugnach, Marcela/M-8189-2013","Dewulf, Art/0000-0002-4171-7644; Dewulf, Art/0000-0002-4171-7644; Brugnach, Marcela/0000-0001-8522-8650",European Commission [Ndegrees511179-NeWater],European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre),"The work presented in this paper was financially supported by the European Commission (Contract N degrees 511179-NeWater).; We thank the participants of the Uncertainty Dialogues in the case studies of the Elbe, Guadiana, Kromme Rijn and Wupper for their kind collaboration and openness.; We further thank Catrin Egerton for proof-reading.",,26,26,26,0,22,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0920-4741,1573-1650,,WATER RESOUR MANAG,Water Resour.

However, critical issues of long-term stability have to be solved for commercialization. The severe weakness of the state-of-the-art PSCs against moisture originates mainly from the hygroscopic organic cations. Here, rubidium (Rb) is suggested as a promising candidate for an inorganic-organic mixed cation system to enhance moisture-tolerance and photovoltaic performances of formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI(3)). Partial incorporation of Rb in FAPbI(3) tunes the tolerance factor and stabilizes the photoactive perovskite structure. Phase conversion from hexagonal yellow FAPbI(3) to trigonal black FAPbI(3) becomes favored when Rb is introduced. The authors find that the absorbance and fluorescence lifetime of 5% Rb-incorporated FAPbI(3) (Rb(0.05)FA(0.95)PbI(3)) are enhanced than bare FAPbI(3). Rb(0.05)FA(0.95)PbI(3)-based PSCs exhibit a best power conversion efficiency of 17.16%, which is much higher than that of the FAPbI(3) device (13.56%). Moreover, it is demonstrated that the Rb(0.05)FA(0.95)PbI(3) film shows superior stability against high humidity (85%) and the full device made with the mixed perovskite exhibits remarkable long-term stability under ambient condition without encapsulation, retaining the high performance for 1000 h.","[Park, Yun Hee; Lee, Chul-Ho] Korea Univ, KU KIST Grad Sch Converging Sci & Technol, 145 Anam Ro, Seoul 02841, South Korea; [Park, Yun Hee; Jeong, Inyoung; Bae, Seunghwan; Son, Hae Jung; Lee, Phillip; Ko, Min Jae] KIST, Photoelect Hybrids Res Ctr, Seoul 02792, South Korea; [Jeong, Inyoung; Lee, Jinwoo] Pohang Univ Sci & Technol POSTECH, Dept Chem Engn, San 31 Hyoja Dong, Pohang 37673, South Korea; [Ko, Min Jae] Hanyang Univ, Dept Chem Engn, 222 Wangsimri Ro, Seoul 04763, South Korea",Korea University; Korea Institute of Science & Technology (KIST); Pohang University of Science & Technology (POSTECH); Hanyang University,"Lee, CH (corresponding author), Korea Univ, KU KIST Grad Sch Converging Sci & Technol, 145 Anam Ro, Seoul 02841, South Korea.;Ko, MJ (corresponding author), KIST, Photoelect Hybrids Res Ctr, Seoul 02792, South Korea.;Ko, MJ (corresponding author), Hanyang Univ, Dept Chem Engn, 222 Wangsimri Ro, Seoul 04763, South Korea.",chlee80@korea.ac.kr; mjko@hanyang.ac.kr,"Lee, Chul-Ho/D-2545-2009; Ko, Min Jae/AAC-4459-2020; Lee, Chul-Ho/AAI-6876-2020","Ko, Min Jae/0000-0002-4842-3235; Lee, Chul-Ho/0000-0003-1570-8688","Technology Development Program to Solve Climate Changes [2015M1A2A2056824]; Global Frontier R&D Program on Center for Multiscale Energy System [2012M3A6A7054856]; National Research Foundation under Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning, Korea; KU-KIST Graduate School of Converging Science and Technology Program; KIST institutional program","Technology Development Program to Solve Climate Changes; Global Frontier R&D Program on Center for Multiscale Energy System; National Research Foundation under Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning, Korea; KU-KIST Graduate School of Converging Science and Technology Program; KIST institutional program(Korea Institute of Science & Technology (KIST))","Y.H.P. and I.J. contributed equally to this work.

Such degradations essentially originate from the loose structure of the materials and the low interactive binding force among the PEM constituents. In this study, the need for simplified design principles of adhesives led to the use of mussel-inspired polydopamine (PD) as an interfacial modifier for the fabrication of highly durable PEM. Indeed, a self-polymerized dopamine layer acts as an interfacial glue, and enables efficient impregnation of a hydrophilic PFSA ionomer into porous hydrophobic PTFE with high packing density, resulting in strong adhesion between the PTFE and the PFSA polymers in the membrane. In addition, the redox property of the PD end groups spontaneously reduces the partial Ce salts in the ionomer solution and anchors them to the PD@PTFE substrate as defective cerium oxide (CeOx) nanoparticles, reducing the dissolution and subsequent migration under cell operations. Finally, a CePD@PTFE membrane shows outstanding durability in fuel cells under an accelerated humidity cycling test with a reduction in the degree of physical and chemical failures.","[Yoon, Ki Ro; Lee, Kyung Ah; Jo, Sunhee; Yook, Seung Ho; Kim, Jin Young] KIST, Fuel Cell Res Ctr, Hwarangno14,Gil 5, Seoul 02792, South Korea; [Lee, Kyung Ah; Lee, Kwan Young] Korea Univ, Dept Chem & Biol Engn, 145 Anam Ro, Seoul 02841, South Korea; [Kim, Il-Doo] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, 291 Daehak Ro, Daejeon 34141, South Korea",Korea Institute of Science & Technology (KIST); Korea University; Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST),"Kim, JY (corresponding author), KIST, Fuel Cell Res Ctr, Hwarangno14,Gil 5, Seoul 02792, South Korea.",jinykim@kist.re.kr,"Lee, Kwan-Young/F-7603-2013","Yoon, Ki Ro/0000-0003-3532-7911","KIST Institutional Programs [2E28271]; Global Frontier R&D Program on Center for Multiscale Energy System - Nation Research Foundation under the Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning, Korea [2016M3A6A7945505]; Technology Development Program to Solve Climate Changes of the National Research Foundation (NRF) - Ministry of Science, ICT, & Future Planning [NRF-2015M1A2A2056690]; Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education [2018R1A6A3A01011591]","KIST Institutional Programs; Global Frontier R&D Program on Center for Multiscale Energy System - Nation Research Foundation under the Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning, Korea; Technology Development Program to Solve Climate Changes of the National Research Foundation (NRF) - Ministry of Science, ICT, & Future Planning; Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education","K.R.Y. and K.A.L. contributed equally to this work.

The culture-history sequences of Iron Age is well established by pottery style and the sites had already been radiocarbon dated. Because the excavations were part of various research projects, rather than a specific OSL study, the sites have been destroyed and hence, local environmental radioactivity was unknown. To reconstruct the environmental dose rate, we used data from three sources: (1), a worldwide survey, (2), radionuclides in the pottery and (3) recent geological surveys. The geological surveys yielded the most dates that are reasonably close to the known chronology, reproducing the correct chronological order in most cases. Some dates, however, are 200 years too recent and some standard deviations too high. To evaluate further the potential of OSL dating in Iron Age research, dosimetry data need to be collected in situ.

J,"McGuire, L",,,,"McGuire, Laura",,,Loos in the Tropics: Alfred Preis and the Raumplan in Hawai'i,UMENI-ART,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"In two recent book analyzing Loos's design methods, The New Space: Movement and Experience in Viennese Modern Architecture (2106) and Adolf Loos: The Last Houses (2020), Christopher Long has argued that in his residential iterations of the Raumplan idea, Loos was invested in the optical and sensory impacts of his residences: he created complex pathways of procession with a studied attention to the ways in which materials, colors, and interlocking spatial volumes could enhance the visceral impact of an interior space on an inhabitant. This essay argues that in the work of the Austrian emigre architect, Alfred Preis (1911-1993), a similar approach to the Raumplan re-emerged in midcentury Hawai'i. By examining several examples of Preis's residential work between 1940 and 1955, including the Scudder Residence (1940), the Lau Residence (1951), the Panfiglio Residence (1952), and the Hudson Residence (1955), it contends that Preis borrowed and reinterpreted Loos's Raumplan. The Scudder Residence, in particular, is remarkably similar to Loos's Doppelhaus for the Werkbundsiedlung exhibition in 1932, which had opened the year that Preis began his architectural training at the Vienna Technisches Hochschule. The essay then extends Long's hypothesis about Loos's interest in the sensory and tactile qualities of architectural space to show that Preis applied similar methods in these Hawai'i residences. Preis transplanted Loos's Raumplan language and ideas to the tropics, deftly rejecting International Style 'open plan' modernism. Like Loos, Preis created complex interior spaces by separating living zones through changes in ceiling heights or elevations, and also by designing circuitous pathways. He also used strong changes in colors and materials to demarcate zones of use and to foster tactile and other aesthetic interactions in the residences. Importantly, Preis also adapted Loos's architectural ideas for the Hawaiian climate and his clientele by incorporating Asian formal and spatial languages.","[McGuire, Laura] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Sch Architecture, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA",University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa,"McGuire, L (corresponding author), Univ Hawaii Manoa, Sch Architecture, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,0,INST ART HIST ACAD SCI CZECH REPUBLIC,PRAHA 1,"HUSOVA 4, PRAHA 1, 110 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",0049-5123,,,UMENI-ART,Umeni-Art,,2020,3,,,,306,+,,,,,,10,Art,Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;HCI),Art,SS6YR,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000661901800007,View Full Record in Web of Science

In addition the experimental studies conducted on full scale electrochromic windows are analysed highlighting the measured physical quantities and the applied measurement methodologies considering both field and laboratory tests. Taking into account the need to accurately predict the operating characteristics and optimum design of electrochromic windows, a review of the theoretical studies available in the scientific literature as well as the developed theoretical models are presented.

Moreover, we recorded significant differences in body sizes between western and eastern Maghreb populations which could suggest genetic isolation between these populations. As the species is related to habitats placed close to the water reservoirs, which in the desert countries are under significant human pressure (including climate change), we expect a reduction of habitat occupied by this taxon.

This study addresses the performance analysis of reference evapotranspiration (ETo) estimated from NASA/POWER, National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) global reanalysis data before and after dynamical downscaling through the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. The state-of-the-art Hamon's and Penman-Monteith's methods were utilized for the ETo estimation in the Northern India. The performance indices such as bias, root mean square error (RMSE), and correlation (r) were calculated, which showed the values 0.242, 0.422, and 0.959 for NCEP data (without downscaling) and 0.230, 0.402, and 0.969 for the downscaled data respectively. The results indicated that after WRF downscaling, there was some marginal improvement found in the ETo as compared to the without downscaling datasets. However, a better performance was found in the case of NASA/POWER datasets with bias, RMSE, and correlation values of 0.154, 0.348, and 0.960 respectively. In overall, the results indicated that the NASA/POWER and WRF downscaled data can be used for ETo estimation, especially in the ungauged areas. However, NASA/POWER is recommended as the ETo calculations are less computationally expensive and easily available than performing WRF simulations.","[Srivastava, Prashant K.; Singh, Prachi; Mall, R.

The methods give surprisingly good estimates of potential predictability of seasonal precipitation despite the fact that the methods assume Gaussian distributions. For temperature, the methods systematically underestimate weather noise variance over land, often by a factor of 2 or more. This bias can be reduced by taking account of precipitation-induced variability. These conclusions may be model dependent, and hence, confirmation in other models would be of interest. Nevertheless, for the state-of-the-art atmospheric model used in this study, the results strongly support the validity of the single time series approach to estimating potential predictability and enhances our confidence in previous estimates of potential predictability based on observations alone.","[DelSole, Timothy] George Mason Univ, Dept Atmospher Ocean & Earth Sci, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [DelSole, Timothy] Ctr Ocean Land Atmosphere Studies, Calverton, MD 20705 USA; [Kumar, Arun; Jha, Bhaskar] NOAA, Climate Predict Ctr, NCEP, NWS, College Pk, MD USA",George Mason University; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"DelSole, T (corresponding author), Ctr Ocean Land Atmosphere Studies, 4041 Powder Mill Rd,Suite 302, Calverton, MD 20705 USA.",delsole@cola.iges.org,"DelSole, Timothy/ABE-2478-2020; , AK/B-6517-2008","DelSole, Timothy/0000-0003-2041-3024; ",NSF [0830068]; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [NA09OAR4310058]; National Aeronautics and Space Administration [NNX09AN50G],NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); National Aeronautics and Space Administration(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)),"We thank Xia Feng, J.

This paper describes a new performance-based tree-scape design approach for quantifying shaded walking routes using the pedestrian accessibility modelling tool PedestrianCatch, combined with visual-functional tree-scape modelling for both solar impact analysis and qualitative aesthetic outcomes of different street tree-scape designs. We test this design approach on a precinct surrounding a school as a case study. The study results demonstrate the potential for targeted strategic street tree selection and planting in proximity to schools, providing the co-benefits of improved thermal comfort and reduced solar and ultra-violet exposure of children walking home from school.

The rechargeable Li-ion batteries (LIBs) that have been developed for transport systems even put fossil fuels in the corner. However, state-of-the-art Li-ion batteries with graphite anodes are now approaching their theoretical specific energy limits, so they cannot meet the increasing demands of a range of portable electronics and large-scale energy storage systems. Li metal is one of the most promising anode materials that could break through the energy density bottleneck of Li-ion batteries due to its ultrahigh specific capacity and very low potential compared to other anode materials. Nonetheless, the direct use of Li metal in commercial battery systems has been hindered due to significant obstacles associated with it such as safety issues, corrosion from chemical reactions that occur inside the battery, or poor cycling performance. The fundamental reason for these problems is the dendritic growth of Li-ions on the Li metal anode during cycling, as a result of the interfacial phenomena of Li metal and electrolytes. Modification of the Li metal interface with an electrolyte presents an efficient solution to solve these problems. In this review, the current challenges facing the development of Li metal anodes are presented in detail. The most recent advances in Li metal anodes using a controlled interface between the Li metal surface and an electrolyte are highlighted and an introduction on the synthesis and production methods for the application of high-energy-density battery systems such as Li-oxygen (Li-O-2), Li-sulfur (Li-S), and Li metal batteries with high-energy density cathodes is presented. Furthermore, the recent developments in the in situ/operando analysis tools adopted for the investigation of Li metal anodes such as the structural and chemical changes, dynamic properties, and solid-electrolyte interface (SEI) layer properties are described and summarized. Finally, some suggestions are given in the direction of the development of Li metal with artificial surface layers for use in future high-energy batteries.","[Lee, Jung-In; Song, Gyujin; Park, Soojin] Pohang Univ Sci & Technol POSTECH, Dept Chem, Pohang 37673, South Korea; [Cho, Sungjin; Han, Dong-Yeob; Park, Soojin] Pohang Univ Sci & Technol POSTECH, Div Adv Mat Sci, Pohang 37673, South Korea",Pohang University of Science & Technology (POSTECH); Pohang University of Science & Technology (POSTECH),"Park, S (corresponding author), Pohang Univ Sci & Technol POSTECH, Dept Chem, Pohang 37673, South Korea.;Park, S (corresponding author), Pohang Univ Sci & Technol POSTECH, Div Adv Mat Sci, Pohang 37673, South Korea.",soojin.park@postech.ac.kr,"Lee, Jung-In/ABB-6667-2020; Park, Soojin/E-5899-2010","Park, Soojin/0000-0003-3878-6515; /0000-0002-5822-0722","Climate Changes through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning [2018M1A2A2063346]; National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education [2017R1A6A3A04010902]","Climate Changes through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning(National Research Foundation of KoreaMinistry of Science, ICT & Future Planning, Republic of Korea); National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education(National Research Foundation of KoreaMinistry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea)","This work was supported by Climate Changes through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning (2018M1A2A2063346) and Presidential Post-Doc.

This climatology represents the monthly-mean atmospheric state from 2006 to 2012. Bending angles from radio occultation (RO) measurements are obtained from the accumulation of the change in the ray-path direction of Global Positioning System (GPS) signals. Best quality of these near-vertical profiles is found from the middle troposphere up to the mesosphere. Beside RO bending angles we also use data from the Mass Spectrometer and Incoherent Scatter Radar (MSIS) model (modified for RO purposes) to expand BAROCLIM in a spectral model, which (theoretically) reaches from the surface up to infinity. Due to the very high quality of BAROCLIM up to the mesosphere, it can be used to detect deficiencies in current state-of-the-art analysis and reanalysis products from numerical weather prediction (NWP) centers. For bending angles derived from European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) analysis fields from 2006 to 2012, e. g., we find a positive bias of 0.5 to 1% at 40 km, which increases to more than 2% at 50 km. BAROCLIM can also be used as a priori information in RO profile retrievals. In contrast to other a priori information (i.e., MSIS) we find that the use of BAROCLIM better preserves the mean of raw RO measurements. Global statistics of statistically optimized bending angle and refractivity profiles also confirm that BAROCLIM outperforms MSIS. These results clearly demonstrate the utility of BAROCLIM.","[Scherllin-Pirscher, B.; Foelsche, U.] Graz Univ, Wegener Ctr Climate & Global Change WEGC, Graz, Austria; [Scherllin-Pirscher, B.; Foelsche, U.] Graz Univ, Inst Geophys Astrophys & Meteorol, Inst Phys IGAM IP, Graz, Austria; [Syndergaard, S.; Lauritsen, K.

The assessment reviews local planning documents, includes a media analysis, a tourist survey, stakeholder interviews and we provide criteria for measuring success, derived from the Systems Approach Framework (SAF) concept. The full process in the Geltinger Birk took over 25 years and was finished in 2013. The early years were characterised by strong local opposition, a polarization of the local society, misinformation and negative media coverage. Land purchase, the establishment of a local information centre with an environmental manager, improved public participation, a more pro-active media strategy and the readiness to accept compromises finally enabled a successful implementation. Today, a comprehensive tourism information and guidance system exists and the area became a popular tourist place. 80% of all visitors point out the outstanding nature experience and 87% are positive about the combined coastal protection and restoration measure. Parallel, major stakeholders changed their attitude and today are positive about the situation. However, the long timespan between initiation of the process and implementation of the measure, calls for a systematic, guided management approach, like the SAF. Especially, because climate change, sea level rise and increasing pressures on the coasts require a much faster implementation of adaptation measures in future.","[Schernewski, Gerald; Bartel, Caroline; Karnauskaite, Donalda] Leibniz Inst Balt Sea Res, Seestr 15, D-18119 Rostock, Germany; [Schernewski, Gerald; Karnauskaite, Donalda] Klaipeda Univ, Marine Sci & Technol Ctr, H Manto 84, LT-92294 Klaipeda, Lithuania; [Kobarg, Nils] State Agcy Agr Environm & Rural Areas LLUR, Falshoft 11, D-24395 Nieby, Germany",Leibniz Institut fur Ostseeforschung Warnemunde; Klaipeda University,"Schernewski, G (corresponding author), Leibniz Inst Balt Sea Res, Seestr 15, D-18119 Rostock, Germany.;Schernewski, G (corresponding author), Klaipeda Univ, Marine Sci & Technol Ctr, H Manto 84, LT-92294 Klaipeda, Lithuania.",gerald.schernewski@io-warnemuende.de; caroline.bartel@outlook.de; nils.kobarg@llur.landsh.de; donalda.karnauskaite@io-warnemuende.de,,,"BONUS-BaltCoast project; BONUS [185]; European Union's Seventh Programme for research, technological development and demonstration; Baltic Sea national funding institutions [BMBF 03F0717A]","BONUS-BaltCoast project; BONUS; European Union's Seventh Programme for research, technological development and demonstration; Baltic Sea national funding institutions","The work was part-funded by the BONUS-BaltCoast project.

Nearshore wave simulations and wave characteristics analysis during extreme weather events. Journal of Coastal Research, 38(1), 35-51. Coconut Creek (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208. Offshore storm wave direction may distinguish between an extreme event and a typical event experienced at nearshore. Using a state-of-the-art spectral wave (SW) model, the purposes of this study are: (1) to investigate the transformation of waves from offshore to nearshore along the coastline from two opposite directions (northerly and southerly); and (2) to analyse the offshore wave energy density spectrum. The SW model was calibrated considering various mesh resolutions and lateral wind forcing with different wind field resolutions. The results show that a longshore wave attenuation gradient exists from the southerly swell, primarily due to different degrees of sheltering provided by the headland. In contrast, the coast essentially becomes an open coast from northerly swells, thereby producing a significant reduction in wave attenuation. The wave energy density spectrum indicates that wave pattern varies depending on offshore wave direction. Both storms produce a wide range of frequencies and directions. However, southerly swells only produce single-peaked spectrum, while double-peaked spectrum is observed in northerly swells due to the presence of prevailing swells and storm swells. This study highlights the significant reduction of wave attenuation when predominate offshore wave direction is abrupted.","[Oo, Ye Htet; Zhang, Hong] Griffith Univ, Sch Engn & Built Environm, Southport, Qld 4111, Australia; [Colleter, Gildas] Water Technol, Notting Hill, Vic 3168, Australia",Griffith University,"Zhang, H (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Sch Engn & Built Environm, Southport, Qld 4111, Australia.",hong.zhang@griffith.edu.au,,"Zhang, Hong/0000-0002-2642-5467",National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Award [NA16NOS0120024],National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Award,"The authors thank DHI for the MIKE product.

Fieldworks have provided a stratigraphy that shows short occupations of the cave by Neolithic and Bronze Age human groups. The sedimentological description has revealed fumiers deposits, that are characteristic of husbandry activities. In this paper, we provide the anthracological results based on 1117 charcoal fragments. The results allow to characterise the Mediterranean vegetation landscape and its transformation, from a local perspective, related to climatic changes and anthropogenic activities. Climate changes and human activities have played a significant role in Mediterranean landscapes dynamics. However, the incidence or impact of both agents on the vegetation landscape occurred unequally among the Mediterranean region. The anthracological results from Cova Colomera suggest that the Central Pre-Pyrenees was dominated by an oak forest ecosystem, with sub- and supra-Mediterranean deciduous taxon and coniferous forest during the Middle Holocene. This ecosystem remained more or less stable during the Late Holocene, although evergreen oak showed a slight increase, and coniferous forest showed a slight decrease. The orographic characteristics of the Central Pre-Pyrenees were able to maintain temperate and humid conditions, with less impact of aridity events recorded in Mediterranean environments. From a diachronic point of view, the herding activities of Neolithic human and Bronze Age human groups do not appear to have affected highly the landscape development of the Central Pre-Pyrenees. Human activities were probably not intensive in terms of forest clearing or land use. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Mas, Barbara; Oms, F.

Because some components need to expend more computational effort than others, it is often the case that these components are computationally imbalanced. Although parallelism within a component can reduce the imbalance, there is still a need to coordinate component interaction via a coupler in real time. To address this issue, NCAR identified requirements for Task Geometry a construct that specifies for the purpose of coordination the run-time topology within and between components. Although it has recently become generically available in Platform LSF HPC, the current focus is commodity architectures based on the Linux operating environment, Crafted originally for CCSM, Task Geometry appears applicable to other systems-coupled atmospheric models such as 4D-Var. Scale-coupled atmospheric models also show promise for application in areas such as subgrid-scale parameterizations for GCM models, and the class of interactions demanded by use cases emerging in the area of Homeland Security. In all cases it is possible to demonstrate via speedup and efficiency that Task Geometry enhances performance, however both metrics are problematical to quantify except in simple cases. With applicability from isolated Linux clusters to grids, Task Geometry remains useful in contexts that span organizational and/or geographic boundaries.","Platform Comp Inc, Markham, ON L3R 3T7, Canada",,"Lumb, I (corresponding author), Platform Comp Inc, 3760 14th Ave, Markham, ON L3R 3T7, Canada.",ilumb@platforrn.com; bmcmillan@platforrn.com; mpage@ucar.edu; gcarr@ucar.edu,,,,,,,47,0,0,0,2,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"PO BOX 128 FARRER RD, SINGAPORE 9128, SINGAPORE",,,981-256-354-7,,,,2005,,,,,234,258,,10.1142/9789812701831_0017,http://dx.doi.org/10.1142/9789812701831_0017,,,25,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,BDP29,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000234714600017,View Full Record in Web of Science

Menez-Dregan I (Brittany, France) is one of the key sites in Western Europe that dates from this threshold, with an alternating sequence of 16 occupation levels and four marine deposits, from MIS 12 to 8. The large lithic assemblages of more than 154,000 artifacts from knapping (cores, flakes) and shaping (macrotools and shaping flakes) show the varying use of raw materials and activities at the site through the sequence. This work focuses on the study of the handaxes and cleavers using technological and metrical methods with multivariate analysis, in combination with geometric morphometrics, and places these analyses within the context of other technological changes at the site. Collectively, results show the persistent use through the sequence of the same lithic raw materials and technologies, including fire use and the import of glossy sandstone from 20 km away, but with variation in activities at the site. These findings suggest that Menez-Dregan I shows the development of a specific material culture that reflects the local resources and environment. Results further indicate that the site shows the sustained hominin occupation of the area, despite varying climate and environment, with strong traditions of social learning that were maintained through flexibility of site use, deep understanding of the local territory, and the innovation of new technologies, such as the use of fire. Evidence from the site is placed within the wider context of Europe, and contrasted with areas to the north, such as Britain, where hominin occupation was more sporadic and driven by cyclical climate change.","[Ravon, Anne-Lyse] Univ Rennes, CNRS, Minist Culture & Commun, CReAAH UMR 6566, F-35042 Rennes, France; [Garcia-Medrano, Paula; Moncel, Marie-Helene] Natl Museum Nat Hist, Inst Pale Ontol Humaine, CNRS UMR 7194, Dept Prehist, 1 Rue Rene Panhard, F-75013 Paris, France; [Garcia-Medrano, Paula; Ashton, Nick] British Museum, Dept Britain Europe & Prehist, Frank House,56 Orsman Rd, London N1 5QJ, England; [Garcia-Medrano, Paula] Inst Catala Paleoecol Humana & Evolucio Social IP, Zona Educ 4,Campus Sescelades URV,Edif W3, Tarragona 43007, Spain; [Garcia-Medrano, Paula] Univ Rovira & Virgili, Dept Hist & Hist Art, Avinguda Catalunya 35, Tarragona 43002, Spain",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); Universite de Rennes; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle (MNHN); Natural History Museum London; Universitat Rovira i Virgili; Catalan Institute of Human Paleo-Ecology & Social Evolution (IPHES); Universitat Rovira i Virgili,"Ravon, AL (corresponding author), Univ Rennes, CNRS, Minist Culture & Commun, CReAAH UMR 6566, F-35042 Rennes, France.",al.ravon@hotmail.fr,"Ravon, Anne-Lyse/AAR-2181-2021","Ravon, Anne-Lyse/0000-0003-0560-3866; Ashton, Nick/0000-0001-9787-3892; Paula, Garcia-Medrano/0000-0002-4574-1019; Ashton, Nicholas/0000-0002-3579-8804",,,,,161,3,3,1,1,ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,LONDON,"24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON NW1 7DX, ENGLAND",0047-2484,1095-8606,,J HUM EVOL,J.

In this study, we analyzed state-of-the-art Earth observation data (1975-2015) to address three key questions. First, how has the LCRPGR varied over space and time? Second, how is built-up expansion related to population increase across regions? Third, what are some important issues related to the SDGs' land-use efficiency concept? We found that the Europe and Northern America SDG region was the least efficient region, having the highest LCRPGR in 1975-2000 and 2000-2015, but the Eastern and South-Eastern Asia SDG region is catching up. The World Bank's high income region and the United Nations' very high human development region were the least efficient regions in 1975-2000, but their places were respectively taken over by the upper middle income and high human development regions in 2000-2015. Although land consumption rate and population growth rate were positively and significantly correlated at the global level, this was not always the case across regions, indicating that land consumption was not always proportionate to population increase. We identified the non-inclusion of changes in in situ natural capital and the external impacts of cities and urban regions as among the important limitations of the SDGs' landuse efficiency concept. This can be considered in its future reconceptualization.","[Estoque, Ronald C.] Forestry & Forest Prod Res Inst, Ctr Biodivers & Climate Change, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058687, Japan; [Estoque, Ronald C.; Ooba, Makoto; Hijioka, Yasuaki] Natl Inst Environm Studies, Ctr Climate Change Adaptat, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058506, Japan; [Togawa, Takuya] Natl Inst Environm Studies, Fukushima Reg Collaborat Res Ctr, Fukushima 9637700, Japan; [Murayama, Yuji] Univ Tsukuba, Fac Life & Environm Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058577, Japan",Forestry & Forest Products Research Institute - Japan; National Institute for Environmental Studies - Japan; University of Tsukuba,"Estoque, RC (corresponding author), Forestry & Forest Prod Res Inst, Ctr Biodivers & Climate Change, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058687, Japan.",estoquerc21@affrc.go.jp,"Estoque, Ronald C./Q-3769-2016; Murayama, Yuji/B-3161-2014","Estoque, Ronald C./0000-0001-9681-492X; Murayama, Yuji/0000-0003-4397-6882","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [18H00763, 20K13262]","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science)","This work was supported by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science through a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (18H00763, Principal Investigator: Yuji Murayama) and a Grant-in-Aid for Early-Career Scientists (20K13262, Principal Investigator: Ronald C.

In this study, two numerical experiments (including and excluding soil freeze-thaw process) were designed to examine the effect of soil freeze-thaw process on surface hydrologic and thermal fluxes in frozen ground region in the Northern Hemisphere based on the state-of-the-art Community Earth System Model version 1.0.5. Results show that in response to soil freeze-thaw process, the area averaged soil temperature in the shallow layer (0.0175 -0.0451 m) decreases by 0.35 degrees C in the TP (Tibetan Plateau), 0.69 degrees C in CES (Central and Eastern Siberia), and 0.6 degrees C in NA (North America) during summer, and increases by 1.93 degrees C in the TP, 2.28 degrees C in CES and 1.61 degrees C in NA during winter, respectively. Meanwhile, in response to soil freeze-thaw process, the area averaged soil liquid water content increases in summer and decrease in winter. For surface heat flux components, the ground heat flux is most significantly affected by the freeze-thaw process in both summer and winter, followed by sensible heat flux and latent heat flux in summer. In the TP area, the ground heat flux increases by 2.82 W/m(2) (28.5%) in summer and decreases by 3.63 W/m(2) (40%) in winter. Meanwhile, in CES, the ground heat flux increases by 1.89 W/m(2) (11.3%) in summer and decreases by 1.41 W/m(2) (18.6%) in winter. The heat fluxes in the Tibetan Plateau are more susceptible to the freeze-thaw process compared with the high-latitude frozen soil regions. Soil freeze-thaw process can induce significant warming in the Tibetan Plateau in winter. Also, this process induces significant cooling in high-latitude regions in summer. The frozen ground can prevent soil liquid water from infiltrating to deep soil layers at the beginning of thawing; however, as the frozen ground thaws continuously, the infiltration of the liquid water increases and the deep soil can store water like a sponge, accompanied by decreasing surface runoff. The influence of the soil freeze-thaw process on surface hydrologic and thermal fluxes varies seasonally and spatially.","[Ma, Di; Luo, SiQiong; Lyu, ShiHua; Meng, XianHong] Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Ecoenvironm & Resources, Key Lab Land Surface Proc & Climate Change Cold &, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu, Peoples R China; [Ma, Di] Lanzhou Univ, Coll Atmospher Sci, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu, Peoples R China; [Guo, DongLin] Chinese Acad Sci, Nansen Zhu Int Res Ctr, Inst Atmospher Phys, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Lyu, ShiHua] Chengdu Univ Informat Technol, Sch Atmospher Sci, Plateau Atmosphere & Environm Key Lab Sichuan Pro, Chengdu 610225, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Chen, BoLi] Changzhou Meteorol Bur, Changzhou 213000, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Luo, LiHui] Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Ecoenvironm & Resources, State Key Lab Frozen Soils Engn, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Lanzhou University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; Chengdu University of Information Technology; Chinese Academy of Sciences","Luo, SQ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Ecoenvironm & Resources, Key Lab Land Surface Proc & Climate Change Cold &, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu, Peoples R China.",lsq@lzb.ac.cn,"Donglin, Guo/F-2514-2014",,"National Nature Science Foundation of China [42075091, 41991281, 41975096, 41675015]; CAREERI STS Funding [Y651671001]",National Nature Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); CAREERI STS Funding,"This work was supported by the National Nature Science Foundation of China (42075091, 41991281, 41975096 and 41675015).

This catchment having anthropogenic activities and different climate could affect environmental variables of surface waters, changed the biochemical compounds of filamentous species. A canonical correspondence analysis elucidated that heavy metals, water temperature, and nutrients were found to be major environmental factors governing the occurrence/succession and biochemical contents of filamentous algae. Cladophora glomerata is mainly linked with water temperature, antimony, orthophosphate, and conductivity, whereas Spirogyra majuscula related to nitrate and lead. Filamentous algae obtained from various sampling stations had different biochemical responses to different physicochemical factors. The biochemical responses of species were significantly different between sampling stations (p < 0.05) at different sampling seasons. Relatively high nutrients and low heavy metal contents stimulated the formation of pigments and total protein content by filamentous algae. On the other hand, increment in heavy metal ions in ecosystems lead to increase malondialdehyde, hydrogen peroxide, proline, total thiol group, and total phenolic compounds by filamentous algae. A significant positive relation between heavy metal ions and mentioned biochemical compounds observed from the Pearson correlation test. Besides, the surface structure of algal biomass changed concerning the different responses of species under various environmental conditions, indicated by the Fourier transform infrared analysis. Filamentous algal species showed different temporal and spatial occurrences in the region, which could be due to the biochemical responses of algae species to different complex environmental conditions. A significant increment in mentioned biochemical compound levels in filamentous algae obtained from a different broad of habitats and their sensitivity/tolerance to the environmental condition could make them valuable bioindicators.","[Celekli, Abuzer] Gaziantep Univ, Fac Art & Sci, Dept Biol, TR-27310 Gaziantep, Turkey; [Bozkurt, Huseyin] Gaziantep Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Food Engn, TR-27310 Gaziantep, Turkey",Gaziantep University; Gaziantep University,"Celekli, A (corresponding author), Gaziantep Univ, Fac Art & Sci, Dept Biol, TR-27310 Gaziantep, Turkey.",celekli@gantep.edu.tr; hbozkurt@gantep.edu.tr,,,TUBITAK (The Scientific and Technical Research Council of Turkey) [112Y054],TUBITAK (The Scientific and Technical Research Council of Turkey)(Turkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Arastirma Kurumu (TUBITAK)),This research was supported by TUBITAK (The Scientific and Technical Research Council of Turkey) with the project No: 112Y054 and also thank to Scientific Research Projects Executive Council of University of Gaziantep.,,53,0,0,2,13,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0925-8574,1872-6992,,ECOL ENG,Ecol.

The purpose of these simulations is to assess achievable device performances with a CIGS/c-Si tandem structure when a realistic efficiency of each subcell is applied. The top subcell conditions are simulated based on the state-of-the-art records, and the bottom c-Si cell is designed to have an efficiency of approximately 19%. When the Eg of the top chalcopyrite cell is below 1.5 eV, the current matching condition between the top cell and bottom cell is not obtained until the top cell's thickness is 0.2 mu m. However, with Eg values of the top chalcopyrite cells at 1.6 eV and 1.7 eV, the current matching conditions could be found. Nevertheless, because the efficiency from the top chalcopyrite cell is approximately 12%, it is predicted that the tandem structure exhibits a similar device performance to the bottom c-Si cell. This result suggests that improving the efficiency of the wide bandgap cell is essential for the tandem cell to overcome the efficiency form a single junction solar cell. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

It is shown here that small-scale temperature fluctuations related to gravity waves, mechanical turbulence, or other small-scale air motions are required to explain these observations. These waves have typical peak-to-peak amplitudes of 1-2 K and frequencies of up to 10 h(-1), corresponding to instantaneous cooling rates of up to 60 K h(-1). Such waves remain unresolved in even the most advanced state-of-the-art global atmospheric models. Given the ubiquitous nature of these fluctuations, it is suggested that the character of young in situ forming cirrus clouds is mostly determined by homogeneous freezing of ice in solution droplets, driven by a broad range of small-scale fluctuations (period similar to a few minutes) with moderate to high cooling rates (1-100 K h(-1)).","World Radiat Ctr, Phys Meteorol Observatorium Davos, CH-7260 Davos, Switzerland; Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Hoyle, CR (corresponding author), World Radiat Ctr, Phys Meteorol Observatorium Davos, Dorfstr 33, CH-7260 Davos, Switzerland.",c.hoyle@pmodwrc.ch,"Hoyle, Christopher R./B-7786-2008; Peter, Thomas/B-2529-2018","Hoyle, Christopher R./0000-0002-1369-9143; Peter, Thomas/0000-0002-7218-7156",,,,,32,85,85,0,16,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0022-4928,1520-0469,,J ATMOS SCI,J.

J,"Ryu, YH; Min, SK",,,,"Ryu, Young-Hee; Min, Seung-Ki",,,Greenhouse warming and anthropogenic aerosols synergistically reduce springtime rainfall in low-latitude East Asia,NPJ CLIMATE AND ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,PERSISTENT RAINS; PRECIPITATION; MECHANISM; HAZE,"Low-latitude East Asia, particularly southern China, has experienced a markedly decreasing springtime rainfall in recent years whereas rainfall trends are weak in mid-latitude East Asia. Details of human influences on this contrasting feature remain uncertain. This study provides a quantification of the relative roles of greenhouse warming and aerosols in the observed spring rainfall trends over East Asia using a state-of-the-art numerical model. Greenhouse warming drives more rapid temperature increases over high-latitude East Asia potentially associated with reduced spring snow than the western North Pacific, which induces an anomalous anticyclone over the East China Sea. This circulation change results in a northwestward extension of the western North Pacific subtropical high, reducing rainfall at low latitudes while moderately increasing rainfall at mid-latitudes. In contrast, anthropogenic aerosols reduce rainfall in both low- and mid-latitude East Asia. Hence, the two anthropogenic factors synergistically reduce rainfall at low latitudes, with a stronger contribution of greenhouse warming (similar to 34%) than aerosols (similar to 17%). In mid-latitude East Asia, their contributions are offset, resulting in weak rainfall trends. Further, the anthropogenic influences are found to be relatively larger under drier conditions, suggesting that a more severe drought can occur in low-latitude East Asia under future drought-conducive conditions.","[Ryu, Young-Hee; Min, Seung-Ki] Pohang Univ Sci & Technol POSTECH, Div Environm Sci & Engn, Pohang, South Korea; [Min, Seung-Ki] Yonsei Univ, Inst Convergence Res & Educ Adv Technol, Incheon, South Korea",Pohang University of Science & Technology (POSTECH); Yonsei University,"Min, SK (corresponding author), Pohang Univ Sci & Technol POSTECH, Div Environm Sci & Engn, Pohang, South Korea.;Min, SK (corresponding author), Yonsei Univ, Inst Convergence Res & Educ Adv Technol, Incheon, South Korea.",skmin@postech.ac.kr,,"Ryu, Young-Hee/0000-0002-7214-6039",National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korean government (MSIT) [NRF-2021R1A2C3007366]; Human Resource Program for Sustainable Environment in the 4th Industrial Revolution Society,"National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korean government (MSIT)(National Research Foundation of KoreaMinistry of Science & ICT (MSIT), Republic of Korea); Human Resource Program for Sustainable Environment in the 4th Industrial Revolution Society",This study was supported by a National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korean government (MSIT) (NRF-2021R1A2C3007366) and the Human Resource Program for Sustainable Environment in the 4th Industrial Revolution Society.,,37,0,0,2,2,NATURE PORTFOLIO,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",2397-3722,,,NPJ CLIM ATMOS SCI,npj Clim.

The use of accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) to date small samples has allowed for the direct analysis of insect remains, and these studies have given a deeper understanding of Quaternary climate change and its effects on human activity during this time. In addition, the presence of certain insects can indicate particular types of human activity (i.e. animal husbandry or the existence of timber structures or open fields), and direct dating of insects provides chronological constraints on these activities throughout the range of the radiocarbon timescale. This chapter covers recent advances in pretreatment chemistry for AMS radiocarbon dating of insects, including isolation of polymeric chitin or chitin monomers. The uses of chitin dates, in particular the archaeological and palaeoenvironmental applications, are also discussed. Problems with the radiocarbon dating of insects, including contamination, degradation, and the often observed offset between dates of insect remains and surrounding organic material, are addressed along with potential solutions.","[Tripp, Jennifer A.] San Francisco State Univ, Dept Chem & Biochem, San Francisco, CA 94132 USA; [Higham, Thomas F.

In general, precipitation data used in hydrological modeling are provided by weather stations. However, in regions with sparse weather station coverage, the spatial interpolation of the individual weather stations provides a rough approximation of the real precipitation fields. In such regions, precipitation from interpolated weather stations is generally considered unreliable for hydrological modeling. Precipitation estimates from reanalyses could represent an interesting alternative in regions where the weather station density is low. This article compares the performances of river flows simulated by a watershed model using precipitation and temperature estimates from reanalyses and gridded observations. The comparison was carried out based on the density of surface weather stations for 316 Canadian watersheds located in three climatic regions. Three state-of-the-art atmospheric reanalyses-ERA-Interim, CFSR, and MERRA-and one gridded observations database over Canada-Natural Resources Canada (NRCan)-were used. Results showed that the Nash-Sutcliffe values of simulated river flows using precipitation and temperature data from CFSR and NRCan were generally equivalent regardless of the weather station density. ERA-Interim and MERRA performed significantly better than NRCan for watersheds with weather station densities of less than 1 station per 1000 km(2) in the mountainous region. Overall, these results indicate that for hydrological modeling in regions with high spatial variability of precipitation such as mountainous regions, reanalyses perform better than gridded observations when the weather station density is low.","[Essou, Gilles R.

However, under natural conditions, environmental stresses do not occur alone, and, in addition, more stressed plants may become more susceptible to attacks by pests and pathogens. Studies on the impact of the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis on tomato response to water deficit showed that several drought-responsive genes are differentially regulated in AM-colonized tomato plants (roots and leaves) during water deficit. To date, global changes in mycorrhizal tomato root transcripts under water stress conditions have not been yet investigated. Here, changes in root transcriptome in the presence of an AM fungus, with or without water stress (WS) application, have been evaluated in a commercial tomato cultivar already investigated for the water stress response during AM symbiosis. Since root-knot nematodes (RKNs, Meloidogyne incognita) are obligate endoparasites and cause severe yield losses in tomato, the impact of the AM fungal colonization on RKN infection at 7 days post-inoculation was also evaluated. Results offer new information about the response to AM symbiosis, highlighting a functional redundancy for several tomato gene families, as well as on the tomato and fungal genes involved in WS response during symbiosis, underlying the role of the AM fungus. Changes in the expression of tomato genes related to nematode infection during AM symbiosis highlight a role of AM colonization in triggering defense responses against RKN in tomato. Overall, new datasets on the tomato response to an abiotic and biotic stress during AM symbiosis have been obtained, providing useful data for further researches.","[Balestrini, Raffaella; Rosso, Laura C.; Veronico, Pasqua; Melillo, Maria Teresa; De Luca, Francesca; Fanelli, Elena; Colagiero, Mariantonietta; Ciancio, Aurelio; Pentimone, Isabella] CNR, Ist Protez Sostenibile Plante, Turin, Italy; [di Fossalunga, Alessandra Salvioli] Univ Torino, Dipartimento Sci Vita & Biol Sistemi, Turin, Italy",Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); University of Turin,"Balestrini, R (corresponding author), CNR, Ist Protez Sostenibile Plante, Turin, Italy.",raffaella.balestrini@ipsp.cnr.it,"Balestrini, Raffaella/D-1975-2010; pentimone, isabella/HHM-7819-2022; Balestrini, Raffaella/Q-1106-2015; Fanelli, Elena/C-1712-2015; Ciancio, Aurelio/AAY-1538-2020; De Luca, Francesca/AAX-5759-2020; de luca, francesca/C-1518-2015","Balestrini, Raffaella/0000-0001-7958-7681; Balestrini, Raffaella/0000-0001-7958-7681; PENTIMONE, ISABELLA/0000-0003-4335-4071","AQUA project (Progetto Premiale, Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche); Eureka!

We analyze data from tall towers in 2004 and 2008 using a high resolution Lagrangian particle dispersion model paired with both geostatistical and Bayesian inversions. Our results indicate peak N2O emissions in June with a strong seasonal cycle. The spatial distribution of sources closely mirrors data on fertilizer application with particularly large N2O sources over the US Cornbelt. Existing inventories for N2O predict emissions that differ substantially from the inverse model results in both seasonal cycle and magnitude. We estimate a total annual N2O budget over the central US of 0.9-1.2 TgN/yr and an extrapolated budget for the entire US and Canada of 2.1-2.6 TgN/yr. By this estimate, the US and Canada account for 12-15% of the total global N2O source or 32-39% of the global anthropogenic source as reported by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in 2007.","[Miller, S.

Silicon- and iron-air batteries underwent less research and development compared to lithium- and zinc-air batteries. Nevertheless, in the recent past, the two also-ran battery systems made considerable progress and attracted rising research interest due to the excellent resource-efficiency of silicon and iron. Silicon and iron are among the top five of the most abundant elements in the Earth's crust, which ensures almost infinite material supply of the anode materials, even for large scale applications. Furthermore, primary silicon-air batteries are set to provide one of the highest energy densities among all types of batteries, while iron-air batteries are frequently considered as a highly rechargeable system with decent performance characteristics. Considering fundamental aspects for the anode materials, i.e., the metal electrodes, in this review we will first outline the challenges, which explicitly apply to silicon- and iron-air batteries and prevented them from a broad implementation so far. Afterwards, we provide an extensive literature survey regarding state-of-the-art experimental approaches, which are set to resolve the aforementioned challenges and might enable the introduction of silicon- and iron-air batteries into the battery market in the future.","[Weinrich, Henning; Durmus, Yasin Emre; Tempel, Hermann; Kungl, Hans; Eichel, Ruediger-A.] Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Energy & Climate Res Fundamental Electrochem, D-52428 Julich, Germany; [Weinrich, Henning; Durmus, Yasin Emre; Eichel, Ruediger-A.] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Inst Phys Chem, Landoltweg 2, D-52074 Aachen, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Research Center Julich; RWTH Aachen University,"Weinrich, H (corresponding author), Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Energy & Climate Res Fundamental Electrochem, D-52428 Julich, Germany.;Weinrich, H (corresponding author), Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Inst Phys Chem, Landoltweg 2, D-52074 Aachen, Germany.",h.weinrich@fz-juelich.de,"Durmus, Yasin Emre/ABH-3264-2021; Eichel, Rüdiger-A./AAD-3521-2019; Durmus, Yasin Emre/GXH-8404-2022; Tempel, Hermann/D-8529-2012","Durmus, Yasin Emre/0000-0001-9245-3549; Eichel, Rüdiger-A./0000-0002-0013-6325; Tempel, Hermann/0000-0002-9794-6403; Weinrich, Henning/0000-0001-9946-6078","German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) [13XP0188B, 03XP0110F]",German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"This research was funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), project 'FeEnergy' Eisen-Slurry-Luft-Akkumulatoren fur die stationare Energiespeicherung mit hoher Kapazitat project no. 13XP0188B and project ` MeLuBatt'  Frischer Wind fur Metall-Luftsauersto ff Batterien: Was man von Li-Ionen Batterien lernen kann project no. 03XP0110F.",,257,23,23,12,78,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1996-1944,,MATERIALS,Materials,1-Jul,2019,13,,,,,,2134,10.3390/ma12132134,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ma12132134,,,55,"Chemistry, Physical; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering; Physics, Applied; Physics, Condensed Matter",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Materials Science; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering; Physics,IL1FI,31269782,"gold, Green Published, Green Submitted",,,12/21/22,WOS:000477043900098,View Full Record in Web of Science

However selection of color traits is confounded by the fact that coloration also plays an important role in many biological processes, and warning coloration may be constrained by biotic or abotic factors. Temperature, in particular the importance of thermoregulation, has been suggested as the source of much of the geographical variation in warning coloration we see in natural populations. Differential selection in different thermal environments may lead to developmentally canalized or 'fixed' differences between populations. Conversely, inter-population differences may be due to phenotypic plasticity, wherein trait expression is modified by environmental conditions. The hibiscus harlequin bug Tectocoris diophthalmus (Heteroptera: Scutelleridae), is a shieldback bug, with iridescent patches that show size variation between individuals, as well as inter-population variation with geographic patterning. This study aimed to identify environmental factors that drive the expression of this variable trait, using surveys, modeling, and experimental approaches. Surveys were taken at sites throughout Australia in three climate regions (tropical, subtropical, and temperate) at different time periods, and results were modeled with a multilevel ordinal regression. We tested for correlations between colouration and several biotic (density, host plant) and abiotic (temperature, rain-fall) factors. We found strong phenotypic plasticity with respect to temperature and rainfall. Higher temperatures and increased rain-fall were related to suppressed iridescence. A factorial experiment with tropical and temperate bugs in two climate-typical temperature regimes confirmed phenotypic plasticity in response to temperature, likely due to temperature sensitivity in melanin expression. Tropical and temperate populations showed striking differences between plasticity reaction norms, suggesting local evolution on the shape of phenotypic plasticity. We suggest that studying both biotic and abiotic selection pressures is important for understanding the causes of inter-population variation in aposematic signals.","[Fabricant, S.

In the case of Nepal, the destructive impact of landslides has been steadily increasing as a result of the rising occupation of marginal land and extreme weather events caused by climate change. In particular, the impacts of seasonal, shallow landslides have been underestimated due to underreporting, and lack appropriate policy response. Within this paper, we argue that citizen science - the practice of incorporating the general public in the process of knowledge co-production - may help address this issue by increasing the knowledge base of stakeholders at different levels. We present the preliminary results from an interdisciplinary scoping study of two landslide sites in Western Nepal, in Bajhang and Bajura, where the Landslide-EVO research project, including a citizen science component, is currently being implemented. The aim of the project is to innovate participatory environmental monitoring and to generate evidence to support resilience. Our exploratory qualitative investigation outlines the strategies currently employed by the local communities that continue living in the landslide affected areas. These include demographic shifts and patterns, land use changes and occupational diversification. We argue that these existing local adaptation and mitigation practices compound a wealth of experiential knowledge. Based on evidence from literature, as well as our first-hand experience of starting citizen science activities in the both landslide sites, we argue that citizen science has the potential to build on local knowledge base and strengthen the adaptive capacities of different level stakeholders. Our theoretical contribution is the proposed typology of citizen-science interventions. We distinguish between community science, participatory environmental monitoring and virtual citizen science, providing examples of how they can benefit stakeholders at different levels and/or different types of research. Finally, we examine the ways in which different types of citizen science could be applied in our case study sites, specifying the conditions under which they can attain maximum usefulness.","[Cieslik, Katarzyna; Dewulf, Art] Wageningen Univ & Res, Sch Social Sci, Publ Adm & Policy Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Shakya, Puja; Uprety, Madhab] Pract Act Nepal, Kathmandu, Nepal; [Russell, Caroline; Clark, Julian] Univ Birmingham, Sch Geog Earth & Environm Sci, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Dhital, Megh Raj; Dhakal, Amrit] Tribhuvan Univ, Dept Geol, Kirtipur, Nepal",Wageningen University & Research; University of Birmingham; Tribhuvan University,"Cieslik, K (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ & Res, Sch Social Sci, Publ Adm & Policy Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands.",kc566@cam.ac.uk,"Cieslik, Katarzyna/GXF-9020-2022; Dhakal, Amrit/GNW-3331-2022","Dhakal, Amrit/0000-0002-2070-6866; Dewulf, Art/0000-0002-4171-7644; Russell, Caroline/0000-0002-4613-1845; Cieslik, Katarzyna/0000-0002-8240-0117","Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); Department for International Development (DFID) under the United Kingdom Science for Humanitarian Emergencies and Resilience (SHEAR) program [NE/P000452/1]; NERC [NE/P000452/1, NE/P000207/1] Funding Source: UKRI",Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Department for International Development (DFID) under the United Kingdom Science for Humanitarian Emergencies and Resilience (SHEAR) program; NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),This manuscript was realized within the interdisciplinary interuniversity consortium L-EVO.

Would a wealth-enhancing policy be associated with increased effectiveness of these practices? Focusing on a nationally representative set of Malawian agricultural households, the article answers the above questions by employing plot-level panel data matched with a set of geo-referenced rainfall and temperature records. The findings suggest a positive correlation between aggregate yield and the adoption of organic fertilizer. A similar result holds for legume intercropping and for hybrid seeds, which are associated to reductions in yield volatility between the two waves. Nevertheless, these effects appear heterogeneous across the agro-ecological zone of adoption, since a reduced number of farmers in selected locations can improve yields through the adoption of these practices. Further exploration suggests that less wealthy households show higher returns when adopting hybrid seeds or legume intercropping. Wealthier households, in contrast, report high yield only when treated with technology-enhancing practices, such as organic fertilizers and soil erosion control measures.","[Maggio, Giuseppe] Food & Agr Org FAO United Nat, Agr Dev Econ Div, Viale Terme Caracalla, I-00153 Rome, Italy; [Asfaw, Solomon] Green Climate Fund, Independent Evaluat Unit IEU, 175 Art Ctr Daero, Incheon 406840, South Korea",,"Asfaw, S (corresponding author), Green Climate Fund, Independent Evaluat Unit IEU, 175 Art Ctr Daero, Incheon 406840, South Korea.",sasfaw@gcfund.org,"Maggio, Giuseppe/HGB-8937-2022","Maggio, Giuseppe/0000-0002-8768-1317",,,,,45,2,2,2,7,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

The biases in representing these features lead to problems in representing the strength and variability of Indian summer monsoon (ISM). This study attempts to unravel the ability of a state-of-the-art coupled model, SINTEX-F2, in simulating these characteristics of ISM. The coupled model reproduces the precipitation and circulation climatology reasonably well. However, the mean ISM is weaker than observed, as evident from various monsoon indices. A wavenumber-frequency spectrum analysis reveals that the model intraseasonal oscillations are also weaker-than-observed. One possible reason for the weaker-than-observed ISM arises from the warm bias, over the tropical oceans, especially over the equatorial western Indian Ocean, inherent in the model. This warm bias is not only confined to the surface layers, but also extends through most of the troposphere. As a result of this warm bias, the coupled model has too weak meridional tropospheric temperature gradient to drive a realistic monsoon circulation. This in turn leads to a weakening of the moisture gradient as well as the vertical shear of easterlies required for sustained northward propagation of rain band, resulting in weak monsoon circulation. It is also noted that the recently documented interaction between the interannual and intraseasonal variabilities of ISM through very long breaks (VLBs) is poor in the model. This seems to be related to the inability of the model in simulating the eastward propagating Madden-Julian oscillation during VLBs.","[Joseph, Susmitha; Sahai, A. K.; Goswami, B.

According to Eskandar Beig, Shah Abbas' secretary, garden construction in Mazandaran is like paradise construction in the heaven. Despite several gardens in the area, little research has been conducted in this regard because few historic gardens remained; the only sources that refer to these gardens are the few descriptions and pictures in the European travelers' histories and travelogues. Despite climatic variations, most of the Safavid gardens in this area were built based on the spatial geometric pattern of the Persian garden and the only difference between the gardens in this area and those in the central and the southern areas is in their use of the natural elements. Therefore, studying these gardens as a special kind of Persian Garden is necessary. This research is conducted in a descriptive-analytical method and investigates historical documents and images. Moreover, case study is conducted through field investigation in order to recognize the features of Bahrol-eram garden and the role of natural elements in this garden in comparison to other Persian gardens. This paper seeks to understand the role of the landscape elements such as water in the formation of Bahrol-eram. The hypothesis states that the widespread presence of water in this area and the full interaction of the garden with its context have create a kind of garden called the island-garden. According to the historical evidence, historians and travelers' quotes, the garden situation, and also based on the images, Bahrol-eram is an island-garden which was constructed in the area because of its appropriate climate and abundant water. The widespread presence of water surrounding the whole garden which is embedded in the central island makes it a specific instance of the Persian gardens which can be referred to as island-gardens. Despite the lack of climatic justification (increased humidity), the Persians' respect for water and its value for them have caused the garden to be a royal residence and resort. The existence of this garden reflects the natural diversity of Iranian garden, maintaining its basic principles.","[Nattaj, Vahid Heidar] Univ Mazandaran, Fac Art & Architecture, Main Campus, Babol Sar, Iran",University of Mazandaran,"Nattaj, VH (corresponding author), Univ Mazandaran, Fac Art & Architecture, Main Campus, Babol Sar, Iran.",v.heidarnattaj@umz.ac.ir,,,,,,,19,2,2,0,2,NAZAR RESEARCH CENTER ART ARCHITECTURE & URBANISM,TEHRAN,"NO 23, DR QARIB ST AZADI AVE, TEHRAN, 14198-43311, IRAN",1735-9635,2251-7197,,BAGH E NAZAR,Bagh e Nazar,DEC,2017,54,,,,5,20,,,,,,16,"Humanities, Multidisciplinary",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Arts & Humanities - Other Topics,FP8EZ,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000417874700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The power spectra of the monthly stream function are compared with trend-eliminating detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA2). The shapes of the spectra differ substantially between latitudes, depth and the two models with constant ( white) behaviour for high frequencies as a single common feature. The most frequent property of the spectra is power-law scaling, S(f)similar to f(-beta), with nontrivial exponents, mostly beta approximate to 1, in agreement with 1/f or flicker noise; this is mainly found in the interannual to decadal frequency range (1/f spectra observed for sea surface temperature fluctuations are explained by a stochastically forced ocean energy balance model with vertical diffusion). For lowest frequencies, some spectra show stationary long term memory, while others reveal spectra increasing with frequency. None of the spectra can be considered uniquely as red noise explained by an ocean integrating a white stochastic atmospheric forcing.","Max Planck Inst Meteorol, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany; Int Max Planck Res Sch Earth Syst Modelling, Hamburg, Germany; Univ Hamburg, Inst Meteorol, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany",Max Planck Society; Max Planck Society; University of Hamburg,"Zhu, XH (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Meteorol, Bundesstr 53, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany.",klaus.fraedrich@zmaw.de,"Zhu, Xiuhua/AAM-1420-2021; zhu, xiuhua/K-7583-2013",,,,,,22,18,18,1,5,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",0094-8276,1944-8007,,GEOPHYS RES LETT,Geophys.

The UM solves the full 3D Navier-Stokes equations with a height-varying gravity, avoiding the simplifications used in most GCMs currently applied to exoplanets. In this work we present the coupling of the UM dynamical core to an accurate radiation scheme based on the two-stream approximation and correlated-k method with state-of-the-art opacities from ExoMol. Our first application of this model is devoted to the extensively studied hot Jupiter HD 209458b. We have derived synthetic emission spectra and phase curves, and compare them to both previous models also based on state-of-the-art radiative transfer, and to observations. We find a reasonable agreement between observations and both our days side emission and hot spot offset, however, our night side emissions is too large. Overall our results are qualitatively similar to those found by Showman et al. (2009, ApJ, 699, 564) with the SPARC/MITgcm, however, we note several quantitative differences: Our simulations show significant variation in the position of the hottest part of the atmosphere with pressure, as expected from simple timescale arguments, and in contrast to the vertical coherency found by Showman et al. (2009). We also see significant quantitative differences in calculated synthetic observations. Our comparisons strengthen the need for detailed intercomparisons of dynamical cores, radiation schemes and post-processing tools to understand these differences. This effort is necessary in order to make robust conclusions about these atmospheres based on GCM results.","[Amundsen, David S.; Mayne, Nathan J.; Baraffe, Isabelle; Manners, James; Tremblin, Pascal; Drummond, Benjamin; Smith, Chris; Acreman, David M.] Univ Exeter, Astrophys Grp, Exeter EX4 4QL, Devon, England; [Amundsen, David S.] Columbia Univ, Dept Appl Phys & Appl Math, New York, NY 10025 USA; [Amundsen, David S.] NASA, Goddard Inst Space Studies, New York, NY 10025 USA; [Baraffe, Isabelle; Homeier, Derek] Univ Lyon 1, Univ Lyon, ENS Lyon, CNRS,CRAL,UMR5574, F-69007 Lyon, France; [Manners, James; Smith, Chris] Met Off, Exeter EX1 3PB, Devon, England; [Tremblin, Pascal] CEA CNRS INRIA UPS UVSQ, Maison Simulat, USR 3441, Ctr Etud Saclay, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Homeier, Derek] Heidelberg Univ, Zentrum Astron, Konigstuhl 12, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany",University of Exeter; Columbia University; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Earth Sciences & Astronomy (INSU); Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon (ENS de LYON); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; Met Office - UK; CEA; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Information Sciences & Technologies (INS2I); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg,"Amundsen, DS (corresponding author), Univ Exeter, Astrophys Grp, Exeter EX4 4QL, Devon, England.;Amundsen, DS (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Dept Appl Phys & Appl Math, New York, NY 10025 USA.;Amundsen, DS (corresponding author), NASA, Goddard Inst Space Studies, New York, NY 10025 USA.",d.s.amundsen@columbia.edu,,"Acreman, David/0000-0002-4881-7584; Manners, James/0000-0003-4402-6811; Tremblin, Pascal/0000-0001-6172-3403","European Research Council under the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7 Grant) [247060-PEPS, 320478-TOFU]; NASA Astrobiology Program through the Nexus for Exoplanet System Science; Leverhulme Trust; Met Office Academic Partnership secondment; DFG through the Collaborative Research Centre The Milky Way System [SFB 881]; STFC; Large Facilities Capital Fund of BIS; University of Exeter; Science and Technology Facilities Council [ST/H008535/1, ST/K000373/1, ST/M006948/1] Funding Source: researchfish; STFC [ST/K000373/1, ST/M006948/1, ST/H008535/1] Funding Source: UKRI",European Research Council under the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7 Grant); NASA Astrobiology Program through the Nexus for Exoplanet System Science; Leverhulme Trust(Leverhulme Trust); Met Office Academic Partnership secondment; DFG through the Collaborative Research Centre The Milky Way System; STFC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Science & Technology Facilities Council (STFC)); Large Facilities Capital Fund of BIS; University of Exeter; Science and Technology Facilities Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Science & Technology Facilities Council (STFC)); STFC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Science & Technology Facilities Council (STFC)),"We would like to thank Jonathan Tennyson and Travis Barman for insightful discussions.

The effect of present plant phenology as a cue for dispersal into areas with favourable stages of development has been well established across avian and mammalian taxa. However, the effect of past experience is less understood. We studied the effect of past and present phenology of the environment on the direction and distance of natal dispersal in a passerine bird, the pied flycatcher (Ficedula hypoleuca). We monitored spring settlement of local recruits in six nest box plots along a 10-km stretch of a south-north gradient of plant and caterpillar food development. We found that males used both past experience of caterpillar phenology from early life and actual plant phenology during the recruitment season as independent cues for breeding settlement. Males that had experienced a mismatch with the caterpillar food peak as a nestling, and/or those that arrived late in the spring in the recruitment year, moved north of their natal site, whereas males that had experienced a better match with the caterpillars as a nestling, and/or those that migrated earlier in the spring, settled at a similar site or more to the south. In females, no such effects were found, suggesting that the usage of phenological cues is sex specific. In summary, tracking environmental phenology by natal dispersal may represent an effective mechanism for settling in new favourable areas, and may thus potentially cause rapid change of a species' geographical breeding range in response to climate change.","[Husek, J.; Lampe, H.

We use a state-of-the art ocean-sea ice model (MOM6 and SIS2) with idealized, zonally symmetric surface forcing and a range of idealized continental configurations with a large, Pacific-like basin and a small, Atlantic-like basin. We perform simulations with five coastline geometries along the Atlantic-like basin that range from coastlines that are straight to coastlines that are shaped like the coasts of the American and African continents. Changing the Atlantic basin coastline shape influences AMOC strength in a manner distinct from simply increasing basin width: widening the basin while maintaining straight coastlines leads to a 10-Sv (1 Sv equivalent to 10(6) m(3) s(-1)) increase in AMOC strength, whereas widening the basin with the geometry of the American and African continents leads to a 6-Sv increase in AMOC strength, despite both cases representing the same average basin-width increase relative to a control case. The structure of AMOC changes are different between these two cases as well: a more realistic basin geometry results in a shoaled AMOC while widening the basin with straight boundaries deepens AMOC. We test the influence of the shape of the both boundaries independently and find that AMOC is more sensitive to the American coastline while the African coastline impacts the abyssal circulation. We also find that AMOC strength and depth scales well with basin-scale meridional density difference, even with different Atlantic basin geometries, illuminating a robust physical link between AMOC and the North Atlantic western boundary density gradient.","[Ragen, Sarah; Armour, Kyle C.; Thompson, LuAnne; Darr, David] Univ Washington, Sch Oceanog, Seattle, WA USA; [Armour, Kyle C.] Univ Washington, Dept Atmospher Sci, Seattle, WA USA; [Shao, Andrew] Canadian Ctr Climate Modelling & Anal, Environm & Climate Change Canada, Victoria, BC, Canada",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling & Analysis (CCCma),"Ragen, S (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Sch Oceanog, Seattle, WA USA.",sragen@uw.edu,,"RAGEN, SARAH/0000-0003-0987-6060",National Science Foundation Award [OCE-1850900]; MEOPAR; MITACS [IT15738]; NASA Ocean Surface Topography Science Team [NNX17AH56G],National Science Foundation Award(National Science Foundation (NSF)); MEOPAR; MITACS; NASA Ocean Surface Topography Science Team(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)),"Authors Ragen, Armour, and Darr acknowledge support from National Science Foundation Award OCE-1850900.

Tropical cyclones originate from the North Indian Ocean and often cause devastating flood inundations in Bangladesh. Storm surges of the Bay of Bengal (BOB) are larger compared to other regions of the world for similar cyclones due to amplification by the shallow water depth, huge continental shelf and convergent coastlines. This scenario of inundation for such storm surges in the future when the sea level rise (SLR) occurs due to global warming will be different from the present. The densely populated coastal region of Bangladesh is likely to become more vulnerable in the future due to SLR. Disaster risks can be reduced if storm surges can be predicted well ahead. To assess the possible changes of inundation in the future, a widely used coastal model, Delft3D, has been applied for this BOB region. The model has been validated for the storm surge of three recent devastating cyclones, namely, Sidr, Aila and Roanu in the southern coast of Bangladesh. The validated model has been run to produce inundation maps and statistics for cyclonic storm surges such as Sidr, Aila and Roanu and probable SLR. Three possible SLR boundary conditions are chosen from the business-as-usual climate scenario representative concentration pathway 8.5 with values of 0.5m (lower limit), 1m (upper limit) and 1.5m (extreme case, considering the subsidence and a rapid collapse of the Antarctic ice sheet). It is found that a category 4 cyclone such as cyclone Sidr would inundate 2.6%, 3.67% and 5.84% of the area of the country if the SLR is 0.5, 1 and 1.5m, which will affect the livelihood of nearly 4.1, 7.0 and 9.1 million people of Bangladesh, respectively. It will also inundate up to 21.0%, 42.1% and 65.1% of the Sundarbans mangrove forest, which will undoubtedly affect the ecology of this unique ecosystem.","[Rahman, Shazzadur; Islam, A. K. M.

The model embeds a conventional nonlinear primitive equation based reduced gravity model (RGM) with N active layers overlying a 1/2 quiescent layer. The model is coupled to a high-resolution mixed layer model (MLM) to capture the physics of the mixed layer. The MLM incorporates a level-2 turbulence closure mixing scheme based on Mellor and Yamada (1982). As a result of the coupling, our model calculates the net hydrostatic pressure as a sum of those due to the thickness of RGM layers with constant densities and due to the dynamic topography of MLM levels with variable densities. At each time step the coupling between RGM and MLM is achieved as follows: (i) a layer-averaged tendency of momentum and tracers (i.e., temperature and salinity) of the MLM is updated to the RGM, (ii) momentum and tracers of the MLM get advected by large-scale horizontal dynamics of the RGM, and (iii) horizontal layer divergence of the RGM aides for the vertical advection of the MLM. By virtue of this coupling, the model faithfully reproduces the seasonal cycle of temperature, salinity, sea surface height, thermocline, mixed and barrier layer thickness of the tropical Indian Ocean. A simulation with Coordinated Ocean-Ice Reference Experiment (CORE) forcing for 15 years (from 1995 to 2009) is used as a test case to study the interannual variability (IAV) of the mixed layer depth and barrier layer thickness (BL) in BoB. The dominant modes of IAV in the BoB mixing are governed by the correspondingly varying surface momentum, heat, and fresh water fluxes with very little contribution from entrainment of heat and/or salt at the base of the mixed layer. Further, these fluxes are controlled by El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) variability with very little influence from Indian Ocean Dipole-Zonal Mode (IODZM). The BL IAV is predominantly controlled by precipitation forcing from ENSO. A stability analysis revealed that the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) and the stability function (S-H) are negatively correlated when ENSO is the dominant forcing. Such a correlation between TKE and S-H is expected since unstable stratification conditions exist during positive ENSO, where the kinetic energy production is enhanced by the unstable buoyancy forcing leading to an increased TKE. During the negative phase of ENSO, stably stratified conditions exist, where the kinetic energy production is offset by the stable buoyancy force, reducing the TKE. This is indicative of high (low) turbulent kinetic energy production, low (high) flux Richardson number based stability function (S-H), and low (high) dominance of buoyancy-driven mixing during positive (negative) phases of ENSO. The results highlight that the counteracting influence of TKE and S-H is a plausible reason for relatively weaker amplitude of IAV of BoB mixing compared to its normal seasonal cycle. Plain Language Summary A dynamic-thermodynamic reduced gravity ocean model embedded with a high-resolution vertical mixed layer model is introduced. Further the model is utilized to study the Bay of Bengal mixing and variability. The year to year variabilities of Bay of Bengal mixing and barrier layer are predominantly controlled by ENSO. Turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) and stability of water column dissociate and mitigate the variability of Bay of Bengal mixing when ENSO is a controlling factor. The study has implications for fine tuning the state of the art general circulation models and climate models in order to represent a robust spatiotemporal variability of surface mixing in the Bay of Bengal.","[Valsala, Vinu; Singh, Shikha] Indian Inst Trop Meteorol, Training Ctr, Pune, Maharashtra, India; [Singh, Shikha; Balasubramanian, Sridhar] Indian Inst Technol, Interdisciplinary Programme Climate Studies, Bombay, Maharashtra, India; [Balasubramanian, Sridhar] Indian Inst Technol, Dept Mech Engn, Bombay, Maharashtra, India",Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) - India; Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM); Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Bombay; Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Bombay,"Valsala, V (corresponding author), Indian Inst Trop Meteorol, Training Ctr, Pune, Maharashtra, India.",valsala@tropmet.res.in,"Valsala, Vinu/V-8414-2019",,,,,,59,10,10,0,12,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",2169-9275,2169-9291,,J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS,J.

The CEMP provides training workshops for stakeholders involved in the program, and educational outreach to address public concerns about health risk and environmental impacts from past and ongoing NTS activities. The network includes 29 monitoring stations located across an approximately 160,000 km(2) area of Nevada, Utah and California in the southwestern US. The principal radiological instruments are pressurized ion chambers for measuring gamma radiation, and particulate air samplers, primarily for alpha/beta detection. Stations also employ a full suite of meteorological instruments, allowing for improved interpretation of the effects of meteorological events on background radiation levels. Station sensors are wired to state-of-the-art dataloggers that are capable of several weeks of on-site data storage, and that work in tandem with a communications system that integrates DSL and wireless internet, land line and cellular phone, and satellite technologies for data transfer. Data are managed through a platform maintained by the Western Regional Climate Center (WRCC) that DRI operates for the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The WRCC platform allows for near real-time upload and display of current monitoring information in tabular and graphical formats on a public web site. Archival data for each station are also available on-line, providing the ability to perform trending analyses or calculate site-specific exposure rates. This configuration also allows for remote programming and troubleshooting of sensors. Involvement of stakeholders in the monitoring process provides a number of benefits, including increased public confidence in monitoring results, as well as decreasing costs by more than 50 percent from when the program was managed entirely by U.S. federal employees. Additionally, the CEMP provides an ideal platform for testing new environmental sensors.","[Hartwell, William T.] Desert Res Inst, Div Earth & Ecosyst Sci, Las Vegas, NV USA",Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); Desert Research Institute NSHE,"Hartwell, WT (corresponding author), Desert Res Inst, Div Earth & Ecosyst Sci, Las Vegas, NV USA.",,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,7,AMER SOC MECHANICAL ENGINEERS,NEW YORK,"THREE PARK AVENUE, NEW YORK, NY 10016-5990 USA",,,978-0-7918-4339-0,,,,2009,,,,,1461,1464,,,,,,4,"Engineering, Environmental; Nuclear Science & Technology",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Engineering; Nuclear Science & Technology,BKQ11,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000268927100222,View Full Record in Web of Science

Forcing numerical ocean models with those data allows the simulation of the estuarine system for long periods including the effect of high frequency wind variability, which in turn constitutes a powerful tool for understanding and evaluating wind forced climate variability in the region. Nevertheless, given the serious limitations of those data sets in the Southern Hemisphere, a question that must be answered before this kind of simulation explains to what extent ocean models forced by a reanalysis represent the real system. In this paper a model validation for the Rio de la Plata inner and outer estuary including adjacent shelf regions is presented. The HAMburg Shelf Ocean Model (HamSOM) code was forced with NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data to perform four hindcasts covering about 1 month in different seasons and five extreme events of storm surges. Three nested unilaterally coupled model domains with increasingly finer grids were used for the simulations. The role of wind forcing over the outer, large-scale shelf region was studied by both including and excluding the forcing for the outer domain. It was found that weak winds in the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis are under-estimated, and a correction factor is needed to adjust winds for different magnitudes. The comparison of simulated surface elevations and currents with observed ones yields high correlations, which improve even further when a meteorological forcing is included in the outer domain. The validation comprises state of the art accuracy with regards to problems where stratification plays a minor role. Numerical solutions satisfactorily reproduce both the timing and amplitude of the observed estuarine waters' response to wind, implying that the quality of the forcing is in turn good. Consequently, our simulations constitute an indirect validation of the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis 10 m winds. Even though they tend to underestimate wind speed, direction and variability seem to be properly represented, at least in the atmospheric synoptic to intra-seasonal time scales.

A systematic map,ENVIRONMENTAL EVIDENCE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Circular economy; Energy recovery; Fertiliser; Nutrient reuse; Resource recovery; Sewage; Wastewater treatment,RESOURCE RECOVERY; PARADIGM,"Background Eutrophication of the Baltic Sea, and many other water bodies, is partly the result of point-source emissions of nutrients and carbon from wastewater. At the same time, nitrogen and phosphorus planetary boundaries have been breached. There is a need for more efficient resource management, including the recovery and reuse of nutrients and carbon in waste. The aim of this paper is to collate evidence on ecotechnologies intended for use in the wastewater sector globally to facilitate the recovery or reuse of carbon and/or nutrients. Methods Searches were performed on literature published between 2013 and 2017 and in 5 bibliographic databases, 1 search engine, and 38 specialist websites. Database searches were performed in English. Searches in specialist websites were also performed in Finnish, Polish and Swedish. There was no geographical limitation. Screening was conducted at title and abstract level, and on full texts. Apart from bibliographical information, we extracted information on ecotechnology type, intervention, details of the recovery or reuse, the type of wastewater stream to which the ecotechnology is applied, the study location, type and design. Prior to screening and coding, we conducted consistency checks amongst reviewers. We generated a searchable database of coded studies. Findings were synthesised narratively and visualised in a geographical information system (i.e. an evidence atlas). We identified a series of knowledge gaps and clusters that warrant further research. Results The search resulted in 4024 records, out of which 413 articles were retained after the screening process. In addition, 35 pre-screened studies from the specialist website searches were added. Together, these 448 articles contained 474 individual studies of 28 types of ecotechnologies. A combination of ecotechnologies (16.7%), followed by microalgae cultivation (14.1%) were the most frequent ecotechnologies in the evidence base. Ecotechnologies for recovery composed 72.6% of the evidence base. The most common wastewater streams for recovery were mixed wastewater and sludge (73.8%). There was a relative lack of studies on recovery from source-separated wastewater. The most common type of recovery was energy (27.3%), followed by simultaneous recovery of nitrogen and phosphorus (22.1%). Reuse of recovered substances was described in 22.8% of the studies. The most common type of reuse was of nitrogen and phosphorus (57.4%), followed by joint reuse of organic carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus (35.2%). Reuse ecotechnologies were mostly focused on the use of wastewater for irrigation or reuse of biosolids, and not on the nutrients that had been extracted through e.g. precipitation of struvite. In 22 studies both recovery and reuse were described. In total, 60 different study countries were reported in the evidence base, and the most common study location was China. Conclusions We found substantial evidence for the recovery and reuse of nutrients and carbon from wastewater sources. The relative abundance of studies where substances are recovered compared to studies where they are reused, suggests a knowledge gap on reuse of recovered nutrients and carbon. The majority of studies on reuse were on irrigation with treated wastewater or reuse of biosolids, and not on reuse of extracted nutrients such as struvite.","[Johannesdottir, Solveig L.] RISE Res Inst Sweden, Ultunaallen 4, Uppsala, Sweden; [Macura, Biljana; Lorick, Dag; Haddaway, Neal R.; Ek, Filippa] Stockholm Environm Inst, Linnegatan 87D, Stockholm, Sweden; [McConville, Jennifer] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Energy & Technol, Box 7032, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden; [Haddaway, Neal R.] Univ Johannesburg, Africa Ctr Evidence, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Haddaway, Neal R.] Mercator Res Inst Global Commons & Climate Change, Berlin, Germany; [Karczmarczyk, Agnieszka] Warsaw Univ Life Sci, Dept Environm Dev, Nowoursynowska 166, PL-02787 Warsaw, Poland; [Piniewski, Mikolaj; Osuch, Pawel] Warsaw Univ Life Sci, Dept Hydrol Meteorol & Water Resources, Nowoursynowska 166, PL-02787 Warsaw, Poland; [Ksiezniak, Marta] Warsaw Univ Life Sci, Dept Remote Sensing & Environm Assessment, Nowoursynowska 166, PL-02787 Warsaw, Poland",RISE Research Institutes of Sweden; Stockholm Environment Institute; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; University of Johannesburg; Warsaw University of Life Sciences; Warsaw University of Life Sciences; Warsaw University of Life Sciences,"Johannesdottir, SL (corresponding author), RISE Res Inst Sweden, Ultunaallen 4, Uppsala, Sweden.",solveig.johannesdottir@ri.se,"Księżniak, Marta/AAR-7061-2021; Piniewski, Mikolaj/A-5159-2012","Księżniak, Marta/0000-0002-9245-9024; Piniewski, Mikolaj/0000-0001-7930-4549; Macura, Biljana/0000-0002-4253-1390","BONUS - EU [Art 185, 2016-01076]; Swedish Foundation for Strategic Environmental Research FORMAS [2016-01076]; Sweden's innovation agency VINNOVA; Academy of Finland; National Centre for Research and Development in Poland","BONUS - EU; Swedish Foundation for Strategic Environmental Research FORMAS; Sweden's innovation agency VINNOVA(Vinnova); Academy of Finland(Academy of Finland); National Centre for Research and Development in Poland(National Centre for Research & Development, Poland)","This systematic map was conducted as part of BONUS RETURN project.

However, there are barriers that need to be considered and understood to be able to optimise the potential of these systems to support a more sustainable future. To this end, transdisciplinary skills and a combination of different mindsets are needed to be able to ask the right questions at the right time.There are several approaches that can help us to initiate constructing innovative, transformative, future-oriented and systematic ideas and questions. The three important approaches that are suggested in this article are systems mindset, design mindset and futuristic mindset. These mindsets combined with the transdisciplinary perspective - where different disciplines work jointly to create sustainable solutions not only for today but also for tomorrow - have the power to change the world. This article underlines the importance of transdisciplinarity, presents the three mindsets and illustrates a hypothetical use case on how to blend these three mindsets to enable creative work in the future's transdisciplinary world for human-centred and sustainable future.","[Broo, Didem Gurdur] Univ Cambridge, Ctr Smart Infrastruct & Construct, Dept Engn, Cambridge CB3 0FA, England; [Broo, Didem Gurdur] Univ Cambridge, Laing ORourke Ctr Construct Engn & Technol, Dept Engn, Cambridge CB3 0FA, England; [Broo, Didem Gurdur] Univ Cambridge, Ctr Digital Built Britain, Cambridge CB3 0FA, England",University of Cambridge; University of Cambridge; University of Cambridge,"Broo, DG (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Ctr Smart Infrastruct & Construct, Dept Engn, Cambridge CB3 0FA, England.;Broo, DG (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Laing ORourke Ctr Construct Engn & Technol, Dept Engn, Cambridge CB3 0FA, England.;Broo, DG (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Ctr Digital Built Britain, Cambridge CB3 0FA, England.",dg580@cam.ac.uk,,/0000-0002-8853-4159,European Union [882550]; Construction Inno-vation Hub funded through the UK Government?s modern industrial strategy by Innovate UK; UK Research and Innovation,European Union(European Commission); Construction Inno-vation Hub funded through the UK Government?s modern industrial strategy by Innovate UK; UK Research and Innovation(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)),"The fundamental theory that is presented in this article has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement No. 882550.

The importance of the plant pollinator interplay (PPI), in flowering crops such as legumes lies in a combination of the importance of pollination for the production service and breeding strategies, plus the increasing urgency in mitigating the decline of pollinators through the development and implementation of conservation measures. To realize the full potential of the PPI, a multidisciplinary approach is required. This article assembles an international team of genebank managers, geneticists, plant breeders, experts on environmental governance and agro-ecology, and comprises several sections. The contributions in these sections outline both the state of the art of knowledge in the field and the novel aspects under development, and encompass a range of reviews, opinions and perspectives. The first three sections explore the role of PPI in legume breeding strategies. PPI based approaches to crop improvement can make it possible to adapt and re-design breeding strategies to meet both goals of: (1) optimal productivity, based on an efficient use of pollinators, and (2) biodiversity conservation. The next section deals with entomological aspects and focuses on the protection of the pest control service and pollinators in legume crops. The final section addresses general approaches to encourage the synergy between food production and pollination services at farmer field level. Two basic approaches are proposed: (a) Farming with Alternative Pollinators and (b) Crop Design System.","[Suso, Maria J.] Spanish Natl Res Council, Inst Sustainable Agr, Dept Plant Breeding, Cordoba, Spain; [Bebeli, Penelope J.] Agr Univ Athens, Lab Plant Breeding & Biometry, Dept Crop Sci, GR-11855 Athens, Greece; [Christmann, Stefanie] Int Ctr Agr Res Dry Areas, Rabat, Morocco; [Mateus, Celia] Natl Inst Agr & Veterinarian Res Linking Landscap, Agr & Forestry Syst & Pant Protect Unit, Oeiras, Portugal; [Negri, Valeria; Torricelli, Renzo] Univ Perugia, Dept Agr Food & Environm Sci, I-06100 Perugia, Italy; [Pinheiro de Carvalho, Miguel A.

Breeding populations have also declined in the eastern North American Arctic, but appear to be stable or increasing in the central and western Arctic. To identify vulnerable populations and sites, we documented the migratory connectivity of Semipalmated Sandpipers using light-level geolocators, deploying 250 at 8 Arctic sites across the species' breeding range from 2011 to 2015, plus 87 at a single wintering site in northeastern Brazil in 2013 and 2014. We recovered 59 units and resighted 7 more (26% return rate) on the breeding grounds, but none at the nonbreeding site. We recovered only similar to 3% of units deployed in 2013 at eastern Arctic breeding sites, but recovered 33% of those deployed in 2015. Overall, birds with geolocators were 57% as likely to return as those carrying alphanumeric flags. Stopover durations at prairie sites (mean: 8.7 days southbound, 6.7 days northbound) were comparable with durations estimated by local banding studies, but geolocator-tagged birds had longer stopovers than previously estimated at James and Hudson Bay, the Bay of Fundy, and the Gulf of Mexico. Migration routes confirmed an eastern Arctic connection with northeastern South America. Birds from eastern Alaska, USA, and far western Canada wintered from Venezuela to French Guiana. Central Alaskan breeders wintered across a wider range from Ecuador to French Guiana. Birds that bred in western Alaska wintered mainly on the west coasts of Central America and northwestern South America, outside the nonbreeding region in which population declines have been observed. Birds that bred in the eastern Arctic and used the Atlantic Flyway wintered in the areas in South America where declines have been reported, whereas central Arctic-breeding populations were apparently stable. This suggests that declines may be occurring on the Atlantic Flyway and in the eastern Arctic region.","[Brown, Stephen; Clay, Rob; Schulte, Shiloh; Winn, Brad] Manomet Inc, Saxtons River, VT 02360 USA; [Gratto-Trevor, Cheri] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Saskatoon, SK, Canada; [Porter, Ron] Delaware Bay Shorebird Project, Ambler, PA USA; [Weiser, Emily L.; Sandercock, Brett K.] Kansas State Univ, Manhattan, KS USA; [Mizrahi, David] New Jersey Audubon Soc, Cape May Court House, Bernardsville, NJ USA; [Bentzen, Rebecca] Wildlife Conservat Soc, Fairbanks, AK USA; [Boldenow, Megan] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Fairbanks, AK USA; [Freeman, Scott] Arctic Natl Wildlife Refuge, Fairbanks, AK USA; [Giroux, Marie-Andree; Lecomte, Nicolas] Univ Moncton, Canada Res Chair Polar & Boreal Ecol, Moncton, NB, Canada; [Giroux, Marie-Andree; Lecomte, Nicolas] Univ Quebec Rimouski, Rimouski, PQ, Canada; [Kwon, Eunbi] Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Fish & Wildlife Conservat, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Lank, David B.] Simon Fraser Univ, Ctr Wildlife Ecol, Burnaby, BC, Canada; [Liebezeit, Joe] Audubon Soc Portland, Portland, OR USA; [Loverti, Vanessa] US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Portland, OR USA; [Rausch, Jennie] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Yellowknife, NT, Canada; [Smith, Paul] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Taylor, Audrey] Univ Alaska Anchorage, Anchorage, AK USA; [Lanctot, Richard B.] US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Anchorage, AK USA",Environment & Climate Change Canada; Kansas State University; Wildlife Conservation Society; University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Fairbanks; University of Moncton; University of Quebec; Universite du Quebec a Rimouski; Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University; Simon Fraser University; United States Department of the Interior; US Fish & Wildlife Service; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Environment & Climate Change Canada; University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Anchorage,"Brown, S (corresponding author), Manomet Inc, Saxtons River, VT 02360 USA.",sbrown@manomet.org,"Sandercock, Brett K/L-1644-2016","Sandercock, Brett K/0000-0002-9240-0268; Freeman, Scott/0000-0002-4580-8885; Lecomte, Nicolas/0000-0002-8473-5375; Lank, David/0000-0002-2670-5143; Weiser, Emily/0000-0003-1598-659X","Manomet Center for Conservation Sciences; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service; Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act grant program [F13AP00535]; National Fish and Wildlife Foundation's Alaska Fish and Wildlife Fund [0801.13.041129]; Environment and Climate Change Canada, Natural Resources Canada's Polar Continental Shelf Program; Liz Claiborne and Art Ortenberg Foundation; New Jersey Audubon Society; Mount Allison University; Simon Fraser University; Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada; Government of Nunavut; National Science Foundation [ARC 1023996]; Alaska Department of Fish and Game; Murie Science and Learning Center","Manomet Center for Conservation Sciences; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service(US Fish & Wildlife Service); Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act grant program; National Fish and Wildlife Foundation's Alaska Fish and Wildlife Fund; Environment and Climate Change Canada, Natural Resources Canada's Polar Continental Shelf Program; Liz Claiborne and Art Ortenberg Foundation; New Jersey Audubon Society; Mount Allison University; Simon Fraser University; Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada; Government of Nunavut; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Alaska Department of Fish and Game; Murie Science and Learning Center","Funders included the Manomet Center for Conservation Sciences, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act grant program (F13AP00535), the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation's Alaska Fish and Wildlife Fund (0801.13.041129), Environment and Climate Change Canada, Natural Resources Canada's Polar Continental Shelf Program, the Liz Claiborne and Art Ortenberg Foundation, New Jersey Audubon Society, Mount Allison University, Simon Fraser University, Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada, the Government of Nunavut, the National Science Foundation (ARC 1023996), Alaska Department of Fish and Game, the Murie Science and Learning Center, and anonymous donors.

However, it has been suggested that there is a substantial and unwarranted imbalance within this biopsychosocial framework, with the social' aspects of the equation relegated to secondary or facilitating factors within treatment contexts. Drawing on data from 12 qualitative interviews with health professionals in a UK region, this article examines the extent to which sociocultural perspectives on eating disorders are valued and explored in eating disorder treatment, with a particular focus on the relationship between eating disorders and gender. As girls/women are widely acknowledged to be disproportionately affected by eating problems, the article draws on feminist perspectives on eating disorders to explore whether the relationships between cultural constructions of femininity and experiences of body/eating distress are actively addressed within treatment. The study reveals high levels of inconsistency in this regard, as while some participants see such issues as central to treatment, others have never really considered' them before. In addition, the study examines the potential limitations of how such sociocultural issues are conceptualised and addressed, as well as why they might be marginalised in the current climate of evidence-based eating disorder treatment. The article then considers the implications of the findings for thinking about feminist perspectives on eating disorders - and the significance of gender in treatment - at the level of both research and practice.","[Holmes, Su] Univ East Anglia, Televis, Norwich, Norfolk, England",University of East Anglia,"Holmes, S (corresponding author), Univ East Anglia, Sch Art Media & Amer Studies, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",Susan.holmes@uea.ac.uk,,,,,,,44,5,5,5,22,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1363-4593,1461-7196,,HEALTH-LONDON,Health,NOV,2018,6,,,,541,557,,10.1177/1363459317715778,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1363459317715778,,,17,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Social Sciences, Biomedical",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Biomedical Social Sciences",GV4VV,28649862,Green Accepted,,,12/21/22,WOS:000446100200002,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, mitochondrial energy metabolism is relatively low, which affects hepatic functionality and sensitivity to hepatotoxins. Culturing in a bioartificial liver (BAL) system with high oxygen, medium perfusion, low substrate stiffness, and 3D conformation increases HepaRG functionality and mitochondrial activity compared to conventional monolayer culturing. In addition, drug metabolism has been improved by overexpression of the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), a regulator of drug and energy metabolism in the new HepaRG-CAR line. Here, we investigated the effect of BAL culturing on the HepaRG-CAR line by applying a simple and downscaled BAL culture procedure based on shaking 3D cultures, named Bal-in-a-dish (BALIAD). We compared monolayer and BALIAD cultures of HepaRG and HepaRG-CAR cells. CAR overexpression and BALIAD culturing synergistically or additively increased transcript levels of CAR and three of the seven tested CAR target genes in biotransformation. Additionally, Cytochrome P450 3A4 activity was 35-fold increased. The mitochondrial energy metabolism was enhanced; lactate production and glucose consumption switched into lactate elimination and glucose production. BALIAD culturing alone reduced glycogen content and increased oxygen consumption and mitochondrial content. Both CAR overexpression and BALIAD culturing decreased mitochondrial superoxide levels. HepaRG-CAR BALIADs were most sensitive to mitochondrial toxicity induced by the hepatotoxin amiodarone, as indicated by oxygen consumption and mitochondrial superoxide accumulation. These data show that BALIAD culturing of HepaRG-CAR cells induces high mitochondrial energy metabolism and xenobiotic metabolism, increasing its potential for drug toxicity studies.","[van der Mark, Vincent A.; Adam, Aziza A.

It is concluded that the current level of political violence in Vietnam is low. Using a wide range of data sources on composite indicators (Global Terrorism Index, Global Terrorism Database and Global Peace Index), it is concluded that to date Vietnam has recorded a low level of political violence. The research explores basic criminogenic conditions or factors that lead to relevant risk of growth of political violence. It should be noted that to some extent ethnic tensions still exist in Vietnam. There is also a great concern about criminal activity of a number of domestic and international terrorist organizations, which, in the short or long term, could disrupt domestic political situation and escalate terrorism. The researchers argue that although political and religious motives (e.g. establishing an Islamic state) underlie certain terrorist activities of international terrorist organizations and the fact that Muslims in Vietnam make up about 0,1 % of the country's population, Vietnam's international commitment to counter-terrorism is likely to make it a target of retaliation by these organizations. In addition, there is a possibility that these organizations may commit terrorist acts within the territory of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam to support and fund terrorist activities in the future. We summarized that as at present in force Criminal Code of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam includes special provisions that carry liability for individual acts showing signs of terrorism (arts. 113, 299, 300 CC SRV) and norms within international obligations that cover criminal liability for other crimes of terrorist nature (crimes with indicators of terrorization). The comparative legal analysis of anti-terrorist statutes presented in the 2015 version of the Criminal Code of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam reveals legal and technical defects in certain material elements of terrorist offences. It is noted that Vietnamese legislator distinguishes two forms of terrorism: traditional terrorism, which pursues political aims (criminal acts against the people's government, committed for the purpose of combating it) and terrorism aimed at creating a climate of fear in society.","[Korobeev, Alexander, I; Nguyen Hung] Far Eastern Fed Univ, Sch Law, Chair Criminal Law & Criminol, Vladivostok, Russia; [Lobach, Dmitriy, V] Vladivostok State Univ Econ & Serv, Inst Law, Chair Theory & Hist Russian & Int Law, Vladivostok, Russia; [Nguyen Hung] Vietnam Hungary Ind Univ, Hanoi, Vietnam",Far Eastern Federal University; Vladivostok State University of Economics & Services,"Korobeev, AI (corresponding author), Far Eastern Fed Univ, Sch Law, Chair Criminal Law & Criminol, Vladivostok, Russia.",akorobeev@rambler.ru; di-maved85@mail.ru; hungnguyen.vh@gmail.com,,,Russian Federation [H(sic)2668.2020.6],Russian Federation(Russian Federation),"This article is a research report carried out under a grant from the president of the Russian Federation in support of major scientific schools of the Russian Federation to carry out scientific research on the subject << National-cultural and digital trends in the socio-economic and political-legal development of the Russian Federation in the 21st century >>, Project H(sic)2668.2020.6",,24,0,0,0,2,BAIKAL STATE UNIV,IRKUTSK,"11 LENIN ST, IRKUTSK, 664003, RUSSIA",2500-4255,2500-1442,,RUSS J CRIMINOL,Russ.

Soaring birds are among the most affected groups with alarming fatality rates by collision with wind turbines and an escalating occupation of their migratory corridors. These birds have been described as changing their flight trajectories to avoid wind turbines, but this behaviour may lead to functional habitat loss, as suitable soaring areas in the proximity of wind turbines will likely be underused. We modelled the displacement effect of wind turbines on black kites (Milvus migrans) tracked by GPS. We also evaluated the impact of this effect at the scale of the landscape by estimating how much suitable soaring area was lost to wind turbines. We used state-of-the-art tracking devices to monitor the movements of 130 black kites in an area populated by wind turbines, at the migratory bottleneck of the Strait of Gibraltar. Landscape use by birds was mapped from GPS data using dynamic Brownian bridge movement models, and generalized additive mixed modelling was used to estimate the effect of wind turbine proximity on bird use while accounting for orographic and thermal uplift availability. We found that areas up to approximately 674 m away from the turbines were less used than expected given their uplift potential. Within that distance threshold, bird use decreased with the proximity to wind turbines. We estimated that the footprint of wind turbines affected 3%-14% of the areas suitable for soaring in our study area. We present evidence that the impacts of wind energy industry on soaring birds are greater than previously acknowledged. In addition to the commonly reported fatalities, the avoidance of turbines by soaring birds causes habitat losses in their movement corridors. Authorities should recognize this further impact of wind energy production and establish new regulations that protect soaring habitat. We also showed that soaring habitat for birds can be modelled at a fine scale using publicly available data. Such an approach can be used to plan low-impact placement of turbines in new wind energy developments.","[Marques, Ana T.; Palmeirim, Jorge Manuel; Silva, Joao P.] Univ Lisbon, Fac Ciencias, CE3c Ctr Ecol Evolucao & Alteracoes Ambientais, P-1749016 Lisbon, Portugal; [Marques, Ana T.] Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Agron, Ctr Ecol Aplicada Prof Baeta Neves CEABN, InBio, Lisbon, Portugal; [Marques, Ana T.; Moreira, Francisco; Silva, Joao P.] Univ Porto, Ctr Invest Biodiversidade & Recursos Genet, REN Biodivers Chair, CIBIO InBio,Lab Associado, Vairao, Portugal; [Santos, Carlos D.; Wikelski, Martin] Max Planck Inst Ornithol, Dept Migrat & Immunoecol, Radolfzell am Bodensee, Germany; [Santos, Carlos D.] Univ Fed Para, Nucleo Teoria & Pesquisa Comportamento, Belem, Para, Brazil; [Hanssen, Frank] Norwegian Inst Nat Res, Trondheim, Norway; [Munoz, Antonio-Roman] Univ Malaga, Fac Ciencias, Dept Biol Anim, Biogeog Divers & Conservat Res Team, Malaga, Spain; [Onrubia, Alejandro] Fdn Migres CIMA, Cadiz, Spain; [Wikelski, Martin] Univ Konstanz, Dept Biol, Constance, Germany; [Moreira, Francisco; Silva, Joao P.] Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Agron, Ctr Invest Biodiversidade & Recursos Genet, CIBIO InBio,Lab Associado, Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade de Lisboa; Universidade de Lisboa; Universidade do Porto; Max Planck Society; Universidade Federal do Para; Norwegian Institute Nature Research; Universidad de Malaga; University of Konstanz; Universidade de Lisboa,"Marques, AT (corresponding author), Univ Lisbon, Fac Ciencias, CE3c Ctr Ecol Evolucao & Alteracoes Ambientais, P-1749016 Lisbon, Portugal.;Marques, AT (corresponding author), Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Agron, Ctr Ecol Aplicada Prof Baeta Neves CEABN, InBio, Lisbon, Portugal.;Marques, AT (corresponding author), Univ Porto, Ctr Invest Biodiversidade & Recursos Genet, REN Biodivers Chair, CIBIO InBio,Lab Associado, Vairao, Portugal.",ateresamarques@gmail.com,"Palmeirim, Jorge M/A-1323-2014; Santos, Carlos/E-5881-2013; MUÑOZ, Antonio Román/K-8259-2014; Hanssen, Frank/AAW-2037-2020; Moreira, Francisco/B-2873-2008; Marques, Ana Teresa/J-2585-2014; Silva, Joao Paulo/L-6745-2013; Onrubia, Alejandro/G-3314-2016","Palmeirim, Jorge M/0000-0003-4734-8162; Santos, Carlos/0000-0001-5693-9795; MUÑOZ, Antonio Román/0000-0002-0253-7632; Hanssen, Frank/0000-0002-0775-6340; Moreira, Francisco/0000-0003-4393-8018; Marques, Ana Teresa/0000-0003-3279-643X; Silva, Joao Paulo/0000-0002-1956-5779; Onrubia, Alejandro/0000-0001-8860-3524",,,,,70,36,40,9,134,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

These impacts are sensitive to dust particle size distribution (PSD), yet models struggle or even fail to represent coarse (diameter (d) > 2.5 mu m) and giant (d > 20 mu m) dust particles and the evolution of the PSD with transport. Here we examine three state-of-the-art airborne observational datasets, all of which measured the full size range of dust (d = 0.1 to > 100 mu m) at different stages during transport with consistent instrumentation. We quantify the presence and evolution of coarse and giant particles and their contribution to optical properties using airborne observations over the Sahara (from the Fennec field campaign) and in the Saharan Air Layer (SAL) over the tropical eastern Atlantic (from the AER-D field campaign). Observations show significantly more abundant coarse and giant dust particles over the Sahara compared to the SAL: effective diameters of up to 20 mu m were observed over the Sahara compared to 4 mu m in the SAL. Excluding giant particles over the Sahara results in significant underestimation of mass concentration (40 %), as well as underestimates of both shortwave and longwave extinction (18% and 26 %, respectively, from scattering calculations), while the effects in the SAL are smaller but non-negligible. The larger impact on longwave extinction compared to shortwave implies a bias towards a radiative cooling effect in dust models, which typically exclude giant particles and underestimate coarse-mode concentrations. A compilation of the new and published effective diameters against dust age since uplift time suggests that two regimes of dust transport exist. During the initial 1.5 d, both coarse and giant particles are rapidly deposited. During the subsequent 1.5 to 10 d, PSD barely changes with transport, and the coarse mode is retained to a much greater degree than expected from estimates of gravitational sedimentation alone. The reasons for this are unclear and warrant further investigation in order to improve dust transport schemes and the associated radiative effects of coarse and giant particles in models.","[Ryder, Claire L.; Highwood, Eleanor J.] Univ Reading, Dept Meteorol, Reading RG6 6BB, Berks, England; [Walser, Adrian; Philipp, Anne; Weinzierl, Bernadett] Univ Vienna, Fac Phys Aerosol Phys & Environm Phys, Vienna, Austria; [Seibert, Petra] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Meteorol, Vienna, Austria","University of Reading; University of Vienna; University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna","Ryder, CL (corresponding author), Univ Reading, Dept Meteorol, Reading RG6 6BB, Berks, England.",c.l.ryder@reading.ac.uk,"Ryder, Claire L/K-5969-2014; Walser, Adrian/G-3264-2019; Weinzierl, Bernadett/G-5319-2012","Ryder, Claire L/0000-0002-9892-6113; Tipka, Anne/0000-0003-2645-3318; Walser, Adrian/0000-0003-0175-8211; Weinzierl, Bernadett/0000-0003-4555-5686",NERC [NE/M018288/1],NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),This research has been supported by a NERC independent research fellowship grant (grant no.

Accurate and timely estimation of corn yield is therefore essential for commodity trading and global food security. Recently, several deep learning models have been explored for corn yield forecasting. Despite success, most existing models only provide yield estimations without quantifying the uncertainty associated with the predictions. Also, the traditional deep learning approaches typically require a large training set and are easily prone to overfitting when the number of samples in the training set is relatively small. To address these limitations, in this study, we developed a county-level corn yield prediction model based on Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) using multiple data sources that are publicly available, including time-series satellite products, sequential climate observations, soil property maps, and historical corn yield records. Using preceding years since 2001 for model training, the developed BNN model achieved an average coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.77 for late-season prediction across the U.S. Corn Belt in testing years 2010-2019, and outperformed five other state-of-the-art machine learning models. Detailed evaluation in three representative testing years demonstrated that the proposed BNN model could accurately estimate corn yield not only in normal years but also in abnormal years when extreme weather events happened. Moreover, the timeliness of the prediction was evaluated within the growing season with an R-2 similar to 0.75 achieved by middle August, which is about 2 months before the harvest. We also assessed the predictive uncertainty, and more than 84% of the observed yield records were successfully enveloped in the 95% confidence interval of the predictive yield distribution. Our results also showed that the uncertainty level decreased steadily as time proceeded and stabilized around early August. Uncertainties in yield prediction were mainly induced by the observation noise and also related to the inter-annual and seasonal variabilities of environmental stress such as heat and water stress. This paper provides a robust framework for the within-season prediction of crop yield and highlights the need to obtain a deeper understanding of the effects of environmental stress on agricultural productivity and crop yield estimation.","[Ma, Yuchi; Zhang, Zhou] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Biol Syst Engn, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Kang, Yanghui] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Geog, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Kang, Yanghui] ARS, USDA, Hydrol & Remote Sensing Lab, 10300 Baltimore Ave, Beltsville, MD 20705 USA; [Ozdogan, Mutlu] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Forest & Wildlife Ecol, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Ozdogan, Mutlu] Univ Wisconsin, Nelson Inst Ctr Sustainabil & Global Environm, Madison, WI 53726 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Zhang, Z (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Biol Syst Engn, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",ma286@wisc.edu; zzhang347@wisc.edu; ykang38@wisc.edu; ozdogan@wisc.edu,"Kang, Yanghui/GRJ-5984-2022","Kang, Yanghui/0000-0001-8563-1503","National Institute of Food and Agriculture, United States Department of Agriculture [WIS03026]; University of Wisconsin-Madison, Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research and Graduate Education; Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation","National Institute of Food and Agriculture, United States Department of Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); University of Wisconsin-Madison, Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research and Graduate Education; Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation","l This research was supported by the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, United States Department of Agriculture, under grant number WIS03026, and the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research and Graduate Education with funding from the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation.",,71,34,35,17,103,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0034-4257,1879-0704,,REMOTE SENS ENVIRON,Remote Sens.

This situation lets design with freedom a face for the building. The subsequent evolution of building technologies has multiplied the potentiality of this closing element, thought from the beginning as the protection of inner space. That closing has now become a skin, distinguished as a mediator between inner and outer, which like human skin also exhales, inside conditions reports and outside circumstances absorbs. This idea is physically related to the concept of out-tonomy, due to the fact that mediation would be built about an inner world, clearly influenced by other world, outer one. Besides this dual relationship is conceptual indeed, because from a theoretical point of view the skin is designed from the mediation between two scopes as technology, scale or composition; purest architectural discipline topics and external aspects like History, Social issues, Advertising, Market or Art. This extended process of the project, lets Architecture to establish linkages and connections between building and its context, understanding it in a broad sense that goes from the place, memory, climate, ecology, economics and phenomenological issues. This research articulates this mediation, in which the skin gets loaded of external information, through three major mechanisms. The first one would be that, in which the matter itself is altered and transformed to build this mediation with the surroundings. A second group would consist of those skins in which layers are added by mathematical rules, tattoos, color or lighting technologies to define a codification that allows a cultural interpretation of the building. And at last, one mechanism would pursue the physical elimination of the skin, to turn it into data, in support of the liquid society that builds contemporary society. Contemporary society in the sense that Giorgio Agamben gave, by defining it as the one that doesn't match perfectly with its time and doesn't fit well to their aspirations, and this way from disconnection or lapses, is better able to perceive and grasp its time.

A mechanistic representation of the atmospheric mercury cycle is developed for the state-of-the-art global climate-chemistry model, CAM-Chem (Community Atmospheric Model with Chemistry). The model simulates the emission, transport, transformation and deposition of atmospheric mercury (Hg) in three forms: elemental mercury (Hg(0)), reactive mercury (Hg(II)), and particulate mercury (PHg). Emissions of mercury include those from human, land, ocean, biomass burning and volcano related sources. Land emissions are calculated based on surface solar radiation flux and skin temperature. A simplified air-sea mercury exchange scheme is used to calculate emissions from the oceans. The chemistry mechanism includes the oxidation of Hg(0) in gaseous phase by ozone with temperature dependence, OH, H2O2 and chlorine. Aqueous chemistry includes both oxidation and reduction of Hg(0). Transport and deposition of mercury species are calculated through adapting the original formulations in CAM-Chem. The CAM-Chem model with mercury is driven by present meteorology to simulate the present mercury air quality during the 1999-2001 period. The resulting surface concentrations of total gaseous mercury (TGM) are then compared with the observations from worldwide sites. Simulated wet depositions of mercury over the continental United States are compared to the observations from 26 Mercury Deposition Network stations to test the wet deposition simulations. The evaluations of gaseous concentrations and wet deposition confirm a strong capability for the CAM-Chem mercury mechanism to simulate the atmospheric mercury cycle. The general reproduction of global TGM concentrations and the overestimation on South Africa indicate that model simulations of TGM are seriously affected by emissions. The comparison to wet deposition indicates that wet deposition patterns of mercury are more affected by the spatial variability of precipitation. The sensitivity experiments show that 22% of total mercury deposition and 25% of TGM concentrations in the United States result from domestic anthropogenic sources, but only 9% of total mercury deposition and 7% of TGM concentrations are contributed by transpacific transport. However, the contributions of domestic and transpacific sources on the western United States levels of mercury are of comparable magnitude.","[Lei, H.; Wuebbles, D.

The intelligent analysis, modeling, and management of agricultural and forest ecosystems, and of the use and protection of soils, already play important roles in securing our planet for future generations and will become irreplaceable in the future. Technical solutions must encompass the entire agricultural and forestry value chain. The process of digital transformation is supported by cyber-physical systems enabled by advances in ML, the availability of big data and increasing computing power. For certain tasks, algorithms today achieve performances that exceed human levels. The challenge is to use multimodal information fusion, i.e., to integrate data from different sources (sensor data, images, *omics), and explain to an expert why a certain result was achieved. However, ML models often react to even small changes, and disturbances can have dramatic effects on their results. Therefore, the use of AI in areas that matter to human life (agriculture, forestry, climate, health, etc.) has led to an increased need for trustworthy AI with two main components: explainability and robustness. One step toward making AI more robust is to leverage expert knowledge. For example, a farmer/forester in the loop can often bring in experience and conceptual understanding to the AI pipeline-no AI can do this. Consequently, human-centered AI (HCAI) is a combination of artificial intelligence and natural intelligence to empower, amplify, and augment human performance, rather than replace people. To achieve practical success of HCAI in agriculture and forestry, this article identifies three important frontier research areas: (1) intelligent information fusion; (2) robotics and embodied intelligence; and (3) augmentation, explanation, and verification for trusted decision support.

State of the art turbine blades have reached dimensions up to 65 meters, which only seems to be limited in terms of transportation. For this reason, German manufacturer Enercon has started to build hybrid blades, made of both, a composite and a steel section which are fit together at the construction site. Still blade fabrication is hardly automized which can result in divergence of quality. Even though design standards have improved, damages due to fabrication inaccuracy still are present. Regarding the consequences of one blade failure, the average inspection and repair time must be estimated taking five days of down time [1]. Hence, the load carrying structure should be monitored in order to minimize costs of maintenance and repair and to extend lifetime. Today, there are only three products on the market other than visual inspection [7][8]. None of these products have been certified for reliable damage detection. For this purpose an automated blade monitoring system for early damage detection is currently developed. It is based on an approach using the proportionality of maximum dynamic stress and maximum vibration velocity related to the first bending modes, in the edge- and flapwise direction. This approach already could be proven to indicate starting damage much earlier than a change in eigenfrequency. Both numerical calculations and laboratory testing could reveal that dependent on the location where damage occurs, the proportionality method can show tremendous changes compared to the initial level [6]. A smart technical platform is supplied by the project partner HBM, offering sensor technology fully orientated on the challenging environment of a turbine blade. Quickly changing climate conditions combined with a high risk of lightning strike which mostly is affecting the entire measurement system have been included into the development of a new deflection sensor which is absolutely immune to the influences mentioned. In 2009 this system could be tested successfully during an edgewise fatigue test at the blade test center in Aalborg, Denmark. Currently, a long-term testing inside a 50.8 m blade of a 3.3 MW REpower turbine is performed, operating near the city of Husum, Germany.","[Zerbst, S.; Rolfes, R.] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Struct Anal, D-30167 Hannover, Germany",Leibniz University Hannover,"Zerbst, S (corresponding author), Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Struct Anal, Appelstr 9A, D-30167 Hannover, Germany.",,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,9,"DESTECH PUBLICATIONS, INC",LANCASTER,"439 DUKE STREET, LANCASTER, PA 17602-4967 USA",,,978-1-60595-053-2,STRUCT HLTH MONIT,,,2013,,,,,2157,2164,,,,,,8,"Engineering, Multidisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Engineering,BJH31,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000328194500099,View Full Record in Web of Science

They are gaining more and more importance due to the accelerating pace of climate change and the rising cost of limited fossil resources. Against this background, a heating system combining solar thermal collectors, heat pump, stratified thermal storage, and water/ice latent heat storage has been investigated. The major advantages of the proposed solar/heat pump heating system are considered to be its flexible application (suitable for new and existing buildings because of acceptable space demand), as well as the improvement of solar fraction (extended solar collector utilization time, enhanced collector efficiency), i.e., the reduction of electric energy demand for the heat pump by management of the source and sink temperatures. In order to investigate and optimize the heating system, a dynamic system simulation model was developed. On this basis, a fundamental control strategy was derived for the overall co-ordination of the heating system with particular regard to the performance of the two storage tanks. In a simulation study, a fundamental investigation of the heating system configuration was carried out and an optimization was derived for the system control, as well as the selection of components and their dimensioning. The influence of different parameters on the system performance was identified, where the collector area and the latent heat storage volume were found to be the predominant parameters for system dimensioning. For a modern one-family house of 120 m(2) living area with a specific annual heat demand of 60 kWh/(m(2) a) for both heating and domestic hot water, a solar collector area of 30 m(2), and a latent heat store volume of 12.5 m(3) are proposed for the location of Wuerzburg (Germany). In this configuration, the heating system reaches a seasonal performance factor of 4.6, meaning that 78% of the building's and users' heat demand are delivered by solar energy. The results show that the solar/heat pump heating system can give an acceptable performance using up-to-date components in a state-of-the-art building.","[Trinkl, Christoph; Zoerner, Wilfried] Ingolstadt Univ Appl Sci, Ctr Excellence Solar Engn, D-85049 Ingolstadt, Germany; [Hanby, Vic] De Montfort Univ, Inst Energy & Sustainable Dev, Leicester LE1 9BH, Leics, England",De Montfort University,"Trinkl, C (corresponding author), Ingolstadt Univ Appl Sci, Ctr Excellence Solar Engn, Esplanade 10, D-85049 Ingolstadt, Germany.",trinkl@fh-ingolstadt.de; vhanby@dmu.ac.uk,,,,,,,17,12,12,0,22,ASME-AMER SOC MECHANICAL ENG,NEW YORK,"THREE PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10016-5990 USA",0199-6231,,,J SOL ENERG-T ASME,J.

The EV charging station is primarily powered from the grid which can be replaced by a solar photovoltaic system. Wide uptake of EVs is possible by improving the technologies, and also with support from the government.

This imposes stringent constraints on the nature of the data used for training (typically, residual time tendencies are needed), and it complicates learning about the interactions between machine-learned parameterizations and other components of an Earth system model. Approaching learning about process-based parameterizations as an inverse problem resolves many of these issues, since it allows parameterizations to be trained with partial observations or statistics that directly relate to quantities of interest in long-term climate projections. Here, we demonstrate the effectiveness of Kalman inversion methods in treating learning about parameterizations as an inverse problem. We consider two different algorithms: unscented and ensemble Kalman inversion. Both methods involve highly parallelizable forward model evaluations, converge exponentially fast, and do not require gradient computations. In addition, unscented Kalman inversion provides a measure of parameter uncertainty. We illustrate how training parameterizations can be posed as a regularized inverse problem and solved by ensemble Kalman methods through the calibration of an eddy-diffusivity mass-flux scheme for subgrid-scale turbulence and convection, using data generated by large-eddy simulations. We find the algorithms amenable to batching strategies, robust to noise and model failures, and efficient in the calibration of hybrid parameterizations that can include empirical closures and neural networks. Plain Language Summary Artificial intelligence represents an exciting opportunity in Earth system modeling, but its application brings its own set of challenges. One of the challenges is to train machine learning systems within Earth system models from partial or indirect data. Here, we present algorithms, known as ensemble Kalman methods, which can be used to train such systems. We demonstrate their use in situations where the data used for training are noisy, only indirectly informative about the model to be trained, and may only become available sequentially. As an example, we present training results for a state-of-the-art model for turbulence, convection, and clouds for use within Earth system models. This model is shown to learn efficiently from data in a variety of configurations, including situations where the model contains neural networks.","[Lopez-Gomez, Ignacio; Christopoulos, Costa; Ervik, Haakon Ludvig Langeland; Dunbar, Oliver R.

To fill in the temporal gap between these missions, other satellites' kinematic orbits derived from GPS-based high-low satellite-to-satellite tracking data may be considered. However, it is well known that kinematic orbits are highly sensitive to various systematic errors. These errors are responsible for a non-stationary noise in the kinematic orbits, which is difficult to handle. As a result, the quality of the obtained gravity field solutions is reduced. In this research, we propose to apply an epoch-difference (ED) scheme in the context of the classical dynamic approach to gravity field recovery. Compared to the traditional undifferenced (UD) scheme, the ED scheme is able to mitigate constant or slowly varying systematic errors. To demonstrate the added value of the ED scheme, three sets of monthly gravity field solutions produced from 6 years of GRACE kinematic orbits are compared: two sets produced in-house (with the ED and UD scheme), and a set produced with the undifferenced scheme in the frame of the short-arc approach (Zehentner and Mayer-Gurr in J Geodesy 90(3):275-286, 2015. https://doi.org/10.1007/s00190-015-0872-7). As a reference, we use state-of-the-art ITSG-Grace2018 monthly gravity field solutions. A comparison in the spectral domain shows that the gravity field solutions suffer from a lower noise level when the ED scheme is applied, particularly at low-degree terms, with cumulative errors up to degree 20 being reduced by at least 20%. In the spatial domain, the ED scheme notably reduces noise levels in the mass anomalies recovered. In addition, the signals in terms of mean mass anomalies in selected regions become closer to those inferred from ITSG-Grace2018 solutions, while showing no evidence of any damping, when the ED scheme is used. We conclude that the proposed ED scheme is preferable for time-varying gravity field modeling, as compared to the traditional UD scheme. Our findings may facilitate, among others, bridging the gap between GRACE and GFO satellite mission.","[Guo, Xiang; Zhao, Qile] Wuhan Univ, GNSS Res Ctr, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Ditmar, Pavel] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Civil Engn & Geosci, Delft, Netherlands; [Xiao, Yun] Xian Res Inst Surveying & Mapping, Xian, Peoples R China",Wuhan University; Delft University of Technology,"Zhao, QL (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ, GNSS Res Ctr, Wuhan, Peoples R China.",xiangguo@whu.edu.cn; P.G.Ditmar@tudelft.nl; zhaoql@whu.edu.cn; powaterssg@qq.com,,"Ditmar, Pavel/0000-0002-8188-7680","National '863 Program' of China [2014AA121501]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41574030, 41374083, 41904009]",National '863 Program' of China(National High Technology Research and Development Program of China); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"The work was sponsored by the National '863 Program' of China (Grant No. 2014AA121501) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41574030, 41374083, 41904009).

We document strong evidence that, since the early 1980s, consumption has been increasingly funded by smaller savings, booming financial profits, wealth extracted from house price appreciation and explosive debt. This is in stark contrast with the productivity-fueled growth that was seen in the 1950s and 1960s. We describe the transition, in gestation in the 1970s, towards the regime of the  illusion of the perpetual money machine, which started at full speed in the early 1980s and developed until 2008. This regime was further supported by a climate of deregulation and a massive growth in financial derivatives designed to spread and diversify the risks globally. The result has been a succession of bubbles and crashes, including the worldwide stock market bubble and great crash of October 1987, the savings and loans crisis of the 1980s, the burst in 1991 of the enormous Japanese real estate and stock market bubbles, the emerging markets bubbles and crashes in 1994 and 1997, the Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM) crisis of 1998, the dotcom bubble bursting in 2000, the recent house price bubbles, the financialization bubble via special investment vehicles, the stock market bubble, the commodity and oil bubbles and the current debt bubble, all developing jointly and feeding on each other until 2008. This situation may be further aggravated in the next decade by an increase in financialization, through exchange-traded-funds (ETFs), speed and automation, through algorithmic trading and public debt, and through growing unfunded liabilities. We conclude that, to get out of this catch 22 situation, we should better manage and understand the incentive structures in our society, we need to focus our efforts on our real economy and we have to respect and master the art of planning and prediction. Only gradual change, with a clear long term planning, can steer our financial and economic system from the turbulence associated with the perpetual money machine to calmer and more sustainable waters.","[Sornette, Didier; Cauwels, Peter] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Management Technol & Econ, Scheuchzerstr 7, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Sornette, Didier] Swiss Finance Inst, CH-41211 Geneva, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; University of Geneva,"Sornette, D (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Management Technol & Econ, Scheuchzerstr 7, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",dsornette@ethz.ch; pcauwels@ethz.ch,,,,,,,27,34,34,0,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2227-9091,,RISKS,Risks,JUN,2014,2,,,,103,131,,10.3390/risks2020103,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/risks2020103,,,29,"Business, Finance",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Business & Economics,V3W3H,,"Green Published, gold, Green Submitted",,,12/21/22,WOS:000218646000002,View Full Record in Web of Science

The mission is jointly conducted by the United States and France. A state-of-the-art radar altimetry system is used to measure the precise height of sea level, from which information on the ocean circulation is obtained. The satellite, launched on August 10, 1992, has been making observations of the global oceans with unprecedented accuracy since late September 1999. To meet the stringent measurement accuracy required for ocean circulation studies, a number of innovative improvements have been made to the mission design, including the first dual-frequency space-borne radar altimeter capable of retrieving the ionospheric delay of the radar signal, a three-frequency microwave radiometer for retrieving the signal delay caused by the water vapor in the troposphere, an optimal model of the Earth's gravity field and multiple satellite tracking systems for precision orbit determination. Additionally, the satellite also carries two experimental instruments to demonstrate new technologies: a single-frequency solid-state altimeter for the technology of low-power, low-weight altimeter and a Global Positioning System receiver for continuous, precise satellite tracking. The performance of the mission's measurement system has been tested by numerous verification studies. The results indicate that the root-sum-square accuracy of a single-pass sea level measurement is 4.7 cm for the TOPEX system and 5.1 cm for the POSEIDON system; both are more than a factor of 2 better than the requirement of 13.7 cm. This global data set is being analyzed by an international team of 200 scientists for improved understanding of the global ocean circulation as well as the ocean tides, geodesy, and geodynamics, and ocean wind and waves. The mission is designed to last for at least 3 years with a possible extension to 6 years. The multiyear global data set will go a long way toward understanding the ocean circulation and its variability in relation to climate change.

This paper is structured based on a vehicle detection processes starting from sensor selection to vehicle detection and tracking. Techniques in each process/step are reviewed and analyzed individually. Two main contributions in this paper are the following: survey on motorcycle detection techniques and the sensor comparison in terms of cost and range parameters. Finally, the survey provides an optimal choice with a low cost and reliable CAS design in vehicle industries.","[Mukhtar, Amir; Tang, Tong Boon] Univ Teknol Petronas, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Tronoh 31750, Malaysia; [Xia, Likun] Beijing Inst Technol, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China",Universiti Teknologi Petronas; Beijing Institute of Technology,"Tang, TB (corresponding author), Univ Teknol Petronas, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Tronoh 31750, Malaysia.",tongboon.tang@petronas.com.my,,"Tang, Tong Boon/0000-0002-5721-6828","Ministry of Science, Technology, and Innovation, Malaysia under eScience Fund [03-02-02-SF0151]; Ministry of Education, Malaysia under the HiCOE Grant","Ministry of Science, Technology, and Innovation, Malaysia under eScience Fund(Ministry of Energy, Science, Technology, Environment and Climate Change (MESTECC), Malaysia); Ministry of Education, Malaysia under the HiCOE Grant","This work was supported in part by the Ministry of Science, Technology, and Innovation, Malaysia under eScience Fund Grant 03-02-02-SF0151 and the Ministry of Education, Malaysia under the HiCOE Grant.

The model component is the NEMO platform driven at the surface by atmospheric conditions from the ECMWF ERA-Interim reanalysis. Ocean observations are assimilated by means of a reduced-order Kalman filter. Along track altimeter sea level anomaly, satellite sea surface temperature and sea ice concentration, as well as in situ temperature and salinity vertical profiles are jointly assimilated. A 3D-VAR scheme provides an additional correction for the slowly-evolving large-scale biases in temperature and salinity. The performance of the reanalysis shows a clear dependency on the time-dependent in situ observation system. The general assessment of GLORYS12 highlights a level of performance at the state-of-the-art and the capacity of the system to capture the main expected climatic interannual variability signals for ocean and sea ice, the general circulation and the inter-basins exchanges. In terms of trends, GLORYS12 shows a higher than observed warming trend together with a slightly lower than observed global mean sea level rise. Comparisons made with an experiment carried out on the same platform without assimilation show the benefit of data assimilation in controlling water mass properties and sea ice cover and their low frequency variability. Moreover, GLORYS12 represents particularly well the small-scale variability of surface dynamics and compares well with independent (non-assimilated) data. Comparisons made with a twin experiment carried out at 1/4 degrees resolution allows characterizing and quantifying the strengthened contribution of the 1/12 degrees resolution onto the downscaled dynamics. GLORYS12 provides a reliable physical ocean state for climate variability and supports applications such as seasonal forecasts. In addition, this reanalysis has strong assets to serve regional applications and provide relevant physical conditions for applications such as marine biogeochemistry. In the near future, GLORYS12 will be maintained to be as close as possible to real time and could therefore provide relevant and continuous reference past ocean states for many operational applications.","[Jean-Michel, Lellouche; Romain, Bourdalle-Badie; Gilles, Garric; Angelique, Melet; Marie, Drevillon; Clement, Bricaud; Mathieu, Hamon; Olivier, Le Galloudec; Charly, Regnier; Tony, Candela; Charles-Emmanuel, Testut; Florent, Gasparin; Giovanni, Ruggiero; Mounir, Benkiran; Yann, Drillet; Pierre-Yves, Le Traon] Mercator Ocean Int, Ramonville St Agne, France; [Eric, Greiner] Collecte Localisat Satellites, Ramonville St Agne, France; [Pierre-Yves, Le Traon] IFREMER, Plouzane, France",Ifremer,"Jean-Michel, L (corresponding author), Mercator Ocean Int, Ramonville St Agne, France.",jlellouche@mercator-ocean.fr,"Le Traon, Pierre Yves/G-9342-2016; Garric, Gilles/O-9065-2016","Le Traon, Pierre Yves/0000-0002-5484-3439; Garric, Gilles/0000-0002-5385-710X; drevillon, marie/0000-0003-4586-8957",,,,,115,27,27,4,4,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-6463,,FRONT EARTH SC-SWITZ,Front.

Arguably social value of protected areas can be viewed as primarily recreational and aesthetic. Perhaps as a result, social value is often much less considered when compared to environmental and economic aspects when planning the establishment and management of protected areas in coastal locations. Understanding how society values these areas could therefore make a significant difference to optimising management direction and outcomes. Furthermore, understanding non-monetary values could help evaluate trade-offs which can be made between scenarios such as alternative development, management and conservation. Literature on social value touches on many topics including the emotional appreciation of wilderness and theory of visitor management. Ironically, in the future, climate change may raise social value at the coast given a public fascination with dramatic storms and sensational rapid change as a result of coastal processes. In order to identify social value, evaluate how it has been applied, and suggest better future integration, research focussing on selected coastal protected areas in England and Wales has taken an inductive grounded theory approach. A combination of practitioner and public interviews were undertaken to inform the design of a normative statement and model of social value. To understand social values at an operational level a detailed 'zoning chart' exercise in conjunction with an expert scoring system was applied to four case studies This work has resulted in validating social value criteria and has highlighted the complexities of measuring social value, particularly using a scoring system to rate the criteria. Tranquillity, for example, is typically subjective. Zoning charts proved to be a productive data collection tool, allowing visualisation of the criteria. All the data collection phases demonstrated that criteria in the 'spirituality and natural environment' theme provided the most social value to the public. Criteria in this theme include areas where it is possible to get away from other people in order to experience tranquillity, isolation and remoteness: experiences of views and open coastline: inspirational opportunities for art, poetry and photography: and an outdoor experience in a place where people want to be.","[Pike, Kate; Wright, Paul] Southampton Solent Univ, Sch Engn Construct & Maritime, Fac Technol, Southampton SO14 0YN, Hants, England; [Johnson, David; Wright, Paul] OSPAR Commiss, London WC2A 2JQ, England; [Fletcher, Steve] Bournemouth Univ, Sch Conservat Sci, Poole BH12 5BB, Dorset, England",Solent University; Bournemouth University,"Pike, K (corresponding author), Southampton Solent Univ, Sch Engn Construct & Maritime, Fac Technol, RM234,E Pk Terrace, Southampton SO14 0YN, Hants, England.",kate.pike@solent.ac.uk; secretariat@ospar.org; sfletcher@bournemouth.ac.uk; paul.wright@solent.ac.uk,,"Fletcher, Stephen/0000-0003-1180-9844",,,,,32,10,10,0,31,COASTAL EDUCATION & RESEARCH FOUNDATION,COCONUT CREEK,"5130 NW 54TH STREET, COCONUT CREEK, FL 33073 USA",0749-0208,1551-5036,,J COASTAL RES,J.

Whereas the use phase plays an important role for the assessment of services in general, the evaluation of the use phase has been underrepresented in previous social life cycle assessment studies. For that reason, particular attention has been paid to indicators, which allow the assessment of social impacts during the use phase of mobility services. Methods Continuous efforts to mitigate climate change and to improve quality of life in cities result in new mobility solutions based on collective use. This will have a huge impact on our society transforming the use of vehicles. In order to better understand the implications for cities, society and the automotive industry, it is essential to evaluate the social impact generated along a product life cycle with particular attention to the use phase. To reach the goal, a systematic literature review was carried out with a focus on social indicators that allow assessing use phase impacts of mobility services. The indicators were analysed and allocated to stakeholder groups. Based on the analysis, a core set of indicators is proposed under consideration of data availability. Results and discussion Based on the selected search strings, 51 publications were selected for the literature review, including 579 social indicators. The analysis revealed a wide variety and diversity of indicators that are trying to measure the same aspect. The allocation to the respective stakeholder groups showed that most of the indicators (36%) evaluate impacts regarding the stakeholder group local community. The majority of analysed indicators are of quantitative nature (63%). Nevertheless, a clear assessment method was often missing in the respective publications. Therefore, for the core set of indicators, an assessment method is proposed for every indicator. Conclusions The results from this study can help practitioners as well as researchers in the field of urban mobility assessment as it systematically analyses social sustainability aspects. The presented data gives an overview of various indicators that are suggested in other publications, and the proposed core set of indicators can be used to evaluate different mobility services in further research.","[Gompf, Katharina; Hetterich, Joerg] BMW Grp, Knorrstr 147, D-80788 Munich, Germany; [Gompf, Katharina; Traverso, Marzia] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Inst Sustainabil Civil Engn, Aachen, Germany",BMW AG; RWTH Aachen University,"Gompf, K (corresponding author), BMW Grp, Knorrstr 147, D-80788 Munich, Germany.;Gompf, K (corresponding author), Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Inst Sustainabil Civil Engn, Aachen, Germany.",Katharina.Gompf@bmw.de,"Traverso, Marzia/AAT-9006-2020","Traverso, Marzia/0000-0001-8848-6292",Projekt DEAL,Projekt DEAL,Open Access funding provided by Projekt DEAL.,,91,14,14,6,27,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0948-3349,1614-7502,,INT J LIFE CYCLE ASS,Int.

As a result of this activity, the State is faced with significant challenges of systemwide resource adequacy, power quality and grid reliability that could be addressed in part with demand responsive (DR) load modifying strategies using controllable building technologies. Dynamic facades have the ability to potentially shift and shed loads at critical times of the day in combination with daylighting and HVAC controls. This study explores the technical potential of dynamic facades to support net load shape objectives. A model predictive controller (MPC) was designed based on reduced order thermal (Modelica) and window (Radiance) models. Using an automated workflow (involving JModelica.org and MPCPy), these models were converted and differentiated to formulate a non-linear optimization problem. A gradient-based, non-linear programming problem solver (IPOPT) was used to derive an optimal control strategy, then a post-optimization step was used to convert the solution to a discrete state for facade actuation. Continuous state modulation of the facade was also modeled. The performance of the MPC controller with and without activation of thermal mass was evaluated in a south-facing perimeter office zone with a three-zone electrochromic window for a clear sunny week during summer and winter periods in Oakland and Burbank, California. MPC strategies reduced total energy cost by 9-28% and critical coincident peak demand was reduced by up to 0.58 W/ft(2)-floor or 19-43% in the 4.6 m (15 ft) deep south zone on sunny summer days in Oakland compared to state-of-the-art heuristic control. Similar savings were achieved for the hotter, Burbank climate in Southern California. This outcome supports the argument that MPC control of dynamic facades can provide significant electricity cost reductions and net load management capabilities of benefit to both the building owner and evolving electrical grid.

The culmination of the warming trend of the Last Glacial Interstadial in the Allerod seems to have been of particular importance in the transition from the classic Upper Magdalenian (with its rupestral and portable art and complex stone and bone technologies) to the Azilian, despite continuity in the main game species and in the process of subsistence intensification. The Younger Dryas, on the other hand, seems to have had little immediate direct repercussion in this region, as the Azilian continued, straddling the Pleistocene-Holocene boundary. On the other hand, the climatically non-dramatic Preboreal-Boreal boundary seems to have seen the abrupt, marked break between the Epimagdalenian Azilian and the Asturian coastal shell midden Mesolithic in the western sector of the region. This contrasted with greater technological continuity (albeit with similarities to the Sauveterrian tradition in adjacent SW France) in the Mesolithic of the Basque Country, with no archeological indications that the 8.2 cal kya event had important consequences in this region. Then, some 15 centuries later, came the sudden, but centuriesdelayed appearance of Neolithic domesticates and ceramics on the Atlantic side of the Cantabrian Cordillera originating from sources in the Mediterranean environments of the upper Ebro basin and/or southern France. This major lifeway change was possibly finally accepted, within a still mixed economy, in the face of the overexploitation of wild food resources. The neolithization of Vasco-Cantabria was finally underway by c. 6.6 cal kya, quickly leading to new human-land relationships characterized by mainly ovicaprine pastoralism, apparently limited cereal agriculture, continued foraging, recolonization of the montane interior and the construction of modest megalithic monuments.

Through the research and analysis of rainwater management cases in domestic and foreign courtyards, we can learn that these courtyards take the improvement of rainwater storage capacity as main purpose, meanwhile integrate the external overall water system into design to build up a sustainable water storage and row system, as well a system emulating water circulation in nature. In terms of some specific methods, domestic traditional courtyards pay more attention to the collection and utilization of rainwater. as long as we no longer consider the rainwater as waste can be discharged directly and manage it as valuable resource, we can keep it using our endless imagination. There are three main points to improve sponginess design in the courtyard space: detention and storage to absorb rainwater locally, input and output to regulate runoff and technology combining art to be multifunctional. The development of sponge city in China is growing vigorously, despite some controversial points currently existing in the concept of sponge city, it is necessary to establish the social notion illustrated by this theory: strengthening urban rainwater management to make the city more flexible and adaptive in coping with the changing environment and disasters[1]. In our urban space, buildings, roads, squares, etc. which accounts for roughly 60% land surface of a city, are normally constructed with impermeable materials. Therefore, the management and design on these impermeable lands are the key factors to enable the city to operate as a sponge to coordinate the rainwater, which aims to reduce the peak value of overland runoff and stagger the peak periods. There are lots of impermeable public courtyards in urban spaces defined by settlements, business buildings, offices buildings and educational buildings, the flexibility design on those impermeable public courtyards proposes to improve their capacity of managing rainwater, make those courtyard spaces function as sponges to deal with the roof and overland runoffs, indeed, reduce the pressure of urban drainage systems meanwhile, reuse rainwater as resource and optimize the urban micro-climate.","[Ma, Jianwu; Yang, Yan] Soochow Univ, Coll Architecture, Suzhou, Peoples R China",Soochow University - China,"Ma, JW (corresponding author), Soochow Univ, Coll Architecture, Suzhou, Peoples R China.",478646560@qq.com; 1143001915@qq.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [51168043],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51168043), Photographs are provided by Dr. Stuart Echols, a professor of life at Penn State University Landscape School (PA, 16801).",,5,0,0,1,4,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5401,,978-94-6252-453-8,AER ADV ENG RES,,,2017,,,,,1529,1533,,,,,,5,"Energy & Fuels; Engineering, Chemical; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Energy & Fuels; Engineering; Materials Science,BJ6LN,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000426813400278,View Full Record in Web of Science

The stenohaline fish fauna of the British Isles is generally thought to have colonised eastern England via a landbridge following the last glacial maximum. This theory is investigated using the nationally extinct burbot, Lota lota, as a model species. Samples were collected from 15 museum specimens of known English provenance and analysed for differences in the mitochondrial DNA control region. The DNA analysis produced eight sequences of 270 base pairs, with one sample reaching 420 base pairs in length. Genetic analysis suggests the extinct English population of the burbot was a distinct lineage, differing from those previously described from across the species' global distribution. Despite this, network analysis suggests that the English lineage is closely related to populations in western Europe, supporting colonisation via a postglacial landbridge. The rate of genetic divergence suggests that the timing of L. lota's colonisation of English rivers was prior to the last glacial maximum. Lota lota appears to have survived the last glacial maximum in refugia within the British Isles. This study adds to the evidence for a British freshwater refugia and furthers our understanding of the colonisation history of British freshwater fishes. These results also provide valuable information for conservation strategies for L. lota indicating the western European clade as most genetically appropriate for potential future reintroductions to English rivers.","[Worthington, Thomas A.; Kemp, Paul S.] Univ Southampton, Int Ctr Ecohydraul Res Engn & Environm, Southampton, Hants, England; [Van Houdt, Jeroen K.

Thanks to those interactions, urban forests provide many ecosystem services to people and to the whole urban environment. One of the most important is the absorption of chemically and radiatively-active trace gases and thus the effect on local air quality. Beyond the main greenhouse gases (CO2, H2O and CH4), in urban areas a relevant role is played by the photochemical pollution mainly constituted by O-3 and particulate matters. Despite their importance, experimental sites monitoring trace gases fluxes in urban forest ecosystems and parks are still scarce. In this paper, we present for the first time the experimental station of Real Bosco di Capodimonte, located within the city of Naples. The vegetation is mainly composed by Quercus ilex with some patches of Pinus pinea and meadows. The site is equipped with state of the art instruments to measure concentrations and exchanges of CO2, H2O, CH4, O-3, PM, VOCs and NOx by the eddy covariance technique. It represents an interesting and rare opportunity to investigate the interactions between urban vegetation, anthropogenic pollutants and secondary photochemical compounds. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

These policies could generate serious preservations problems for architecturally sensitive areas, such as historical towns, historic buildings, and protected landscapes. Inside them, photovoltaic technologies have several benefits for the built environment related to aesthetic appeal, reliability, modularity, scalability, versatility, low maintenance costs, and peak shaving. The major challenge for their application is the presumed negative impact on heritage value. Thus, the diffusion of these systems in the territory is hindered by a social diffidence on their acceptability due to legislative, cultural, technical, and economic barriers. To support the definition of appropriate policies, and realistic targets, the study presents a complete discussion on policy -related design criteria for integrating photovoltaic systems on cultural heritage. This socio-technical analysis can increase a cleaner and integrated energy production, favoring the energy transition and the mitigation of climate changes, respecting heritage and natural values, and considering current energy needs, and innovative developments of photovoltaic systems. The comparison of relevant research projects, scientific studies, awards, and guidelines describes the state of the art of this topic, also identifying 42 international guidelines on energy efficiency, renewable sources, and solar integration on cultural heritage. International recommendations are categorized to find recurring, and applied design criteria for architectural heritage sites, protected landscapes, historic and traditional buildings, and building extensions. Then, updated criteria, pros, and cons for a possible integration are defined through specific focus groups with the Heritage Authorities. These activities are based on international criteria of architectural conservation. The synopsis of these results shows non-negotiable criteria for heritage-compatible solar applications. Finally, the study presents some policy-relevant implications connected with these design criteria, to define realistic energy targets and scenarios, to prepare strategic policy options (e. g., guidelines, rules, policies, and financial incentives) based on updated criteria, correct targets, and recent innovations, to implement existing energy policies in a correct way, to correctly assess restoration design pro-jects, and to evaluate socio-economic trends of innovative photovoltaics' markets.","[Lucchi, Elena] EURAC Res, Inst Renewable Energy, Bolzano, Italy",European Academy of Bozen-Bolzano,"Lucchi, E (corresponding author), EURAC Res, Inst Renewable Energy, Bolzano, Italy.",elena.lucchi@eurac.edu,,,"European Union; European Regional Development Fund; Italian Government; Swiss Confederation and Cantons, as part of the Interreg V-A Italy-Switzerland Cooperation Program [603882]","European Union(European Commission); European Regional Development Fund(European Commission); Italian Government; Swiss Confederation and Cantons, as part of the Interreg V-A Italy-Switzerland Cooperation Program","The research was co-financed by the European Union, the European Regional Development Fund, the Italian Government, the Swiss Confederation and Cantons, as part of the Interreg V-A Italy-Switzerland Cooperation Program, within the context of the Project BIPV meets history.

At the same time, spread of emerging and re-emerging diseases, development of sophisticated antibiotic resistance mechanisms, grown threat of bioterrorism, and loss of disease control due to ecological damage and globalization dictate the urgent development of a national biosecurity program capable to address these risks and threats. Although Russian Federation is technologically and methodologically adept in the field of epidemiological and medical control of biological select agents, the expertise in latest technologies of treatment, prevention, and detection of potential biohazards is lagging. There is an urgent need for updating of state biosecurity programs, especially in the field of new vaccines and biologicals development for control and prevention of hazardous infections. Key elements of these programs include: well-justified list of priority targets and technologies; list of highest risk infectious agents to be addressed in development of countermeasures; identification of most efficient countermeasures for each agent of concern; selection of the most appropriate partnership model for scientific collaboration and formation of multidisciplinary teams, as well as for cooperation between science and biotech industry. The latter is particularly important for prompt conversion of scientific findings into solid technologies and prospective drug and vaccine candidates. By combining state funding and infrastructure with growing competence of Russian biotech and pharma industry, the likelihood of successful implementation of biosecurity programs will increase significantly. Strong aspects of Russian microbiological programs, such as development of anti-infective vaccines and bacteriophages, should be exploited in full. Despite current political turbulence, it is necessary to note that combined effort of various countries is required to protect the world population from risks of the globalization-fueled infectious diseases and bioterrorism threats emergence. Pathogens neglect borders and political issues, whereas poor coordination and collaboration at the international level can result in significant social and economic losses globally.

The problems and difficulties mentioned here do not reflect the common practice in Turkey and mostly list rare cases for information purposes. Countries located in Asia and Middle East have rich structural heritage, in number and significance, which are sometimes even a few millenniums old. On the other hand, often times financial or bureaucratic constraints make the conservation studies more difficult, while technical problems remain to be an issue. It is quite interesting that sometimes having available financial support for conservation studies turns out to be the main source of problem, since quick and not well thought interventions end up damaging hundreds of years old surviving structures, rather than conserving them. Other most common application problems include use of Portland cement in humid environments causing salt contamination (which is now widely being avoided), infilling and freezing cracks that used to work as seasonal water table movement based motion or thermal expansion joints that are cyclic in nature, covering the structure to protect but forming unintentional green house effect micro climates forming fungus, improper drainage to cause support settlements, removing earth fill or structural members to cause structural movements and cracks, strengthening parts of a flexible structure only to make it more rigid and cause to attract more earthquake forces, disable its energy dissipating mechanisms, applying improper chemicals, using incompatible material or irreversible techniques etc. are just a few to mention. The problem solution strategies in conservation studies should include internationally accepted conservation rules. Multi disciplinary teams are always recommended since combination of various expertise areas are mutually needed in conservation studies; architects, geotechnical and structural engineers, geology and material science specialists, archeologists, art historians are among the most important team members. Analytical modeling and simulations, on-field non destructive testing, instrumented monitoring (SHM), and small scale field treatment tests are recommended to be merged and used in conservation studies, because conventional methods or commercial repair/treatment materials available over-the-counter may not always suitable for a given specific case.

J,"Michaud, JD; Shuttleworth, WJ",,,,"Michaud, JD; Shuttleworth, WJ",,,Executive survey of the Tucson Aggregation Workshop,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,,,English,Editorial Material,,,,,,,,"'Aggregation' refers to spatial averaging of some heterogeneous surface variable to obtain an effective value representative of an area. The effect of surface heterogeneity an interactions between land and atmosphere is relevant to near-surface hydrology, ecology, and climate, and is the common theme of the papers in this issue. Even though the full effect of heterogeneity must be neglected owing to limited spatial resolution of large-scale models, it is important to understand when and how the presence of heterogeneity requires recognition in any aggregate representation. In March 1994, a workshop, which has come to be known as the 'Tucson Aggregation Workshop', was convened to assess the state of the art in aggregation research, and the papers in this issue are the product of that workshop. The principal findings of the workshop can be summarized as follows: 1. substantial progress has been made in producing aggregated representations of flat terrain. Simple aggregation rules applied to surface properties have given rise, in some studies, to simulated surface energy fluxes that are within 10% of fluxes produced from models with full representation of heterogeneity. 2. Aggregation rules are relatively straightforward in the ease of patch-scale heterogeneity (variability on the order of hundreds to thousands of meters) of vegetative characteristics which control surface exchanges, although aggregation of soil hydraulic properties and possibly of soil moisture remains problematic. In addition, some of the effects of meso-scale heterogeneity (variability on the order of 10-100 km) in surface cover will need to be addressed through more complicated types of parameterization. 3. There is convincing evidence that the regional energy balance (over, say, 10(5) km(2)) is insensitive to gentle topography, provided that surface vegetation and water availability are uniform, but in mountainous terrain the influence of topography on near-surface meteorology must be considered. 4. It appears that the value of simple combinations of remotely sensed radiances representing areal-average measurements are influenced only slightly by unresolved variability, although the averaging of some derived variables based on these radiances offers a greater challenge, especially with sparse canopies.","UNIV ARIZONA,DEPT HYDROL & WATER RESOURCES,TUCSON,AZ 85721",University of Arizona,,,,,,,,,11,14,14,0,3,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-1694,,,J HYDROL,J.

Aerosol optical thickness (AOT) and effective radius (Reff) are two main parameters describing the optical and microphysical properties of airborne dust aerosol. Satellite remote sensing provides an opportunity for estimating the two parameters in spatial coverage and continuously. To take the merits of machine learning algorithms and also utilize the physical knowledge discovered in the conventional retrieval algorithms, a physical-based machine learning method was proposed and applied on the Himawari-8 geostationary satellite for robust retrieval of dust aerosol properties. The main concepts of this study comprise i) constructing the model input data by extracting highly informative features from the Himawari observations according to physical knowledge and ii) exploiting the utility of six state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms in dust aerosol retrieval. The algorithms include artificial neural network (ANN), extreme boost gradient tree (XGBoost), extra tree (ET), random forest (RF), support vector regression (SVR), and kernel Ridge regression (Ridge). The groundtruth AOT and Reff data from AERONET stations were supplied as output labels. The cross-validation technique was adopted for model training and the results show that the ANN model is superior to the other machine learning models for both AOT and Reff estimation, which exhibits the lowest mean absolute error (MAE = 0.0292 and 0.0981) and the highest correlation coefficient (r = 0.98 and 0.84). When validated on an independent dataset, the ANN model achieved the lowest MAE (0.0334 and 0.1487), and the highest r (0.94 and 0.63). More importantly, when compared against representative physical-based algorithms, the developed ANN model still retains the best performance.

These low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (LT-SOFCs) have seen considerable research and development and are widely viewed as the next generation technology, following the 650-850 degrees C SOFCs that are currently undergoing commercialization. LT-SOFCs have potential advantages for conventional SOFC applications such as stationary power generation, and may be viable for new portable and transportation power applications, along with electrolytic fuel production and energy storage. The characteristics of electrolyte and electrode materials are reviewed, with a focus on materials that have demonstrated good properties and cell performance at low temperature. Only oxygen-ion-conducting electrolytes are considered here. Anode materials are discussed, primarily the various Ni-cermet anode compositions that yield good low-temperature performance. Mixed ionically and electronically conducting cathode materials are described in detail, reflecting the extensive research activity that has aimed at providing useful oxygen reduction kinetics at low operating temperature. Cell design, materials compatibility, processing methods, and resulting microstructures are discussed, along with their role in determining cell performance.

This is seen within advanced applications for e.g. aeronautics, modern ship vessels and railway vehicles. FRPs are often used to save weight, but the downside is that they are ignitable, which implies a potential higher fire risk. It is thus important to thoroughly characterise the material properties of FRPs, including the fire performance, in order to ensure a high safety level. Fire performance testing is made with newly produced materials to show the conformance to required standard test. However, the impact of ageing on the fire performance of materials and products is not mandatory information and hardly ever known. This is still an overlooked matter that is important to address for combustible materials in transport applications, where the requirements of personal safety are especially high. Accelerated ageing is a method to expose materials and products to various environmental parameters for a simulation of long-term usage. Within a few days, weeks or months the damage and degradation of the materials can occur, which normally would be after years in normal climate and after normal usage. Fire performance testing of test samples subjected to accelerated ageing would potentially give important information on the long-term safety of the end-use application of FRPs. The objective of this paper is twofold. One is to find out if the industry, society and research need to deal with the effect of ageing on materials in relation to fire safety as this is not dealt with in fire regulations. And further to identify the state-of-the-art of accelerated ageing methods relevant for Fibre Reinforced Polymer (FRP) materials. In summary, the findings in the literature were limited of reported ageing effects of FRPs, with respect to the fire behaviour. An important conclusion is that there is a major lack of knowledge regarding material aging and fire behaviour, especially for FRPs. However, the identified ageing studies showed that both fire and mechanical properties were affected by ageing. The accelerated ageing methods described in literature was not consequently applied. The ageing methods were special designed for each study and application of material. All methods need a proper validation applying real time ageing.","[Sandinge, Anna; Blomqvist, Per; Dederichs, Anne] RISE Res Inst Sweden, Safety & Transport, Fire Res, Brinellgatan 4, S-50462 Boras, Sweden; [Sandinge, Anna; Dederichs, Anne; Markert, Frank] Tech Univ Denmark, DTU Civil Engn, Brovej 118, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark",RISE Research Institutes of Sweden; Technical University of Denmark,"Sandinge, A (corresponding author), RISE Res Inst Sweden, Safety & Transport, Fire Res, Brinellgatan 4, S-50462 Boras, Sweden.;Sandinge, A (corresponding author), Tech Univ Denmark, DTU Civil Engn, Brovej 118, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark.",anna.sandinge@ri.se,"Markert, Frank/K-7126-2016","Markert, Frank/0000-0002-1396-2810; Dederichs, Anne Simone/0000-0002-6120-2461",European Union [723246],European Union(European Commission),The research is a part of the RAMSSES project which has received funding under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the grant agreement No 723246.,,41,2,2,1,18,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0925-7535,1879-1042,,SAFETY SCI,Saf.

Previous studies have indicated that the incorporation of legumes into cereal rotations could reduce overall environmental burdens from cropping systems. However, most life cycle assessment (LCA) studies focus on individual crops and miss environmental consequences of inter-annual crop sequence and nutrient cycling effects. This review investigates state-of-the-art representation of inter-crop rotation effects within legume LCA studies. Methods A literature review was undertaken, starting with a search for all peer-reviewed articles with combinations of 'LCA', 'legumes' and 'rotations' or synonyms thereof. In total, 3180 articles were obtained. Articles were screened for compliance with all of the following requirements: (i) reporting results based on LCA or life cycle inventory methodology; (ii) inclusion of (a) legume(s); (iii) the legume(s) is/are analysed within the context of a wider cropping system (i.e. rotation or intercropping). Seventy articles satisfying these requirements were analysed. Results and discussion We identified three broad approaches to legume LCA. Most studies involved simple attributional LCA disregarding important interactions across years and crops in rotations. N-fertilizer reduction through legume residue N carryover is either disregarded or the benefit is attributed to the following crop in such studies, whilst N leaching burdens from residues are usually attributed to the legume crop. Some studies applied robust allocation approaches and/or complex functional units to enable analysis of entire rotation sequences, accounting for nutrient cycling and break crop effects. Finally, a few studies applied consequential LCA to identify downstream substitution effects, though these studies did not simultaneously account for agronomic effects of rotational sequence changes. Conclusions We recommend that LCA studies for legume cropping systems should (i) evaluate entire rotations; (ii) represent nitrogen and ideally carbon cycling; (iii) for attributional studies, define at least two functional units, where one should encompass the multifunctional outputs of an entire rotation and the other should enable product footprints to be calculated; (iv) for CLCA studies, account for both agronomic changes in rotations and markets effects; (v) include impact categories that reflect hotspots for agricultural production.","[Costa, Marcela Porto; Chadwick, David; Styles, David] Bangor Univ, Sch Nat Sci, Bangor LL57 2UW, Gwynedd, Wales; [Chadwick, David] Southwest Univ, Interdisciplinary Res Ctr Agr Green Dev Yangtze R, Chongqing, Peoples R China; [Saget, Sophie; Williams, Michael] Trinity Coll Dublin, Sch Nat Sci, Dublin Dept Bot, Dublin, Ireland; [Rees, Robert M.] Scotlands Rural Coll, West Mains Rd, Edinburgh EH9 3JG, Midlothian, Scotland; [Styles, David] Natl Univ Ireland Galway, Plant & AgriBioSci Ctr, Ryan Inst, Galway, Ireland",Bangor University; Southwest University - China; Trinity College Dublin; Scotland's Rural College; Ollscoil na Gaillimhe-University of Galway,"Costa, MP (corresponding author), Bangor Univ, Sch Nat Sci, Bangor LL57 2UW, Gwynedd, Wales.",cmarcelaporto@gmail.com,"Rees, Robert Martin/L-8103-2013","Rees, Robert Martin/0000-0003-1348-8693; Porto Costa, Marcela/0000-0003-1309-5339; Styles, David/0000-0003-4185-4478",TRUE project - EU Framework Programme for Research and Innovation H2020 [727973]; Scottish Government's Strategic Research Development Programme,TRUE project - EU Framework Programme for Research and Innovation H2020; Scottish Government's Strategic Research Development Programme,"This research is supported by the TRUE project, funded by the EU Framework Programme for Research and Innovation H2020, Grant Agreement number 727973, and the Scottish Government's Strategic Research Development Programme.",,100,23,23,11,50,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0948-3349,1614-7502,,INT J LIFE CYCLE ASS,Int.

Leaching experiments of inorganic nitrogen (LINO3-, LINH4+) and phosphorus (LIPO4), using SE Mediterranean surface seawater, were performed on 41 aerosol (hereafter dust) samples collected on Whatman 41 filters between April 1996 and January 1999 at Tel Shikmona, Israel and on four desert-event dust powder samples. A geometric mean of 2.8 and 3.2 mmol NO3- and NH4+ per gram of dust was leached by seawater from normal (background) dry deposition captured by the filters. Significantly lower art Of IN with lower NH4+ : NO3- ratios were leached from both the filters and the dust powder sampled during dust events (mean of 0.18 and 0.02 mmol NO3- and NH4+ per grain of dust). Similarly, relatively lower values of LIPO4 were measured in desert type events, attributed to systematic decrease in IP solubility with increased rock/soil component. The calculated LINO3- and LINH4+ fluxes were 34 and 20 mmol m(-2) yr(-1) from normal dry deposition, 2.5 higher than the wet IN deposition, and twice the riverine input (23 mmol m(-2) yr(-1), Guerzoni et al.). This high ratio is due to the semiarid climate in this basin. The estimated flux of total dry IP was 1 mmol P m(-2) yr(-1), approximately 3 times higher than the input of wet IP and somewhat lower than the estimated riverine input (1.4 mmol m(-2) yr(-1), Guerzoni et al. 1999). The similarity of atmospheric and burial fluxes of P in the Levantine basin reinforces the hypothesis that the atmosphere is the dominant source of P to the sediments in the deeper parts of the basin. It was estimated that the leachable fluxes of IP and IN (dry + wet) can support between similar to15 or similar to70% (1-4 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) of the new production in the SE Mediterranean, effective mainly during dust events and stratification. This input may contribute significantly to the relatively high N : P ratios in Levantine deep water (similar to27).","Natl Inst Oceanog, Israel Oceanog & Limnol Res, IL-31080 Haifa, Israel",Israel Oceanographic & Limnological Research Institute,"Herut, B (corresponding author), Natl Inst Oceanog, Israel Oceanog & Limnol Res, POB 8030, IL-31080 Haifa, Israel.",barak@ocean.org.il,"Krom, Michael D/I-5076-2012","Krom, Michael D/0000-0003-3386-9215; Herut, Barak/0000-0002-7093-8753",,,,,37,129,137,0,27,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0024-3590,1939-5590,,LIMNOL OCEANOGR,Limnol.

A leading option is based on the pre-combustion decarbonisation of fossil fuels to produce hydrogen-rich fuel gases. Such decarbonisation processes integrate the production of a synthesis gas with combined cycle power generation: Synthesis gas (essentially a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide) is produced from a fossil fuel by partial oxidation and/or steam reforming. Carbon monoxide is converted by a water-shift reaction to CO2. The CO2 is then removed from the fuel gas stream using a regenerable solvent and sequestered. The fuel gas, consisting predominantly of hydrogen, is burnt in the gas turbine of a combined cycle. If synthesis gas is produced from natural gas using air as the oxidant, the decarbonised turbine fuel is approximately a 50:50 mixture of hydrogen and nitrogen (volume basis). The paper examines barriers to the availability of suitable turbines for the combustion of the hydrogen-rich fuels produced in decarbonisation processes. Studies carried out on a model of a Modem Reference Engine (MRE) are reported. The MRE model was developed to represent state-of-the-art technology for the gas turbines available from leading manufacturers. Potentially advantageous effects of a hydrogen-rich fuel on turbine performance are reported. The technical modifications needed to bum hydrogen-rich fuels are mainly confined to the combustor, fuel system and control system. Suppression of NOx emissions is a key issue. Hydrogen-rich gas cannot, at present, be burnt in existing pre-mix combustion systems. The implications of suppressing NOx emissions by adding steam to the hydrogen-rich gas are examined. The overall conclusion is that the future availability of gas turbines suitable for use in decarbonisation processes for CO2 abatement is not in jeopardy due to any major technology barriers. Hydrogen is potentially an attractive fuel. Development work is required, but the time-scale and costs involved are not prohibitive. These conclusions are supported by views expressed by manufacturers, users, and other informed parties.","CRE Casaccia, IEA Greenhouse Gas R&D Programme, Cheltenham GL52 4RZ, Glos, England",,"Audus, H (corresponding author), CRE Casaccia, IEA Greenhouse Gas R&D Programme, Cheltenham GL52 4RZ, Glos, England.",,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,1,C S I R O,EAST MELBOURNE,"PO BOX 89 (EAST ALBERT ST), EAST MELBOURNE, 3002, AUSTRALIA",,,0-643-06672-1,,,,2001,,,,,765,770,,,,,,6,"Engineering, Environmental; Environmental Sciences",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BX21Q,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000184645800126,View Full Record in Web of Science

Under severe drought stress, other acclimation mechanisms are trigged to further reduce transpiration to prevent irreversible conductance loss. Here, we investigate two of them: the reversible impacts on the photosynthetic apparatus, lumped as non-stomatal limitations (NSL) of photosynthesis, and the irreversible effect of premature leaf shedding. We integrate NSL and leaf shedding with a state-of-the-art tree hydraulic simulation model (SOX+) and parameterize them with example field measurements to demonstrate the stress-mitigating impact of these processes. We measured xylem vulnerability, transpiration, and leaf litter fall dynamics in Pinus sylvestris (L.) saplings grown for 54 days under severe dry-down. The observations showed that, once transpiration stopped, the rate of leaf shedding strongly increased until about 30% of leaf area was lost on average. We trained the SOX+ model with the observations and simulated changes in root-to-canopy conductance with and without including NSL and leaf shedding. Accounting for NSL improved model representation of transpiration, while model projections about root-to-canopy conductance loss were reduced by an overall 6%. Together, NSL and observed leaf shedding reduced projected losses in conductance by about 13%. In summary, the results highlight the importance of other than purely stomatal conductance-driven adjustments of drought resistance in Scots pine. Accounting for acclimation responses to drought, such as morphological (leaf shedding) and physiological (NSL) adjustments, has the potential to improve tree hydraulic simulation models, particularly when applied in predicting drought-induced tree mortality.</p>","[Nadal-Sala, Daniel; Grote, Ruediger; Birami, Benjamin; Knuever, Timo; Rehschuh, Romy; Schwarz, Selina; Ruehr, Nadine K.] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res Atmospher Environm Re, Garmisch Partenkirchen, Germany; [Birami, Benjamin] Univ Bayreuth, Chair Plant Ecol, Bayreuth, Germany; [Knuever, Timo] Univ Innsbruck, Dept Bot, Innsbruck, Austria",Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; University of Bayreuth; University of Innsbruck,"Nadal-Sala, D (corresponding author), Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res Atmospher Environm Re, Garmisch Partenkirchen, Germany.",d.nadal@kit.edu,"Nadal-Sala, Daniel/AAC-2904-2020; Ruehr, Nadine K/C-6986-2011; Schwarz, Selina/GWZ-2023-2022; Grote, Rüdiger/A-7350-2013","Nadal-Sala, Daniel/0000-0002-0935-6201; Ruehr, Nadine K/0000-0001-5989-7463; Grote, Rüdiger/0000-0001-6893-6890",German Research Foundation through its Emmy Noether Program [RU 1657/2-1],German Research Foundation through its Emmy Noether Program(German Research Foundation (DFG)),This study was supported by the German Research Foundation through its Emmy Noether Program (RU 1657/2-1).,,106,8,8,4,22,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-462X,,,FRONT PLANT SCI,Front.

This paper reviews the assumptions made by 24 modeling teams about supply-side drivers of structural change: primary factor efficiency and changes in input-output structures of the production function over time. We critically review various methodologies, identifying state-of-the-art practices, and we propose simple guidelines, particularly focusing on consistency between data sources and models. The review highlights that most models take into account structural change to some extent. However, more effort is needed in modelling projected changes in input-output structures. Furthermore, this review is helpful for understanding the functioning of dynamic CGE models and in assisting dynamic CGE modelers in building their own baselines.","[Chateau, Jean; Lanzi, Elisa] Org Econ Cooperat & Dev OECD, Environm Directorate, 2 Rue Andre Pascal, Paris, France; [Corong, Erwin] Purdue Univ, Ctr Global Trade Anal, 403 W State St, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Carrico, Caitlyn] Wageningen Econ Res, Prinses Beatrixlaan 582, NL-2595 BM The Hague, Netherlands; [Foure, Jean] Ctr Etud Prospect & Informat Int CEPII, 20 Ave Segur,TSA 10726, F-75334 Paris 07, France; [Laborde, David] Int Food Policy Res Inst IFPRI, 1201 Eye St NW, Washington, DC 20005 USA",Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD); Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Wageningen University & Research; CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Chateau, J (corresponding author), Org Econ Cooperat & Dev OECD, Environm Directorate, 2 Rue Andre Pascal, Paris, France.",jean.chateau@oecd.org; ecorong@purdue.edu; elisa.lanzi@oecd.org; caitlyn.carrico@wur.nl; jean.foure@cepii.fr; d.laborde@cgiar.org,,,,,,,51,6,6,0,2,CENTER GLOBAL TRADE ANALYSIS,WEST LAFAYETTE,"DEPT AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS, PURDUE UNIV, 403 W STATE ST, WEST LAFAYETTE, IN 47907-2056 USA",2377-2999,,,J GLOB ECON ANAL,J.

Therefore, characterizing the nature and quantifying the extent of any reproductive failure should be considered in fisheries studies. Here, we describe morphological changes in developed ovaries of autumn-spawning herring (Clupea harengus membras) caught in the northern Baltic Sea and evaluate the magnitude of this phenomenon during 3 consecutive years. Visibly, abnormal ovaries were histologically characterized by irregular- shaped oocytes in a vitellogenic or final maturation stage with coagulative necrosis and liquefaction of the yolk sphere, degraded follicle membranes, and fibrinous adhesion among oocytes. Such degeneration is presumed to cause complete infertility in the fish. The frequency of fish with abnormal ovaries varied annually between 10 and 15% among all females sampled. However, specific sampling events showed up to 90% females with abnormal gonads. The specific cause of this abnormality remains unknown; however, prevalence was associated with unfavourable environmental conditions encountered before spawning. Thus, ovarian abnormality was positively related to water temperatures, with the highest level found at >= 15 degrees C and negatively related to the frequency of strong winds. The frequency of occurrence of abnormal gonads decreased with the progression of spawning from August to October. The observed abnormality and associated spawning failure will negatively affect the realized fecundity of autumn herring in the Baltic Sea and may act as a limiting factor for recovery of the stock, which has experienced profound depression during the last three decades.","[Ojaveer, Henn; Arula, Timo; Klais, Riina] Univ Tartu, Estonian Marine Inst, EE-80012 Parnu, Estonia; [Tomkiewicz, Jonna] Tech Univ Denmark, Natl Inst Aquat Resources, DK-2920 Charlottenlund, Denmark; [Klais, Riina] Univ Tartu, Inst Ecol & Earth Sci, EE-51014 Tartu, Estonia",University of Tartu; Estonian Marine Institute; Technical University of Denmark; University of Tartu; Tartu University Institute of Ecology & Earth Sciences,"Ojaveer, H (corresponding author), Univ Tartu, Estonian Marine Inst, Lootsi 2a, EE-80012 Parnu, Estonia.",henn.ojaveer@ut.ee,"Ojaveer, Henn/K-2160-2016; Tomkiewicz, Jonna/AAH-7526-2021; arula, timo/G-8710-2017","Ojaveer, Henn/0000-0003-2742-6063; Tomkiewicz, Jonna/0000-0002-9695-2019; Klais-Peets, Riina/0000-0003-2895-1273; arula, timo/0000-0001-9621-1168","Estonian Ministry of Education and Research [SF0180005s10]; Estonian Science Foundation [8747]; BONUS (INSPIRE project); BONUS (BIO-C3 project); joint Baltic Sea research and development programme - European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for Research, Technological Development and Demonstration [Art 185]; joint Baltic Sea research and development programme - Estonian Research Council; joint Baltic Sea research and development programme - Innovation Fund Denmark","Estonian Ministry of Education and Research(Ministry of Education and Research, Estonia); Estonian Science Foundation; BONUS (INSPIRE project); BONUS (BIO-C3 project); joint Baltic Sea research and development programme - European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for Research, Technological Development and Demonstration; joint Baltic Sea research and development programme - Estonian Research Council(Estonian Research Council); joint Baltic Sea research and development programme - Innovation Fund Denmark","We thank Inger Hormum and Maria Kruger Johnsen for assisting with histological processing of ovaries.

There are many reasons why biofuels are viewed by both developed and industrialized countries as important technologies. These include reasons related to energy supply, climate, foreign exchange savings, and rural socioeconomic issues. The term modern biomass is generally used to describe the traditional use of biomass through effective and clean fuel technologies and a long-term provision of biomass resources as well as environmental and competitive fuel, heating, and power using state-of-the-art conversion technologies. For electricity and heat generation, modern biomass can be used. The most recent biomass-backed transportation fuel is bioethanol and biodiesel as well as diesel generated by synthesis from biomass Fischer-Tropsch. The petroleum additive/substitute is bioethanol. Wood, paint, and even household waste can be processed into bio-ethanol economically. The organic ethanol comes from alcoholic fermentation by hydrolysis process of the saccharides or simple sugars provided by biomass. Starch, sugar or oil-generating crops are currently the basis for the production of transport fuel. The use of vegetable oils for the production of biodiesel has been renewed because of less pollutant and sustainable nature than traditional petroleum diesel. The role of catalysts in biofuel production is highly praised as the rate of conversion and reusability are the major concerns of production economics. Biodiesel is a petroleum-based diesel renewable alternative. Bio-oil production is enabled by biomass energy conversion facilities. In the biomass thermal conversion processes, pyrolysis is the most critical method. A brief overview of the basic concepts involved in biomass fuel thermochemical conversion is reviewed with a major focus on the use of nanotechnologies for biofuel production. High potential heterogeneous nanocatalysts (zinc oxide, silver oxide, doped nanoparticles, alloy nanoparticles, titanium dioxide, magnesium dioxide, iron oxide, and others), as well as their synthesis and characterization have been considered with much emphasis on green production strategies. The share of biomass in the renewable energy sector is around 62%. The key benefit of using biomass energy is reducing greenhouse gas emissions.","[Manikandan, Sivasubramanian] Saveetha Inst Med & Tech Sci SIMATS, Saveetha Sch Engn, Dept Biotechnol, Chennai 602105, Tamil Nadu, India; [Subbaiya, Ramasamy] Copperbelt Univ, Sch Math & Nat Sci, Dept Biol Sci, Jambo Dr,POB 21692, Kitwe, Zambia; [Biruntha, Muniyandi] Alagappa Univ, Dept Anim Hlth & Management, Karaikkudi 630003, Tamil Nadu, India; [Krishnan, Radhakrishnan Yedhu] Amal Jyothi Coll Engn, Dept Food Technol, Kottayam 686518, Kerala, India; [Muthusamy, Govarthanan] Kyungpook Natl Univ, Dept Environm Engn, Daegu, South Korea; [Karmegam, Natchimuthu] Govt Arts Coll Autonomous, Dept Bot, Salem 636007, Tamil Nadu, India",Saveetha Institute of Medical & Technical Science; Saveetha School of Engineering; Copperbelt University; Alagappa University; Kyungpook National University,"Muthusamy, G (corresponding author), Kyungpook Natl Univ, Dept Environm Engn, Daegu, South Korea.;Karmegam, N (corresponding author), Govt Arts Coll Autonomous, Dept Bot, Salem 636007, Tamil Nadu, India.",gova.muthu@gmail.com; kanishkarmegam@gmail.com,"Krishnan, Radhakrishnan Yedhu/K-7885-2016; Natchimuthu, Karmegam/J-4745-2019","Krishnan, Radhakrishnan Yedhu/0000-0002-7088-9699; Natchimuthu, Karmegam/0000-0002-7955-3593",,,,,106,9,9,10,14,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0016-2361,1873-7153,,FUEL,Fuel,15-Apr,2022,,,,,,,122757,10.1016/j.fuel.2021.122757,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuel.2021.122757,,,12,"Energy & Fuels; Engineering, Chemical",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Energy & Fuels; Engineering,0X3ZG,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000789648300003,View Full Record in Web of Science

To address this need, soil spectroscopy in the visible, near- and shortwave-infrared (VNIR-SWIR) has emerged as a viable alternative to traditional analytical approaches. To this end, large-scale soil spectral libraries coupled with advanced machine learning tools have been developed to infer the soil properties from the hyperspectral signatures. However, models developed from one region may exhibit diminished performance when applied to a new, unseen by the model, region due to the large and inherent soil variability (e.g. pedogenetical differences, diverse soil types etc.). Given an existing spectral library with labeled data and a new unlabeled region (i.e. where no soil samples are analytically measured) the question then becomes how to best develop a model which can more accurately predict the soil properties of the unlabeled region. In this paper, a machine learning technique leveraging on the capabilities of semi-supervised learning which exploits the predictors' distribution of the unlabeled dataset and of active learning which expertly selects a small set of data from the unlabeled dataset as a spiking subset in order to develop a more robust model is proposed. The semi-supervised learning approach is the Laplacian Support Vector Regression following the manifold regularization framework. As far as the active learning component is concerned, the pool-based approach is utilized as it best matches with the aforementioned use-case scenario, which iteratively selects a subset of data from the unlabeled region to spike the calibration set. As a query strategy, a novel machine learning-based strategy is proposed herein to best identify the spiking subset at each iteration. The experimental analysis was conducted using data from the Land Use and Coverage Area Frame Survey of 2009 which covered most of the then memberstates of the European Union, and in particular by focusing on the mineral cropland soil samples from 5 different countries. The statistical analysis conducted ascertained the efficacy of our approach when compared to the current state-of-the-art in soil spectroscopy.","[Tsakiridis, Nikolaos L.; Theocharis, John B.; Symeonidis, Andreas L.] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Thessaloniki 54124, Greece; [Zalidis, George C.] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Fac Agr, Thessaloniki 54124, Greece",Aristotle University of Thessaloniki; Aristotle University of Thessaloniki,"Tsakiridis, NL (corresponding author), Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Thessaloniki 54124, Greece.",tsakirin@ece.auth.gr; theochar@eng.auth.gr; asymeon@eng.auth.gr; zalidis@agro.auth.gr,"Tsakiridis, Nikolaos/AAT-7879-2021","Tsakiridis, Nikolaos/0000-0002-1904-9029",,,,,59,8,8,3,19,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0016-7061,1872-6259,,GEODERMA,Geoderma,1-Apr,2021,,,,,,,114830,10.1016/j.geoderma.2020.114830,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2020.114830,,21-Jan,17,Soil Science,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,QE4FO,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000616163300002,View Full Record in Web of Science

The slogan of Greta Thunberg Our house is on fire urges any person to act on the climate. As researchers in the field of databases, one of the most active research communities, we are compelled to propose little and big steps to save our planet. It should be noticed that DBMSs are one of the main energy consumers, as responsible to store and efficiently process data. In data stores, research on energy consumption has been mainly focused on some specific types of stores: data centers, database clusters, known as big infrastructures. These stores are computer warehouses dedicated to store and process in a parallel manner a large amount of data. They include different servers and network infrastructures. Energy consumption in traditional DBMSs got less attention compared to data centers, and at the same time, they are widely used in the actual applications. In DB-Engine (https://db-engines.com/en/ranking) ranking DBMSs according to their popularity, traditional DBMSs (Oracle, MySQL, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, DB2) are the top 5 of the most popular systems. This motivates us to integrate energy consumption in the components of these DBMSs. Query optimizers are one of the energy consumer's components. The actual studies were focused on integrating energy in query optimization in the mono-core processor architecture. Recently, thanks to multi-core, these studies have to be revisited. In this paper, we propose a new approach to integrate the energy dimension into query optimizers in the multi-core processor architecture. Firstly, we present a rich state of the art on energy consumption in the context of traditional databases. Secondly, a crossing from sequential query processing mode to parallel mode is given. Thirdly, we propose a cost model capturing energy in a multicore architecture. Its parameter values are obtained by using non-linear regression and neural network techniques. Finally, our cost model is integrated into the query optimizer in PostgreSQL on which several experiments were conducted showing the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposal.","[Dembele, Simon Pierre; Bellatreche, Ladjel] Univ Poitiers, LIAS ISAE ENSMA, Chasseneuil, France; [Ordonez, Carlos] Univ Houston, Houston, TX USA; [Roukh, Amine] Univ Mostaganem, Mostaganem, Algeria",Ecole Nationale Superieure de Mecanique et d'Aerotechnique (ISAE-ENSMA); Universite de Poitiers; University of Houston System; University of Houston; Universite Abdelhamid Ibn Badis de Mostaganem,"Bellatreche, L (corresponding author), Univ Poitiers, LIAS ISAE ENSMA, Chasseneuil, France.",simon-pierre.dembele@ensma.fr; bellatreche@ensma.fr; carlos@Central.UH.EDU; roukh.amine@univ-mosta.dz,,,,,,,73,2,2,0,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1386-7857,1573-7543,,CLUSTER COMPUT,Cluster Comput.,SEP,2020,3,,,,2323,2345,,10.1007/s10586-019-03005-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10586-019-03005-0,,19-Oct,23,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science,PQ3CX,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000493499100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

More recently, SDV have been used in combination with other plant measurements and biophysical modelling to study fundamental mechanisms underlying whole-plant functioning and growth. The present review aims to scrutinize the important insights emerging from these more recent SDV applications to identify trends in ongoing fundamental research. The main mechanism underlying SDV is variation in water content in stem tissues, originating from reversible shrinkage and swelling of dead and living tissues, and irreversible growth. The contribution of different stem tissues to the overall SDV signal is currently under debate and shows variation with species and plant age, but can be investigated by combining SDV with state-of-the-art technology like magnetic resonance imaging. Various physiological mechanisms, such as water and carbon transport, and mechanical properties influence the SDV pattern, making it an extensive source of information on dynamic plant behaviour. To unravel these dynamics and to extract information on plant physiology or plant biophysics from SDV, mechanistic modelling has proved to be valuable. Biophysical models integrate different mechanisms underlying SDV, and help us to explain the resulting SDV signal. Using an elementary modelling approach, we demonstrate the application of SDV as a tool to examine plant water relations, plant hydraulics, plant carbon relations, plant nutrition, freezing effects, plant phenology and dendroclimatology. In the ever-expanding SDV knowledge base we identified two principal research tracks. First, in detailed short-term experiments, SDV measurements are combined with other plant measurements and modelling to discover patterns in phloem turgor, phloem osmotic concentrations, root pressure and plant endogenous control. Second, long-term SDV time series covering many different species, regions and climates provide an expanding amount of phenotypic data of growth, phenology and survival in relation to microclimate, soil water availability, species or genotype, which can be coupled with genetic information to support ecological and breeding research under on-going global change. This under-exploited source of information has now encouraged research groups to set up coordinated initiatives to explore this data pool via global analysis techniques and data-mining.","[De Swaef, Tom] Inst Agr & Fisheries Res ILVO, Plant Sci Unit, B-9090 Melle, Belgium; [De Swaef, Tom; De Schepper, Veerle; Vandegehuchte, Maurits W.; Steppe, Kathy] Univ Ghent, Fac Biosci Engn, Dept Appl Ecol & Environm Biol, Plant Ecol Lab, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium",Institute For Agricultural & Fisheries Research; Ghent University,"Steppe, K (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Fac Biosci Engn, Dept Appl Ecol & Environm Biol, Plant Ecol Lab, Coupure Links 653, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",kathy.steppe@UGent.be,"De Swaef, Tom/I-1272-2019","De Swaef, Tom/0000-0002-8338-7786; Steppe, Kathy/0000-0001-6252-0704",Special Research Fund (BOF) of Ghent University; Research Foundation-Flanders (FWO),Special Research Fund (BOF) of Ghent University(Ghent University); Research Foundation-Flanders (FWO)(FWO),This work was supported by the Special Research Fund (BOF) of Ghent University (Postdoc funding granted to V.D.S.) and the Research Foundation-Flanders (FWO) (Postdoc funding granted to M.V.).,,142,86,91,7,180,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0829-318X,1758-4469,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,OCT,2015,10,,,,1047,1061,,10.1093/treephys/tpv080,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/treephys/tpv080,,,15,Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Forestry,CY6MI,26377875,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000366522800003,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, in recent decades the world has entered a new phase in the magnitude and diversity of biological invasions: the Era of Globalization. This Special Profile reviews the links between the main drivers of globalization and biological invasions and examines state-of-the-art approaches to pathway risk assessment to illustrate new opportunities for managing invasive species. Income growth is a primary driver of globalization and a clear association exists between Gross Domestic Product and the richness of alien floras and faunas for many regions of the world. In many cases, the exposure of these economies to trade is highlighted by the significant role of merchandise imports in biological invasions, especially for island ecosystems. Post-1950, technical and logistic improvements have accelerated the ease with which commodities are transported across the globe and hindered the traceability of goods and the ease of intercepting pests. New sea, land and air links in international trade and human transport have established novel pathways for the spread of alien species. Increasingly, the science advances underpinning invasive species management must move at the speed of commerce. Increasing transport networks and demand for commodities have led to pathway risk assessments becoming the frontline in the prevention of biological invasions. The diverse routes of introduction arising from contaminant, stowaway, corridor and unaided pathways, in both aquatic and terrestrial biomes are complex. Nevertheless, common features enable comparable approaches to risk assessment. By bringing together spatial data on climate suitability, habitat availability and points of entry, as well a demographic models that include species dispersal (both natural and human-mediated) and measures of propagule pressure, it is possible to generate risk maps highlighting potential invasion hotspots that can inform prevention strategies. Synthesis and applications. To date, most attempts to model pathways have focused on describing the likelihood of invader establishment. Few have modelled explicit management strategies such as optimal detection and inspection strategies and assessments of the effectiveness of different management measures. A future focus in these areas will ensure research informs response.","Lincoln Univ, Bioprotect Res Ctr, Canterbury, New Zealand",Lincoln University - New Zealand,"Hulme, PE (corresponding author), Lincoln Univ, Bioprotect Res Ctr, POB 84, Canterbury, New Zealand.",Philip.hulme@lincoln.ac.nz,"Hulme, Philip/F-7454-2011","Hulme, Philip/0000-0001-5712-0474",,,,,65,1482,1551,34,922,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8901,1365-2664,,J APPL ECOL,J.

However, how the provision of FR service affects the HVAC system performance is still largely unknown. This paper investigates how a HVAC system performance and its associated controls are impacted during and after a FR service. We exploit a dynamic Modelica-based medium office building model as a virtual testbed with the Air Handling Unit (AHU) fans providing the FR service for the assessment. The virtual testbed adopts state-of-the-art HVAC control sequences and an experimentally validated frequency regulation control scheme. The comprehensive study of 832 case studies considers several scenarios, consisting of different regulation capacities (demand levels), standardized FR test signals, and building load profiles in 16 U.S, climate zones. The holistic assessment includes the interaction between the FR and the HVAC baseline controls, the impact of FR on the occupant's thermal comfort, and, more importantly, the energy efficiency. The results show that FR has little or no impact on the HVAC operation and occupant thermal comfort while the building is providing the service if an appropriate regulation capacity is pre-determined. However, if the regulation capacity is overestimated, the quality of the FR service provided by the HVAC system and the HVAC energy efficiency will be affected due to the equipment operating constraints. In addition, the AHU supply air temperature fluctuates, and the controller cannot maintain the desired setpoint as the FR magnitude is increased. After the FR service time, the system takes a certain period to return to normal operation. The rebound period extends with the increase in the FR magnitude. For this case study, there exists a control conflict between the FR control and the existing HVAC control (from ASHRAE Guideline 36-2018) during high load conditions, causing the fan speed to saturate.

With that comes the need to better shield society against space weather by improving forecasts, environmental specifications, and infrastructure design. We recognize that much progress has been made and continues to be made with a powerful suite of research observatories on the ground and in space, forming the basis of a Sun Earth system observatory. But the domain of space weather is vast extending from deep within the Sun to far outside the planetary orbits and the physics complex including couplings between various types of physical processes that link scales and domains from the microscopic to large parts of the solar system. Consequently, advanced understanding of space weather requires a coordinated international approach to effectively provide awareness of the processes within the Sun Earth system through observation-driven models. This roadmap prioritizes the scientific focus areas and research infrastructure that are needed to significantly advance our understanding of space weather of all intensities and of its implications for society. Advancement of the existing system observatory through the addition of small to moderate state-of-the-art capabilities designed to fill observational gaps will enable significant advances. Such a strategy requires urgent action: key instrumentation needs to be sustained, and action needs to be taken before core capabilities are lost in the aging ensemble. We recommend advances through priority focus (1) on observation-based modeling throughout the Sun Earth system, (2) on forecasts more than 12 h ahead of the magnetic structure of incoming coronal mass ejections, (3) on understanding the geospace response to variable solar-wind stresses that lead to intense geomagnetically-induced currents and ionospheric and radiation storms, and (4) on developing a comprehensive specification of space climate, including the characterization of extreme space storms to guide resilient and robust engineering of technological infrastructures. The roadmap clusters its implementation recommendations by formulating three action pathways, and outlines needed instrumentation and research programs and infrastructure for each of these. An executive summary provides an overview of all recommendations. (C) 2015 COSPAR.

The opacity is measured at Bern, Switzerland, by the radiometer Middle Atmospheric Water Vapour Radiometer (MIAWARA), designed for middle atmospheric water vapor profile measurements. In contrast to typical radiometers for tropospheric monitoring, this middle atmospheric water vapor radiometer only measures in the vicinity of the 22.235 GHz water vapor line with a bandwidth of 1 GHz. With this study we show that it is even possible to derive the integrated tropospheric water vapor ( IWV) content of the atmosphere using this limited frequency range if the liquid water content of the atmosphere is negligible. IWV measurements of the tropospheric monitoring instruments Tropospheric Water Vapour Radiometer (TROWARA, two-channel radiometer), All-Sky Multi Wavelength Radiometer (ASMUWARA, multichannel radiometer), and GPS, which are operated next to MIAWARA, are used to derive a linear relation between the opacity and the water vapor content of the troposphere. In a second step, the mean tropospheric temperature is taken into account and a slight improvement of the linear relation is achieved. All instruments involved in this study are contributing to the Studies in Atmospheric Radiative Transfer and Water Vapour Effects (STARTWAVE) project of the Climate program of the National Competence Center in Research. The MIAWARA measurements in the subarctic winter in northern Finland during the Lapbiat Upper Tropospheric Lower Stratospheric Water Vapor Validation Project (LAUTLOS/WAVVAP) campaign in 2004 are compared to radiosonde measurements by the Finnish Meteorological Institute using the same algorithm that was derived for Bern. The agreement of MIAWARA IWV and radiosonde IWV is of the same order as for Bern. Finally, Payerne radiosonde measurements and model simulation using the Atmospheric Radiative Transfer Simulator ( ARTS) software and the continuum absorption models of Rosenkranz ( 1998) and Liebe (MPM87/MPM93) confirm the derived opacity-IWV relation. This study shows that the integrated water vapor content of the troposphere can be measured by a radiometer operating near the 22.235 GHz water vapor line using a bandwidth of 1 GHz, if the liquid water content of the atmosphere is negligible.","Univ Bern, Inst Appl Phys, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland",University of Bern,"Deuber, B (corresponding author), BKW FMB Energie AG, CH-3000 Bern, Switzerland.",beat.deuber@bkw-fmb.ch,,,,,,,28,7,7,0,0,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",0048-6604,,,RADIO SCI,Radio Sci.,20-Oct,2005,5,,,,,,RS5011,10.1029/2004RS003233,http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2004RS003233,,,11,Astronomy & Astrophysics; Geochemistry & Geophysics; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences; Remote Sensing; Telecommunications,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Astronomy & Astrophysics; Geochemistry & Geophysics; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences; Remote Sensing; Telecommunications,978DG,,Bronze,,,12/21/22,WOS:000232851900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

These energy functionals are usually minimized, based on the calculus of variations (Euler-Lagrange equation). Once the Euler-Lagrange equation has been determined, it needs to be discretized in order to implement it on a digital computer. This is not a trivial task and, is moreover, error-prone. In this paper, we propose a flexible alternative. We discretize the energy functional and, subsequently, apply the mathematical concept of algorithmic differentiation to directly derive algorithms that implement the energy functional's derivatives. This approach has several advantages: First, the computed derivatives are exact with respect to the implementation of the energy functional. Second, it is basically straightforward to compute second-order derivatives and, thus, the Hessian matrix of the energy functional. Third, algorithmic differentiation is a process which can be automated. We demonstrate this novel approach on three representative vision problems ( namely, denoising, segmentation, and stereo) and show that state-of-the-art results are obtained with little effort.","Graz Univ Technol, Inst Comp Graph & Vis, A-8010 Graz, Austria; Graz Univ, Wegener Ctr Climate & Global Change, A-8010 Graz, Austria",Graz University of Technology; University of Graz,"Pock, T (corresponding author), Graz Univ Technol, Inst Comp Graph & Vis, Inffeldgasse 16, A-8010 Graz, Austria.",pock@icg.tugraz.at; michael.pock@uni-graz.at; bischof@icg.tugraz.at,,"Bischof, Horst/0000-0002-9096-6671",,,,,60,10,11,0,3,IEEE COMPUTER SOC,LOS ALAMITOS,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1314 USA",0162-8828,1939-3539,,IEEE T PATTERN ANAL,IEEE Trans.

However, previous studies have mainly compared the tourist flow of scenic spots, and it is still unclear how cultural tourism affects regional tourism seasonality. This study investigated the seasonal patterns by analyzing the monthly inbound tourist flow of the 28 typical Chinese tourist cities from 2001 to 2012, and examined the effect of cultural tourism on weakening seasonality by using the random-response panel Tobit model. It was found that the seasonal patterns of inbound tourists present non-peak, one-peak, two-double, and three-peak regular fluctuations, and also have irregular fluctuations affected by emergencies and festivals. Cultural tourism can weaken the seasonality of regional tourism, while nature tourism products enhance tourism seasonality. Suitable travel times throughout the year and destination reception industry levels, locations, and external connections have a significant impact on the regional tourism seasonality, but climate comfort, foreign direct investment, and simply the number of hotels and international travel agencies are not significant for tourism seasonality.","[Zhang, Jing; Yu, Zhonglei; Miao, Changhong; Li, Yuting; Qiao, Shuai] Henan Univ, Minist Educ, Key Res Inst Yellow River Civilizat & Sustainable, Kaifeng 475001, Peoples R China; [Yu, Zhonglei; Miao, Changhong] Henan Univ, Coll Geog & Environm Sci, Kaifeng 475004, Peoples R China",Henan University; Henan University,"Miao, CH (corresponding author), Henan Univ, Minist Educ, Key Res Inst Yellow River Civilizat & Sustainable, Kaifeng 475001, Peoples R China.;Miao, CH (corresponding author), Henan Univ, Coll Geog & Environm Sci, Kaifeng 475004, Peoples R China.",104753181181@vip.henu.edu.cn; yzlei@mail.bnu.edu.cn; chhmiao@henu.edu.cn; liyuting@henu.edu.cn; 104753201432@henu.edu.cn,"Wang, Jiahui/GRR-4965-2022",,National Natural Science Foundation of China [42171186]; Major Project of China National Social Science Fund [21ZD03]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41901206]; Philosophy and Social Science planning project of Henan Province [2020CSH029],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Major Project of China National Social Science Fund; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Philosophy and Social Science planning project of Henan Province,"This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Fund project host: Miao Changhong), grant number 42171186; The Major Project of China National Social Science Fund in Art (Fund sub-project host: Miao Changhong), grant number 21ZD03; The National Natural Science Foundation of China, grant number 41901206 (Fund project host: Yu Zhonglei); Philosophy and Social Science planning project of Henan Province (Fund project host: Yu Zhonglei), grant number 2020CSH029.",,56,1,1,17,33,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-445X,,LAND-BASEL,Land,FEB,2022,2,,,,,,308,10.3390/land11020308,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land11020308,,,14,Environmental Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,ZN5UB,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000765098000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Renewed interest on these events comes from the possible link between the drainage of the ice-dammed Lake Agassiz-Ojibway and a major climate deterioration known as the 8.2-ka cooling event. Recent glaciological modeling suggests that this drainage may have occurred subglacially, a mechanism that can accommodate more than one lake discharge, as suggested by marine records. The exact number and timing of drainage events, as well as location of the lake discharge pathway(s) remain, however, largely unconstrained. Here we focus on the events that led to the drainage of Lake Ojibway by documenting late-glacial sedimentary sequences located east of James Bay. Our investigations indicate that the deglacial sequence consists of a readvance till, extensive Ojibway rhythmites, and thick marine sediments. The glaciolacustrine and marine units are separated by a 60 cm-thick horizon composed of laminated silt beds containing rounded clay balls and disseminated clasts resulting from the abrupt drainage of the lake. Radiocarbon dating of marine fossils lying above the drainage horizon indicates that the glaciolacustrine episode ended around 8128-8282 cal yr BP. Micropaleontological analyses reveal that freshwater ostracods (Candona sp.) and marine microfossils (foraminifers, dinocysts) occur together in the upper part of the Ojibway sediments. Analysis of oxygen isotopes (delta O-18) of ostracods and foraminifers originating from the same stratigraphic position show highly contrasting values that suggest possible subglacial exchanges between Lake Ojibway and Tyrrell Sea waters prior to the final drainage event. The complexity of the deglacial events is further indicated by radiocarbon dating of marine shells retrieved from a Cochrane till that suggests that the last ice readvance occurred almost simultaneously with the final lake discharge. These results bring additional constraints on the drainage mechanism of the coalesced Lake Agassiz-Ojibway and indicate that the James Bay region formed an important drainage pathway for meltwaters at the end of the last deglaciation.

CANYON-B is a Bayesian neural network mapping that accurately reproduces GLODAPv2 bottle data and the biogeochemical relations contained therein. CONTENT combines and refines the four carbonate system variables to be consistent with carbonate chemistry. Both methods come with a robust uncertainty estimate that incorporates information from the local conditions. They are validated against independent GO-SHIP bottle and sensor data, and compare favorably to other state-of-the-art mapping methods. As dynamic climatologies they show comparable performance to classical climatologies on large scales but a much better representation on smaller scales (40-120 d, 500-1,500 km) compared to in situ data. The limits of these mappings are explored with pCO(2) estimation in surface waters, i.e., at the edge of the domain with high intrinsic variability. In highly productive areas, there is a tendency for pCO(2 )overestimation due to decoupling of the O-2 and C cycles by air-sea gas exchange, but global surface pCO(2) estimates are unbiased compared to a monthly climatology. CANYON-B and CONTENT are highly useful as transfer functions between components of the ocean observing system (GO-SHIP repeat hydrography, BGC-Argo, underway observations) and permit the synergistic use of these highly complementary systems, both in spatial/temporal coverage and number of observations. Through easily and robotically-accessible observations they allow densification of more difficult-to-observe variables (e.g., 15 times denser A(T) and C-T compared to direct measurements). At the same time, they give access to the complete carbonate system. This potential is demonstrated by an observation-based global analysis of the Revelle buffer factor, which shows a significant, high latitude-intensified increase between +0.1 and +0.4 units per decade.

It is evidence of millennia of adaptation of humans to the environment. Cultural heritage can be intangible (e.g., traditional knowledge, customs, ritual practises or beliefs) and tangible, the latter including various categories of places, from cultural landscapes and sacred sites to archaeological complexes, individual architectural or artistic monuments and historic urban centres. The most world wide representative Cultural and Natural Heritages are included within UNESCO Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage''. They are the flagship of a large number of monuments and sites diffused at both national and local level. The sites and remains are not always in equilibrium with the environment. They are continuously impacted and weathered by several internal and external factors, both natural and human-induced, with rapid and/or slow onset. These include major sudden natural hazards, such as earthquakes or extreme meteorological events, but also slow, cumulative processes such as the erosion of rocks, compounded by the effect of climate change, without disregarding the role of humans, especially in conflict situations. Cultural Heritages required proper infrastructures to be used by local populations. Such infrastructures are part of the heritage itself and nowadays need adequate attention for a sustainable conservation and maintenance. Typical example is the Siq of Petra (Jordan). In the present paper the role of engineering geology and earth science in general is described for the conservation and management of a masterpiece of cultural properties such as the Siq of Petra. The relevance and potential of these areas of study was not fully appreciated in the past. At present, however, their contribution is increasingly acknowledged as the need for an inter-disciplinary approach, which would bring together art history, science, management and socio-economic concerns, has become more and more apparent. This paper will focus on the relevance of modern technologies for investigation and monitoring, as a fundamental step for a safeguarding project that have to enhance, as much as possible, traditional knowledge and local sustainable practises, in conservation techniques.","[Margottini, Claudio; Spizzichino, Daniele] ISPRA, Dept Geol Survey Italy, Rome, Italy; [Margottini, Claudio; Spizzichino, Daniele] Florence Univ, Florence, Italy",Italian Institute for Environmental Protection & Research (ISPRA); University of Florence,"Margottini, C (corresponding author), ISPRA, Dept Geol Survey Italy, Rome, Italy.;Margottini, C (corresponding author), Florence Univ, Florence, Italy.",claudio.margottini@gmail.com,"Margottini, Claudio/N-2831-2019; Margottini, Claudio/G-6816-2015","Margottini, Claudio/0000-0001-5045-9942; ",UNESCO Amman Office,UNESCO Amman Office,"The present work is an advancement of the UNESCO Project Siq STABILITY-Sustainable Monitoring Techniques for Assessing Instability of Slopes in the Siq of Petra, Jordan.

Investigations of the CO(2)-hydrate properties indicate the feasibility of geologic sequestration CO, as gas hydrate and the possibility of coincident CO(2) sequestration/CH(4) production from natural gas hydrate reservoirs. Numerical studies can provide an integrated understanding of the process mechanisms in predicting the potential and economic viability of CO(2) gas sequestration, especially when utilizing realistic geological reservoir characteristics in the. 1 models. This study numerically investigates possible sequestration of CO(2) as a stable gas hydrate in various reservoir geological informations. As such, this paper extends the applicability of a previously developed model to more realistic and relevant reservoir scenarios. A unified gas hydrate model coupled with a thermal reservoir simulator (CMG STARS) was applied to simulate CO(2)-hydrate formation in four reservoir geological formations. These reservoirs can be described as follows. The first reservoir (Reservoir 1) is similar to tight gas reservoir with mean porosity 0.25 and mean absolute permeability 10 mD. The second reservoir (Reservoir II) is similar to a conventional sandstone reservoir with mean porosity 0.25 and mean permeability 20 mD. The third reservoir (Reservoir III is similar to hydrate-free Mallik silt with mean porosity 0.30 and mean permeability 100 mD. The fourth reservoir (Reservoir IV) is similar to hydrate-free Mallik sand with mean porosity 0.35 and mean permeability 1000 mD. The Mallik gas hydrate bearing formation itself can be described as several layers of variable thickness with permeability variations from 1 mD to 1000 mD, and is addressed as a separate part of this study This paper describes numerical methodology, model input data selection, and reservoir simulation results, including an enhancement to model the effects of ice formation and decay. The numerical investigation shows that the gas hydrate model effectively captures the spatial and temporal dynamics of CO(2)-hydrate formation in geological reservoirs by injection of CO(2) gas. Practical limitations to CO(2)-hydrate formation by gas injection art, identified and potential improvements to the process are suggested.","[Uddin, M.] Alberta Res Council Inc, Edmonton, AB T6N 1E4, Canada; [Coombe, D.] Comp Modeling Grp Ltd, Calgary, AB T2L 2A6, Canada; [Wright, F.] Geol Survey Canada, Terrain Sci Div, Sidney, BC V8L 4B2, Canada",Alberta Innovates; Natural Resources Canada; Lands & Minerals Sector - Natural Resources Canada; Geological Survey of Canada,"Uddin, M (corresponding author), Alberta Res Council Inc, 250 Karl Clark Rd, Edmonton, AB T6N 1E4, Canada.",uddin@arc.ab.ca; dennis.coombe@cmgl.ca; fwright@nrcan.gc.ca,,,"Geological Survey of Canada, Natural Resources of Canada","Geological Survey of Canada, Natural Resources of Canada","The work presented in this paper was Supported by the Geological Survey of Canada, Natural Resources of Canada.

These challenges motivate the need for new solution strategies capable of effectively and efficiently discovering the multi-sectoral tradeoffs that are inherent to alternative reservoir operation policies. Evolutionary many-objective direct policy search (EMODPS) is gaining importance in this context due to its capability of addressing multiple objectives and its flexibility in incorporating multiple sources of uncertainties. This simulation-optimization framework has high potential for addressing the complexities of water resources management, and it can benefit from current advances in parallel computing and meta-heuristics. This study contributes a diagnostic assessment of state-of-the-art parallel strategies for the auto-adaptive Borg Multi Objective Evolutionary Algorithm (MOEA) to support EMODPS. Our analysis focuses on the Lower Susquehanna River Basin (LSRB) system where multiple sectoral demands from hydropower production, urban water supply, recreation and environmental flows need to be balanced. Using EMODPS with different parallel configurations of the Borg MOEA, we optimize operating policies over different size ensembles of synthetic streamflows and evaporation rates. As we increase the ensemble size, we increase the statistical fidelity of our objective function evaluations at the cost of higher computational demands. This study demonstrates how to overcome the mathematical and computational barriers associated with capturing uncertainties in stochastic multiobjective reservoir control optimization, where parallel algorithmic search serves to reduce the wall-clock time in discovering high quality representations of key operational tradeoffs. Our results show that emerging self-adaptive parallelization schemes exploiting cooperative search populations are crucial. Such strategies provide a promising new set of tools for effectively balancing exploration, uncertainty, and computational demands when using EMODPS.","[Salazar, Jazmin Zatarain; Reed, Patrick M.; Quinn, Julianne D.] Cornell Univ, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Giuliani, Matteo; Castelletti, Andrea] Politecn Milan, Dept Elect Informat & Bioengn, Milan, Italy; [Castelletti, Andrea] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Environm Engn, Zurich, Switzerland",Cornell University; Polytechnic University of Milan; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Reed, PM (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",jz583@cornell.edu; pmr82@cornell.edu,"Castelletti, Andrea/AAG-7111-2020; Reed, Patrick M/E-4435-2014","Reed, Patrick M/0000-0002-7963-6102; Quinn, Julianne/0000-0001-7806-4416",National Science Foundation through the Network for Sustainable Climate Risk Management (SCRiM) under NSF cooperative agreement [GEO-1240507]; Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACYT) Fellowship [313591]; Directorate For Geosciences [1240507] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,National Science Foundation through the Network for Sustainable Climate Risk Management (SCRiM) under NSF cooperative agreement; Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACYT) Fellowship(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)); Directorate For Geosciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)),"Portions of this work were supported by the National Science Foundation through the Network for Sustainable Climate Risk Management (SCRiM) under NSF cooperative agreement GEO-1240507 as well as the Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACYT) Fellowship no. 313591.

An analysis of the wind speed ratio between two vertical levels observed at tall masts in the North Sea and The Netherlands demonstrates that over sea non-neutral conditions commonly occur, even when the 10m wind speed is 7 Bft or higher (at least 13.9 ms(-1)). Over land, stability conditions are always close to neutral for these strong wind conditions. This is because over land, large vertical temperature differences are rare in these conditions. An analysis of 30 years of station data shows that even in storm conditions the ratio of the 10m wind speed between sea and land depends systematically on the difference between the air temperature and the sea surface temperature. The observational results are reproduced by HARMONIE, a state-of-the-art Numerical Weather Prediction model, although the impact of stability is smaller than in the observations. A model sensitivity analysis for a severe storm shows that the near-surface wind speed over sea can vary by 10% depending on the difference between the air temperature and the sea surface temperature. The results presented in this study indicate that even in conditions that are usually classified as '(near) neutral', small variations in stability may have a significant impact on the wind profile. They also indicate that for high wind speeds, the sea-to-land wind speed ratio is dominated by the stability over sea as in these conditions the stability over land is close to neutral.

Utilising this opportunity, significant progress has been achieved in India in demonstrating the utility of satellite remote sensing data for various oceanographic research and applications during the last one decade. Among these, techniques have been developed for retrieval of various ocean parameters and processes such as ocean surface waves, winds, internal waves, sea surface temperature, chlorophyll pigments, oceanic eddies, heat budget, mixed layer depth and latent heat. With the encouraging results from these studies as well as for meeting the specific and increasing data requirements on an assured basis by oceanographers, concerted efforts are being made for developing and launching state-of-the-art indigenous satellites for ocean applications. The first in the series of ocean satellites planned for launch is Oceansat-1 (IRS-P4) by early 1999. It carries on-board two payloads viz. an Ocean Colour Monitor (OCM) and a Multi-frequency Scanning Microwave Radiometer (MSMR), which are designed to provide global data for various oceanographic and meteorological applications. Followed by this, a full fledged satellite for ocean applications known as Oceansat-2 (IRS-P7) is planned for launch during 2002. Oceansat-2 which is configured with payload mix of microwave (Scatterometer, Altimeter & Passive Microwave Radiometer), Thermal (TIR) and Optical(OCM) sensors, is expected to provide greater in-sight into the global understanding of ocean dynamics/resources through measurement of wide range of oceanographic parameters. For efficient utilisation of data from Oceansat-1 & preparedness for utilisation of Oceansat-2, a well-knit programmes aimed at demonstrations of end-to-end capability & their applications in thrust areas have been initiated. Important efforts initiated in this direction include SATellite Coastal and Oceanographic Research and Ocean Information Services, which are being carried out on an integrated basis with the objectives of providing ocean services to the down stream users.

More precisely, new species of insects that are introduced or already existing insect species whose population multiply uncontrollably into the forest area, affect tree growth, their survival, as well as the quality of forest biomass and constitute a serious threat to the mechanisms of such forest ecosystems. Thus, new concepts are needed that will overcome difficulties faced by existing remote sensing techniques and that would allow the timely and accurate health determination process of forest regions, assisting scientists and authorities to take action in order to protect the forests. In this paper, we propose a monitoring approach, which uses high resolution RGB aerial images and combines different Region Convolution Neural Networks (R-CNNs) architectures, namely Faster R-CNN and Mask R-CNN and fuses their bounding box outcomes in order to more accurately localize candidate infected trees' regions whilst increasing the number of the candidate trees that have been detected as infected. Subsequently, the candidate detected trees are modelled through the higher order linear dynamical systems (h-LDS) and descriptors are extracted for each candidate region. Finally, the h-LDS descriptors are classified using an SVM classifier for the estimation of the infected trees. The study area includes parts of the suburban pine forest of Thessaloniki city (Greece) named Seich Sou, which suffers the last months an infestation of high significance and intensity by a bark and wood destroying insect (Tomicus piniperda). Although this insect was recorded in the specific ecosystem many years ago, its population increased uncontrollably after the degradation of the ecosystem due to human intervention and lack of protection and management strategy. Experimental results, through their outperforming existing state-of-the-art algorithms, demonstrate high potential and perspectives of the proposed methodology of low cost and time consumed, to contribute to the sustainable management, protection and recovery of a forest ecosystem.","[Barmpoutis, Panagiotis; Stathaki, Tania] Imperial Coll London, Fac Engn, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, London, England; [Kamperidou, Vasiliki] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Fac Forestry & Nat Environm, Dept Harvesting & Technol Forest Prod, Thessaloniki, Greece",Imperial College London; Aristotle University of Thessaloniki,"Barmpoutis, P (corresponding author), Imperial Coll London, Fac Engn, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, London, England.",,,,,,,,26,4,4,3,12,SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING,BELLINGHAM,"1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010 USA",0277-786X,1996-756X,978-1-5106-3644-6,PROC SPIE,,,2020,,,,,,,UNSP 114333C,10.1117/12.2556378,http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.2556378,,,8,Optics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Optics,BP2JP,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000542922700120,View Full Record in Web of Science

The estimation of SULR plays an important role in the study of surface energy circulation and climate change. State-of-the-art methods to estimate SULR, including the physical method and the hybrid method, are conducted without considering directional thermal radiation (DTR), which may induce a large error in the estimation, particularly over sparsely vegetated surfaces. In this paper, we modified the physical temperature-emissivity algorithm by combining a directional emissivity model (FRA97) and a kernel-driven DTR model to estimate the SULR of vegetated surfaces while considering the thermal directionality of the land surface. The most suitable kernel-driven model and an angle combination of the DTR were selected from six kernel-driven models and five angular combinations. The sensitivity of the proposed algorithm to the input parameters was also analyzed. The proposed algorithm was then validated with the Wide-angle infrared Dual-mode line/area Array Scanner (WiDAS) data set and longwave radiation data of automatic meteorological stations from the Heihe Watershed Allied Telemetry Experimental Research experiment. The results showed that the five-angle combination with large-angle intervals performs the best. When the leaf area index (LAI) is less than 1.2, the RossThick-LiSparseR model performs the best; when LAI is larger than 1.2, the RossThick-LiDenseR model is the most accurate. The SULR is not sensitive to surface downward longwave radiation and LAI, is slightly sensitive to leaf and soil emissivity at certain LAIs, and is highly sensitive to DTR, which may greatly affect the accuracy of the estimated SULR. The root-mean-square error (RMSE) and the mean bias error (MBE) of the SULR estimated using the WiDAS data and the proposed algorithm are 5.618 and -1.642 W/m(2), respectively, thereby improving the estimation accuracy by as much as 7.479 and 10.511 W/m(2) at most in terms of RMSE and MBE, respectively, compared with the results calculated without considering the DTR.","[Hu, Tian; Du, Yongming; Cao, Biao; Li, Hua; Bian, Zunjian; Liu, Qinhuo] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Remote Sensing & Digital Earth, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Hu, Tian; Bian, Zunjian] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Resources & Environm, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Hu, Tian; Sun, Donglian] George Mason Univ, Dept Geog & Geoinformat Sci, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Liu, Qinhuo] JCGCS, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; The Institute of Remote Sensing & Digital Earth, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; George Mason University","Du, YM; Liu, QH (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Remote Sensing & Digital Earth, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.;Liu, QH (corresponding author), JCGCS, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",hutian@radi.ac.cn; duym@radi.ac.cn; gobscaobiao@163.com; lihua@radi.ac.cn; jiankegai@163.com; dsun@gmu.edu; liuqh@radi.ac.cn,"Li, Hua/S-3644-2018; LIU, Qinhuo/S-1647-2016; 曹, 彪/AFQ-0478-2022; Cao, Biao/L-8100-2019","LIU, Qinhuo/0000-0002-3713-9511; ","National Basic Research Program of China [2013CB733401]; Chinese Natural Science Foundation [41571359, 41501366, 41571357, 41571329]",National Basic Research Program of China(National Basic Research Program of China); Chinese Natural Science Foundation(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This work was supported in part by the National Basic Research Program of China under Grant 2013CB733401, by the Chinese Natural Science Foundation Project under Grant 41571359, and by the Chinese Natural Science Foundation Project under Grant 41501366, Grant 41571357, and Grant 41571329.

The GRACE monthly gravity field solutions, available from several analysis centres, reflect mass variations in the atmosphere, hydrosphere and geosphere. Due to correlated noise contained in these solutions, it is, however, first necessary to apply an appropriate filtering technique. The resulting, smoothed time series are applied not only to determine variations with different periodic signatures (e.g., seasonal, short and medium-term), but to derive long-periodic mass variations and secular trends as well. As the GRACE monthly solutions always show the integral effect of all mass variations, for separation of single processes, like the GIA (Glacial isostatic adjustment)-related mass increase in Fennoscandia, appropriate reduction models (e.g. from hydrology) are necessary. In this study we show for the example of the Fennoscandian uplift area that GRACE solutions from different analysis centres yield considerably different secular trends. Furthermore, it turns out that the inevitable filtering of the monthly gravity field models affects not only the amplitudes of the signals, but also their spatial resolution and distribution such as the spatial form of the detected signals. It also becomes evident that the determination of trends has to be performed together with the determination of periodic components. All periodic terms which are really contained in the data, and only such, have to be included. The restricted time span of the available GRACE measurements, however, limits the separation of long-periodic and secular signals. It is shown that varying the analysis time span affects the results considerably. Finally, a reduction of hydrological signals from the detected integral secular trends using global hydrological models (WGHM, LaDWorld, GLDAS) is attempted. The differences among the trends resulting from different models illustrate that the state-of-the-art hydrology models are not suitable for this purpose as yet. Consequently, taking the GRACE monthly gravity field solutions from one centre, choosing a single filter and applying an insufficiently reliable reduction model leads sometimes to a misinterpretation of considered geophysical processes. Therefore, one has to be cautious with the final interpretation of the results. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Biodegradable wastes generated across various sectors (agriculture, horticulture, animal husbandry, municipalities, sericulture, fisheries, and industries) are examined, many of which have not been considered previously for India's bioenergy potential assessments. The degree of replaceability of present-day unclean fuels and the net avoided greenhouse gas emissions from the utilisation of this biomethane are evaluated for three separate end use scenarios: electricity generation, cooking, and road transportation. The total biomethane generation potential is 125 billion cubic metres, after considering a gas leakage rate of 3%. The corresponding total heat and electrical energy generation potentials are 4.49 EJ and 748.59 TWh respectively; the breakdown of this for all the states and union territories of India is also calculated. Biomethane from wastes could have provided for either 47% of India's gross generated electricity or 91% of India's road transport fuel demand in the financial year of 2018-19. Less than 43% of this biomethane could supply the entirety of the country's cooking fuel demand. The corresponding avoided GHG emissions from the displacement of fossil fuels and the prevention of crop residue field burning and municipal waste dumping are between 284 and 461 million tonnes of carbon dioxide-equivalent, excluding the contribution from black carbon. The avoided particulate emissions from crop residue burning prevention is around 2 million tonnes. Thus, this paper makes a strong case for biomethane generation from wastes in India to appropriately address climate change impact, pollution, and waste disposal problems, and aims to inform and influence energy policy in the country, with additional considerations of the gap between the potential and the state-of-the-art, and the technical and socio-economic challenges of waste-to-energy schemes. In addition to the quantitative evaluations, this paper contains a comprehensive compilation of data on waste and biomethane generation potentials from experiments and surveys scattered across the literature; it is hoped that this will be a valuable resource for future research, energy assessments, and policy considerations.","[Dey, Akashdeep; Thomson, R.

With this approach, in this article, it is aimed to determine the effects of administrative periods on the built environment and so, to document the immovable cultural heritage. Design/Methodology/Approach The residential environment is the cultural values that carry the architectural codes of the local culture from the past to the present. In the formation of these values, cultural ve spatial policies of the administration together with universal developments such as architectural style, construction technologies and so on as well as geographical location, climate and lifestyle are determinant. In this spiral relationship, while the residential environment of the city of Lefke was examined by focusing on the city's own administration periods, cultural heritage values were questioned and documented. The basis of this approach is to define these values, the first stage of the heritage management system envisaged by the World Heritage Committee, with a values-led approach and thus obtain the statement of significance, that is, clues for management strategies. Findings The traditional and/or historical housing and its pattern have been included in three frameworks, typological, chronological-regional, and thematic determined for cultural heritage in 2000s. In all of these frameworks, the effects of time / space and the administration periods on social and spatial structure are emphasized. In this study, it is documented that the residential environment was shaped according to the administration periods and that its traditional housing and its pattern and some modernist buildings which convey the art deco architectural style are cultural heritage within these frames in the city of Lefke. Research Limitations The issues such as the sustainability or management process of cultural heritage values are externalities of this study. Social/Practical Implications This study should be helpful in defining the immovable cultural heritage according to current international policies, approaches and principles. Originality/Value The residential environment and traditional housing in the city of Lefke are described for the first time with this study.","[Gultekin, Nevin Turgut] Gazi Univ, Fac Architecture, Ankara, Turkey",Gazi University,"Gultekin, NT (corresponding author), Gazi Univ, Fac Architecture, Ankara, Turkey.",neving@gazi.edu.tr,,,,,,,27,0,0,3,5,"KONYA TECHNICAL UNIV, FAC ARCHITECTURE & DESIGN",KONYA,"YENI ISTANBUL CAD NO 235-1 SELCUKLU, KONYA, TURKEY",2147-9380,,,ICONARP INT J ARCHIT,ICONARP Int.

High-quality data, encompassing more than four decades, have successfully been used in a wide range of applications, including climate change studies. However, even though the ERA-40 data-set benefits from improvements in the assimilation procedures since the release of earlier reanalyses, ERA-40 exhibits unrealistic behaviour as regards some atmospheric quantities, including the water budget and the Brewer-Dobson Circulation. In addition, the results presented here show significant mass-budget inconsistencies. Over inter-annual timescales (greater than one year), the vertically-averaged meridional mass transport is unrealistic and cannot be explained on the basis of naturally occurring physical processes. This mass inconsistency also yields spurious signals in meridional fluxes of other atmospheric quantities, such as energy. The total atmospheric mass content, on the other hand, shows a realistic evolution on daily timescales during the satellite era, from about 1979 onwards. Through this period, the variability of the total mass on intra-annual timescales (less than one year) and annual timescales is consistent with differences between evaporation and precipitation. Here it is demonstrated that unrealistic mass fluxes are present in ERA-40 because of inherent properties of the data assimilation process. In assimilating model forecasts, between analysis time-steps, systematic and unrealistic changes of the local surface-pressure field in the assimilating model are encountered. These local mass changes are associated with mass fluxes. During the assimilation procedure, observations reset the surface-pressure field, whereas the mass fluxes are not adjusted properly. This is because surface-pressure observations are plentiful and accurate, in contrast to wind observations. Consequently, the analysed mass fluxes show a spurious development, even though the mass field itself is well captured. A correction method can be applied in order to eliminate the spurious fluxes. For trend calculations it is demonstrated that this method yields more realistic results than those obtained from the original ERA-40 data.

The Altar Machine was dated back to the second half of the 18th century; it is constituted by carved and painted wood, a complex system of winch and pulleys allows move various statues and parts of the Machine in accordance with the baroque scenography machineries. Results: The observation and survey of the mechanisms allowed formulate hypothesis on a more ancient mode of operation of the Altar Machine. Laboratory analysis revealed the presence of many superimposed layers constituted by several different materials (protein binders, siccative oils, natural terpene resins, shellac, calcium carbonate, gypsum, lead white, brass, zinc white, iron oxides) and different wood species employed for the original and restoration elements of the Machine. This is due to a continuous usage of the object that has got a demo-ethno-anthropological significance. Microclimate monitoring (relative humidity RH and temperature T) put in evidence that most of the data fall outside the tolerance intervals, i.e. the RH and T limits defined by the international standards. In particular, T values were generally high (out of the tolerance range) but they appeared to be quite constant; on the other hand RH values fell almost always inside the tolerance area but they often exhibited dangerous variations. Conclusions: The characterization of the constitutive materials provided useful information both to support the dating of the Machine proposed by the inscription and to obtain a base of data for a possible conservation work. The microclimate monitoring put in evidence that the temperature and relative humidity values are not always suitable to correctly preserve the artefact. The careful in situ investigation confirmed an on-going climate induced damage to the Altar Machine that, associated to the deterioration caused by its usage, may have dramatic consequences on this unique and peculiar work of art. The results of this work will have potential implications in the near future regarding a probable conservation project on the Machine.","[Marabelli, Maurizio; Pelosi, Claudia; Salvo, Michele] Univ Tuscia, Dept Cultural Heritage Sci, Viterbo, Italy; [Lo Monaco, Angela] Univ Tuscia, Dept Agr Forests Nat & Energy, Viterbo, Italy",Tuscia University; Tuscia University,"Pelosi, C (corresponding author), Univ Tuscia, Dept Cultural Heritage Sci, Viterbo, Italy.",pelosi@unitus.it,"Pelosi, Claudia/C-4923-2018; Monaco, Angela Lo/F-2914-2012","Pelosi, Claudia/0000-0002-1338-5267; Monaco, Angela Lo/0000-0001-6816-2899",University funds (RSA),University funds (RSA),"The authors wish to thank Don Gioacchino Duca for having allowed us to study the Church and the Altar Machine, and to consult the Parish Archive of the Church Mother; the Archpriest Don Giuseppe Vacca, President of the Holy Mary of the Assumption Committee.

CO2 emissions reduction is a central focus of climate change initiatives. Therefore, it is desired to have a power plant process cycle that reduces CO2 emissions associated with producing power Once captured CO2 must be transferred to a sequestration site for long term storage or utilized in EOR operations. Recent research has demonstrated that CO2 is most efficiently transported as a liquid at high pressures via pipelines. A Cryogenic Oxy-Fuel cycle will be presented that captures all CO2 produced during combustion and inherently converts that CO2 to a sequestration-ready state that can be immediately placed into transportation Pipelines and stored at the desired sequestration site. The proposed cycle deviates from conventional cycles in that during part of the process the CO2 is in cooled liquid form which allows; I) Decreased power demand to increase the CO2 pressure because pumping has lower power requirement than compression CO2) The take-off of the CO2 is optimized for pipeline transport and no further compression or expansion is required, and 3) A high overall thermodynamic cycle efficiency can be reached with relatively low firing temperatures in the oxy-burner (around 1000 F). This significantly simplifies the combustor and expander designs required for the process. Additional benefits of the cycle include predicted efficiencies near state of the art IGCC's, applicability to multiple fuel sources, and cost reduction associated with reduced component sizes utilized in the cycle. This presentation will focus on the overall operational and technological requirements of the novel cycle, a breakdown of the individual components utilized, and simulations demonstrating predicted performance. Technological challenges of implementing a working version of the cycle will be discussed and suggested development required for overcoming the challenges will be presented This paper will include recent research and development of an oxy-fuel combustor utilized in the cycle as well as implementation of compression and pumping apparatus of recent development.","[Gatewood, Jason; Moore, Jeff; Nored, Marybeth; Brun, Klaus; Iyengar, Vishwas] SW Res Inst, San Antonio, TX 78238 USA",Southwest Research Institute,"Gatewood, J (corresponding author), SW Res Inst, San Antonio, TX 78238 USA.",,,,,,,,2,1,1,0,0,AMER SOC MECHANICAL ENGINEERS,NEW YORK,"THREE PARK AVENUE, NEW YORK, NY 10016-5990 USA",,,978-0-7918-4471-7,,,,2012,,,,,1007,1014,,,,,,8,"Engineering, Mechanical; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Engineering; Materials Science; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering,BHC48,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000324956100102,View Full Record in Web of Science

Remote sensing and modeling are two main approaches to obtain SM over a large-scale area. However, there is a big difference between them due to algorithm, spatial-temporal resolution, observation depth and measurement uncertainties. In this study, an assessment of the comparison of two state-of-the-art remotely sensed SM products, Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) and European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative (ESACCI), and one land surface modeled dataset from the North American Land Data Assimilation System project phase 2 (NLDAS-2), were conducted using 17 permanent SM observation sites located in the Southern Great Plains (SGP) in the U.S. We first compared the daily mean SM of three products with in-situ measurements; then, we decompose the raw time series into a short-term seasonal part and anomaly by using a moving smooth window (35 days). In addition, we calculate the daily spatial difference between three products based on in-situ data and assess their temporal evolution. The results demonstrate that (1) in terms of temporal correlation R, the SMAP (R = 0.78) outperforms ESACCI (R = 0.62) and NLDAS-2 (R = 0.72) overall; (2) for the seasonal component, the correlation R of SMAP still outperforms the other two products, and the correlation R of ESACCI and NLDAS-2 have not improved like the SMAP; as for anomaly, there is no difference between the remotely sensed and modeling data, which implies the potential for the satellite products to capture the variations of short-term rainfall events; (3) the distribution pattern of spatial bias is different between the three products. For NLDAS-2, it is strongly dependent on precipitation; meanwhile, the spatial distribution of bias represents less correlation with the precipitation for two remotely sensed products, especially for the SMAP. Overall, the SMAP was superior to the other two products, especially when the SM was of low value.

The synthesis based on the principles of the molecular design and integrative chemistry which includes the innovative aerosol and hydro(solvo)thermal nanotechnology routes, the building block assembling and hybridization, represent intelligent platform for the creation of advanced functional materials. Due to exceptional optical properties and a diverse application in electronics, optoelectronics, energy conversion/storage and biomedicine, the examples from some wide band gap oxides for light harvesting and photocatalytic applications as well as both down and up-conversion energy-saving luminescent materials for photonic and biological applications are considered. With the help of various analyzing techniques like XRPD (X-ray powder diffraction), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), analytical and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM, HR-TEM), selected area electron diffraction (SAED), scanning tunneling electron microscopy (STEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and Raman spectroscopy, photocatalytic and fluorescence measurements, the opportunities of the aerosol and hydro(solvo)thermal routes for the synthesis of novel hierarchically and hybrid assembled structures and nanocomposites are reviewed highlighting the recent research activities realized in the Institute of Technical Sciences of SASA, Belgrade, Serbia and University Carlos III, Madrid, Spain. The morphological, structural and functional aspects of the following systems: ZnO, TiO2, Y2O3:Eu,Yb/Er/T/Hm, Y2O3:Eu@Ag, (Y1-xGdx)(2)O-3:Eu, (NaYF4:Yb/Er)@EDTA/PEG/PVP, are discussed from the state-of-the art and literature contexts. Controlled growth of 1D and 3D hierarchical structures based on the single-source processing methodology in combination with the homogeneous precipitation of optically active intermediate precursor are especially stressed for the case of yttria based phosphor particles and phase-dependent luminescence efficiency. The obtained results offer possible routes for the synthesis of hierarchically structured nanomaterials with tunable structure, morphology and optical properties.

MLH estimates are inferred from in situ radiosonde measurements or remote sensing observations from instruments like lidar, wind profiling radar, or sodar. Methods used to estimate MLH from radiosonde profiles are also used with atmospheric temperature and humidity profiles retrieved by microwave radiometers (MWR). This paper proposes an alternative approach to estimate MLH from MWR data, based on direct observations (brightness temperatures, Tb) instead of retrieved profiles. To our knowledge, MLH estimates directly from Tb observations have never been attempted before. The method consists of a multivariate linear regression trained with an a priori set of collocated MWR Tb observations (multifrequency and multi-angle) and MLH estimates from a state-of-the-art lidar system. The proposed method was applied to a 7-month data set collected at a typical midlatitude site. Results show that the method is able to follow both the diurnal cycle and the day-to-day variability as suggested by the lidar measurements, and also it can detect low MLH values that are below the full overlap limit (similar to 200 m) of the lidar system used. Statistics of the comparison between MWR-and reference lidar-based MLH retrievals show mean difference within 10 m, root mean square within 340 m, and correlation coefficient higher than 0.77. Monthly mean analysis for daytime MLH from MWR, lidar, and radiosonde shows consistent seasonal variability, peaking at similar to 1200-1400 m in June and decreasing down to similar to 600 m in October. Conversely, nighttime monthly mean MLH from all methods are within 300-500 m without any significant seasonal variability. The proposed method provides results that are more consistent with radiosonde estimates than MLH estimates from MWR-retrieved profiles. MLH monthly mean values agree well within 1 standard deviation with the bulk Richardson number method applied at radiosonde profiles at 11: 00 and 23: 00 UTC. The method described herewith operates continuously and is expected to work with analogous performances for the entire diurnal cycle, except during considerable precipitation, demonstrating new potential for atmospheric observation by ground-based microwave radiometry.","[Cimini, D.] IMAA CNR, Potenza, Italy; [Cimini, D.; De Angelis, F.] Univ Aquila, CETEMPS, I-67100 Laquila, Italy; [Dupont, J. -C.] Univ Versailles St Quentin, Inst Pierre Simon Laplace, Guyancourt, France; [Pal, S.] Ecole Polytech, CNRS, Lab Meteorol Dynam, F-91128 Palaiseau, France; [Pal, S.] Univ Virginia, Dept Environm Sci, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA; [Haeffelin, M.] Ecole Polytech, CNRS, Inst Pierre Simon Laplace, F-91128 Palaiseau, France",Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Metodologie per l'Analisi Ambientale (IMAA-CNR); University of L'Aquila; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut Polytechnique de Paris; UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; University of Virginia; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut Polytechnique de Paris; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Cite; Universite Paris Saclay,"Cimini, D (corresponding author), IMAA CNR, Potenza, Italy.",domenico.cimini@imaa.cnr.it,"Cimini, Domenico/AAH-3530-2019; Pal, Sandip/I-7207-2012; Cimini, Domenico/M-8707-2013","Pal, Sandip/0000-0001-9497-9990; Cimini, Domenico/0000-0002-5962-223X",,,,,37,48,50,3,12,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1867-1381,1867-8548,,ATMOS MEAS TECH,Atmos.

When using vegetation cover as an additional variable for nearly-natural and human influenced environments, the vegetation cover increases R(2) from 0.62 to 0.74. The degree of slope controls between 25 and 30% of topsoil characteristics. The results of model simulations were confirmed during natural heavy rainfalls on different field plots. Because simulated rainfalls were based on recorded intensities and durations, results compared with historic records and estimations imply also that specific intensity of between 25 and 100 mm/h and duration of between 1 and 6 hours art: not so important, relative to geomorphic-environmental impact, in flash flood generation in a Mediterranean climate area like the Roussillon area (SE-France). On 26 September 1992 the rainfall intensity of a four-hour heavy rainfall event was to a large extent influenced by the topography of the catchment of River Reart/Canterrane (Roussillon, SE-France), increasing with altitude. As an example of the model application: the flash flood of 26/27 September 1991 was simulated. The peak flash-flood flow at the river mouth of River Reart/Canterrane was 1100 m(3)/s or 7 (m(3)/km(2))/s. Runoff conditions for the natural or nearly natural catchment would have accounted for 43.6% of this, agricultural impact fur 9.1% and building areas and construction sites for 5.5%. A further 41.8% was accounted for by the effects of breaching of stored floodwater. In absence of breaching of stored floodwater, the nearly-natural part of the peak flash-flood flow would have been about 480 m(3)/s (75 degrees C) and the part caused by human influence about 160 m(3)/s (25%).",,,"Schmittner, KE (corresponding author), UNIV PERPIGNAN,LAB RECH SEDIMENTOL & GEOCHIM MARINES,CNRS URA 715,52 AVE VILLENEUVE,F-66860 PERPIGNAN,FRANCE.",,,,,,,,27,12,13,1,8,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0169-555X,,,GEOMORPHOLOGY,Geomorphology,AUG,1996,4,,,,337,347,,10.1016/0169-555X(96)00002-5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0169-555X(96)00002-5,,,11,"Geography, Physical; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Physical Geography; Geology,UZ870,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:A1996UZ87000004,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the number of reports remains small and the quality of published records is highly variable. Here, we extend the literature on comparative thanatology with observations on a population of the northern muriqui (Brachyteles hypoxanthus). We compiled all seven cases of muriqui responses to dead, dying, or abandoned infants observed by trained researchers of the Muriqui Project of Caratinga between 1998 and 2020. Four different adult females were observed carrying their dead offspring (n = 4) and one of these females was also observed carrying her dead grand-offspring (n = 1). Five of the seven cases involved dead newborns, one involved a newborn abandoned by its mother on the forest floor, and one involved a 1.6-year-old infant that was visibly ill and died after its mother left it on the ground. Dead newborns were carried for 1-3 days, and all cases occurred during the dry season months. No other age-sex classes were observed to interact with the dead or dying immatures. Our observations are consistent with hypotheses concerning the predominance of dead-infant carrying in other primates, and with the effects of climate on rates of corpse disintegration. They also show the value of long-term studies for obtaining and understanding anecdotal records of rare behavior.","[Freire Filho, Roberio] Univ Fed Pernambuco, Programa Posgrad Biol Anim, Ctr Biociencias, Dept Zool, Ave Prof Moraes Rego 1235,Cidade Univ, BR-50670420 Recife, PE, Brazil; [Inforzato, Igor] Soc Zool Antuerpia, Ctr Pesquisa & Conservacao, Projeto BioBrasil, Antuerpia, Belgium; [Inforzato, Igor] Bicho Mato Inst Pesquisa, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil; [Tabacow, Fernanda P.; Possamai, Carla B.; Nery, Marcello S.; Almeida, Leticia] Muriqui Inst Biodiversidade MIB, Rua Euclydes Etienne Arreguy Filho, BR-35300372 Ctr Caratinga, MG, Brazil; [Martins, Waldney] Univ Estadual Montes Claros, Ctr Ciencias Biol & Saude, Dept Biol Geral, BR-39401089 Montes Claros, MG, Brazil; [Martins, Waldney] Univ Estadual Montes Claros, Ctr Ciencias Biol & Saude, Programa Posgrad Biodiversidade & Uso Recurs, BR-39401089 Montes Claros, MG, Brazil; [Ferraz, Daniel] Rede Ecodiversa Conservacao Biodiversidade, Rua Glicerio Dias Soares 76, BR-36844000 Niteroi, MG, Brazil; [Hack, Robson O.

The accuracy of these datasets can be validated against reliable standards in some areas, but other areas remain inaccessible. To date, limited reference data over oceans hinder successful uncertainty quantification or bias correction efforts and preclude reliable conclusions about changes in the carbon cycle in some regions. Here, we propose a new approach to analyze and evaluate seasonal, interannual, and latitudinal variations of XCO2 over oceans by integrating cargo-ship (Ship Of Opportunity - SOOP) and commercial aircraft (Comprehensive Observation Network for Trace gases by Airliner CONTRAIL) observations with the aid of state-of-the art atmospheric chemistry-transport model calculations. The consistency of the observation-based column-averaged CO2 dataset (obs. XCO2) with satellite estimates was analyzed over the western Pacific between 2014 and 2017, and its utility as a reference dataset evaluated. Our results demonstrate that the new dataset accurately captures seasonal and interannual variations of CO2. Retrievals of XCO2 over the ocean from GOSAT (Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite: National Institute for Environmental Studies - NIES v02.75; Atmospheric CO2 Observation from Space - ACOS v7.3) and OCO-2 (Orbiting Carbon Observatory, v9r) observations show a negative bias of about 1 part per million (ppm) in northern midlatitudes, which was attributed to measurement uncertainties of the satellite observations. The NIES retrieval had higher consistency with obs. XCO2 at midlatitudes as compared to the other retrievals. At low latitudes, it shows many fewer valid data and high scatter, such that ACOS and OCO-2 appear to provide a better representation of the carbon cycle. At different times, the seasonal cycles of all three retrievals show positive phase shifts of 1 month relative to the observation-based data. The study indicates that even if the retrievals complement each other, remaining uncertainties limit the accurate interpretation of spatiotemporal changes in CO2 fluxes. A continuous long-term XCO2 dataset with wide latitudinal coverage based on the new approach has great potential as a robust reference dataset for XCO2 and can help to better understand changes in the carbon cycle in response to climate change using satellite observations.","[Muller, Astrid; Tanimoto, Hiroshi; Sugita, Takafumi; Machida, Toshinobu; Nakaoka, Shin-ichiro] Natl Inst Environm Studies, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Patra, Prabir K.] Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan; [Laughner, Joshua] CALTECH, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Crisp, David] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA USA",National Institute for Environmental Studies - Japan; Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science & Technology (JAMSTEC); California Institute of Technology; California Institute of Technology; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL),"Muller, A; Tanimoto, H (corresponding author), Natl Inst Environm Studies, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.",mueller.astrid@nies.go.jp; tanimoto@nies.go.jp,"Patra, Prabir/B-5206-2009; OCO, OCO/GVS-4314-2022; Sugita, Takafumi/H-6669-2018; Tanimoto, Hiroshi/E-6779-2010; Shin-ichiro, Nakaoka/I-7222-2018","Patra, Prabir/0000-0001-5700-9389; Sugita, Takafumi/0000-0002-0508-7040; Tanimoto, Hiroshi/0000-0002-5424-9923; Shin-ichiro, Nakaoka/0000-0002-3870-1721","Global Environmental Research Coordination System from the Ministry of the Environment (Japan) [E1851, E1253, E1652, E1151, E1951, E1451, E1751, E1432]; Environmental Research and Technology Development Fund (ERTDF) from the Ministry of the Environment (Japan) [2-1803, JPMEERF20182003]",Global Environmental Research Coordination System from the Ministry of the Environment (Japan); Environmental Research and Technology Development Fund (ERTDF) from the Ministry of the Environment (Japan),"This research has been supported by the Global Environmental Research Coordination System from the Ministry of the Environment (Japan) (grant nos.

The need for such an approach is exemplified here based on the fire-prone eucalypt forests in south-east Australia. Wildfire effects on vegetation, fauna, soil erodibility and erosion in this environment are evaluated and placed in the context of the global state-of-the-art for forest environments. In addition to expected variation resulting from, for example, geology, topography and climate of the area, it is argued that a distinctive post-fire behaviour is caused in these eucalypt forests by the interaction between specific characteristics of the vegetation, litter, soil properties, faunal activity and micro-scale surface features. Soil erosion limited only by post-fire rainfall intensity and quantity, or until bedrock is exposed, might be expected after wildfire on steep slopes in these forests given the non-cohesive character of the often sandy soils and their universally water repellent character. That this scenario is not realised, except possibly under extreme rainfall conditions, which rarely occur during the vulnerable post-fire period, can be attributed to a unique suite of features that disrupt or provide sinks for overland flow, bind the loose in situ soil and trap mobilised sediment. These include mats of fine roots, litter dam-microterrace complexes and faunal activity by small mammals and ants. In combination, these characteristics reduce post-fire hillslope-channel sediment transfer, at least under light to moderate intensity rainfall typical of post-fire periods following recent wildfires. Evidence is discussed suggesting that the long-term geomorphological role of wildfires in south-east Australia may be of relatively minor importance and confined largely to enhanced weathering of exposed outcrops and redistribution of soil across existing erosional and depositional landforms. The soil fertility and downstream water quality implications of widespread transfer of topsoil to watercourses resulting from frequent, often severe wildfires are nevertheless significant.

Effectiveness of an ET cover depends on site-specific factors such as climate, soil hydraulic properties, and vegetation. The variation of the degree of saturation (S) and matric suction (Psi) of soil due to the fluctuation in the environmental parameters, mostly precipitation and temperature may affect the performance of an ET cover. The objective of the current research is to inspect the S and Psi variation of a test section ET cover soil under actual climatic condition and simulate these results through numerical modeling. Test section ET cover (lysimeter), having dimension of 12 m x 12 m x 1.2 m (40 ft x 40 ft x 4 ft), constructed at the City of Denton landfill, Texas was selected for this study. Moisture content and matric suction were measured by sensors, installed in the lysimeter at different depths. Local fine-grained soil was used during the construction of the lysimeter. Soil water characteristic curve (SWCC) of the lysimeter soil was determined in the laboratory. Finite-Element (FE) model PLAXIS 2D was used to numerically simulate the water movement through unsaturated soil cover. Based on the input soil and climatic parameters, the change in the Psi and S was investigated in the model and compared with the field instrumentation data. The generated model could reproduce the relative fluctuation of Psi and S with the varying precipitation input. The average variation in Psi and S was found to be 24% and 6.71%, respectively, in the shallower depth (0.3 m), while the variation was found 28% and 22% for the deeper depth (0.76 m). The study revealed that FE modeling can provide a practical indication of soil hydraulic behavior of ET cover systems on a broader scale.","[Bin Alam, Md Jobair] Prairie View A&M Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Prairie View, TX 77446 USA; [Bhandari, Prabesh] Geosyntec Consultants Inc, Cincinnati, OH USA; [Hossain, Md Sahadat] Univ Texas Arlington, Dept Civil Engn, Arlington, TX 76019 USA",Texas A&M University System; Prairie View A&M University; University of Texas System; University of Texas Arlington,"Bin Alam, MJ (corresponding author), Prairie View A&M Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Prairie View, TX 77446 USA.",mdalam@pvamu.edu; pbhandari@geosyntec.com; hossain@uta.edu,"Bhandari, Prabesh/GMW-9836-2022","Bhandari, Prabesh/0000-0002-7696-4717",,,,,20,0,0,0,0,AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,NEW YORK,"UNITED ENGINEERING CENTER, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017-2398 USA",0895-0563,,978-0-7844-8403-6,GEOTECH SP,,,2022,,,,,1,11,,,,,,11,"Engineering, Civil; Engineering, Geological",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Engineering,BS8RF,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000775850000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Timber assortments are defined as log sections of specific dimensions (log length and maximum/minimum end diameters), gathered from felled trunks, that have both specific commercial timber utilisation and economic value. However, it is challenging to discriminate and assess timber assortment types, especially within a forest stand before the forest has been harvested. Accurate estimations of timber assortments are a fundamental prerequisite in supporting forest holdings and assisting practitioners in the optimisation of harvesting activities and promoting forest wood chains, in addition to forest policy and planning. Based on the georeferenced points cloud tool, light detection and ranging (LiDAR) is a powerful technology for rapidly and accurately depicting forest structure, even if the use of LiDAR for timber assortments estimation is lacking and poorly explored. This systematic literature review aimed to highlight the state-of-the-art applications of the LiDAR systems (spaceborne; airborne, including unmanned aerial UASs; and terrestrial) to quantify and classify different timber assortment types. A total of 304 peer-reviewed papers were examined. The results highlight a constant increment of published articles using LiDAR systems for forest-related aspects in the period between 2000 and 2021. The most recurring investigation topics in LiDAR studies were forest inventory and forest productivity. No studies were found that used spaceborne LiDAR systems for timber assortment assessments, as these were conditioned by the time and sample size (sample size = similar to 12 m/similar to 25 m of laser footprint and 0.7 m/60 m of space along the track for ICESat-2, GEDI and time = since 2018). Terrestrial LiDAR systems demonstrated a higher performance in successfully characterising the trees belonging to an understory layer. Combining airborne/UAS systems with terrestrial LiDAR systems is a promising approach to obtain detailed data concerning the timber assortments of large forest covers. Overall, our results reveal that the interest of scientists in using machine and deep learning algorithms for LiDAR processes is steadily increasing.","[Alvites, Cesar; Marchetti, Marco; Lasserre, Bruno] Univ Molise, Dipartimento Biosci & Terr, Cda Fonte Lappone Snc, I-86090 Pesche, Italy; [Santopuoli, Giovanni] Univ Molise, Dipartimento Agr Ambiente & Alimenti, Via De Sanctis 1, I-86100 Campobasso, Italy",University of Molise; University of Molise,"Santopuoli, G (corresponding author), Univ Molise, Dipartimento Agr Ambiente & Alimenti, Via De Sanctis 1, I-86100 Campobasso, Italy.",giovanni.santopuoli@unimol.it,"; Lasserre, Bruno/G-1409-2011; Marchetti, Marco/D-9277-2012","Alvites Diaz, Cesar Ivan/0000-0003-2956-6211; Lasserre, Bruno/0000-0003-1150-8064; Marchetti, Marco/0000-0002-5275-5769; Santopuoli, Giovanni/0000-0002-5373-5970",,,,,104,0,0,10,10,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2072-4292,,REMOTE SENS-BASEL,Remote Sens.,SEP,2022,18,,,,,,4466,10.3390/rs14184466,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs14184466,,,23,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,4S7DB,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000857595800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, many of these studies demonstrate conflicting or ambiguous results, so although the huge number of used tyres promises good availability for TPO, its role as fuel for transport applications is still uncertain. This review's goal is to clarify the case for TPO as transport fuel by means of a critical, wide-ranging and updated review of TPO's engine applications. The work gathers, collates and analyses the results of over 200 influential original research papers, aiming to answer the governing research questions related to TPO production and quality, post-processing and quality improvement and its final end-use engine validation. The work re-evaluates the environmental aspects of TPO technology, setting it against the latest backdrop of growing climate change concern and the urgency to find alternative fuels. The hard economics of TPO are also addressed, for example, assessing other end-of-life tyre management routes and competing fuel alternatives. The critical discussion on the key issues, including the most relevant drivers and boundaries, points towards TPO's use as a fuel component in marine, off-road and heavy-duty road applications. The results indicate that state-of-the-art production methods yield fuel that could be used directly in bunkering chains for marine transport as low-sulphur fuel oil. Discussion reveals that automotive applications are limited to blends not exceeding 10% tyre pyrolytic oil: sulphur and polyaromatic hydrocarbons contents and particulate emissions are the main constraints. Pyrolysis process efficiency is high and feedstock for TPO is both available and flexible. Waste tyre-derived pyrolytic oils could function as a supplementary solution to biofuels, blended to take advantage of their complementary properties. The particular added value of this review is that it bridges the latest knowledge from several domains related to TPO fuel: industrial management, process chemistry, fuel science and combustion/engine research. The resultant analysis is expressed in terms that are accessible to all those domains. It underlines how studies from an individual domain perspective fail to produce the holistic view. The review creates a route towards modern multidisciplinary research supporting TPO's role in global transition to circular economy. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

To date, this is the most observationally favourable system of potentially habitable planets known to exist. Since the announcement of the discovery of the TRAPPIST-1 planetary system in 2016, a growing number of techniques and approaches have been used and proposed to characterize its true nature. Here we have compiled a state-of-the-art overview of all the observational and theoretical constraints that have been obtained so far using these techniques and approaches. The goal is to get a better understanding of whether or not TRAPPIST-1 planets can have atmospheres, and if so, what they are made of. For this, we surveyed the literature on TRAPPIST-1 about topics as broad as irradiation environment, planet formation and migration, orbital stability, effects of tides and Transit Timing Variations, transit observations, stellar contamination, density measurements, and numerical climate and escape models. Each of these topics adds a brick to our understanding of the likely-or on the contrary unlikely-atmospheres of the seven known planets of the system. We show that (i) Hubble Space Telescope transit observations, (ii) bulk density measurements comparison with H-2-rich planets mass-radius relationships, (iii) atmospheric escape modelling, and (iv) gas accretion modelling altogether offer solid evidence against the presence of hydrogen-dominated-cloud-free and cloudy-atmospheres around TRAPPIST-1 planets. This means that the planets are likely to have either (i) a high molecular weight atmosphere or (ii) no atmosphere at all. There are several key challenges ahead to characterize the bulk composition(s) of the atmospheres (if present) of TRAPPIST-1 planets. The main one so far is characterizing and correcting for the effects of stellar contamination. Fortunately, a new wave of observations with the James Webb Space Telescope and near-infrared high-resolution ground-based spectrographs on existing very large and forthcoming extremely large telescopes will bring significant advances in the coming decade.","[Turbet, Martin; Bolmont, Emeline; Bourrier, Vincent] Univ Geneva, Observ Astron, 51 Chemin Pegase, CH-1290 Sauverny, Switzerland; [Demory, Brice-Olivier] Univ Bern, Ctr Space & Habitabil, Gesellschaftsstr 6, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Leconte, Jeremy] Univ Bordeaux, Lab Astrophys Bordeaux, CNRS, B18N,Allee Geoffroy St Hilaire, F-33615 Pessac, France; [Owen, James] Imperial Coll London, Dept Phys, Astrophys Grp, Prince Consort Rd, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Wolf, Eric T.] Univ Colorado, Lab Atmospher & Space Phys, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",University of Geneva; University of Bern; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite de Bordeaux; Imperial College London; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Turbet, M (corresponding author), Univ Geneva, Observ Astron, 51 Chemin Pegase, CH-1290 Sauverny, Switzerland.",,"Demory, Brice-Olivier/ABG-1063-2020","Demory, Brice-Olivier/0000-0002-9355-5165; Turbet, Martin/0000-0003-2260-9856; Bolmont, Emeline/0000-0001-5657-4503","University of Geneva; European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Grant [832738/ESCAPE]; European Research Council (ERC) [679030/WHIPLASH, 724427/FOUR ACES]; Gruber Foundation; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF); International Space Science Institute (ISSI); STFC [ST/P006892/1, ST/S006176/1] Funding Source: UKRI",University of Geneva; European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Grant; European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)European Commission); Gruber Foundation; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); International Space Science Institute (ISSI); STFC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Science & Technology Facilities Council (STFC)),"Open access funding provided by University of Geneva.

In the past two decades, a new concept called connectivity has been used by Earth Scientists as a means to describe and quantify the influences on the fluxes of water and sediment on different scales: aggregate, pedon, location on the slope, slope, watershed, and basin. A better understanding of connectivity can enhance our comprehension of landscape processes and provide a basis for the development of better measurement and modelling approaches, further leading to a better potential for implementing this concept as a management tool. This paper provides a short review of the State-of-the-Art of the connectivity concept, from which we conclude that scientists have been struggling to find a way to quantify connectivity so far. We adapt the knowledge of connectivity to better understand and quantify water and sediment transfers in catchment systems. First, we introduce a new approach to the concept of connectivity to study water and sediment transfers and the associated substances. In this approach water and sediment dynamics are divided in two parts: the systemc onsists of phases and fluxes, each being separately measurable. This approach enables us to: i) better conceptualize our understanding of system dynamics at different timescales, including long timescales; ii) identify the main parameters driving system dynamics, and devise monitoring strategies which capture them; and, iii) build models with a holistic approach to simulate system dynamics without excessive complexity. Secondly, we discuss the role of system boundaries in designing measurement schemes and models. Natural systems have boundaries within which sediment connectivity varies between phases; in (semi-) arid regions these boundaries can be far apart in time due to extreme events. External disturbances (eg. climate change, changed landmanagement) can change these boundaries. It is therefore important to consider the system state as a whole, including its boundaries and internal dynamics, when designing and implementing comprehensive monitoring and modelling approaches. Connectivity is a useful tool concept for scientists that must be expanded to stakeholder and policymakers. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

One of the strengths of the CO2 forecasting system is that the land surface, including vegetation CO2 fluxes, is modelled online within the IFS. Other CO2 fluxes are prescribed from inventories and from off-line statistical and physical models. The CO2 forecast also benefits from the transport modelling from a state-of-the-art numerical weather prediction (NWP) system initialized daily with a wealth of meteorological observations. This paper describes the capability of the forecast in modelling the variability of CO2 on different temporal and spatial scales compared to observations. The modulation of the amplitude of the CO2 diurnal cycle by near-surface winds and boundary layer height is generally well represented in the forecast. The CO2 forecast also has high skill in simulating day-today synoptic variability. In the atmospheric boundary layer, this skill is significantly enhanced by modelling the day-today variability of the CO2 fluxes from vegetation compared to using equivalent monthly mean fluxes with a diurnal cycle. However, biases in the modelled CO2 fluxes also lead to accumulating errors in the CO2 forecast. These biases vary with season with an underestimation of the amplitude of the seasonal cycle both for the CO2 fluxes compared to total optimized fluxes and the atmospheric CO2 compared to observations. The largest biases in the atmospheric CO2 forecast are found in spring, corresponding to the onset of the growing season in the Northern Hemisphere. In the future, the forecast will be re-initialized regularly with atmospheric CO2 analyses based on the assimilation of CO2 products retrieved from satellite measurements and CO2 in situ observations, as they become available in near-real time. In this way, the accumulation of errors in the atmospheric CO2 forecast will be reduced. Improvements in the CO2 forecast are also expected with the continuous developments in the operational IFS.","[Agusti-Panareda, A.; Massart, S.; Boussetta, S.; Balsamo, G.; Beljaars, A.; Engelen, R.; Jones, L.; Peuch, V. -H.] European Ctr Medium Range Weather Forecasts, Reading RG2 9AX, Berks, England; [Chevallier, F.; Ciais, P.; Paris, J. -D.; Sherlock, V.] UVSQ, CNRS, CEA, Lab Sci Climat & Environm,IPSL, Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Deutscher, N.

Studies on large strain flow curve identification can be divided in three main categories. The first class of experiment sgenerate statically determinate stress states which unambiguously correlate analytically to the external load and measured strains, hence enable a direct measurement of the large strain flow curve. The second category relies on the intermittently measured flow stress using pre-strained samples to construct the large strain flow curve. The third category consists of methods that minimize the discrepancy between the experimentally acquired and the numerically computed measurand to inversely identify a chosen hardening law representing the large strain flow curve. The paper presents an overview of the state-of-the-art methods to acquire the large strain flow curve of sheet metal.

The project proposes an expedited aboveground decomposition process (Natural Organic Reduction) to convert human tissue and bone into nutrient-rich soil-like materials. Following decomposition, human remains merge with non-human ecologies over time to offer mourners an extended period of ceremony and remembrance. Transference of energy and matter to adjacent non-human life is emphasized in the transition, and a memorial's embodiment in physical space is expanded to include natural systems and ecological productivity. The funerary landscape is thus decentralized from a static site of memorial to an evolving memorial system that invites engagement with the living. In an age of pandemic, mass extinction, and deepening climate crises, a commitment to an environmentally ethical funeral practice connects the loss of the individual to global patterns of ecological ruin and environmental decline. These layered scales of grief are experienced at divergent timescales, suggesting the need for a new typology of memorial landscape that positions the human life within larger natural cycles of birth, death, decay, and metamorphosis. Rituals of commemoration, management, and activism would be alchemized to unexpected outcomes when the program of memorial, ecological preserve, and a theater for collective actions are merged. Dark Matter proposes a network of biodiverse public landscapes where bodily death events meaningfully contribute to ecological systems of propulsive regenerative life.","[Whitaker, John] Washington Univ, Sam Fox Sch Design & Visual Art, St Louis, MO 63110 USA",Washington University (WUSTL),"Whitaker, J (corresponding author), 6926 Hancock Ave, St Louis, MO 63139 USA.",john@whitakerdesign.co,,,,,,,16,0,0,1,6,HIGHER EDUCATION PRESS,BEIJING,"CHAOYANG DIST, 4, HUIXINDONGJIE, FUSHENG BLDG, BEIJING 100029, PEOPLES R CHINA",2096-336X,2095-5413,,LANDSC ARCHIT FRONT,Landsc.

However, in order to maintain this position and respond to new challenges and/or priorities, it is necessary to further develop innovative concepts that use safe process engineering technology in terms of climate and resource protection as well as reduction of environmental impacts. MARTIN, in collaboration with research institutes, successfully developed and optimized a multi-stage combustion process in the 1990s. Various pilot and fullscale studies and tests followed. Based on this knowledge, MARTIN and its cooperation partners COVANTA ENERGY (USA), CNINA (F) and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (JP) developed the Very Low NOx (VLN) process as a large-scale primary measure for NOx reduction. MARTIN's next step was to develop the Very Low NOx gasification mode (VLN-GM) process. This process has been implemented directly in continuous operation at an industrial-scale Energy-from-Waste (EfW) plant in Switzerland. In VLN-GM operation, the excess air rate in the gas above the grate is decreased from lambda = 1.2 to about 0.8. The characteristics of municipal solid waste make it suitable for the generation of heat and power. While boiler concepts implemented in the past often focused on factors such as high availability, reduced downtimes and minimized maintenance costs, measures to increase the efficiency of the overall process are also growing in importance. Energy efficiency can be increased by optimizing boiler efficiency itself on the one hand, and on the other hand by improving peripheral plant devices, in particular by improving energy recovery through changes in the steam parameters. MARTIN has developed corrosion-protected wall and radiant superheater solutions, located in the upper furnace area, and installed these as prototypes in full-scale plants. As a result, steam can be heated about 35 degrees C (90 degrees F) in excess of the current state-of-the-art parameters without adversely affecting plant operation due to superheater corrosion. This paper documents that innovative concepts using MARTIN technology successfully provide solutions for a grate-based conversion technology (VLN-GM) as well as measures for increasing the energy efficiency of Energy-from-Waste plants.","MARTIN GmbH Umwelt & Energietech, D-80807 Munich, Germany",,"Koralewska, R (corresponding author), MARTIN GmbH Umwelt & Energietech, Leopoldstr 248, D-80807 Munich, Germany.",Ralf.Koralewska@martingmbh.de,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,0,AMER SOC MECHANICAL ENGINEERS,NEW YORK,"THREE PARK AVENUE, NEW YORK, NY 10016-5990 USA",,,978-0-7918-5544-7,,,,2013,,,,,,,UNSP V001T03A003,,,,,5,"Energy & Fuels; Engineering, Environmental; Engineering, Mechanical",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Energy & Fuels; Engineering,BA3XM,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000335079500007,View Full Record in Web of Science

At a farm scale, farmer's have a particularly strong incentive to optimize their irrigation water use when the volume of water available over a season is production limiting. In this situation, a farmer's goal is to maximize farm profit, by adjusting when and where irrigation water is used. However, making the very best decisions about when and where to irrigate is not easy, since these daily decisions require consideration of the entire remaining irrigation season. Future rainfall uncertainty further complicates decisions on when and which crops should be subjected to water stress. This paper presents an innovative on-farm irrigation scheduling decision support method called the Canterbury irrigation scheduler (CIS) that is suitable when seasonal water availability is limited. Previous optimal scheduling methods generally use stochastic dynamic programming, which requires over-simplistic plant models, limiting their practical usefulness. The CIS method improves on previous methods because it accommodates realistic plant models. Future farm profit (the objective function) is calculated using a time-series simulation model of the farm. Different irrigation management strategies are tested using the farm simulation model. The irrigation strategies are defined by a set of decision variables, and the decision variables are optimized using simulated annealing. The result of this optimization is an irrigation strategy that maximizes the expected future farm profit. This process is repeated several times during the irrigation season using the CIS method, and the optimal irrigation strategy is modified and improved using updated climate and soil moisture information. The ability of the CIS method to produce near optimal decisions was demonstrated by a comparison to previous stochastic dynamic programming schedulers. A second case study shows the CIS method can incorporate more realistic farm models than is possible when using stochastic dynamic programming. This case study used the FarmWi$e/APSIM model developed by CSIRO, Australia. Results show that when seasonal water limit is the primary constraint on water availability, the CIS could increase pasture yield revenue in Canterbury (New Zealand) in the order of 10%, compared with scheduling irrigation using current state of the art scheduling practice.

Post-fire management of burned areas has been given much lesser attention than combating or preventing fires. However, important questions raise public concern and call for sound scientific knowledge to undertake appropriate post-fire actions: e. g., how to evaluate fire damages in economical terms? How to manage burned areas? Is it possible to establish, in the long-term, less flammable and more fire resilient forests and landscapes? To address these questions, a network of researchers and practitioners working in the field of fire ecology and forest management from all around Europe has been established in the frame of COST Action FP0701-Post-Fire Forest Management in Southern Europe, supported by the European Union Research and Technology Development Framework Program. The Action aims to: i) develop and disseminate scientifically based decision criteria for planning post-fire forest management, from the stand to the landscape level; ii) translate this scientific knowledge into management practices; iii) connect scientists and stakeholders for exchanging experiences, evaluating these practices, and putting them into practice. To achieve these objectives the scientific groups involved will a) review and summarize the current scientific knowledge on post-fire management in Europe, by gathering and evaluating the results of previous and ongoing research; b) translate this knowledge into technical recommendations, by producing thematic reports, a book on the state-of-the-art of scientific knowledge on post fire assessment, and an electronic handbook on post-fire restoration; c) disseminate this knowledge to stakeholders, practitioners and decision makers. Besides publications and a project website already active (http://uaeco.biol.uoa.gr/cost/), training schools and one major conference will be organized. Although focused on Southern Europe, the outcomes of this Action will be crucial for central and northern European countries as well, as climate change and land use changes often leading to more homogeneous and expanding forest areas are already increasing fire hazard in those regions.","[Barbati, A.; Corona, P.] Univ Tuscia, Dip Sci Ambiente Forestale & Risorse, I-01100 Viterbo, Italy; [Arianoutsou, M.] Univ Athens, Fac Biol, Terr Ecol Grp, Athens 15784, Greece; [De Las Heras, J.] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Escuela Tecn Super Ingn Agron, Albacete 02071, Spain; [Fernandes, P.] UTAD, Dep Florestal, P-5001801 Vila Real, Portugal; [Fernandes, P.] UTAD, Ctr Invest & Tecnol Agroambientais & Biol, P-5001801 Vila Real, Portugal; [Moreira, F.] Univ Tecn Lisboa, Inst Agron, Ctr Appl Ecol, P-1349017 Lisbon, Portugal; [Papageorgiou, K.] Forest Fire Protect Off, Dep Forests, CY-1414 Nicosia, Cyprus; [Vallejo, R.] Fdn CEAM, Paterna 46980, Spain; [Xanthopoulos, G.] Natl Agr Res Fdn, Inst Mediterranean Forest Ecosyst & Forest Prod T, Athens 11528, Greece",Tuscia University; National & Kapodistrian University of Athens; Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha; University of Tras-os-Montes & Alto Douro; University of Tras-os-Montes & Alto Douro; Universidade de Lisboa,"Barbati, A (corresponding author), Univ Tuscia, Dip Sci Ambiente Forestale & Risorse, I-01100 Viterbo, Italy.",barbati.sisfor@unitus.it,"De las Heras, Jorge/I-1033-2015; BARBATI, ANNA/E-5731-2015; Vallejo, V.

The focus of the study is on the life cycle design of a district energy system for a new residential development in Finland. This study analyses LCC (life cycle costs) and carbon emissions (LCA (life cycle assessment)), i.e., the viability of different energy systems through a methodological life cycle framework. By combining LCC and LCA, a LCM (life cycle management) perspective is portrayed to support decision-making on a long-term basis. The comparable energy design options analysed are (1) district heating (reference design), (2) district heating with building integrated photovoltaic panels, (3) ground source heat pump, and (4) ground source heat pump with building-integrated photovoltaic panels. The results show that the design option with the highest initial investment (4) is in fact the most viable from a life cycle perspective. This study further strengthens the connection between cost savings and carbon emissions reduction in a life cycle context. Thus, by implementing LCC and LCA analysis in an early design phase, justified economic and environmental design decisions can be identified to develop more sustainable urban areas.

Developing new models and estimates based on state-of-the-art algorithms and data constraints can provide valuable knowledge and contribute to a final ensemble model in which various optimal carbon budget estimates are integrated, such as the annual global carbon budget paper. Here, we develop a new atmospheric inversion system based on the 4D local ensemble transform Kalman filter (4D-LETKF) coupled with the GEOS-Chem global transport model to infer surface-to-atmosphere net carbon fluxes from Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (000-2) Vl0r XCO2 retrievals. The 4D-LETKF algorithm is adapted to an OCO-2-based global carbon inversion system for the first time in this work. On average, the mean annual terrestrial and oceanic fluxes between 2015 and 2020 are estimated as - 2.02 and - 2.34 GtC yr(-1), respectively, compensating for 21 % and 24 %, respectively, of global fossil carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions (9.80 GtC yr(-1)). Our inversion results agree with the CO2 atmospheric growth rates reported by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and reduce the modeled CO2 concentration biases relative to the prior fluxes against surface and aircraft measurements. Our inversion-based carbon fluxes are broadly consistent with those provided by other global atmospheric inversion models, although discrepancies still occur in the land-ocean flux partitioning schemes and seasonal flux amplitudes over boreal and tropical regions, possibly due to the sparse observational constraints of the OCO-2 satellite and the divergent prior fluxes used in different inversion models. Four sensitivity experiments are performed herein to vary the prior fluxes and uncertainties in our inversion system, suggesting that regions that lack OCO-2 coverage are sensitive to the priors, especially over the tropics and high latitudes. In the further development of our inversion system, we will optimize the data-assimilation configuration to fully utilize current observations and increase the spatial and seasonal representativeness of the prior fluxes over regions that lack observations.","[Kong, Yawen; Zhang, Qiang] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Key Lab Earth Syst Modeling, Minist Educ, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Bo] Tsinghua Univ, Tsinghua Shenzhen Int Grad Sch, Inst Environm & Ecol, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Bo; He, Kebin] State Environm Protect Key Lab Sources & Control, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [He, Kebin] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Environm, State Key Joint Lab Environm Simulat & Pollut Con, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China",Tsinghua University; Tsinghua University; Tsinghua University,"Zheng, B (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Tsinghua Shenzhen Int Grad Sch, Inst Environm & Ecol, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China.;Zheng, B (corresponding author), State Environm Protect Key Lab Sources & Control, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",bozheng@sz.tsinghua.edu.cn,"OCO, OCO/GVS-4314-2022; Zheng, Bo/X-1616-2018","Zheng, Bo/0000-0001-8344-3445",Young Elite Scientists Sponsorship Program by CAST [YESS20200135]; Tsinghua Shenzhen International Graduate School [QD2021024C]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41921005],Young Elite Scientists Sponsorship Program by CAST; Tsinghua Shenzhen International Graduate School; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This research was supported by the Young Elite Scientists Sponsorship Program by CAST (grant no.

However, given a specific PSTA task and the corresponding data set, how to appropriately determine the desired configuration of a deep learning model, theoretically analyze the model's learning behavior, and quantitatively characterize the model's learning capacity remains a mystery. In order to demystify the power of deep learning for PSTA in a theoretically sound and explainable way, in this article, we provide a comprehensive framework for deep learning model design and information-theoretic analysis. First, we develop and demonstrate a novel interactively and integratively connected deep recurrent neural network ((IDRNN)-D-2) model. (IDRNN)-D-2 consists of three modules: an input module that integrates data from heterogeneous sources; a hidden module that captures the information at different scales while allowing the information to flow interactively between layers; and an output module that models the integrative effects of information from various hidden layers to generate the output predictions. Second, to theoretically prove that our designed model can learn multiscale spatiotemporal dependence in PSTA tasks, we provide an information-theoretic analysis to examine the information-based learning capacity (i-CAP) of the proposed model. In so doing, we can tackle an important open question in deep learning, that is, how to determine the necessary and sufficient configurations of a designed deep learning model with respect to the given learning data sets. Third, to validate the (IDRNN)-D-2 model and confirm its i-CAP, we systematically conduct a series of experiments involving both synthetic data sets and real-world PSTA tasks. The experimental results show that the (IDRNN)-D-2 model outperforms both classical and state-of-the-art models on all data sets and PSTA tasks. More importantly, as readily validated, the proposed model captures the multiscale spatiotemporal dependence, which is meaningful in the real-world context. Furthermore, the model configuration that corresponds to the best performance on a given data set always falls into the range between the necessary and sufficient configurations, as derived from the information-theoretic analysis.","[Tan, Qi; Liu, Yang; Liu, Jiming] Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Hong Kong Baptist University,"Liu, JM (corresponding author), Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",csqtan@comp.hkbu.edu.hk; csygliu@comp.hkbu.edu.hk; jiming@comp.hkbu.edu.hk,,"Liu, Jiming/0000-0002-8669-9064","Research Grant Council of Hong Kong SAR [RGC/HKBU12201318, RGC/HKBU12201619, RGC/HKBU12202220, RGC/HKBU12202417]; Faculty Research Grant of Hong Kong Baptist University (HKBU) [FRG2/17-18/027]",Research Grant Council of Hong Kong SAR(Hong Kong Research Grants Council); Faculty Research Grant of Hong Kong Baptist University (HKBU),"This work was supported in part by the General Research Fund from the Research Grant Council of Hong Kong SAR under Project RGC/HKBU12201318, Project RGC/HKBU12201619, Project RGC/HKBU12202220, and Project RGC/HKBU12202417; and in part by the Faculty Research Grant of Hong Kong Baptist University (HKBU) under Project FRG2/17-18/027.",,60,0,0,2,8,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2162-237X,2162-2388,,IEEE T NEUR NET LEAR,IEEE Trans.

Consider, for example, how droughts and water reserves affect crop production and how agriculture and industrial needs affect water quality and availability. Preventive measures, such as delaying planting dates and adopting new agricultural practices in response to changing weather patterns, can reduce the damage caused by natural processes. Understanding how these natural and human processes affect one another allows forecasting the effects of undesirable situations and study interventions to take preventive measures. For many of these processes, there are expert models that incorporate state-of-the-art theories and knowledge to quantify a system's response to a diversity of conditions. A major challenge for efficient modeling is the diversity of modeling approaches across disciplines and the wide variety of data sources available only in formats that require complex conversions. Using expert models for particular problems requires integration of models with third-party data as well as integration of models across disciplines. Modelers face significant heterogeneity that requires resolving semantic, spatiotemporal, and execution mismatches, which are largely done by hand today and may take more than 2 years of effort. We are developing a modeling framework that uses artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to reduce modeling effort while ensuring utility for decision making. Our work to date makes several innovative contributions: (1) an intelligent user interface that guides analysts to frame their modeling problem and assists them by suggesting relevant choices and automating steps along the way; (2) semantic metadata for models, including their modeling variables and constraints, that ensures model relevance and proper use for a given decision-making problem; and (3) semantic representations of datasets in terms of modeling variables that enable automated data selection and data transformations. This framework is implemented in the MINT (Model INTegration) framework, and currently includes data and models to analyze the interactions between natural and human systems involving climate, water availability, agricultural production, and markets. Our work to date demonstrates the utility of AI techniques to accelerate modeling to support decision-making and uncovers several challenging directions for future work.","[Gil, Yolanda; Garijo, Daniel; Khider, Deborah; Knoblock, Craig A.; Ratnakar, Varun; Osorio, Maximiliano; Vargas, Hernan; Pham, Minh; Pujara, Jay; Shbita, Basel; Vu, Binh; Deelman, Ewa; Da Silva, Rafael Ferreira; Mayani, Rajiv] Univ Southern Calif, Informat Sci Inst, Marina Del Rey, CA 90292 USA; [Chiang, Yao-Yi; Feldman, Dan; Lin, Yijun; Song, Hayley] Univ Southern Calif, Spatial Sci Inst, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Kumar, Vipin; Khandelwal, Ankush; Steinbach, Michael; Tayal, Kshitij; Xu, Shaoming] Univ Minnesota, Dept Comp Sci, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Pierce, Suzanne A.; Pearson, Lissa; Hardesty-Lewis, Daniel] Univ Texas Austin, Texas Adv Comp Ctr, Austin, TX 78758 USA; [Kemanian, Armen R.; Shi, Yuning; Leonard, Lorne] Penn State Univ, Dept Plant Sci, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Peckham, Scott; Stoica, Maria] Univ Colorado, Inst Arctic & Alpine Res, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Cobourn, Kelly; Zhang, Zeya] Virginia Tech, Dept Forest Resources & Environm Conservat, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Duffy, Christopher] Penn State Univ, Dept Civil Engn, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Shu, Lele] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Land Air & Water Resources, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of Southern California; University of Southern California; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Gil, Y (corresponding author), Univ Southern Calif, Informat Sci Inst, Marina Del Rey, CA 90292 USA.",gil@isi.edu; dgarijo@isi.edu; dkhider@isi.edu; knoblock@isi.edu; varunr@isi.edu; mosorio@isi.edu; hern.var@gmail.com; minhpham@usc.edu; jpujara@isi.edu; shbita@usc.edu; binhlvu@usc.edu; yaoyic@usc.edu; danf@usc.edu; yijunlin@usc.edu; haejinso@usc.edu; kumar@cs.umn.edu; khand035@umn.edu; stei0062@umn.edu; tayal@umn.edu; xu000114@umn.edu; spierce@tacc.utexas.edu; Lissa.Pearson@austin.utexas.edu; dhl@tacc.utexas.edu; yshi@psu.edu; lnl3@psu.edu; Scott.Peckham@colorado.edu; Stoica@colorado.edu; kellyc13@vt.edu; zzeya7@vt.edu; cxd11@psu.edu; shulele@lzb.ac.cn,"Ferreira da Silva, Rafael/K-3132-2014; Chiang, Yao-Yi/N-3628-2013; Pierce, Suzanne A/M-4563-2013","Ferreira da Silva, Rafael/0000-0002-1720-0928; Chiang, Yao-Yi/0000-0002-8923-0130; Pierce, Suzanne A/0000-0002-3050-1987",Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency [W911NF-18-1-0027]; Planet Texas 2050 program of The University of Texas at Austin; National Science Foundation [ICER-1440323],Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency(United States Department of DefenseDefense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)); Planet Texas 2050 program of The University of Texas at Austin; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This research was funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency with grant no.

A worrying trend has been the ever-decreasing life of buildings in cities because of premature building obsolescence. Premature building obsolescence has been cited as the major driver of demolition waste which accounts for more than 40% of total waste generated annually. This waste stream poses a bigger challenge as the pressure on natural resources increases with urban growth. A traditional way of looking at the urban sustainability has been from the perspective of the environmental sciences and waste management methods. Analyzing urban areas with design science perspectives could provide novel insights to improve existing resource consumption patterns and transform sustainability growth in cities. This study focuses on the problem of demolition waste arising from the premature building obsolescence in cities. It applies a design research methodology framework for identifying existing problems associated with demolition waste and generating strategies to transform cities into more sustainable urban systems. In the problem clarification phase, a detailed literature review was supported with stakeholder's interviews to identify the state-of-art for building demolition process and demolition waste. Research was further extended to descriptive study-I phase to carry out a demolition case study and generate support tools to enable transformation in the existing scenario for achieving a desired state. Singapore, a dense city state of South East Asia has been taken as a case study in this research. Results show that applying design research methods could help open-up a new dimension to solve urban sustainability challenge for built environment. It highlights that material reuse could lead to significant improvement in the built environment sustainability but the challenge associated with realization of material reuse practice needs to be addressed. Descriptive study-I concludes with the strategies on creating a reuse market through entrepreneurial innovation and an alternative material supply chain of secondary materials for regional housing demand. These results highlight the role of design research methods for tackling complex systems level problems in cities.","[Arora, Mohit; Silva, Arlindo] Singapore Univ Technol & Design, Pillar Engn Prod Dev, Singapore, Singapore; [Raspall, Felix] Singapore Univ Technol & Design, Pillar Architecture & Sustainable Design, Singapore, Singapore",Singapore University of Technology & Design; Singapore University of Technology & Design,"Arora, M (corresponding author), Singapore Univ Technol & Design, Pillar Engn Prod Dev, Singapore, Singapore.",,"Silva, Arlindo/A-4735-2013; Arora, Mohit/AAC-3982-2020","Silva, Arlindo/0000-0001-5120-3914; Arora, Mohit/0000-0002-4153-2797; Raspall Galli, Carlos Felix/0000-0002-7213-4572","SUTD-MIT International Design Centre, Singapore [IDG11700102]; Ministry of Education, Government of Singapore; Aiksun Demolition and Engineering Ltd, Building and Construction Authority; National Environment Agency, Singapore","SUTD-MIT International Design Centre, Singapore(Singapore University of Technology & Design); Ministry of Education, Government of Singapore(Ministry of Education, Singapore); Aiksun Demolition and Engineering Ltd, Building and Construction Authority; National Environment Agency, Singapore","Authors would like to acknowledge the funding support from SUTD-MIT International Design Centre, Singapore through research grant IDG11700102.

The virtue of the TSO model comes from employing granular state-of-the-art datasets such as half-hourly electricity demands and prices, irradiance levels from weather stations, and technology databases; while also considering building specific attributes. Investment revenues are obtained from reducing grid electricity costs and providing fast-frequency response (FFR) ancillary services. A case study of a distribution centre in London, UK is showcased with the goal to identify which technologies can minimise total energy costs against a conventional system setup serving as a benchmark. Results indicate the best technology configuration is a combination of lithium-ion batteries and mono-crystalline silicon PVs worth a total investment of 1.72 M. Due to the available space in the facility, the preferred PV capacity is 1.76 MW, while the battery system has a 1.06 MW power capacity and a 1.56 MWh energy capacity. Although PV performance varies across seasons, the solution indicates almost 30% of the energy used on-site can be supplied by PVs while achieving a carbon reduction of 26%. Nonetheless, PV and battery systems seem to be a questionable investment as the proposed solution has an 8-year payback, despite a 5-year NPV savings of 300k, implying there is still a performance gap for such systems to be massively deployed across the UK. Overall, the TSO model provides valuable insights into real-world project evaluation and can help to reduce the uncertainty associated with capital-intensive projects; hence proving to be a powerful modelling framework for distributed energy technology assessments.

Acrylic acid is Currently produced in a two-step process from propylene. Because of its lower cost, propane is an attractive alternative to propylene; however, no catalysts are currently available that can compete with the high yield of the propylene process. The LCA was performed using SimaPro, and impact assessment was determined using the Eco-Indicator 99 method. A comparison of the two feedstocks at the 87% yield of the current commercial propylene process demonstrated that switching to propane Would decrease the environmental impact of the process by 20%. Determination of environmental impact as the yield from the potential propane process wits varied predicts that, at yields exceeding 6%, the propane process will have a lower environmental impact than the current propylene process. By focusing on particular categories such as fossil fuels or climate change, the propane process will have a lower impact for yields exceeding 15 and 33%, respectively. The Current catalyst yield of up to 48% for the propane process exceeds these values. If reaction and waste gas heat are converted to electricity instead of steam, yields in excess of 61% will result in a lower total impact for the propane process. On the basis of raw material costs, the economic break-even point for the propane process is 59% yield. The similar yields of similar to 60% from propane required by economics and for a lower environmental impact represents a factor of 1.25 increase in yield over the current state-of-the-art propane catalyst compared to a factor of 1.81 increase in yield required to equal the current propylene yield. Thus, the proposed propane process may be much closer to viability than previously realized. This analysis provides an example of how LCA can compare chemical production from two different feedstocks, even if a catalyst for the reaction of interest has not been designed. The LCA analysis can also be used to determine target goals for catalysis research.","[Holman, Peter A.; Shonnard, David R.; Holles, Joseph H.] Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; [Shonnard, David R.] Michigan Technol Univ, Sustainable Futures Inst, Houghton, MI 49931 USA",Michigan Technological University; Michigan Technological University,"Holles, JH (corresponding author), Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Chem Engn, 1400 Townsend Dr, Houghton, MI 49931 USA.",jhholles@mtu.edu,"Holles, Joseph/R-4843-2016","Holles, Joseph/0000-0003-0390-8295",National Science Foundation [DGE 0333401],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),The authors gratefully acknowledge support from the Sustainable Futures IGERT project sponsored by the National Science Foundation (under Grant No. DGE 0333401).,,28,16,16,1,13,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0888-5885,,,IND ENG CHEM RES,Ind.

Much of this work is driven by global environmental change concerns, with global models seen as key tools with which to synthesize current understanding, explain paleoclimatic variability in global biogeochemistry and ecology, and forecast ecosystem responses to climate change and increasing atmospheric CO2 levels. We discuss the approaches used to model terrestrial and marine photosynthesis at the global scale. Models in both realms fall into two equivalent categories, one empirical and one mechanistic. Within each category there are many similarities between terrestrial and marine models. Most empirical approaches estimate the distribution of photosynthetic capacity (chlorophyll in the oceans, LAI on land) from space and apply a photosynthetic light-use efficiency approach to obtain an estimate of carbon uptake. Mechanistic approaches attempt to simulate the distribution of capacity itself, as well as the rate of photosynthesis, and are thus capable of projecting terrestrial and marine carbon fluxes into the future and distant past. A completely new state-of the-art global combined simulation of terrestrial and marine production is presented. Terrestrial photosynthesis is calculated using a mechanistic approach that treats the within-leaf light gradient, among other improvements over previous methods. Marine production utilizes a new approach that treats spatial and temporal variation in phytoplankton chlorophyll to C ratio. Mean contemporary annual net primary productivity is estimated to be 107.3 Pg C year(-1), with 51.1% coming from land and 48.9% from the oceans. Improvements in prognostic modeling of global photosynthesis will come about through attention to the same issues in both terrestrial and marine environments. These primarily concern high quality validation data at scales appropriate to test global models and the development of methodologies to deal with the variety of physiological and phenological types. In addition, attention needs to be given to both the potential importance of phenotypic plasticity and better mechanistic approaches for the prediction of photosynthetic capacity distribution in space and time. Dialogue between modelers, experimental physiologists, and ecologists needs to improve. Without this there is a very real danger that global models will assume a shared acceptance of an in silico reality that bears only superficial resemblance to that in vivo.","[Friend, Andrew D.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Geog, Downing Pl, Cambridge CB2 3EN, England; [Geider, Richard J.] Univ Essex, Dept Biol Sci, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England; [Behrenfeld, Michael J.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Bot & Plant Pathol, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Still, Christopher J.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Geog, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Still, Christopher J.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Inst Computat Earth Syst Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",University of Cambridge; University of Essex; Oregon State University; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara,"Friend, AD (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Geog, Downing Pl, Cambridge CB2 3EN, England.",adf10@cam.ac.uk,,"Still, Christopher/0000-0002-8295-4494",,,,,237,24,25,0,19,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1572-0233,,978-1-4020-9237-4,ADV PHOTOSYNTH RESP,Adv.

MOCAGE-Climat is a state-of-the-art CTM that simulates the global distribution of ozone and its precursors (82 chemical species) both in the troposphere and the stratosphere, up to the mid-mesosphere (similar to 70 km). Surface processes (emissions, dry deposition), convection, and scavenging are explicitly described in the model that has been driven by the ECMWF operational analyses of the period 2000-2005, on T21 and T42 horizontal grids and 60 hybrid vertical levels, with and without a procedure that reduces calculations in the boundary layer, and with on-line or climatological deposition velocities. Model outputs have been compared to available observations, both from satellites (TOMS, HALOE, SMR, SCIAMACHY, MOPITT) and in-situ instrument measurements (ozone sondes, MOZAIC and aircraft campaigns) at climatological timescales. The distribution of long-lived species is in fair agreement with observations in the stratosphere putting aside the shortcomings associated with the large-scale circulation. The variability of the ozone column, both spatially and temporarily, is satisfactory. However, because the Brewer-Dobson circulation is too fast, too much ozone is accumulated in the lower to mid-stratosphere at the end of winter. Ozone in the UTLS region does not show any systematic bias. In the troposphere better agreement with ozone sonde measurements is obtained at mid and high latitudes than in the tropics and differences with observations are the lowest in summer. Simulations using a simplified boundary layer lead to larger ozone differences between the model and the observations up to the mid-troposphere. NOx in the lowest troposphere is in general overestimated, especially in the winter months over the Northern Hemisphere, which may result from a positive bias in OH. Dry deposition fluxes of O-3 and nitrogen species are within the range of values reported by recent inter-comparison model exercises. The use of climatological deposition velocities versus deposition velocities calculated on-line had greatest impact on HNO3 and NO2 in the troposphere.","[Teyssedre, H.; Michou, M.; Clark, H.

Yet much about the ocean still remains to be understood, largely due to lack of detailed and accurate observations over the oceans. A satellite platform, with its synoptic view and capability to give spatially continuous data on a repetitive basis has increased the possibilities for studying oceans and ocean-atmosphere system in greater detail and for providing valuable inputs for modelling efforts. Optimum exploitation of ocean resources calls for detailed knowledge of the hydro-biological and related aspects of the environment. Several studies using passive and active models of satellite measurements have proved their potential in understanding the ocean-atmosphere systems. Complementary conventional systems, e.g., ships and buoys, provide detailed temporal and in-depth coverage at specific points, and are used in conjunction with satellite observations over large areas. Many ocean-related studies have reached near operational level and suitable sensors have been developed. The ocean colour measured by optical sensors is found to bear the direct relation to the suspended material of the water, thermal characteristics and location of greenish biological materials. Sea surface temperature and thermal patterns are amenable to measurements using thermal sensors. The ocean currents caused primarily by surface winds, have been studied with satellite microwave sensors like the altimeter, which also have provided significant information on wave height and wind speed. The thermal structure of ocean layers has been mapped using infrared radiometry. Wind scatterometers are ideal for the measurement of wind speed and direction, while synthetic aperture radar (SAR) provides information on bi-directional wave spectra. Microwave sensors have also been found to be useful in mapping sea-ice features, nearshore bathymetry, etc. The updated information on wetlands, geomorphology, erosion/accretion, sediment transport, pollutant dispersal, etc., which could be obtained from satellite based remote sensing, have proved invaluable towards scientific management of the coastal zones. This article reviews the state-of-the-art of various satellites and sensors and expected accuracies from satellite-based measurements and their utility in ocean modelling.

Observations of giant kelp forests are spatially and temporally uneven, with disproportionate coverage in the northern hemisphere, despite the size and comparable density of southern hemisphere kelp forests. Satellite imagery enables the mapping of existing and historical giant kelp populations in understudied regions, but automating the detection of giant kelp using satellite imagery requires approaches that are robust to the optical complexity of the shallow, nearshore environment. We present and compare two approaches for automating the detection of giant kelp in satellite datasets: one based on crowd sourcing of satellite imagery classifications and another based on a decision tree paired with a spectral unmixing algorithm (automated using Google Earth Engine). Both approaches are applied to satellite imagery (Landsat) of the Falkland Islands or Islas Malvinas (FLK), an archipelago in the southern Atlantic Ocean that supports expansive giant kelp ecosystems. The performance of each method is evaluated by comparing the automated classifications with a subset of expert-annotated imagery (8 images spanning the majority of our continuous timeseries, cumulatively covering over 2,700 km of coastline, and including all relevant sensors). Using the remote sensing approaches evaluated herein, we present the first continuous timeseries of giant kelp observations in the FLK region using Landsat imagery spanning over three decades. We do not detect evidence of long-term change in the FLK region, although we observe a recent decline in total canopy area from 2017-2021. Using a nitrate model based on nearby ocean state measurements obtained from ships and incorporating satellite sea surface temperature products, we find that the area of giant kelp forests in the FLK region is positively correlated with the nitrate content observed during the prior year. Our results indicate that giant kelp classifications using citizen science are approximately consistent with classifications based on a state-of-the-art automated spectral approach. Despite differences in accuracy and sensitivity, both approaches find high interannual variability that impedes the detection of potential long-term changes in giant kelp canopy area, although recent canopy area declines are notable and should continue to be monitored carefully.","[Houskeeper, Henry F.; Cavanaugh, Katherine C.; Pawlak, Camille; Cavanaugh, Kyle C.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Geog, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; [Rosenthal, Isaac S.] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Environm, Boston, MA USA; [Trouille, Laura] Adler Planetarium, Chicago, IL USA; [Byrnes, Jarrett E.

According to Croce, the pernicious consequences of Cartesian mathematical attitude can be found in Locke, Leibniz, Wolff and Baumgarten: it is not until the Italian Giambattista Vico that we can talk about a true aesthetic science. During the years in which his Philosophy of spirit takes shape, Croce criticizes Descartes' intellectualism, the abstractedness of his science and morals, as long as his ignorance of history. This reading is not original and reveals the influence of the cultural climate of its time (idealism; Francesco De Sanctis). However, it contributes to underpin a strongly innovative conception of art which is going to be very influential during the first half of 20th century. A more detailed study of Croce's vast and complex writings shows that his reading of Descartes denotes a deep knowledge of the history of philosophy: Croce is able to correct simplistic interpretations of certain aspects of Cartesian thought by Vico, Hegel or Valery, and to acknowledge his debt to Descartes's theory of error. But nonetheless his exaggerated schematisations arouse some misunderstandings, for instance about the passions of the soul. After the First World War, Descartes begins to play a different role in Croce's writings. The Neapolitan philosopher feels the need to react to the irrationalism, the vitalism and the nationalism which led to the war and to the decadence of European culture, and which will lead to the Second World War. It is now important to defend reason, of which Descartes is a champion. The French philosopher becomes again, in the eyes of Croce, the leading figure in the fundamental trend of modern philosophy. This shift of emphasis is far from implying a change in Croce's conception of the philosophy of spirit: it rather reflects the ability of his thought to respond to the ever-changing needs which arise throughout the course of history.","[Gasparri, Giuliano] Univ Enna Kore, Enna, Italy",Universita Kore di ENNA,"Gasparri, G (corresponding author), Univ Enna Kore, Enna, Italy.",,,,,,,,27,0,0,0,7,"UNIV LILLE III-CHARLES GAULLE, UMR SAVOIRS TEXTES LANGAGE",VILLENEUVE ASCQ,"B P 60149, VILLENEUVE ASCQ, CEDEX 59653, FRANCE",1769-7379,,,METHODOS,Methodos,,2018,18,,,,,,,10.4000/methodos.5056,http://dx.doi.org/10.4000/methodos.5056,,,18,Philosophy,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Philosophy,GM7HH,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000438353900011,View Full Record in Web of Science

The stations operate in a harmonized and standardized way based on community-proven protocols and methods for ocean GHG observations, improving operational conformity as well as quality control and assurance of the data. This enables the network to focus on long term research into the marine carbon cycle and the anthropogenic carbon sink, while preparing the network to include other GHG fluxes. ICOS data are processed on a near real-time basis and will be published on the ICOS Carbon Portal (CP), allowing monthly estimates of CO2 air-sea exchange to be quantified for European waters. ICOS establishes transparent operational data management routines following the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) guiding principles allowing amongst others reproducibility, interoperability, and traceability. The ICOS-Oceans network is actively integrating with the atmospheric (e.g., improved atmospheric measurements onboard SOOP lines) and ecosystem (e.g., oceanic direct gas flux measurements) domains of ICOS, and utilizes techniques developed by the ICOS Central Facilities and the CP. There is a strong interaction with the international ocean carbon cycle community to enhance interoperability and harmonize data flow. The future vision of ICOS-Oceans includes ship-based ocean survey sections to obtain a three-dimensional understanding of marine carbon cycle processes and optimize the existing network design.","[Steinhoff, Tobias;

These reanalyses were produced by using a frozen state-of-the-art version of the global data assimilation system developed at these two centers. For the period 1987-88 and for the tropical oceanic regions of 30 degrees S-30 degrees N, surface and atmospheric fields related to atmospheric hydrology and radiation are compared and assessed, wherever possible, with satellite data. Some common biases as well as discrepancies between the two independent reassimilation products are highlighted. Considering both annual averages and interannual variability (1987-88), discrepancies between DAO and NCEP reanalysis in water vapor, precipitation, and clear-sky longwave radiation at the top of the atmosphere are generally smaller than discrepancies that exist between corresponding satellite estimates. Among common biases identified in the reanalyses, the authors note an underestimation of the total precipitable water and an overestimation of the shortwave cloud radiative forcing in warm convective regions. Both lead to an underestimation of the surface radiation budget. The authors also note an overestimaton of the clear-sky outgoing longwave radiation in most tropical ocean regions, as well as an overestimation of the longwave radiative cooling at the ocean surface. Surface latent and sensible heat fluxes differ by about 20 and 3 W m(-2), respectively, in the two reanalyses, Differences in the surface radiation budget are larger than the uncertainties of satellite-based estimates. Biases in the surface radiation fluxes derived from the reanalyses are primarily due to incorrect shortwave cloud radiative forcing and, to a lesser degree, due to a deficit in the total precipitable water and a cold bias at lower-tropospheric. temperatures. This study suggests that individual features and biases of each set of reanalyses should be carefully studied, especially when using analyzed surface fluxes to force other physical or geophysical models such as ocean circulation models. Over large regions of the tropical oceans, DAO and NCEP reanalyses produce surface net heat fluxes that can differ by up to 50 W m(-2) in the average and by a factor of 2 when considering interannual anomalies. This may lead to vastly different thermal forcings for driving ocean circulations.","NASA, GODDARD SPACE FLIGHT CTR, GREENBELT, MD 20771 USA; NATL CTR ENVIRONM PREDICT, WASHINGTON, DC USA",National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Bony, S (corresponding author), ECOLE NORMALE SUPER, CNRS, METEOROL DYNAM LAB, 24 RUE LHOMOND, F-75231 PARIS 05, FRANCE.",,"Lau, William K/E-1510-2012; Bony, Sandrine/AAG-5804-2019","Lau, William K/0000-0002-3587-3691; Bony, Sandrine/0000-0002-4791-4438",,,,,65,53,55,0,3,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0894-8755,,,J CLIMATE,J.

Background: Social prescribing services for mental healthcare create links with support in the community for people using primary care. Social prescribing services may reduce future healthcare use, and therefore reduce the financial and environmental costs of healthcare, by providing structured psychosocial support. The National Health Service (NHS) is required to reduce its carbon footprint by 80% by 2050 according to the Climate Change Act (2008). This study is the first of its kind to analyse both the financial and environmental impacts associated with healthcare use following social prescribing. The value of this observational study lies in its novel methodology of analysing the carbon footprint of a service at the primary-care level. Method: An observational study was carried out to assess the impact of the service on the financial and environmental impacts of healthcare use. GP appointments, psychotropic medications and secondary-care referrals were measured. Findings: Results demonstrate no statistical difference in the financial and carbon costs of healthcare use between groups. Social prescribing showed a trend towards reduced healthcare use, mainly due to a reduction in secondary-care referrals compared with controls. The associations found did not achieve significance due to the small sample size leading to a large degree of uncertainty regarding differences. This study demonstrates that these services are potentially able to pay for themselves through reducing future healthcare costs and are effective, low-carbon interventions, when compared with cognitive behavioral therapy or antidepressants. This is an important finding in light of Government targets for the NHS to reduce its carbon footprint by 80% by 2050. Larger studies are required to investigate the potentials of social prescribing services further.","[Maughan, Daniel L.] Royal Coll Psychiatrists, London SW1X 8PG, England; [Maughan, Daniel L.; Cooke, Matthew] Warwick Med Sch, Coventry, W Midlands, England; [Maughan, Daniel L.] Ctr Sustainable Healthcare, Oxford, England; [Patel, Alisha; Parveen, Tahmina] Univ E Anglia, Sch Med, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Braithwaite, Isobel] UCL, Sch Med, London W1N 8AA, England; [Cook, Jonathan] Nuffield Dept Orthopaed, Ctr Stat Med Rheumatol & Musculoskeletal Sci, Oxford, England; [Lillywhite, Rob] Univ Warwick, Dept Life Sci, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Cooke, Matthew] Heart England NHS Fdn Trust, Birmingham, W Midlands, England",University of Warwick; University of East Anglia; University of London; University College London; UCL Medical School; University of Warwick; Heart of England NHS Foundation Trust,"Maughan, DL (corresponding author), Cranbrook House,287-291 Banbury Rd, Oxford OX2 7JQ, England.",daniel.maughan@sustainablehealthcare.org.uk,,"Braithwaite, Isobel/0000-0001-5327-5612",,,,,25,21,21,4,31,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1463-4236,1477-1128,,PRIM HEALTH CARE RES,Prim.

This paper tests whether uncertainties in the physics of water vapor absorption in clear skies are directly responsible for this unexplained excess absorption. Radiative transfer calculations of clear-sky solar fluxes are compared to measurements in the tropical Pacific at the surface and the tropopause. We find that the atmospheric absorption in excess of that predicted by radiative transfer models, if it exists, is less than the experimental uncertainty of 7 W m(-2) (diurnally averaged). Furthermore, the difference between observed and modeled absorption is essentially independent of water vapor amounts between 35 and 51 kg m(-2). A more direct test of the accuracy of modeled water vapor absorption is conducted with two independent multi-spectral radiometers at the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement site in Oklahoma, each providing over 16000 surface measurements of direct solar radiation in the 0.94 mu m region. These spectral data confirm state-of-the-art radiation model computations of water vapor line absorption to within 5% for the wavelength region tested. The model-observation agreement for both tropical and Oklahoma data strongly suggests that uncertainties in the physics of water vapor absorption in clear skies are not a source for any significant excess solar absorption, thus narrowing the search to other atmospheric constituents or water vapor in cloudy skies.","Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, Ctr Clouds Chem & Climate, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, Ctr Atmospher Sci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego; Scripps Institution of Oceanography; University of California System; University of California San Diego; Scripps Institution of Oceanography,"Conant, WC (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, Ctr Clouds Chem & Climate, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",,"Vogelmann, Andrew M/M-8779-2014","Vogelmann, Andrew M/0000-0003-1918-5423",,,,,25,10,10,0,1,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0280-6495,,,TELLUS A,Tellus Ser.

It explains the principle of operation and classification in detail. The various developments in dehumidifier, regenerator, desiccant material, and mathematical modelling are discussed. The various types of performance parameters, and the design criteria and effect of operating parameters are also detailed. Finally, the climate feasibility, performance control strategies and indoor air quality are explained.

Abatement technologies focused on carbon capture, storage, and utilization (CCUS) enable the continued use of processes and resources that produce CO2 (and other acid gases) while minimizing their effect on the environment.

Thus, accurate and timely predictions of Arctic sea ice changes is important. Arctic sea ice forecasting involves two connected tasks: predicting sea ice concentration (SIC) at each pixel and predicting overall sea ice extent (SIE). Instead of having two separate models for these two forecasting tasks, in this paper we study how to use multi-task learning techniques and leverage the connections between ice concentration and ice extent to improve accuracy for both forecasting tasks. Because of the spatiotemporal nature of the data, we designed two novel multi-task learning models based on the CNN and ConvLSTM, respectively. Further, in conjunction with multi-task models, we developed custom loss functions which train the models to ignore land pixels and optimize for both concentration and extent when making predictions. Our experiments show that multi-task models provide better accuracy for a 1-month lead time than models that predict sea ice extent and concentration separately. Our accuracies are better than or comparable to results in related state-of-the-art studies. Our best model in SIC prediction outperformed the best existing SIC prediction model in the literature with 1.78% less error, and our best model in SIE prediction outperformed the best existing SIE prediction model with 0.283 million km(2) less error.","[Kim, Eliot] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Stat, Nelson Inst Environm Studies, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Kruse, Peter] Juniata Coll, Dept Accounting Business & Econ, Huntingdon, PA 16652 USA; [Lama, Skylar] Univ Maryland, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Bourne, Jamal, Jr.] McDaniel Coll, Dept Math & Comp Sci, Westminster, MD USA; [Hu, Michael] Georgia Inst Technol, Coll Comp, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Ali, Sahara; Huang, Yiyi; Wang, Jianwu] Univ Maryland Baltimore Cty, Dept Informat Syst, Baltimore, MD 21228 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland Baltimore County,"Kim, E (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Stat, Nelson Inst Environm Studies, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",ejkim23@wisc.edu; krusepi18@juniata.edu; slama@umd.edu; jeb0100@mcdaniel.edu; mhu94@gatech.edu; sali9@umbc.edu; yhuang10@umbc.edu; jianwu@umbc.edu,,"Kim, Eliot/0000-0002-3152-2130","grant REU Site: Online Interdisciplinary Big Data Analytics in Science and Engineering from the National Science Foundation [OAC-1942714]; grant CAREER: Big Data Climate Causality Analytics from the National Science Foundation [OAC-1942714]; U.S. National Science Foundation through the MRI program [CNS-0821258, CNS-1228778, OAC-1726023]; National Science Foundation through the SCREMS program [DMS-0821311]; University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC)","grant REU Site: Online Interdisciplinary Big Data Analytics in Science and Engineering from the National Science Foundation; grant CAREER: Big Data Climate Causality Analytics from the National Science Foundation; U.S. National Science Foundation through the MRI program; National Science Foundation through the SCREMS program; University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC)","This work is supported by the grant REU Site: Online Interdisciplinary Big Data Analytics in Science and Engineering from the National Science Foundation (grant no.

Besides the instrumental characteristics determining the measurement uncertainties, an important issue is possible long-term changes of the radiometers exposed to solar irradiance-especially in the EUV- and the space environment. A model for the degradation has been developed which can explain the behaviour of most radiometers in space. The TSI record since 1978 from different platforms and radiometers can be combined in a composite time series which demonstrates that although the assumed uncertainty of the present state-of-the-art radiometers is insufficient, their short-and long-term precision is good enough to produce a reliable time series of TSI over almost 30 years.","World Radiat Ctr, Phys Meteorol Observ Davos, Davos, Switzerland",,"Frohlich, C (corresponding author), World Radiat Ctr, Phys Meteorol Observ Davos, Davos, Switzerland.",,,,,,,,47,3,3,2,2,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013, UNITED STATES",,,978-1-4614-7804-1; 978-1-4614-7803-4,ISSI SCI REP SER,,,2013,,,,,565,581,,10.1007/978-1-4614-7804-1_32,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-7804-1_32,10.1007/978-1-4614-7804-1,,17,Astronomy & Astrophysics; Remote Sensing,Book Citation Index – Science (BKCI-S),Astronomy & Astrophysics; Remote Sensing,BD5DC,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000361327100034,View Full Record in Web of Science

The offshore WF usually has a bigger generation capacity with less environmental impacts, and it is more reliable too due to stronger and consistent sea winds. The early offshore WF installations are located near the shore, whereas most modern installations are located far away from shore, generating higher power. This paradigm shift has forced the researchers and industry personnel to look deeper into transmission options, namely, high voltage AC transmission (HVAC) and high voltage DC transmission (HVDC). This evaluation can be both in terms of power carrying capability as well as cost comparisons. Additionally, different performance requirements such as power rating, onshore grid requirements, reactive power compensation, etc., must be considered for evaluation. This paper elaborately reviews and explains the offshore wind farm structure and performance requirements for bulk offshore power transfer. Based on the structure and performance requirements, both HVDC and HVAC transmission modes are compared and analyzed critically. Finally, a criterion for selection and increasing popularity of HVDC transmission is established.","[Rahman, Syed] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Khan, Irfan; Nadeem, Muhammad Faisal] Texas A&M Univ, Clean & Resilient Energy Syst CARES Lab, Galveston, TX 77553 USA; [Alkhammash, Hend I.] Taif Univ, Coll Engn, Dept Elect Engn, At Taif 21944, Saudi Arabia; [Nadeem, Muhammad Faisal] Univ Engn & Technol Taxila, Dept Elect Engn, Taxila 47080, Pakistan",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Texas A&M University System; Taif University; University of Engineering & Technology Taxila,"Khan, I (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Clean & Resilient Energy Syst CARES Lab, Galveston, TX 77553 USA.",smz_909618@tamu.edu; irfankhan@tamu.edu; khamash.h@tu.edu.sa; faisal.nadeem@uettaxila.edu.pk,"Khan, Irfan/J-1241-2019; Alkhammash, Hend/CAF-6834-2022; Syed, Rahman/ACS-9570-2022","Khan, Irfan/0000-0003-2484-6169; Syed, Rahman/0000-0002-8672-6894; Khan, Muhammad Faisal Nadeem/0000-0002-1906-8924",,,,,67,8,8,5,14,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2079-9292,,ELECTRONICS-SWITZ,Electronics,JUN,2021,12,,,,,,1489,10.3390/electronics10121489,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/electronics10121489,,,15,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Physics, Applied",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Physics,SY9EF,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000666181600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

For the direct problem solution, we use the well-known Chandrasekhar's discrete ordinates method combined with the finite difference method. We are interested in the estimation of the scattering and absorbing coefficients using the measured data of the emerging radiation at both boundary surfaces of the medium and also at the interface between the two layers. The inverse problem is implicitly formulated and the minimization of the defined objective function is achieved with the Levenberg-Marquardt method.

The ELV Directive is an example of 'extended producer responsibility'. As of 1(st) January 2006 all automotive OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturers) and component manufacturers operating within the European Union (EU) had to comply with this regulation. The Directive compels all OEMs to 'take-back' and dismantle all motor vehicles for domestic use at the end of their useful lives for reuse or recycling. The ultimate goal of the ELV Directive is that all motor vehicles will have a reuse or recyclable content of 85%, increasing to 95% by 2015 (DEFRA, 2009). The financial burden of the ELV Directive falls on both the OEMs and their component manufacturers, forcing them to 'design for disassembly'. This is an example of the 'polluter pays principle' and represents a major shift in product responsibility from consumers towards producers. The EU is thus directing vehicle designers towards more sustainable forms of production, and parallel legislation is also aimed at stimulating innovation in low carbon' powertrain systems. However, there is a growing recognition that non-fossil fuel derived material streams will have to be developed to replace non-recyclable or toxic materials, particularly plastics. The problems facing the industry are immense, not least because of the current economic climate; recycling current vehicles represents a serious historical design problem, but has technical and cost limits. Industry trends include greater focus on lightweighting with new alloys and increased substitution from bio-plastics and bio-fuels. Resolving a complex array of design constraints will challenge designers in the near future. Other regulatory compliance coupled with significant market and technological developments may prove to be more powerful in transforming this sector in a more sustainable direction.","Birmingham City Univ, Birmingham Inst Art & Design, Birmingham, W Midlands, England",Birmingham City University,"Smith, M (corresponding author), Birmingham City Univ, Birmingham Inst Art & Design, Birmingham, W Midlands, England.",,,,,,,,24,3,3,0,5,"NOVA SCIENCE PUBLISHERS, INC",HAUPPAUGE,"400 OSER AVE, STE 1600, HAUPPAUGE, NY 11788-3635 USA",,,978-1-60876-143-2,TRANSP ISSUES POLICI,,,2010,,,,,191,203,,,,,,13,Transportation Science & Technology,Book Citation Index – Science (BKCI-S),Transportation,BQQ06,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000281522900006,View Full Record in Web of Science

One of the important types of controlled environment agriculture is greenhouses. Key indoor environmental parameters such as carbon dioxide, moisture, lighting, and temperature are required to be maintained for favorable crop growth in greenhouses. Due to lightweight construction and inefficient operation, greenhouses consume more fossil fuel energy in the operation of mechanical systems than other similar sized buildings and have larger carbon footprints. In fact, greenhouses are one of the most energy-intensive sectors of the agricultural industry. Energy consumption in greenhouses is influenced by mechanical systems, indoor environment, crop growth, and evapotranspiration. Therefore, energy simulations help analyze the complex thermal processes in greenhouse operation, and contribute to energy efficient greenhouse operation. This paper reviews existing strategies on energy efficient control operation and state-of-the-art energy simulation for greenhouses. It first discusses strategies for improving energy efficiency in greenhouse control operation by summarizing the studies on energy efficient operation strategies, the control of key greenhouse parameters, sensing network and monitoring systems, along with various control algorithms. Second, the review covers energy modeling of greenhouses by summarizing existing and developed approaches. Finally, this review identifies areas in which future research has the potential to reduce greenhouse energy consumption and carbon footprint.","[Iddio, E.; Wang, L.; Thomas, Y.; McMorrow, G.; Denzer, A.] Univ Wyoming, 1000 E Univ Ave, Laramie, WY 82071 USA",University of Wyoming,"Wang, L (corresponding author), Univ Wyoming, 1000 E Univ Ave, Laramie, WY 82071 USA.",lwang12@uwyo.edu,,"Iddio, Emmanuel/0000-0002-3481-5844; Wang, Liping/0000-0002-7765-2387",,,,,247,58,58,27,130,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",1364-0321,1879-0690,,RENEW SUST ENERG REV,Renew.

Therefore, forensic analysis of mobile device images takes on special importance. This paper explores the branch of forensic analysis which is based on the identification of the source, specifically on the grouping or clustering of images according to their source acquisition. In contrast with other state of the art techniques for source identification, hierarchical clustering does not involve a priori knowledge of the number of images or devices to be identified or training data for a future classification stage. That is, a grouping by classes with all the input images is performed. The proposal is based on the combination of hierarchical and flat clustering and the use of Sensor Pattern Noise (SPN). There has been a series of experiments which emulate similar situations to those that may occur in reality to test the robustness and reliability of the results of the technique. The results are satisfactory in all the experiments, obtaining high rates of success. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

However, another common problem is applying optimization. Hence, in this paper we propose an AAM based face recognition technique, which is capable of resolving the fitting problem of AAM by introducing a new adaptive ABC algorithm. The adaptation increases the efficiency of fitting as against the conventional ABC algorithm.

Of the two sub-basins in the Gulf of Bothnia, the Bothnian Sea is more dynamic in its hydrography and food web structure than the Bothnian Bay, due to the variable influence of the more eutrophic and more saline Baltic Proper. Variation in deep-water intrusion from the main Baltic Proper, and its effect on salinity and stratification, had a clear effect on the phyto- and zooplankton communities in the Bothnian Sea. Probably due to this intrusion, the nutrient status in this basin has also changed in terms of nitrogen limitation, with subsequent class- and genus-level changes in phytoplankton community composition. The migration of cod to the Bothnian Sea during the 1980s had profound effects on the herring population, but cascading effects affecting the basis of the food web were not obvious. In contrast to a more pronounced interplay of both top-down control and bottom-up nutrient limitation of the Bothnian Sea, the Bothnian Bay food web was mostly driven by hydrography and climate, and major changes were observed in the basis of the food web. Community changes were observed in both basins in the Gulf of Bothnia throughout the entire time period. Human influence considerably affects both the basis of the food web and its very top, where man has replaced the natural top predators. Though the eutrophication status of the Gulf has been rather stable, the results indicate that the potential symptoms should be surveyed specifically in the Bothnian Sea, and that management of Baltic herring stocks requires an understanding, and thus monitoring, of the entire food web.

To isolate the influence of lithology on weathering rates and mechanisms, we compare two nearby catchments in the Luquillo Critical Zone Observatory in Puerto Rico, which have similar climate history, relief and vegetation, but differ in bedrock lithology. Regolith and pore water samples with depth were collected from two ridgetops and at three sites along a slope transect in the volcaniclastic Bisley catchment and compared to existing data from the granitic Rio Icacos catchment. The depth variations of solid-state and pore water chemistry and quantitative mineralogy were used to calculate mass transfer (tau) and weathering solute profiles, which in turn were used to determine weathering mechanisms and to estimate weathering rates. Regolith formed on both lithologies is highly leached of most labile elements, although Mg and K are less depleted in the granitic than in the volcaniclastic profiles, reflecting residual biotite in the granitic regolith not present in the volcaniclastics. Profiles of both lithologies that terminate at bedrock corestones are less weathered at depth, near the rock-regolith interfaces. Mg fluxes in the volcaniclastics derive primarily from dissolution of chlorite near the rock-regolith interface and from dissolution of illite and secondary phases in the upper regolith, whereas in the granitic profile, Mg and K fluxes derive from biotite dissolution. Long-term mineral dissolution rates and weathering fluxes were determined by integrating mass losses over the thickness of solid-state weathering fronts, and are therefore averages over the timescale of regolith development. Resulting long-term dissolution rates for minerals in the volcaniclastic regolith include chlorite: 8.9 x 10(-14) mol m(-2) s(-1), illite: 2.1 x 10(-14) mol m(-2) s(-1) and kaolinite: 4.0 x 10(-14) mol m(-2) s(-1). Long-term weathering fluxes are several orders of magnitude lower in the granitic regolith than in the volcaniclastic, despite higher abundances of several elements in the granitic regolith. Contemporary weathering fluxes were determined from net (rain-corrected) solute profiles and thus represent rates over the residence time of water in the regolith. Contemporary weathering fluxes within the granitic regolith are similar to the long-term fluxes. In contrast, the long-term fluxes are faster than the contemporary fluxes in the volcaniclastic regolith. Contemporary fluxes in the granitic regolith are generally also slightly faster than in the volcaniclastic. The differences in weathering fluxes over space and time between these two watersheds indicate significant lithologic control of chemical weathering mechanisms and rates. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

To support a proper ecosystem management, the analysis of an ecosystem's vulnerability provide information on its weaknesses as well as on its capacity to recover after suffering an impact. However, the application of the vulnerability concept to ecosystems is still an emerging topic. After providing background on the vulnerability concept, we summarize existing ecosystem vulnerability research on the basis of a systematic literature review with a special focus on ecosystem type, disciplinary background, and more detailed definition of the ecosystem vulnerability components. Using the Web of Science (TM) Core Collection, we overviewed the literature from 1991 onwards but used the 5 years from 2011 to 2015 for an in-depth analysis, including 129 articles. We found that ecosystem vulnerability analysis has been applied most notably in conservation biology, climate change research, and ecological risk assessments, pinpointing a limited spreading across the environmental sciences. It occurred primarily within marine and freshwater ecosystems. To avoid confusion, we recommend using the unambiguous term ecosystem vulnerability rather than ecological, environmental, population, or community vulnerability. Further, common ground has been identified, on which to define the ecosystem vulnerability components exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. We propose a framework for ecosystem assessments that coherently connects the concepts of vulnerability, resilience, and adaptability as different ecosystem responses. A short outlook on the possible operationalization of the concept by ecosystem vulnerabilty indices, and a conclusion section complete the review.","[Weisshuhn, Peter] Leibniz Ctr Agr Landscape Res ZALF eV, Eberswalder Str 84, D-15374 Muncheberg, Germany; [Mueller, Felix] Univ Kiel, Inst Nat Resource Conservat, Olshausenstr 40, D-24098 Kiel, Germany; [Wiggering, Hubert] Univ Potsdam, Inst Earth & Environm Sci, Karl Liebknecht Str 24-25, D-14476 Potsdam, Germany",Leibniz Zentrum fur Agrarlandschaftsforschung (ZALF); University of Kiel; University of Potsdam,"Weisshuhn, P (corresponding author), Leibniz Ctr Agr Landscape Res ZALF eV, Eberswalder Str 84, D-15374 Muncheberg, Germany.",weisshuhn@zalf.de,,"Weisshuhn, Peter/0000-0002-1245-454X",Deutsche Bundesstiftung Umwelt (DBU),Deutsche Bundesstiftung Umwelt (DBU),Peter Weisshuhn thanks for the receipt of a doctoral scholarship from the Deutsche Bundesstiftung Umwelt (DBU) in 2016/17.,,126,44,49,15,131,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0364-152X,1432-1009,,ENVIRON MANAGE,Environ.

As part of the Sun Earth Connection programme at the British Antarctic Survey (BAS), a new, state-of-the-art microwave radiometer is being developed in collaboration with the MaxPlanck Institute (MPI) and the Norwegian Polar Institute (NPI) to simultaneously measure profiles of ozone and nitric oxide between 30 and 80 km deep within the Antarctic polar vortex. Operating in the 250 GHz spectral region, the semi-autonomous instrument will be coupled to moderate- and high-resolution chirp spectrometers to provide simultaneous spectra of the nitric oxide and ozone. In addition, a second local oscillator will be used to periodically examine carbon monoxide at 230.538 GHz to infer the vertical descent rate within the Antarctic vortex.

The measurement of water reflectance requires the measurement of water-leaving radiance and downwelling irradiance just above water. For the latter, there are four generic families of method, using: (1) an above-water upward-pointing irradiance sensor; (2) an above-water downward-pointing radiance sensor and a reflective plaque; (3) a Sun-pointing radiance sensor (sunphotometer); or (4) an underwater upward-pointing irradiance sensor deployed at different depths. Each method-except for the fourth, which is considered obsolete for the measurement of above-water downwelling irradiance-is described generically in the FRM context with reference to the measurement equation, documented implementations, and the intra-method diversity of deployment platform and practice. Ideal measurement conditions are stated, practical recommendations are provided on best practice, and guidelines for estimating the measurement uncertainty are provided for each protocol-related component of the measurement uncertainty budget. The state of the art for the measurement of downwelling irradiance is summarized, future perspectives are outlined, and key debates such as the use of reflectance plaques with calibrated or uncalibrated radiometers are presented. This review is based on the practice and studies of the aquatic optics community and the validation of water reflectance, but is also relevant to land radiation monitoring and the validation of satellite-derived land surface reflectance.","[Ruddick, Kevin G.] RBINS, Operat Directorate Nat Environm, 29 Rue Vautierstr, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium; [Voss, Kenneth] Univ Miami, Phys Dept, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA; [Banks, Andrew C.] HCMR, Former US Base Gournes, Inst Oceanog, Hersonissos 71500, Crete, Greece; [Boss, Emmanuel] Univ Maine, Orono, ME 04469 USA; [Castagna, Alexandre] Univ Ghent, Protistol & Aquat Ecol Res Grp, Krijgslaan 281, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Frouin, Robert] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, 8810 Shellback Way, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Hieronymi, Martin] HZG, Inst Coastal Res, Max Planck Str 1, D-21502 Geesthacht, Germany; [Jamet, Cedric] Univ Lille, Univ Littoral Cote Opale, CNRS, UMR8187, F-62930 Wimereux, France; [Johnson, B.

Results show that the warming caused by the two forcings results in an increasing trend in total precipitation and a solid-to-liquid precipitation transition in the Arctic. Under RCP8.5 scenario, the increased rate of Arctic mean precipitation with global warming forced by aerosol reduction (7.7%/degrees C) is twice greater than that by increased GHG emission (3.5%/degrees C). The sensitivity of rainfall to precipitation ratio (RPR) to various forcings is much higher than that of total precipitation in the Arctic. The increased rate of RPR due to global aerosol forcing (8.4%/degrees C) is approximately 3 times that due to GHG forcing (2.9%/degrees C) in the Arctic, the differences even larger over Greenland and the eastern Arctic Ocean, resulting in more rainfall in these areas. Plain Language Summary The precipitation phase is extremely sensitive to temperature changes, especially in the Arctic. Solid and liquid precipitation have almost the opposite effect on the ground energy budget. The changes in precipitation phase can greatly affect snow and ice mass balance, regulating the regional hydrological cycle. The transition from solid precipitation to liquid precipitation can even promote carbon release over the permafrost through changing the rate of snow melting. We evaluated the impacts of the two most important anthropogenic forcing agents (greenhouse gases [GHGs] and aerosols) on the changes of precipitation phases in the Arctic using a state-of-the-art Earth system model. We found that the warming forced by global aerosol reduction and increased GHG emission leads to a solid-to-liquid precipitation transition and therefore more rainfall events in the Arctic. Under RCP8.5 scenario, the sensitivity of Arctic precipitation phase to global aerosol forcing is approximately 3 times that to the GHG forcing, and the most sensitive phase changes of Arctic precipitation to the aerosol forcing are observed in Greenland and the eastern Arctic Ocean. Understanding the impact of human activities on the changes in the Arctic precipitation phase will help formulate reasonable emission reduction policies and better adapt to the rapid Arctic climate changes in the future. Key Points Warming forced by global aerosol reduction and increased GHG emission leads to a solid-to-liquid precipitation transition in the Arctic The sensitivity of Arctic precipitation phase to the aerosol forcing is approximately three times that to the GHG forcing The most sensitive phase changes of Arctic precipitation to the aerosol forcing are observed in Greenland and the eastern Arctic Ocean","[Pan, Shifeng; Duan, Mingkeng; Liao, Hong] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteoro, Joint Int Res Lab Climate & Envi, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster,Minist Educ KLME, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Dou, Tingfeng] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Resources & Environm, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Lin, Lei] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Atmospher Sci, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Lin, Lei] Key Lab Trop Atmosphere Ocean Syst, Minist Educ, Zhuhai, Peoples R China; [Lin, Lei] Southern Marine Sci & Engn Guangdong Lab Zhuhai, Zhuhai, Peoples R China; [Yang, Jiao] Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Ecoenvironm & Resources, State Key Lab Cryospher Sci, Lanzhou, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Feng] Fudan Univ, Inst Atmospher Sci, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Feng] Shanghai Qi ZhiInst, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Chuanfeng; Xiao, Cunde] Beijing Normal Univ, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Chuanfeng] Beijing Normal Univ, Coll Global Change & Earth Syst Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China","Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Sun Yat Sen University; Southern Marine Science & Engineering Guangdong Laboratory; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Fudan University; Beijing Normal University; Beijing Normal University","Dou, TF (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Resources & Environm, Beijing, Peoples R China.",doutf@ucas.ac.cn,"Pan, Shifeng/HCI-2366-2022; Zhao, Chuanfeng/O-5626-2019; Liao, Hong/T-7963-2017","Pan, Shifeng/0000-0003-4765-0839; Zhao, Chuanfeng/0000-0002-5196-3996; Liao, Hong/0000-0002-9315-4839","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2018YFC1406103]; National Nature Science Foundation of China [NSFC 41971084, 41925022]; U.S. National Science Foundation",National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Nature Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); U.S. National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),We wish to acknowledge National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) UCAR for CESM1 data.

No final concrete solution has been found so far. In the past few years, problems of transport safety, reprocessing, and interim storage were in the foreground of interest. An issue important for the future is final storage. Consequently, a number of statements are put up below for discussion about the further approach to be taken. - There is no repository for high-level radioactive waste from NPP's anywhere in the world. - The yardsticks for evaluating safe final storage applied in Germany up until 1998 no longer correspond to the state of the art. - Interim storage provides the time horizon necessary for the final site selection procedure. - A new site must be found for a repository. - Final storage is a national responsibility. - International yardsticks must be taken into account in final storage. - On-site interim storage and direct disposal minimize transports. - The definition of residual periods of operation of nuclear power plants limits the waste volume to be managed, and also takes some of the potential for conflicts out of the decision in favor of a specific repository site. - The existing financial regulations requiring reserves to be accumulated for final storage aggravate the construction and operation of a repository and must be replaced by a fund. - The objective must be to have a repository available by 2030. In this societal and technical environment, the development of a repository must be advanced speedily with broad scientific backing of site selection and in a transparent procedure.","Bundesamtes Strahlenschutz, D-38226 Salzgitter, Germany",,"Konig, K (corresponding author), Bundesamtes Strahlenschutz, Willy Brandt Str 5, D-38226 Salzgitter, Germany.",,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,3,VERLAGSGRP HANDELSBLATT GMBH,DUSSELDORF,"POSTFACH 10 11 02, D-40002 DUSSELDORF, GERMANY",1431-5254,,,ATW-INT Z KERNENERG,ATW-Int.

Long-term monitoring of precipitation is thus essential, and satellite-based precipitation products can help in coping with the relatively sparse rain gauge ground networks of this area of the world. However, the complex topography and the marked geographic variability of precipitation in the region make precipitation retrieval from satellites problematic and product validation and intercomparison necessary. Six state-of-the-art monthly satellite precipitation products over East Africa during the 2001-09 time frame are evaluated. Eight areas (clusters) are identified by investigating the precipitation seasonality through the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) climatological gauge data. Seasonality was fully reproduced by satellite data in each of the GPCC-identified clusters. Not surprisingly, complex terrain (mountain regions in particular) represents a challenge for satellite precipitation estimates, as demonstrated by the standard deviations of the six-product ensemble. A further confirmation comes from the comparison between satellite estimates and rain gauge measurements as a function of terrain elevation. The 3B42 product performs best, although the satellite gauge comparative analysis was not completely independent since a few of the products include a rain gauge bias correction.","[Cattani, E.; Levizzani, V.] Natl Res Council Italy, Inst Atmospher Sci & Climate, Bologna, Italy; [Merino, A.] Univ Leon, Dept Appl Phys, Leon, Spain",Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Scienze dell'Atmosfera e del Clima (ISAC-CNR); Universidad de Leon,"Cattani, E (corresponding author), CNR, ISAC, Via Gobetti 101, I-40129 Bologna, Italy.",e.cattani@isac.cnr.it,"Merino, Andrés/L-4845-2014; Cattani, Elsa/B-4198-2018; Levizzani, Vincenzo/A-9070-2013","Merino, Andrés/0000-0001-8806-6263; Cattani, Elsa/0000-0002-2352-7767; Levizzani, Vincenzo/0000-0002-7620-5235","European Union [26225, 603608]",European Union(European Commission),"This study was supported by the European Union's Seventh Programme for research, technological development, and demonstration under Grant Agreements 26225 (GLOWASIS) and 603608 (eartH2Observe).

Concentration polarization effects are observed in these types of membranes when O-2 permeating fluxes are significantly high. These undesired effects can be overcome by the development of new membrane reactors where mass transport and heat transfer are enhanced by adopting state-of-the-art microfabrication. In addition, careful control over the fluid dynamics regime by employing compact metallic reactors equipped with microchannels could allow the rapid extraction of the products, minimizing undesired secondary reactions. Moreover, a high membrane surface area to catalyst volume ratio can be achieved. In this work, a compact metallic reactor was developed for the integration of mixed ionic-electronic conducting ceramic membranes. An asymmetric all-La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta membrane was sealed to the metallic reactor by the reactive air brazing technique. O-2 permeation was evaluated as a proof of concept, and the influence of different parameters, such as temperature, sweep gas flow rates and oxygen partial pressure in the feed gas, were evaluated.","[Escolastico, Sonia; Haas-Santo, Katja; Dittmeyer, Roland] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, IMVT, D-76344 Eggenstein Leopoldshafen, Germany; [Schulze-Kueppers, Falk; Baumann, Stefan] Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Energy & Climate IEK1 Mat Synth & Proc, D-52425 Julich, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; Helmholtz Association; Research Center Julich,"Escolastico, S (corresponding author), Karlsruhe Inst Technol, IMVT, D-76344 Eggenstein Leopoldshafen, Germany.",soesro@itq.upv.es; f.schulze@fz-juelich.de; s.baumann@fz-juelich.de; katja.haas-santo@kit.edu; roland.dittmeyer@kit.edu,"Baumann, Stefan/ABF-3574-2021; Schulze-Kuppers, Falk/Q-6286-2016; Escolastico Rozalen, Sonia/M-1883-2017; Dittmeyer, Roland/R-5041-2017","Baumann, Stefan/0000-0002-7302-7103; Schulze-Kuppers, Falk/0000-0001-6985-3835; Escolastico Rozalen, Sonia/0000-0002-7097-2425; Haas-Santo, Katja/0000-0001-5830-7134; Dittmeyer, Roland/0000-0002-3110-6989",European Commission [608524],European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre),This research was funded by the European Commission in the framework of the GREENCC Project (Grant Agreement no. 608524).,,37,4,4,3,13,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2077-0375,,MEMBRANES-BASEL,Membranes,JUL,2021,7,,,,,,541,10.3390/membranes11070541,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/membranes11070541,,,12,"Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Chemistry, Physical; Engineering, Chemical; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Polymer Science",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Chemistry; Engineering; Materials Science; Polymer Science,TO3CR,34357191,"Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000676794800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here, we document directional hemispherical reflectance measurements of anthropogenic and natural materials gathered along the shorelines of the Chiloe Archipelago, Chile. These spectral observations were completed in a Chilean laboratory using a state-of-the-art hyperspectral HyLogger-3 (TM) thermal infrared (TIR) spectrometer starting from the medium-wave infrared spectrum (6 mu m) and going to the longwave infrared (14.5 mu m) spectrum at 0.025 mu m intervals. The samples we investigated included sands, shells, algae, nautical ropes, Styrofoam (R), gunny sacks and several fragments of plastic-based items. The apparent visible colours of these samples included shades of black, blue, brown, green, orange, white and yellow. We grouped the samples using robust statistical approaches (derivatives, peak-seeking technique) and visual analyses of the derived hyperspectral reflectances. In each group we derived an average or TIR end-member signal and determined diagnostic wavebands. Most of the diagnostic wavebands picked were found to be inside the atmospheric window of the TIR spectrum region. Furthermore, this laboratory reference dataset and findings might become useful in related field observations using similar thermal infrared technologies, especially in identifying anomalies resulting from environmental and meteorological perturbations. Validation and verification of proposed diagnostic wavebands would be part of a continuing effort to advance TIR remote sensing knowledge as well as support robust detection algorithm development to potentially distinguish plastics in litter throughout the natural environments.","[Garaba, Shungudzemwoyo P.] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Inst Chem & Biol Marine Environm, Marine Sensor Syst Grp, Schleusenstr 1, D-26382 Wilhelmshaven, Germany; [Acuna-Ruz, Tomas] Univ Chile, Lab Anal Biosphere LAB, Av Santa Rosa 11315, Santiago, Chile; [Mattar, Cristian B.] Univ Aysen, Lab Geosci Geolab, Obispo Vielmo 62, Coyhaique, Chile",Carl von Ossietzky Universitat Oldenburg; Universidad de Chile,"Garaba, SP (corresponding author), Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Inst Chem & Biol Marine Environm, Marine Sensor Syst Grp, Schleusenstr 1, D-26382 Wilhelmshaven, Germany.",shungu.garaba@uni-oldenburg.de,"ACUÑA RUZ, TOMAS IGNACIO/Q-6659-2018; ACUÑA RUZ, TOMAS IGNACIO/Q-9556-2018","ACUÑA RUZ, TOMAS IGNACIO/0000-0002-2748-4602; ACUÑA RUZ, TOMAS IGNACIO/0000-0002-2748-4602; Garaba, Shungu/0000-0002-9656-3881","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [417276871]; Discovery element of the European Space Agency's Basic Activities (ESA) [4000132037/20/NL/GLC]; Agencia de Sustentabilidad y Cambio Climatico (ASCC - Agency of Sustainability and Climate Change); INNOVA CSIRO-CHILE project (run by the HL3) [10CEII-9007]; Estudio para la generacion de un modelo predictivo de residuos en 3 playas de Chiloe, mediante Teledeteccion Cuantitativa (PRED-RES Chiloe)","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Discovery element of the European Space Agency's Basic Activities (ESA); Agencia de Sustentabilidad y Cambio Climatico (ASCC - Agency of Sustainability and Climate Change); INNOVA CSIRO-CHILE project (run by the HL3); Estudio para la generacion de un modelo predictivo de residuos en 3 playas de Chiloe, mediante Teledeteccion Cuantitativa (PRED-RES Chiloe)","The study was funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (grant no. 417276871); the Discovery element of the European Space Agency's Basic Activities (ESA contract no. 4000132037/20/NL/GLC); Estudio para la generacion de un modelo predictivo de residuos en 3 playas de Chiloe, mediante Teledeteccion Cuantitativa (PRED-RES Chiloe); Agencia de Sustentabilidad y Cambio Climatico (ASCC - Agency of Sustainability and Climate Change); and the INNOVA CSIRO-CHILE 10CEII-9007 project (run by the HL3).",,39,7,7,4,8,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1866-3508,1866-3516,,EARTH SYST SCI DATA,Earth Syst.

The proposed context-self contrastive loss (CSCL) learns an embedding space that makes semantic boundaries pop-up by use of a similarity metric between every location in a training sample and its local context. For crop type semantic segmentation from satellite image time series (SITS), we find performance at parcel boundaries to be a critical bottleneck and explain how CSCL tackles the underlying cause of that problem, improving the state-of-the-art performance in this task. Additionally, using images from the Sentinel-2 (S2) satellite missions we compile the largest, to our knowledge, SITS dataset densely annotated by crop type and parcel identities, which we make publicly available together with the data generation pipeline. Using that data we find CSCL, even with minimal pretraining, to improve all respective baselines and present a process for semantic segmentation at greater resolution than that of the input images for obtaining crop classes at a more granular level.

In this study, we compare the results of five state-of-the-art global hydrological models (GHMs) with observations to examine the role of human impact parameterizations (HIP) in the simulation of mean, high-and low-flows. The analysis is performed for 471 gauging stations across the globe for the period 1971-2010. We find that the inclusion of HIP improves the performance of the GHMs, both in managed and near-natural catchments. For near-natural catchments, the improvement in performance results from improvements in incoming discharges from upstream managed catchments. This finding is robust across the GHMs, although the level of improvement and the reasons for it vary greatly. The inclusion of HIP leads to a significant decrease in the bias of the long-term mean monthly discharge in 36%-73% of the studied catchments, and an improvement in the modeled hydrological variability in 31%-74% of the studied catchments. Including HIP in the GHMs also leads to an improvement in the simulation of hydrological extremes, compared to when HIP is excluded. Whilst the inclusion of HIP leads to decreases in the simulated high-flows, it can lead to either increases or decreases in the low-flows. This is due to the relative importance of the timing of return flows and reservoir operations as well as their associated uncertainties. Even with the inclusion of HIP, we find that the model performance is still not optimal. This highlights the need for further research linking human management and hydrological domains, especially in those areas in which human impacts are dominant. The large variation in performance between GHMs, regions and performance indicators, calls for a careful selection of GHMs, model components and evaluation metrics in future model applications.","[Veldkamp, T.

A process step that is very sensitive to the presence of nonmetallic inclusion (NMI) is continuous casting. Here, the so-called clogging phenomenon can occur, resulting in a distinct disruption of the casting process and decreased steel quality. The presence of nonmetallic inclusions considerably contributes to the build-up of deposits in the submerged entry nozzle provoking instabilities in the flow control system. Numerous research studies have been subject to different clogging mechanisms and related influencing parameters. Interfacial properties significantly influence the behavior of inclusions in the steel-refractory system. The present review demonstrates state of the art concerning the role of NMIs in the appearance of clogging. Particular focus is put on the wetting behavior between the different phases and their consequence for the deposition process. Industrial observations and laboratory methods are summarized and discussed; potential countermeasures are evaluated. A steel group that is especially prone to clogging are Ti- ultra low carbon (ULC) steels. An overview of the current understanding of their high clogging tendency and possible influences is presented, considering thermodynamic and interfacial aspects.","[Michelic, Susanne K.] Univ Leoben, Christian Doppler Lab Inclus Met Adv Steelmaking, Franz Josef Str 18, A-8700 Leoben, Austria; [Bernhard, Christian] Univ Leoben, Chair Ferrous Met, Franz Josef Str 18, A-8700 Leoben, Austria",University of Leoben; University of Leoben,"Michelic, SK (corresponding author), Univ Leoben, Christian Doppler Lab Inclus Met Adv Steelmaking, Franz Josef Str 18, A-8700 Leoben, Austria.",susanne.michelic@unileoben.ac.at,,"Bernhard, Christian/0000-0003-3976-9725","K1-MET GmbH, metallurgical competence center; COMET (Competence Center for Excellent Technologies), the Austrian program for competence centers; Federal Ministry for Climate Action, Environment, Energy, Mobility, Innovation and Technology; Federal Ministry for Digital and Economic Affairs; province of Upper Austria; province of Tyrol; province of Styria; Styrian Business Promotion Agency (SFG); Austrian Federal Ministry for Digital and Economic Affairs; National Foundation for Research, Technology and Development; Christian Doppler Research Association","K1-MET GmbH, metallurgical competence center; COMET (Competence Center for Excellent Technologies), the Austrian program for competence centers; Federal Ministry for Climate Action, Environment, Energy, Mobility, Innovation and Technology; Federal Ministry for Digital and Economic Affairs; province of Upper Austria; province of Tyrol; province of Styria; Styrian Business Promotion Agency (SFG); Austrian Federal Ministry for Digital and Economic Affairs; National Foundation for Research, Technology and Development; Christian Doppler Research Association","The work of Uxia Dieguez-Salgado, Philipp Dorrer and Augustin Karasangabo performed during their Ph.D. theses on clogging-related topics is greatly acknowledged.

Nevertheless, the capacity to predict spatial patterns of alien species richness remains largely unassessed. Using 22 data sets of alien species richness from diverse taxonomic groups and covering various parts of the world, we evaluated whether different statistical models were able to provide useful predictions of absolute and relative alien species richness, as a function of explanatory variables representing geographical, environmental and socio-economic factors. Five state-of-the-art count data modelling techniques were used and compared: Poisson and negative binomial generalised linear models (GLMs), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), random forests (RF) and boosted regression trees (BRT). We found that predictions of absolute alien species richness had a low to moderate accuracy in the region where the models were developed and a consistently poor accuracy in new regions. Predictions of relative richness performed in a superior manner in both geographical settings, but still were not good. Flexible tree ensembles-type techniques (RF and BRT) were shown to be significantly better in modelling alien species richness than parametric linear models (such as GLM), despite the latter being more commonly applied for this purpose. Importantly, the poor spatial transferability of models also warrants caution in assuming the generality of the relationships they identify, e.g. by applying projections under future scenario conditions. Ultimately, our results strongly suggest that predictability of spatial variation in richness of alien species richness is limited. The somewhat more robust ability to rank regions according to the number of aliens they have (i.e. relative richness), suggests that models of aliens species richness may be useful for prioritising and comparing regions, but not for predicting exact species numbers.","[Capinha, Cesar; Pereira, Henrique Miguel] Univ Porto, Ctr Invest Biodiversidade & Recursos Genet, CIBIO InBIO, Campus Agrario Vairao, P-4485661 Vairao, Portugal; [Capinha, Cesar] Zool Forsch Museum Alexander Koenig, Adenauerallee 160, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Essl, Franz] Univ Vienna, Div Conservat Biol Vegetat & Landscape Ecol, Rennweg 14, A-1030 Vienna, Austria; [Seebens, Hanno] Senckenberg Biodivers & Climate Res Ctr SBiK F, Senckenberganlage 25, D-60325 Frankfurt, Germany; [Pereira, Henrique Miguel; Kuehn, Ingolf] Martin Luther Univ Halle Wittenbetg, Inst Biol, Geobot & Bot Garden, Kirchtor 1, D-06108 Halle, Germany; [Pereira, Henrique Miguel; Kuehn, Ingolf] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Deutsch Pl 5e, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Kuehn, Ingolf] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Community Ecol, Theodor Lieser Str 4, D-06120 Halle, Germany",Universidade do Porto; Zoologisches Forschungsmuseum Alexander Koenig (ZFMK); University of Vienna; Senckenberg Biodiversitat & Klima- Forschungszentrum (BiK-F); Senckenberg Gesellschaft fur Naturforschung (SGN); Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ),"Capinha, C (corresponding author), Univ Porto, Ctr Invest Biodiversidade & Recursos Genet, CIBIO InBIO, Campus Agrario Vairao, P-4485661 Vairao, Portugal.;Capinha, C (corresponding author), Zool Forsch Museum Alexander Koenig, Adenauerallee 160, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.",ccapinha@cibio.up.pt,"Pereira, Henrique/B-3975-2009; Essl, Franz/ABE-7064-2020; Capinha, César D/K-6439-2017; Kühn, Ingolf/B-9756-2009; Seebens, Hanno/I-2310-2019","Pereira, Henrique/0000-0003-1043-1675; Essl, Franz/0000-0001-8253-2112; Capinha, César D/0000-0002-0666-9755; Kühn, Ingolf/0000-0003-1691-8249; Seebens, Hanno/0000-0001-8993-6419",FEDER Funds through the Operational Competitiveness Factors Programme COMPETE; National Funds through the Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT) [PTDC/AAG-GLO/0463/2014-PO-CI-01-0145-FEDER-016583]; Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [I2086-B16]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) [SE 1891/2-1],FEDER Funds through the Operational Competitiveness Factors Programme COMPETE; National Funds through the Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT)(Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology); Austrian Science Fund (FWF)(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"We acknowledge the comments from one anonymous reviewer and Cang Hui who helped to improve the manuscript.

In June 2011, a comprehensive data set of ground-based and airborne in situ measurements and remote sensing observations was acquired within the Fennec/Lagrangian Dust Source Inversion Experiment (LADUNEX) field campaign in the western Sahara region. Here we evaluate the ability of the state-of-the-art Lagrangian particle dispersion model FLEXPART, newly fitted with a dust mobilization capability, to simulate dust transport in this region. We investigate a case where a large mesoscale convective system (MCS) triggered dust emissions in central Mali, which subsequently moved as a large cold pool dust front toward northern Mauritania. Specifying dust mobilization for this case is shown to be an important obstacle to simulating dust transport during this event, since neither the MCS nor the associated cold pool-causing dust emission is represented in the meteorological analysis. Obtaining a realistic dust transport simulation for this case therefore requires an inversion approach using a manual specification of the dust sources supported by satellite imagery. When compared to in situ and remote sensing data from two aircraft, the Lagrangian dust transport simulations represent the overall shape and evolution of the dust plume well. While accumulation and coarse mode dust are well represented in the simulation, giant mode particles are considerably underestimated. Our results re-emphasize that dust emission associated with deep moist convection remains a key issue for reliable dust model simulations in northern Africa.","[Sodemann, H.; Lai, T.

Optimum use requires specific objectives to be defined in advance, including a review of the potential impact of the test on subsequent decisions. An additional issue that is subject to scrutiny in the current climate of cost containment relates to the incremental value of a specific examination. The imaging modality to be used will partially depend on other issues, including accessibility, cost, and interindividual or institutional expertise with a particular technique. Major applications in noninvasive imaging in the acute coronary syndromes include the following: 1) diagnosis, including identification of associated diseases and contraindications for acute reperfusion; 2) evaluation and management of complications (mechanical and nonmechanical); 3) determination of prognosis (both early and late); 4) estimation of myocardial viability; 5) assessment of therapeutic efficacy; 6) investigational approaches, including Tc-99m-sestamibi tomographic imaging, ultrafast cine computed tomographic scanning, and nuclear magnetic resonance imaging. Previous studies in the prethrombolytic era have documented the powerful impact of radionuclide stress testing on prognosis, but this needs to be reevaluated in the light of the changing current population undergoing stress testing. Preliminary data imply that the prognostic accuracy of stress testing after thrombolytic therapy is diminished. Moreover, the role of the open infarct-related artery in traditional estimates of prognosis (e.g., ejection fraction) requires further study. Noninvasive imaging has multiple applications in the diagnosis and management of patients with acute coronary disease, but the decision to use a specific technology in a particular circumstance mandates good clinical judgment and selectivity.",,,"GERSH, BJ (corresponding author), MAYO CLIN & MAYO FDN,DIV CARDIOVASC DIS & INTERNAL MED,200 1ST ST SW,ROCHESTER,MN 55905, USA.",,,,,,,,82,6,6,0,0,AMER HEART ASSOC,DALLAS,"7272 GREENVILLE AVENUE, DALLAS, TX 75231-4596",0009-7322,,,CIRCULATION,Circulation,SEP,1991,3,,,,I140,I147,,,,,,8,Cardiac & Cardiovascular Systems; Peripheral Vascular Disease,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Cardiovascular System & Cardiology,GF388,1832098,,,,12/21/22,WOS:A1991GF38800019,View Full Record in Web of Science

The fundamental suitability of [2-Sea(+)][TfO-] for application as a protic electrolyte in high temperature PEM fuel cells (HT-PEFCs) was investigated up to a temperature of 130 degrees C. A comparison was made against a state-of-the-art electrolyte, phosphoric acid. [2-Sea(+)][TfO-] is electrochemically and thermally stable up to 140 degrees C. The specific conductivity of 95 wt% [2-Sea(+)][TfO-] aqueous solution at 130 degrees C is approximate to 20 times lower compared to 95 wt% H3PO4. The strong coupling of ion transport and viscous flow suggests a vehicular ion (proton) transport in [2-Sea(+)][TfO-]. 95 wt% [2-Sea(+)][TfO-] shows superior kinetics in terms of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on polycrystalline Pt compared to 95 wt% H3PO4 at temperatures greater than 90 degrees C in a fuel cell-applicable potential range. Double layer capacitances suggest a complex double layer structure, including adsorbed [2-Sea(+)][TfO-] and water, as well as intermediates of oxygen reduction and Pt oxidation. Potential and temperature-dependent ORR kinetics in the presence of 95 wt% [2-Sea(+)][TfO-] yield different Tafel slopes (b = 82-139 mV) and symmetry factors (beta = 0.46-0.96), indicating changes in surface coverages of the adsorbed species and possibly also a change in the reaction mechanism.

In this study, the authors report that high-compressive 3D Pt nanostructured thin films can considerably increase the catalytic activity and electrochemical durability of electrocatalysts under PEMFC device operating conditions. The nanostructure fabrication relies on the dealloying or selective leaching of solid alloys of Pt-C binary film to produce a residual 3D nanoporous thin-film structure. A very rich structural behavior from the dealloying is shown, in which stress relief plays a governing role; the films possess a 3D structure of randomly interpenetrating ligaments and hierarchical pores with sizes between less than 50 nm and several tens of micrometers. In addition, a significant change is observed in the average lattice constant (1.55% compressive strain), which can tune the structural and electronic states of catalytic sites for enhancing the activity of the Pt electrocatalysts. Electrochemical performance of the fabricated porous strained Pt thin-film electrocatalysts in both half-cell and single-cell analyses has demonstrated activity and durability superior to benchmark carbon support Pt catalysts.","[Hwang, Chang-Kyu; Kim, Jong Min; Hwang, Sehoon; Kim, Joo-Hyung; Sung, Chang Hyun; Moon, Byung-Moo; Chae, Keun Hwa; Singh, Jitendra Pal; Kim, Seung-Hoon; Jang, Seung Soon; Lee, Seung Woo; Ham, Hyung Chul; Han, Seunghee; Kim, Jin Young] Korea Inst Sci & Technol, Ctr Hydrogen Fuel Cell Res, 14 Gil 5 Hwarang Ro, Seoul 02792, South Korea; [Hwang, Chang-Kyu; Moon, Byung-Moo] Korea Univ, Dept Elect Engn, 145 Anam Ro, Seoul 02841, South Korea; [Kim, Jong Min] KIST, Mat Architecturing Res Ctr, Seoul 02792, South Korea; [Ham, Hyung Chul] Inha Univ, Dept Chem Engn, 100 Inha Ro, Incheon 22212, South Korea; [Hwang, Sehoon; Han, Seunghee] Korea Inst Sci & Technol, Photo Elect Hybrids Res Ctr, 14 Gil 5 Hwarang Ro, Seoul 02792, South Korea; [Chae, Keun Hwa; Singh, Jitendra Pal] Korea Inst Sci & Technol, Adv Anal Ctr, 14 Gil 5 Hwarang Ro, Seoul 02792, South Korea; [Kim, Seung-Hoon] Korea Univ, Grad Sch Energy & Environm, Green Sch, Seoul 02841, South Korea; [Jang, Seung Soon] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, 771 Ferst Dr NW, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Lee, Seung Woo] Georgia Inst Technol, GW Woodruff Sch Mech Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA",Korea Institute of Science & Technology (KIST); Korea University; Korea Institute of Science & Technology (KIST); Inha University; Korea Institute of Science & Technology (KIST); Korea Institute of Science & Technology (KIST); Korea University; University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology; University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology,"Han, S; Kim, JY (corresponding author), Korea Inst Sci & Technol, Ctr Hydrogen Fuel Cell Res, 14 Gil 5 Hwarang Ro, Seoul 02792, South Korea.;Han, S (corresponding author), Korea Inst Sci & Technol, Photo Elect Hybrids Res Ctr, 14 Gil 5 Hwarang Ro, Seoul 02792, South Korea.",shhan@kist.re.kr; jinykim@kist.re.kr,"Jang, Seung Soon/C-6847-2008; Singh, Jitendra Pal/G-7221-2015","Jang, Seung Soon/0000-0002-1920-421X; Singh, Jitendra Pal/0000-0001-8500-8236; Kim, Joo-Hyung/0000-0003-4247-2850; Kim, Seung-hoon/0000-0002-5990-0738","KIST Institutional Program [2E28271]; Global Frontier R&D Program on Center for Multiscale Energy System - Nation Research Foundation under the Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning, Korea [2016M3A6A7945505]; Technology Development Program to Solve Climate Changes of the National Research Foundation (NRF) - Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning [NRF-2015M1A2A2056690]; Korea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation and Planning (KETEP) - Korea government (MOTIE) [20188550000440]; Inha University Research Grant","KIST Institutional Program(Korea Institute of Science & Technology (KIST)); Global Frontier R&D Program on Center for Multiscale Energy System - Nation Research Foundation under the Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning, Korea; Technology Development Program to Solve Climate Changes of the National Research Foundation (NRF) - Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning; Korea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation and Planning (KETEP) - Korea government (MOTIE); Inha University Research Grant","C.-K.H. and J.M.K. contributed equally to this work.

Given its importance, researchers are attempting to disentangle complex interactions between landscapes and river temperatures. We investigated how landscape variables of geomorphology, geology, and vegetation can explain a large portion of the spatial variations amongst tributary temperatures in the large, Miramichi watershed, New Brunswick. We utilize thermal infrared imagery (TIR) to characterize river temperature and remote sensed data to delineate landscape variables. Partial Least Squares regression (PLS) models indicated that variability in river temperature was associated with landscape attributes, but these differed with physiography. For the Clearwater Brook and Burnthill Brook watersheds located on the Miramichi Highlands physiographic unit, solar radiation exposure, surficial geology deposit (comprising gravels, sands, and minor silt), geological contact zones, and maximum watershed slope were strongly and positively correlated with river temperature. We stipulate that the interaction of slope steepness and geologic contact zones can produce complex local and larger groundwater interactions influencing river temperatures in this physiographic region. In the lower elevation, and lower relief, Cains River watershed, located on the Maritime Plains physiographic unit, watershed elevation and wetlands were significant and positively correlated with river temperatures. Here the main stem was cooler in the downstream reaches, likely due to the semi-confined channel interaction with groundwater discharge originating from the surficial deposits and fractured underlying sandstone of the lowlands, and possibly hyporheic processes. These findings illustrate how physiography and geomorphology influence thermal processes in flowing waters at both the landscape and local scales, and the resultant implications for management and conservation efforts both in terms of land use and climate change.","[O'Sullivan, Antoin M.; Curry, R.

The energy transition towards carbon-neutrality: lessons learned from the case of Roeselare, Belgium",RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Greenhouse gas inventory; Decarbonisation strategy; Energy potential map; Roadshow; Sustainable city,,"As climate change develops, with most of the world population living in urban areas, decarbonisation of cities is among the greatest challenges of the coming decades. In the framework of the EU City-zen project, a number of so-called Roadshows has been organised in ten cities within and outside Europe in order to plan and kick-off their transition towards an energy- and climate-neutral economy. During the Roadshows, a group of experts is engaged to perform co-working activities and participative labs involving local stakeholders. These activities support cities in identifying their own decarbonisation pathways, mainly by combining three mutual processes, i.e. energy design, urban design and carbon accounting. The latter, in particular, has been used to quantify the greenhouse gas emissions of cities and neighbourhoods and to estimate the mitigation effect of a combination of measures towards the desirable condition of carbon neutrality. This exploratory and proactive design process has been successfully demonstrated through intensive workshops and can be potentially replicated in other cities. This paper provides a schematic overview of the main results achieved in the Belgian town of Roeselare, but more significantly it describes the techniques needed to make that cooperative process understandable, impactful and implementable. It is likely that 2050 European goals will drastically change urban environments and socioeconomic dynamics in cities, due to the fragmentation of energy sources. Hence, from this standpoint there is a vital need for integrated technologies and infrastructures, a circular economy and community-based processes such as food production, sharing of facilities and valorisation of ecosystem services. The City-zen Roeselare Roadshow brought over 300 stakeholders into the process of re-imagining and visualising their 2050 future city with these solutions. Stakeholders, with no particular expertise in carbon accounting or sustainability, would now have the capability of understanding and applying these solutions in a combined effort to meet the zero-carbon challenge. The approach is generally replicable elsewhere being highly visual, impactful, transferable, and multi-stakeholder friendly. Given that data are made locally available, the combination of this general approach, site-specific assessments and the involvement of both experts and local stakeholders (i.e. policy makers, citizens, etc) allow the transition to start by referring to any real city or neighbourhood.","[Pulselli, Riccardo Maria] Univ Siena IT, Santa Chiara Lab, Siena, Italy; [Broersma, Siebe; van den Dobbelsteen, Andy] Delft Univ Technol NL, Fac Architecture & Built Environm, Delft, Netherlands; [Martin, Craig Lee] Univ Cent Lancashire UK, Sch Art Design & Fash, Preston, Lancs, England; [Keeffe, Greg] Queens Univ Belfast UK, Sch Nat & Built Environm, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland; [Bastianoni, Simone] Univ Siena IT, Ecodynam Grp, Dept Phys Sci Earth & Environm, Siena, Italy",,"Pulselli, RM (corresponding author), Univ Siena IT, Santa Chiara Lab, Siena, Italy.",pulselli@unisi.it,"郭, 青霞/GZH-2618-2022; Bastianoni, Simone/K-6721-2015","Bastianoni, Simone/0000-0002-6470-7377; Martin, Craig Lee/0000-0003-0239-1298; Pulselli, Riccardo Maria/0000-0001-8340-4040; Keeffe, Greg/0000-0003-4588-2660",European Union's Seventh Programme for Research and Technological Development and Demonstration [608702],European Union's Seventh Programme for Research and Technological Development and Demonstration,The present study has been developed for implementing the activities of the City-zen project that has received funding from the European Union's Seventh Programme for Research and Technological Development and Demonstration under grant agreement No 608702.,,43,20,20,11,87,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",1364-0321,1879-0690,,RENEW SUST ENERG REV,Renew.

Measurement of water reflectance requires the measurement of water-leaving radiance and downwelling irradiance just above water. For the former there are four generic families of method, based on: (1) underwater radiometry at fixed depths; or (2) underwater radiometry with vertical profiling; or (3) above-water radiometry with skyglint correction; or (4) on-water radiometry with skylight blocked. Each method is described generically in the FRM context with reference to the measurement equation, documented implementations and the intra-method diversity of deployment platform and practice. Ideal measurement conditions are stated, practical recommendations are provided on best practice and guidelines for estimating the measurement uncertainty are provided for each protocol-related component of the measurement uncertainty budget. The state of the art for measurement of water-leaving radiance is summarized, future perspectives are outlined, and the question of which method is best adapted to various circumstances (water type, wavelength) is discussed. This review is based on practice and papers of the aquatic optics community for the validation of water reflectance estimated from satellite data but can be relevant also for other applications such as the development or validation of algorithms for remote-sensing estimation of water constituents including chlorophyll a concentration, inherent optical properties and related products.","[Ruddick, Kevin G.] Royal Belgian Inst Nat Sci RBINS, Operat Directorate Nat Environm, 29 Rue Vautierstr, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium; [Voss, Kenneth] Univ Miami, Dept Phys, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA; [Boss, Emmanuel] Univ Maine, Sch Marine Sci, Orono, ME 04469 USA; [Castagna, Alexandre] Univ Ghent, Protistol & Aquat Ecol Res Grp, Krijgslaan 281, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Frouin, Robert] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, 9500 Gilman Dr 0224, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Gilerson, Alex] CUNY City Coll, Dept Elect Engn, 160 Convent Ave, New York, NY 10031 USA; [Hieronymi, Martin] Helmholtz Zentrum Geesthacht HZG, Inst Coastal Res, Max Planck Str 1, D-21502 Geesthacht, Germany; [Johnson, B.

Transcriptional studies on responses to heat stress have been conducted in catfish, one of the most important economic aquaculture species around the world. The molecular mechanisms underlying heat tolerance is still poorly understood, especially at the post-transcriptional level including regulation of alternative splicing. In this study, existing RNA-Seq datasets were utilized to characterize the change of alternative splicing in catfish following heat treatment. Heat-tolerant and-intolerant catfish were differentiated by the time to lost equilibrium after heat stress. With heat stress, alternative splicing was generally increased. In heat-intolerant fish, the thermal stress induced 29.2% increases in alternative splicing events and 25.8% increases in alternatively spliced genes. A total of 282, 189, and 44 differential alternative splicing (DAS) events were identified in control intolerant, control-tolerant, and intolerant-tolerant comparisons, corresponding to 252, 171, and 42 genes, respectively. Gene ontology analyses showed that genes involved in the molecular function of RNA binding were significantly enriched in DAS gene sets after heat stress in both heat-intolerant and-tolerant catfish compared with the control group. Similar results were also observed in the DAS genes between heat-intolerant and-tolerant catfish, and the biological process of RNA splicing was also enriched in this comparison, indicating the involvement of RNA splicing-related genes underlying heat tolerance. This is the first comprehensive study of alternative splicing in response to heat stress in fish species, providing insights into the molecular mechanisms of responses to the abiotic stress.","[Tan, Suxu; Wang, Wenwen; Tian, Changxu; Niu, Donghong; Zhou, Tao; Jin, Yulin; Yang, Yujia; Gao, Dongya; Dunham, Rex] Auburn Univ, Sch Fisheries Aquaculture & Aquat Sci, Fish Mol Genet & Biotechnol Lab, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Niu, Donghong] Shanghai Ocean Univ, Coll Life Sci, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Liu, Zhanjiang] Syracuse Univ, Dept Biol, Coll Art & Sci, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA",Auburn University System; Auburn University; Shanghai Ocean University; Syracuse University,"Liu, ZJ (corresponding author), Syracuse Univ, Dept Biol, Coll Art & Sci, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA.",johnliu@syr.edu,"Liu, Zhanjiang/R-9633-2019; Tan, Suxu/AAG-1790-2021","Tan, Suxu/0000-0001-9618-1472; Jin, Yulin/0000-0002-7142-5589; Zhou, Tao/0000-0002-2353-7404","Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (AFRI) Competitive Grants from the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), under the Animal Health Program, and the Animal Breeding, Genetics and Genomics Program [2015-67015-22975, 2017-67015-26295]; China Scholarship Council","Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (AFRI) Competitive Grants from the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), under the Animal Health Program, and the Animal Breeding, Genetics and Genomics Program; China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council)","This project was supported by Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (AFRI) Competitive Grants (2015-67015-22975 and 2017-67015-26295) from the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), under the Animal Health Program, and the Animal Breeding, Genetics and Genomics Program.

Resolving these waves in state-of-the-art atmospheric models still remains challenging. Also, their time-dependent excitation process cannot be represented by a common GW drag parametrization with static launch distribution. Thus, the aim of this paper is to investigate the excitation and three-dimensional propagation of GWs forced by deep convection in the troposphere and estimate their influence on the middle atmosphere. For that purpose, the GW ray tracer Gravity-wave Regional Or Global Ray Tracer (GROGRAT) has been coupled to the Yonsei convective GW source model. The remaining free model parameters have been constrained by measurements. This work led to a coupled convective GW model representing convective GWs forced from small cells of deep convection up to large-scale convective clusters. In order to compare our simulation results with observed global distributions of momentum flux, limitations of satellite instruments were taken into account: The observational filter of a limb-viewing satellite instrument restricts measurements of GWs to waves with horizontal wavelengths longer than 100 km. Convective GWs, however, often have shorter wavelengths. This effect is taken into account when comparing simulated and observable GW spectra. We find good overall agreement between simulated and observed GW global distributions, if superimposed with a nonorographic background spectrum for higher-latitude coverage. Our findings indicate that parts of the convective GW spectrum can indeed be observed by limb-sounding satellites.","[Kalisch, S.; Ern, M.; Preusse, P.; Trinh, Q.

The proposed classifier is a fusion of the ordering algorithm, Fuzzy ARTMAP (FAM) and the Dynamic Decay Adjustment (DDA) algorithm. The network, called Ordered FAMDDA, inherits the benefits of the trio, viz. an ability to identify a fixed order of training pattern presentation for good generalisation; stable and incrementally leaming architecture; and dynamic width adjustment of the weights of hidden nodes of conflicting classes. Classification performance of the Ordered FAMDDA is assessed using two benchmark datasets. The performances are analysed and compared with those from FAM and Ordered FAM. The results indicate that the Ordered FAMDDA classifier performs at least as good as the mentioned networks. The proposed Ordered FAMDDA network is then applied to a condition monitoring problem in a power generation station. The process under scrutiny is the Circulating Water (CW) system, with prime attention to condition monitoring of the heat transfer efficiency of the condensers.

It is a chemical of environmental concern as it readily reacts with atmospheric acids to produce fine particulate matter and indirectly contributes to nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. Here, we present the first tall tower observations of NH3 within the U.S. Corn Belt for the period April 2017 through December 2018. Hourly average NH3 mixing ratios were measured at 100 and 56 m above the ground surface and fluxes were estimated using a modified gradient approach. The highest NH3 mixing ratios (>30 nmol mol(-1)) occurred during early spring and late fall, coinciding with the timing of fertilizer application within the region and the occurrence of warm air temperatures. Net ecosystem NH3 exchange was greatest in spring and fall with peak emissions of about +50 nmol m(-2) s(-1). Annual NH3 emissions estimated using state-of-the-art inventories ranged from 0.6 to 1.4 x the mean annual gross tall tower fluxes (+2.1 nmol m(-2) s(-1)). If the tall tower observations are representative of the Upper Midwest and broader U.S. Corn Belt regions, the annual gross emissions were +720 Gg NH3-N y(-1) and +1,340 Gg NH3-N y(-1), respectively. Finally, considering the N2O budget over the same region, we estimated total reactive N emissions (i.e., N2O+NH3) of approximately 1,790 Gg N y(-1) from the U.S. Corn Belt, representing similar to 23% of the current annual new N input.","[Griffis, Timothy J.; Hu, Cheng; Baker, John M.; Millet, Dylan B.; Erickson, Mathew; Yu, Zhongjie; Deventer, M.

AGARDH RAFTS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; BALTIC PROPER; SEA; TEMPERATURE; SEAWEED; PERSISTENCE; SURFACE; VARIABILITY,"Floating algae can be found in high abundances at mid and high latitudes, their prolonged positive buoyancy allowing long-distance dispersal. However, despite their importance to dispersal and ecological and evolutionary meta-population dynamics, little is known about the buoyancy responses of high latitude algae to the conditions at the sea surface. Indeed, even at 60 degrees N environmental conditions during spring/summer can be challenging, and may cause the demise and sinking of floating algae. The bladderwrack Fucus vesiculosus from the Northern Baltic Sea floats on the sea surface when detached from the benthic substratum. We conducted a field experiment with tethered individuals during their reproductive period to measure variation in floating time and how that is related to morphological traits such as occurrence of vesicles and/or receptacles, and to measure growth and photosynthesis while afloat. Algal individuals with receptacles tended to sink quickly, whereas the longest floating time was evident for individuals carrying vesicles but lacking receptacles. While afloat, all individuals grew in size, showed photosynthetic acclimation to sea surface conditions and had a few invertebrates associated with them. Our results showed that rafts of F. vesiculosus were physiologically viable until their day of sinking and that morphological traits such as the occurrence of vesicles and receptacles modified their floating time. Accordingly, floating algae with a similar morphological set-up, and thus also reproductive phenology, to F. vesiculosus can have a high floating persistence, but, depending on their reproductive structures, they may mostly serve as long-range dispersal vehicles for associated organisms.","[Rothausler, Eva; Rugiu, Luca; Tiihonen, Tiina; Jormalainen, Veijo] Univ Turku, Dept Biol, Turku, Finland; [Rothausler, Eva] Univ Atacama, CIC, UDA, Ave Copayapu 485, Copiapo, Atacama, Chile; [Rugiu, Luca] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Marine Sci, Tjarno, Sweden",University of Turku; Universidad de Atacama; University of Gothenburg,"Rothausler, E (corresponding author), Univ Turku, Dept Biol, Turku, Finland.;Rothausler, E (corresponding author), Univ Atacama, CIC, UDA, Ave Copayapu 485, Copiapo, Atacama, Chile.",eva.rothausler@uda.cl,,"Rothausler, Eva/0000-0002-3185-4290; Jormalainen, Veijo/0000-0001-6346-2585","Academy of Finland [273623]; BONUS project BAMBI, the joint Baltic Sea research and development programme (Art 185) - European Union","Academy of Finland(Academy of Finland); BONUS project BAMBI, the joint Baltic Sea research and development programme (Art 185) - European Union","This study was financed by the Academy of Finland (Decision #273623) and the BONUS project BAMBI, the joint Baltic Sea research and development programme (Art 185), funded jointly from the European Union's Seventh Programme for research, technological development and demonstration and various national research funding agencies of the Baltic Sea countries.",,59,5,5,1,13,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-0262,1469-4433,,EUR J PHYCOL,Eur.

However, social and regulatory factors may constrain UNG activity at regional scales. Robust impact assessments of the effects of the UNG industry at different phases of development could help reduce trade-offs of energy policy and promote overall welfare improvements. We assessed if the early phases of the coal seam gas (CSG, a type of UNG) industry in New South Wales, Australia produced regional economic changes between 2001 and 2011. We combined spatial econometrics, genetic matching algorithms and seemingly unrelated regressions with instrumental variables to control for multiple factors influencing regional economic patterns (e.g., climate, human capital) to estimate the effect of the CSG industry on local income and employment. Results show that regions with CSG activity had 7% (+/- 5%, 95% C.I.) higher family income than regions without CSG mining. No statistical evidence of indirect employment multiplier effects from CSG activity were found. The analysis can inform social license and regulatory decisions related to the CSG industry that impact competing social priorities such as energy and water security, economic growth and environmental health.","[Marcos-Martinez, Raymundo] CSIRO, Land & Water, Black Mt, ACT 2601, Australia; [Marcos-Martinez, Raymundo] Univ South Australia, Sch Commerce, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Measham, Thomas G.; Fleming-Munoz, David A.] CSIRO, Land & Water, Dutton Pk, Qld 4102, Australia",Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); University of South Australia; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Marcos-Martinez, R (corresponding author), CSIRO, Land & Water, Black Mt, ACT 2601, Australia.",mar77v@csiro.au,"Marcos-Martinez, Raymundo/Q-7051-2019; FLEMING, DAVID A/H-2442-2012; Measham, Tom/A-5210-2010","Marcos-Martinez, Raymundo/0000-0002-7925-7081; FLEMING, DAVID A/0000-0003-1070-5381; Measham, Tom/0000-0003-4549-5361",Gas Industry Social and Environmental Research Alliance (GISERA),Gas Industry Social and Environmental Research Alliance (GISERA),"We acknowledge the support of the Gas Industry Social and Environmental Research Alliance (GISERA).

As the climate warms in eastern Canada, threats to habitats of cold-water species will increase, underpinning the necessity to develop an understanding of landscape-scale, thermal regimes of flowing waters. We assessed the performance of spatial statistical network (SSN) models of river temperature using high-resolution thermal infrared imagery (0.6 m) and LiDAR (1 m) compared to NASA's Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM-30 m) topographic data and interrogate LiDAR derived fine-scale models (3 ha) to describe groundwater connectivity to surface waters in catchments with shallow overburden and varied bedrock geology. LiDAR improved model performance in a catchment underlain by a homogeneous, high hydraulic conductance bedrock (Cains River) but did not improve model performance in a catchment with heterogeneous bedrock and variable hydraulic conductance (North Pole Stream). We hypothesize that differences in bedrock conductance modified topographic controls on subsurface flows and discharge patterns to the rivers and thus produced the mixed performance of the SSN models. At finer scales, river reaches in steep valleys incising high conductance bedrock produced groundwater discharge, which was absent in incised valleys with low conductance bedrock. These findings indicate that while topography exerts an important control on landscape-scale hydrological processes, geologic setting is a similarly important influence on hydrological processes. We suggest the inclusion of a third dimension of spatial autocorrelation, representative of the vertical plane that captures the geologic setting, would broaden the geographic applicability of spatial statistical models for river temperature studies.","[O'Sullivan, Antoin M.; Ogilvie, Jae; Linnansaari, Tommi; Curry, R.

The project was conducted in partnership with indigenous people who share a long and close relationship with caribou and self-identify as the Caribou People. The Caribou People desired to share their knowledge, experiences, challenges, and coping strategies with other indigenous communities and with scientists and wildlife managers. Six communities in the North American Arctic participated in the project, with 99 people interviewed about the ecological, cultural, spiritual, and nutritional aspects of their relationship with caribou. The Caribou People wished to tell their stories with their own voices, without the filter of a researcher's interpretations of their messages. The communities defined three project goals, i.e., documentation, communication, and sharing of knowledge, and we identified methodological challenges associated with these goals. Through videography, we sought to overcome these challenges and accomplish community goals, which formed the basis for our project's evaluation. Participants reported changes and concerns ranging from impacts of oil and gas exploration, mining activities, nonlocal hunting, and high energy costs to impacts of climate-related conditions. All interviews were made available in the public domain via the Internet for sharing. In the view of the communities, videography preserved their legacy and served as a repository of traditional knowledge in changing times; visual images were seen as a powerful medium to communicate with policy makers and the public at large and were seen as a preferred informal, unstructured approach. We have (1) described the approach of the Voices of the Caribou People project as a collaborative video methodology and (2) discussed the effectiveness of this method in meeting the goals of participatory research. General insights into the process of using videography as a participatory research tool to study social-ecological systems in partnership with indigenous communities have been provided.","[Bali, Archana; Kofinas, Gary P.] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Sch Nat Resources & Agr Sci, Dept Humans & Environm, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA; [Bali, Archana; Kofinas, Gary P.] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Inst Arctic Biol, Fairbanks, AK USA; [Bali, Archana; Kofinas, Gary P.] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Resilience & Adaptat Program, Fairbanks, AK USA",University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Fairbanks; University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Fairbanks; University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Fairbanks,"Bali, A (corresponding author), Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Sch Nat Resources & Agr Sci, Dept Humans & Environm, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA.",,,,"Circum-Arctic Rangifer Monitoring and Assessment (CARMA) network through the Canadian International Polar Year program; George Schaller Fellowship through the Liz Claiborne; Art Ottenberg Foundation (New York, USA), Yukon College (Whitehorse, Yukon, Canada); U.S. National Science Foundation (OPP Project Heterogeneity and Resilience of Human-Rangifer Systems: A Circumpolar Social-Ecological Synthesis project) [0531200]","Circum-Arctic Rangifer Monitoring and Assessment (CARMA) network through the Canadian International Polar Year program; George Schaller Fellowship through the Liz Claiborne; Art Ottenberg Foundation (New York, USA), Yukon College (Whitehorse, Yukon, Canada); U.S. National Science Foundation (OPP Project Heterogeneity and Resilience of Human-Rangifer Systems: A Circumpolar Social-Ecological Synthesis project)(National Science Foundation (NSF))","Voices of the Caribou People project was funded by the Circum-Arctic Rangifer Monitoring and Assessment (CARMA) network through the Canadian International Polar Year program.

The characters of hair fiber of cold-resistant animal were featured, which includes color, scale density, scale thickness, medulla distribution and morphology of cross section. The conclusions show that there are some common characters to the same cold-resistant animal, i.e., cross section as circle or ellipse or anomaly ellipse, scale density ranging from 40 to 100 per 1 mm, scale styles as variable, scale angle as small.

The novelty of this approach is that it decomposes the phase space in, possibly, overlapping clusters and simultaneously estimates the most likely switching sequence among the clusters. The parameters of the clustering and switching are estimated by a finite element approach. The switching among the clusters can be described by a Markov transition matrix. Possible metastable regime behavior is assessed by inspecting the eigenspectrum of the associated transition probability matrix. The recently introduced metastable data-analysis method is applied to high-dimensional datasets produced by a barotropic model and a comprehensive atmospheric general circulation model (GCM). Significant and dynamically relevant metastable regimes are successfully identified in both models. The metastable regimes in the barotropic model correspond to blocked and zonal states. Similar regime states were already previously identified in highly reduced phase spaces of just one and two dimensions in the same model. Next, the clustering method is applied to a comprehensive atmospheric GCM in which seven significant flow regimes are identified. The spatial structures of the regimes correspond to, among others, both phases of the Northern Annular Mode and Pacific blocking. The regimes are maintained predominantly by transient eddy fluxes of low-pass-filtered anomalies. It is demonstrated how the dynamical description of the slow process switching between the regimes can be acquired from the analysis results, and an investigation of the resulting simplified dynamical model with respect to predictability is performed. A predictability study shows that a simple Markov model is able to predict the regimes up to six days ahead, comparable to the ability of high-resolution state-of-the-art numerical weather prediction models to accurately predict the onset and decay of blockings. The implications of the results for derivation of reduced models for extended-range predictability are discussed.","[Franzke, Christian] NERC, British Antarctic Survey, Cambridge CB3 0ET, England; [Horenko, Illia; Klein, Rupert] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Math, Berlin, Germany; [Majda, Andrew J.] NYU, Courant Inst Math Sci, Dept Math & Climate, New York, NY USA",UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); NERC British Antarctic Survey; Free University of Berlin; New York University,"Franzke, C (corresponding author), NERC, British Antarctic Survey, Madingley Rd, Cambridge CB3 0ET, England.",chan1@bas.ac.uk,"Franzke, Christian L E/A-6191-2012","Franzke, Christian L E/0000-0003-4111-1228; Franzke, Christian/0000-0002-8084-3256",Natural Environment Research Council [bas010021] Funding Source: researchfish; NERC [bas010021] Funding Source: UKRI,Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),,,50,50,50,0,7,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0022-4928,1520-0469,,J ATMOS SCI,J.

Those studies remarkably improved our knowledge of the regional past environmental change; palaeoclimate inferences based on the magnetic susceptibility and grain-size distribution, as the most commonly used palaeoenvironmental proxies for the Carpathian Basin loess, indicate colder and drier climatic conditions during glacials when compared to interglacials. With an increasing number of studies using novel proxies in loess research, such a traditional understanding of dry and cold glacials and humid and warm interglacials in the Carpathian Basin has been questioned. As an illustrative example, mollusc-based climate reconstructions suggest generally warm and very dry summer conditions with mean July temperatures up to 21 degrees C for the southern Carpathian Basin during the last glacial. Results based on stable carbon isotopes strongly oppose such high summer temperatures, but studies based on n-alkanes are in general agreement with the mollusc data when it comes to the vegetation reconstruction indicating mostly steppic conditions. However, n-alkanes studies contradict warm and dry glacial conditions as indicated by mollusc-based reconstructions, pointing instead to cold and relatively humid glacials. In addition, there is an ongoing debate whether or not millennial-scale climatic oscillations can be observed in the Carpathian Basin loess, as well as whether this area was an important Northern Hemisphere dust source or rather a sink of far distance dust transport. Consequently, the current state of the art of the palaeoclimate reconstructions from loess in the Carpathian Basin is rather inconsistent. In order to make sense of the existing palaeoclimate data from the Carpathian Basin loess, we have reevaluated and reinterpreted the available data. We discuss and propose a coherent interpretation of rock magnetic, grain-size, malacological, stable carbon and nitrogen isotope, n-alkane and bacterial membrane lipid data for the last glacial cycle loess archives from the Carpathian Basin. We show that glacial conditions in the Carpathian Basin led to a notable increasing North-South gradient in temperature and an even stronger expressed decreasing trend in humidity, and that most of the biomarker proxy data conducted in loess for the very dry southern part of the Carpathian Basin show a strong bias towards arid conditions. In particular, palaeotemperature reconstructions seem to be misleading. Glacial conditions were drier and colder than previously proposed (summer temperatures likely under 15 degrees C during glacials), but notably warmer than in other parts of Western, Central, and Eastern Europe. The vegetation consisted mostly of steppic environments during both, glacials and interglacials. We indicate that the Carpathian Basin has a potential to be a major dust source of the Northern Hemisphere during glacials, although it was at the same time exposed to the deposition of fine far distance travelled dust. Moreover, the main issues in the regional and continental correlation of loess are highlighted, as well as the sensitivity of the Carpathian Basin loess to the millennial-scale climate variability recorded in other Northern Hemisphere records. Finally, we suggest that the onset of loess formation in the investigated area occurred during the Middle Pleistocene Transition, and it was probably related to intensive silt production related to glacier dynamics in the Alpine ice cap.","[Obreht, Igor] Univ Bremen, Organ Geochem Grp, MARUM Ctr Marine Environm Sci, Leobener Str 8, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; [Obreht, Igor] Univ Bremen, Dept Geosci, Leobener Str 8, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; [Zeeden, Christian] Univ Lille, UPMC Univ Paris 06, Sorbonne Univ, IMCCE,Observ Paris,PSL Res Univ,CNRS, F-75014 Paris, France; [Zeeden, Christian] LIAG, Stilleweg 2, D-30655 Hannover, Germany; [Hambach, Ulrich] Univ Bayreuth, BayCEER, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany; [Hambach, Ulrich] Univ Bayreuth, Chair Geomorphol, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany; [Veres, Daniel] Romanian Acad, Inst Speleol, Cluj Napoca 400006, Romania; [Markovic, Slobodan B.] Univ Novi Sad, Phys Geog, Fac Sci, Trg Dositeja Obradov 3, Novi Sad 21000, Serbia; [Lehmkuhl, Frank] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Dept Geog, Templergraben 55, D-52056 Aachen, Germany",University of Bremen; University of Bremen; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; PSL Research University Paris; Observatoire de Paris; Sorbonne Universite; Universite Paris Cite; Universite de Lille - ISITE; Universite de Lille; Leibniz Institut fur Angewandte Geophysik (LIAG); University of Bayreuth; University of Bayreuth; Emil Racovita Institute of Speleology; Romanian Academy of Sciences; University of Novi Sad; RWTH Aachen University,"Obreht, I (corresponding author), Univ Bremen, Organ Geochem Grp, MARUM Ctr Marine Environm Sci, Leobener Str 8, D-28359 Bremen, Germany.;Obreht, I (corresponding author), Univ Bremen, Dept Geosci, Leobener Str 8, D-28359 Bremen, Germany.",iobreht@marum.de,"Veres, Daniel/AAX-3319-2020; Veres, Daniel S/GNH-2578-2022; Veres, Daniel/GNH-2718-2022; Zeeden, Christian/AFO-4070-2022","Veres, Daniel/0000-0003-3932-577X; Obreht, Igor/0000-0001-9710-8365; Lehmkuhl, Frank/0000-0002-6876-7377; Zeeden, Christian/0000-0002-8617-0443; Markovic, Slobodan/0000-0002-4977-634X","German Research Foundation (DFG) [INST 216/596-2]; Serbian Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development [176020]; Serbian Academy of Sciences [F178]; Ministry of Research and Innovation CNCS - UEFISCDI [PN P4-ID-PCE-2016-0262]","German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Serbian Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development; Serbian Academy of Sciences; Ministry of Research and Innovation CNCS - UEFISCDI","We thank the Editor Ian Candy, Gabor Ujvari and other two unknown reviewers for thorough and constructive reviews that significantly improved this paper.

With a promise of improved warning and coordination, a prevailing hope is that information and communication technology (ICT) can help reduce the impacts of large-scale disruptions, including political crises, natural disasters, pandemics, and terrorist threats. Much of the focus of development has been on the formal emergency response effort. However, social computing is changing the way we understand information distribution. By viewing the citizenry as a powerful, self-organizing, and collectively intelligent force, ICT is now playing a remarkable and transformational role in the way society responds to mass emergencies and disasters. Furthermore, this view of a civil society that can be augmented by ICT is based on social and behavioral knowledge about how people truly respond in disaster, rather than on simplified and mythical portrayals of people unable to help themselves [2]. Indeed, long before the advent of widely available social computing platforms, research has shown that disaster victims themselves are the true. first responders, frequently acting on the basis of knowledge not available to officials [1, 3, 6]. We argue that this transformative view is critical to our global future: When large-scale emergencies happen, there is often no way to survive it in practical terms unless we rely on each other for help. The urgency and scale of many disaster events are such that no one-not even the most experienced and best technology-equipped responders-can rescue all victims or direct all people over the span of the event as to what the best course of action might be. Climate change and population migration to geographically vulnerable areas mean that naturally occurring hazards will exert increasingly extensive damage. Man-made and terrorist threats can also have greater potential to cause lasting damage to the social and built environment. It is instead necessary, through innovative ICT, to leverage the power of the collective intelligence of the citizenry to support natural instincts, which are to search for reliable information using any means possible to optimize for local conditions [5]. This view challenges fundamental assumptions about how information should be controlled and disseminated to ensure public safety. That officials can and should provide the best information during emergencies, and that the public can and should primarily rely on official information appears to be a difficult-to-resist, near-universal human hope. However, it is critical that we adopt a view of broad public participation in emergency response-and make such a view viable. Crisis informatics addresses socio-technical concerns in largescale emergency response. Additionally it expands consideration to include not only official responders (who tend to be the focus in policy and technology-focused matters), but also members of the public. It therefore views emergency response as a much broader socio-technical system where information is disseminated within and between official and public channels and entities. Crisis informatics wrestles with methodological concerns as it strives to develop new theory and support informed development of ICT and policy [4]. In this talk, I will review the state of the art in research, and where future opportunities in computing research lie.","[Palen, Leysia] Univ Colorado, Comp Sci, Project EPIC, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Palen, L (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Comp Sci, Project EPIC, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",palen@colorado.edu,,,,,,,6,0,0,2,7,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA",,,978-1-4503-2351-2,,,,2014,,,,,1,2,,10.1145/2556195.2559898,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2556195.2559898,,,2,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BN6JH,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000485476600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Environmental science cautions that we must expect further disruptions as the sustainability crisis deepens. Resilience to these disruptions will be key to humanity's survival in years to come. The pandemic constitutes a litmus test for environmental education's effectiveness in fostering socio-ecological resilience. This paper uses Educational Action Research (EAR) to report on the impact of an environmental education intervention on students' socio-ecological resilience during the pandemic. Using two-step participatory thematic analysis as part of the reflection phase of the EAR cycle, the author interviewed twenty students from a liberal arts college in The Netherlands about their perspectives on the pandemic. The findings suggest that environmental education can catalyse a change of perspective on the purpose of education, from instrumental to social-transformative; bring about greater concern for others in times of crisis; help to develop greater awareness of the systemic underpinnings of crises; and spur some students to take concrete action for change. However, the research cautions against undue optimism, as many students reverted to old patterns of thought and behaviour after the intervention. The EAR cycle closes with suggestions for developing better pedagogies to reach through to these students.","[Servant-Miklos, Virginie] Erasmus Univ Coll, Nieuwemarkt 1A, NL-3011 HP Rotterdam, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Servant-Miklos, V (corresponding author), Erasmus Univ Coll, Nieuwemarkt 1A, NL-3011 HP Rotterdam, Netherlands.",servant@euc.eur.nl,,,,,,,81,1,1,1,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4622,1469-5871,,ENVIRON EDUC RES,Environ.

To determine possible carbon sinks in agriculture, it is necessary to study carbon sequestration potentials in relation to agricultural management. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the soil carbon sequestration potential of a site in north-eastern Switzerland under different tillage systems. The study was performed as a long-term (19-year) trial on an Orthic Luvisol (sandy loam) with a mean annual air temperature of 8.4 degrees C and a long-term precipitation mean of 1183 mm. The soil organic carbon (SOC) concentration was determined five times during the study period, with the paper focussing mainly on the year 2006. The main objective was to quantify the influence of mouldboard ploughing (PL), shallow tillage (ST), no-tillage (NT) practices, and grassland (GL) on soil organic carbon content, the latter's different fractions (labile, intermediate, and stable), and its distribution by depth. In calculating the SOC content of the whole soil profile, we included a correction factor accounting for variations in bulk density (equivalent soil mass). The total SOC stock at a depth of 0-40 cm was 65 Mg C ha(-1) and although higher under GL, did not differ significantly between PL, ST, and NT. SOC concentrations per soil layer were significantly greater for NT and ST (0-10 cm) than for PL, which had greater SOC concentrations than NT and ST at 20-30 cm depth. Both SOC concentrations and stocks (0-20 cm) were largest under GL. In all treatments, most of the carbon was found in the intermediate carbon fraction. There was no significant difference in any of the three SOC fractions between NT and ST, although there was between ST and PL. A sharp decrease in C-concentrations was observed in the first 7 years after the transition from grassland to arable land, with a new equilibrium of the carbon concentration in the 0-40 cm layer being reached 12 years later, with no significant difference between the tillage treatments. Overall, the results indicate that effects of tillage on soil carbon are small in moist, cold-temperate soils, challenging conversion into no-till as a measure for sequestering C.

Actually, a considerable variety of things constitutes a matter of geography. Namely, geography is a study field which includes a wide range of subject matters and facts such as the formation of the earth, outer space, the shape of the globe and many incidents connected to this shape, the formation of climates, the dispersion of these different climates all over the world, the formation and dispersion of geo-shapes, human population and habitation, and many human-related issues like agriculture, industry, transportation, trade, stock-breeding, etc. In order to make geography education effective and fruitful, it is required to offer what geography refers in our lives and how it affects us. In other words, it is a must not to offer only geographical knowledge but also to give how this knowledge can be used. Unless the knowledge is used outside the classroom, it is useless and without effect. For that reason, it is necessary to learn what each knowledge means and stands for in the world and in our environments and our lives. In order to make geography education and teaching effective, it is a must to discard the presentation of knowledge solely. The prominent problems in geography teaching result mainly from loose perspectives of teachers and students towards geography course, and include that students get stuck under huge knowledge bulk and they cannot associate this knowledge to practical life. It is obvious that this study would considerably help to understand what Turkish geography teacher candidates think about what geography teaching/education is and should be, about how effective this education is and about which problems this education has. In this vein, the aim of this study is to determine geography teacher candidates' opinions about what geography education/teaching is and should be, about how effective this education is and about what problems this education includes. Here, a study based on qualitative data was performed by examining teacher candidates' opinions. The study group of this research is comprised of thirty five students from the out-thesis Master of Arts in the Department of Geography Education-Secondary Education Social Fields taken part in the Ataturk Education Faculty of the Marmara University. In this study, the data were collected via one-to-one interviews made in a weekly interval and subsequently three times with same persons with the aim to learn teacher candidates' opinions about geography education/teaching and its effectiveness level and problems. On the basis of the findings of this study, geography education must aim at teaching to secondary school students how the environment surrounded them is and what kind of economic and cultural values their country encompasses. Geography education should enable students to have a wide perspective in respect to subject matters it aims to offer. In geography courses, subject matters should be taught in accordance with academic content. At the same time, social education should be emphasized. The message which is intended to be offered in geography education is the environmental consciousness and sensitivity. The thing of great importance in geography education is functionality of it. If the knowledge learned is not used in real life, it is unnecessary. In order to perform geography teaching in the most effective way, it is a must to offer knowledge in association with actual events in the world. At the end of the study, it was found that the aim of teaching is to teach how to learn.","[Akinoglu, Orhan] Marmara Univ, Ataturk Egitim Fak, Ogretim Uyesidir, Istanbul, Turkey",Marmara University,"Akinoglu, O (corresponding author), Marmara Univ, Ataturk Egitim Fak, Ogretim Uyesidir, Istanbul, Turkey.",oakinoglu@marmara.edu.tr,,,,,,,23,9,9,0,3,MARMARA UNIV,ISTANBUL,"GOZTEPE CAMPUS, KADIKOY, ISTANBUL, 34722, TURKEY",1303-2429,2147-7825,,MARMARA GEOGR REV,Marmara Geogr.

Our analyses point to a change in the seasonality of mortality, with maximum monthly incidence progressively shifting from winter to summer. The results also show that the rise in heat-related mortality will start to completely compensate the reduction of deaths from cold during the second half of the century, amounting to an average drop in human lifespan of up 3-4 months in 2070-2100. Nevertheless, projections suggest that human lifespan might indeed increase if a substantial degree of adaptation to warm temperatures takes place.","[Ballester, Joan; Rodo, Xavier] Inst Catala Ciencies Clima IC3, Barcelona, Spain; [Robine, Jean-Marie] CRLC, INSERM, Ctr Val dAurelle, F-34298 Montpellier 5, France; [Herrmann, Francois Richard] Geneva Sch Med, Dept Rehabil & Geriatr, CH-1226 Thonex, Switzerland; [Herrmann, Francois Richard] Univ Hosp, CH-1226 Thonex, Switzerland; [Rodo, Xavier] ICREA, Barcelona, Spain",Institut Catala de Ciencies del Clima (IC3); University of Barcelona; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); Universite de Montpellier; University of Geneva; University of Geneva; ICREA,"Ballester, J (corresponding author), Inst Catala Ciencies Clima IC3, Barcelona, Spain.",joanballester@ic3.cat,"Ballester, Joan/E-6627-2017; HERRMANN, Francois/M-7390-2019; Robine, Jean-Marie/F-5439-2011; HERRMANN, Francois R/B-6710-2011; Rodó, Xavier/F-7663-2017","Ballester, Joan/0000-0003-0009-437X; HERRMANN, Francois/0000-0003-1312-1517; Robine, Jean-Marie/0000-0002-4111-6195; HERRMANN, Francois R/0000-0003-1312-1517; Rodó, Xavier/0000-0003-4843-6180",European Commission [GOCE-CT-2003-505539]; EU [2005114]; ICREA Funding Source: Custom,European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre); EU(European Commission); ICREA(ICREA),"We are grateful for comments and suggestions from Salvador Pueyo.

In addition, UN Habitat program has defined a baseline about the quality of human settlements in terms of sustainability (UN-Habitat 2009) and the role of the planner in the status quo. As the world population settles predominantly in cities, urban planners should implement new tools to improve sustainability performances of urban areas in general, and in water and energy in particular. This paper aims at presenting a proposed planning tools to improve water and energy sustainability in Mexico, and as a result, propose arguments to discuss ways to improve performances of public policy in other regions of the world. The focus of this tool is on housing developments, under the premise of looking for compact, denser cities. The proposed planning tool comes in the form of a local government initiative to certify Green Development as a response to large water and energy consuming developments. Implementation of the tool considers that inefficient housing development patterns compromise water and energy sources in the territory, and implementation of carrot and stick approach in policy making could modify developmental behaviours, and therefore saving resources. Certification allows developers to apply for fiscal incentives such as building permits exemptions and property tax discounts. Certification also acknowledges energy production transition from fossil fuel to cleaner technologies in order to address climate change and reduce carbon footprint; as well as considers concepts such as Low Impact Development, Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems, and Water Sensitive Urban Design in order to save water. The unit of analysis is the community development within a municipality, as a result the certification applies to the development and the developer. The paper concludes with content guidelines of a certification system which is intended to be implemented by local governments.","[Demerutis Arenas, Juan Angel] Univ Guadalajara, Coll Art Architecture & Design, Ctr Univ Arte Arquitectura & Diseno, Dept Proyectos Urbanist,Planning Dept, Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico",Universidad de Guadalajara,"Demerutis Arenas, JA (corresponding author), Univ Guadalajara, Coll Art Architecture & Design, Ctr Univ Arte Arquitectura & Diseno, Dept Proyectos Urbanist,Planning Dept, Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico.",juan.demerutis@cuaad.udg.mx,,,,,,,8,0,0,1,14,ISOCARP,HAGUE,"PO BOX 983, HAGUE, 2501 CZ, NETHERLANDS",,,978-94-90354-43-5,,,,2015,,,,,,,,,,,,7,Urban Studies,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Urban Studies,BF2RS,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000380493900089,View Full Record in Web of Science

One of these CCS technologies is the Oxyfuel process. In the Oxyfuel process the coal is burned in a mixed atmosphere of O-2 and recycled flue gas. The flue gas thus generated has a high CO2 concentration, because of the missing air nitrogen. Still the dried flue gas consists of approximately 15 mol-% impurities (O-2, N-2, Ar, NOx and SOx). To increase the CO2-purity the flue gas is treated in a gas processing unit (GPU). Two promising technologies to perform the gas processing are partial condensation and distillation. Both are well known and available at industrial scale. Using these technologies about 90 % of the CO2 can be separated. The remaining part of the CO2 leaves the GPU with the offgas. To increase the overall capture rate of the CO2 in the Oxyfuel process the offgas from the GPU can be treated in either a pressure swing adsorption (PSA) cycle or a polymeric membrane (PM) cycle. These cycles generate a CO2-enriched GPUrecycle stream and an exhaust gas stream which consists of the residual impurities. The CO2-enriched GPU-recycle can be fed back to the GPU or mixed with the CO2 product stream of the GPU. The exhaust gas stream with the impurities has a high content of O-2 and could be refed to the air separation unit (ASU) to increase the efficiency of the overall process. The additional gas treatment in the PSA-or the PM-cycle has influences on the specific energy demand of the GPU, the CO2 capture rate, the composition of the CO2 product stream and the overall process efficiency. In the work presented here the feed gas of the GPU is the flue gas of a large scale bituminous coal-fired Oxyfuel power plant. The plant model is based on the actual state-of-the-art power plant technology. For the GPU two different reference process cases are modelled. One case with a distillation of the CO2 and one case with a partial condensation of the CO2 are considered. For both cases the GPU process is externally cooled. These reference cases are compared then with a distillation and a partial condensation which have an additional offgas treatment by PSA or PM. For the offgas treatment with membranes, polymeric membranes are considered due to their high CO2/O-2-selectivity and high permeability. For the offgas treatment with PSA a multiple bed cycle is modelled to assure continuous operation of the plant. The overall CO2 capture rate, the specific energy demand and the composition of the CO2 product stream are calculated for the reference cases, the distillation with PSA or PM and the partial condensation with PSA or PM. With these results the potential of these technologies for the GPU shall be compared with the reference cases. Furthermore a recycle of the O-2-containing gas stream to the ASU is modelled in the overall process model. This recycled gas stream can be used to reduce the energy demand of the ASU. The influence of the offgas treatment is evaluated by calculating the net efficiency of the overall process.(C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd. Open access under CC BY-NC-ND license.

Promoting the use of natural stone has therefore a great positive impact on the environment. However, the number of occurrences of bowing and expansion of marble and limestone panels has led to increased maintenance costs, significant safety risk, and negative publicity. The lack of knowledge of a solution to the problem of bowing marble has a large negative effect on the entire stone trade. In response, short-sighted and less durable construction solutions are used as an alternative, adding to the decreasing export figures and numbers of employees within the stone sector. The TEAM (TEAM = TEsting and Assessment of Marble and limestone) project addresses a problem with marble types, from several European countries, that display bowing on facades in both cold and warm climates. There is, therefore a need to develop harmonized European standards for differentiating between marble that is susceptible to bowing and marble that is not. Resolution No. 013, in May 1999 taken by the European Committee for Standardization (CEN), Technical Committee (TC) 246 Natural Stone states the urgent needs to develop a direct test method of the bowing risk for marble cladding products. Thus, the project addresses the mandate for external wall coverings and the safety of panels. This paper serves to give a comprehensive overview of the main findings in the project. The main objectives were: (.) To understand and explain the mechanisms of the expansion and loss of strength, probably the most important phenomena leading to degradation of marble and limestone clad facades. (.) To prevent the use of deleterious marble and limestone by introducing drafts for European standards. (.) To develop a concept for assessment of facades, including a monitoring system in order to predict strength development and improve safety and reliability. (.) To analyze if surface coating and impregnation could prevent or diminish the degradation. (.) To address quality control aspects in order to optimize the production conditions. The TEAM project consortium, representing nine EU (European union) countries, comprised sixteen partners representing stone producers and trade associations, testing laboratories, standardization and certification bodies, consultants, building owners and caretakers and producers of fixing and repair systems. A state-of-the-art report has been written and is based on an extensive compilation of more than 400 papers on marble and limestone deterioration dating from the late 1800s to 2006. A survey of about 200 buildings has given a clear picture of the extent of the problem in geographical, geological, and climatological terms. Detailed case studies of six buildings have resulted in a methodology for assessment of facades including monitoring system and risk assessment. Research both in the laboratory and the field were performed on a large number of different stone types from different countries and used in different climates. This gave the explanation of degradation mechanisms and led to the determination of the critical influencing factors. Two tests methods, including precision statements: one for bowing [11 and one for thermal and moisture irreversible expansion have been prepared for submission to CEN TC 246. Repair techniques based on the use of surface coating and impregnation systems has been tested at laboratoy and in the field. Positive side effects including increased durability and easier cleaning have been observed. Guidelines for production and product control have been proposed, and an instruction for stone sampling and description has been developed.","[Schouenborg, B.; Malaga, K.] SP Tech Res Inst, Box 857, S-50115 Boras, Sweden; [Grelk, B.] RAMBOLL AS, S-2830 Virum, Sweden",SP Technical Research Institute of Sweden,"Schouenborg, B (corresponding author), SP Tech Res Inst, Box 857, S-50115 Boras, Sweden.",,,,"TEAM project under GROWTH Program Competitive and Sustainable Growth, Expanding the Limits and Durability of Structural Material.

Therefore, the goal of this study was to define a muscle strain injury criterion (MSIC) to evaluate the damage sustained by the musculature during muscle driven movement scenarios. The MSIC was derived from biome-chanical tests found in the literature and the proposed threshold values were substantiated through a comparison to an estimate of the ultimate tensile strength of human skeletal muscle and the forces acting on the biceps femoris long head muscle during one sprinting gait cycle. The application of the MSIC to state-of-the-art FE AHBMs was demonstrated by evaluating the strain injury severity of selected neck muscles of a full-body AHBM during two seat rotation load cases. The results of the MSIC substantiation suggest that all three injury threshold values proposed in this work fall in a plausible corridor of forces acting on the MTU. The combined results of the AHBM simulations indicate that neither of the two examined seat rotations are likely to cause strain injury to the neck muscles and that the proposed MSIC can easily be applied to current AHBMs without further modification of the model architecture or the muscle parameters. The MSIC was also used to formulate a hypothesis on the aetiology of muscle strain injuries, through which it was demonstrated that material inhomogeneities in the MTU might be the cause for strain injuries sustained during otherwise physiological movements. This work is a first step in the direction of the definition of a wholistic injury criterion for the human skeletal muscle fibre.","[Noelle, Lennart, V; Martynenko, Oleksandr, V; Schmitt, Syn] Univ Stuttgart, Inst Modelling & Simulat Biomech Syst, Stuttgart, Germany; [Mishra, Atul] Mercedes Benz Res & Dev, Bangalore, Karnataka, India",University of Stuttgart,"Nolle, LV (corresponding author), Univ Stuttgart, Inst Modelling & Simulat Biomech Syst, Stuttgart, Germany.",lennart.noelle@imsb.uni-stuttgart.de,"Martynenko, Oleksandr/F-9135-2017","Martynenko, Oleksandr/0000-0002-0420-0670; Schmitt, Syn/0000-0002-7768-8961","EU [768947 OSCCAR]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) under Germany's Excellence Strategy -EXC [2075 390740016]; Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action of Germany (Bundesministerium fur Wirtschaft und Klimaschutz) [19A21027D]","EU(European Commission); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) under Germany's Excellence Strategy -EXC(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action of Germany (Bundesministerium fur Wirtschaft und Klimaschutz)","This work was supported by the EU Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under grant agreement No. 768947 OSCCAR, by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) under Germany's Excellence Strategy -EXC 2075 390740016 (SimTech) and by the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action of Germany (Bundesministerium fur Wirtschaft und Klimaschutz) through the project Artificial Intelligence for Real-Time Injury Prediction (ATTENTION), grant number 19A21027D.

In the southern part of the region, just north of the Lower Mondego River Valley, we find a broad flattened area, where the predominant sandy soils overlap deposits from ancient Pleistocene beaches. The wide and complex chronology of these deposits and the characteristics of its components suggest that during their development, environmental constraints, such as climate and vegetation, imposed severe limitations on human settling, as testified by the absence of archaeological remains in the lower deposits, extending westwards, which survey was facilitated by various sand quarries. This evidence contrasts with the presence of Acheulean assemblages in Mealhada, nearby the Certima valley, in deposits which some authors considered to be equivalent to some of the Pleistocene beaches indicated. Later on, in the end of the Pleistocene, the extensive dune formations that cover the previous Pleistocene deposits was associated with a severe episode of aridity that affected the entire region. Represented by a covers and extremely aeolised, this formation was currently named Areias da Gandara. Recent studies allow more precise chronology and also reinforce their similarity to the Landes formations, in France. Lack of data from the Pleistocene-Holocene transition does not allow us to characterize the coastal landscape in this phase. Still, it is clear that in the Mid-Holocene extensive pine and oak forests were found in the region. As in other western Iberian coastal areas, during the Bronze, human activities led to a significant decrease in forest areas, marking a new phase of landscape evolution. These seem to be connected with changes in human societies, agriculture and settlement. This trend became clearer in later periods, following major changes in the strategies of occupation and exploitation of the territory. It is clear, from this stage, the expansion of heathland presumably as a result of the increase in animal husbandry. These were already predominant in Roman times. Agricultural and grazing signs continue to be important drivers of change throughout Medieval and Modern times. These and the climate changes related to the Little Ice Age led to a progressive destruction of vegetation cover and subsequent sand accumulation. This scenario which affected several areas of the Portuguese coast has been intensively studied further north in the Aveiro Lagoon. That is exactly what was happening across the Gelfa, the medieval name assigned to the sandy spit developed from the South of Espinho that closed the large bay formerly localized in the area of the current Aveiro lagoon. Until the nineteenth century no permanent human occupation was found in the sandy cordon, probably due to lack of suitable agricultural fields and the risk of piracy. Such areas were only used for pasture as well as a starting base for sea fishing with the art of xavega, further developed by the implementation of the canning industry (eighteenth century). This scenario only changed with the forest stands for dune fixation initiated during the twentieth century. Whether climatically induced or anthropogenic, changes in vegetation are an important variable for the understanding of the trends in human settlement in the region in a long-term perspective. However, it is necessary to increase our knowledge of the diachronic, regarding such multiplicity of factors. Only then will we be able to fully understand the characteristics and the intensity of such changes.","[Bastos, Maria Rosario] Open Univ Portugal, Oporto, Portugal; [Pereira, Olegario; Monteiro-Rodrigues, Sergio] Univ Porto, Fac Arts & Humanities, Ctr Trandisciplinary Res Culture Space & Memory C, Oporto, Portugal; [Pereira, Olegario] FAPERJ Scholarship, Oporto, Portugal; [Pereira, Olegario] CEPESE Res Ctr Econ Populat & Soc, Oporto, Portugal; [Tereso, Joao Pedro] Univ Porto, BIO Res Network Biodivers & Evolutionary Biol Ass, CIBIO Res Ctr Biodivers & Genet Resources, Oporto, Portugal; [Cunha-Ribeiro, Joao Pedro] Univ Lisbon, UNIARQ Ctr Archaeol, Fac Arts & Humanities, Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade do Porto; Universidade do Porto; Universidade de Lisboa,"Cunha-Ribeiro, JP (corresponding author), Univ Lisbon, UNIARQ Ctr Archaeol, Fac Arts & Humanities, Lisbon, Portugal.",Maria.Bastos@uab.pt; olegario.pereira@hotmail.com; sergiomonteirorodrigues@gmail.com; jptereso@gmail.com; jpcunharibeiro@fl.ul.pt,,"Tereso, Joao/0000-0003-0871-8255; Pereira, Olegario/0000-0002-5935-0932; Cunha Ribeiro, Joao Pedro/0000-0003-2614-3555",,,,,54,0,0,0,5,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2211-9019,,978-3-319-41139-2; 978-3-319-41137-8,ENVIRON HIST-SER,,,2017,,,,,129,144,,10.1007/978-3-319-41139-2_8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-41139-2_8,10.1007/978-3-319-41139-2,,16,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Book Citation Index – Social Sciences & Humanities (BKCI-SSH),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BH6KW,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000401898100009,View Full Record in Web of Science

The empirical results obtained during the spring months showed an improvement in the monthly heat balance for windows with phase change materials compared to the reference window by as much as 34.09%. In addition, the empirical results allowed the development and verification of a mathematical model describing the transport and distribution of heat within a window with a phase change heat accumulator. The model was made using equations of non-stationary heat flow and an explicit finite difference method using calorimetric thermograms describing the phase change eutectic mixture used in the research. Carrying out the Snedecor-Fischer test proved the statistical adequacy of the developed model in 4 out of 6 tested combinations of glazing units. Good matching of the empirical and theoretical quantities was also confirmed using the quasi-Newton method.

The utilization of solar energy in air conditioning may in this sense be the challenge for the next major growth of the solar thermal market. Nevertheless, there is a long way to go, and SAC technologies must prove that they are competitive. This chapter discusses the principles and the state of the art of SAC. Technical and non-technical advantages and barriers are also presented, as well as the possibility of using active SAC technologies, and technical issues raised by the use of electrically driven conventional air-conditioning systems are identified.

Satellite remote sensing provides the necessary wide area coverage and period revisits to measure episodic heavy precipitation and resultant urban floods. We propose two methods to assimilate satellite-observed precipitation into hydrologic models in real time to update flood forecasts, bypassing two previous barriers in this technology: infrequent satellite overpasses and long model run times. Constellations of small satellites overcomes the first barrier by providing frequent flights over an area of interest; however, these constellations require coordination and planning to capture precipitation data where it is most needed to inform flood forecasts. The primary purpose of this paper is to address the second barrier - that is high computational costs that make it infeasible to run flood forecast models on-board these satellites so that they can re-orient to measure where most needed. We develop a simple regression-based approach and a machine learning framework (Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models) to provide reliable flood forecasts using satellite-observed precipitation at a fraction of the computational cost of physics-based hydrologic models. We apply these approaches to a test case for the Atlanta metropolitan region using the Weather Research and Forecasting model hydrologic modeling system (WRF-Hydro) to simulate flooding across the model domain for several precipitation events. We compare the accuracy of our proposed approaches to the WRF-Hydro model using different spatial extents and temporal frequencies of precipitation observations to examine different plausible satellite constellation scenarios. The LSTM approach trades performance accuracy and adaptability for computational efficiency, which can be important in a time and resource constrained scenario. The LSTM model reduces total error up to 38% from an initial flood forecast. Additionally, this approach correctly classified flooding to within one flood magnitude category in similar to 90% of cases. These new forecasting algorithms can be used onboard constellations of small satellites to observe ongoing flood events, update short term predictions, and schedule observations to maximize useful measurements and thereby improve flood warning systems for protecting residents and properties.","[Lammers, Roderick] Univ Georgia, Coll Engn, 712 Boyd Grad Studies Bldg 200 DW Brooks Dr, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Li, Alan; Nag, Sreeja; Ravindra, Vinay] NASA, Ames Res Ctr, Bay Area Environm Res Inst, Moffett Field, CA 94035 USA; [Lammers, Roderick] Cent Michigan Univ, Sch Engn & Technol, ET Bldg 100, Mt Pleasant, MI 48859 USA",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Ames Research Center; Central Michigan University,"Lammers, R (corresponding author), Univ Georgia, Coll Engn, 712 Boyd Grad Studies Bldg 200 DW Brooks Dr, Athens, GA 30602 USA.;Lammers, R (corresponding author), Cent Michigan Univ, Sch Engn & Technol, ET Bldg 100, Mt Pleasant, MI 48859 USA.",rod.lammers@cmich.edu,,,NASA Science Mission Directorate New Investigator Program [NNX12AD05A],NASA Science Mission Directorate New Investigator Program,This work was supported by the NASA Science Mission Directorate New Investigator Program [RC-CREST Cooperative Agreement #NNX12AD05A] .

Here, we identify tephra deposits in the Sagileru Valley, south India, in association with Palaeolithic industries. The glass shard and biotite composition of the Sagileru tephra matches that of the YTT from other terrestrial sites in India and from the Toba caldera, and are distinct from earlier large eruptions from Toba. Moreover, our survey identified rare associations between lithic artefacts and YTT deposits, making the Sagileru Valley one of the few globally identified locations with both ash and archaeology. The identification of ash deposits and stone tool assemblages in the Sagileru Valley provides another source of information for understanding Late Pleistocene climate change, depositional environments and hominin occupations of South Asia.

Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and colorimeter were used to characterize the change of bamboo scrimber surface and microstructure. Natural weathering led to degradation of lignin and rapid color changes, demonstrated by decrease of 1232 cm(-1), 1423 cm(-1) and 1506 cm(-1) absorption peaks, the reduction of C1and increase of C2, and Delta E* value notably. Lignin degradation resulted in micro-check formation in the cell walls of fibers and parenchyma cells within exposure time. In particular, parameters of weather resistance changed rapidly within the initial two years and stabilized in the following four years. It is also revealed that two natural regions with different type of climate have significantly affected the degradation behavior of bamboo scrimber.","[Zhang, Ya-Hui; Qi, Yue; Zhu, Rong-Xian; Yu, Wen-Ji] Chinese Acad Forestry, Res Inst Wood Ind, Dept Wood Based Panels & Adhes, Xiang Shan Rd, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Ma, Hong-Xia; Li, Xing-Wei] Guangdong Acad Forestry, 233 Guangshan 1st Rd, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Rao, Fei] Zhejiang Sci Tech Univ, Sch Art & Design, Dept Ind Design, Hangzhou, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Forestry; Research Institute of Wood Industry, CAF; Zhejiang Sci-Tech University","Qi, Y; Yu, WJ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Forestry, Res Inst Wood Ind, Dept Wood Based Panels & Adhes, Xiang Shan Rd, Beijing, Peoples R China.",qiyue1219@126.com; chinayuwj@126.com,,,National Nature Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [32171886]; Key-Area Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province [2020B020216002],National Nature Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Key-Area Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province,"This work was financial supported by the National Nature Science Foundation of China (NSFC) General project (32171886), and also thanks to Key-Area Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province (2020B020216002).",,36,1,1,5,5,NATURE PORTFOLIO,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",,2397-2106,,NPJ MAT DEGRAD,NPJ Mater.

Supercritical fluids are often referred to green solvents because they can proceed at moderate temperatures. Therefore, this study sought to compare the supercritical fluid flow synthesis of TiO2 to that of a conventional precipitation method from an environmental and human health perspective. A life-cycle assessment was conducted to determine the impacts of producing 1 kg of dry TiO2 nanoparticles using either the supercritical or precipitation route. While the results suggest that supercritical fluid flow synthesis may indeed be a preferable synthesis route compared with a conventional route such as precipitation, the inherent uncertainty underlying this emerging technology indicates that there are a number of trade-offs in switching from one technology to another. Supercritical fluid flow synthesis was likely a better technology option from a cumulative energy demand and climate change perspective; however, there was less evidence for this from a human health and ecotoxicological perspective, for example. In particular, occupational exposure to emissions of TiO2 nanoparticles could be an issue for this emerging industry if the proper protective controls are not put in place.","[Tsang, Michael P.; Sonnemann, Guido] Univ Bordeaux, 351 Cours Liberat, F-33405 Talence, France; [Tsang, Michael P.; Sonnemann, Guido] CNRS, ISM, UMR 5255, 351 Cours Liberat, F-33405 Talence, France; [Tsang, Michael P.] Three Pillars Consulting, POB 2598,Postal Code 130, Muscat, Oman; [Philippot, Gilles; Aymonier, Cyril] CNRS, 87 Ave Dr Albert Schweitzer, F-33600 Pessac, France; [Philippot, Gilles; Aymonier, Cyril] Univ Bordeaux, 87 Ave Dr Albert Schweitzer, F-33600 Pessac, France; [Philippot, Gilles; Aymonier, Cyril] Bordeaux INP, ICMCB, UMR 5026, 87 Ave Dr Albert Schweitzer, F-33600 Pessac, France",UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite de Bordeaux; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Chemistry (INC); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite de Bordeaux; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite de Bordeaux; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite de Bordeaux,"Sonnemann, G (corresponding author), Univ Bordeaux, 351 Cours Liberat, F-33405 Talence, France.;Sonnemann, G (corresponding author), CNRS, ISM, UMR 5255, 351 Cours Liberat, F-33405 Talence, France.",guido.sonnemann@u-bordeaux.fr,"Aymonier, Cyril ca/H-3299-2013; Philippot, Gilles/AAI-7423-2020; Sonnemann, Guido/L-9425-2019; Tsang, Michael/A-9701-2016","Aymonier, Cyril ca/0000-0003-1775-0716; Philippot, Gilles/0000-0001-8560-1240; Sonnemann, Guido/0000-0003-2581-1910; Tsang, Michael/0000-0002-1010-8651","University of Bordeaux; French National Center for Scientific Research, LabEx AMADEus, IdEx Bordeaux [ANR-10-LABX-42, ANR-10-IDEX-03-02]; LCA Chair of the Region of Aquitaine; Investissements d'Avenir programme of the French government","University of Bordeaux; French National Center for Scientific Research, LabEx AMADEus, IdEx Bordeaux; LCA Chair of the Region of Aquitaine; Investissements d'Avenir programme of the French government(French National Research Agency (ANR))","We are grateful for the financial support of the University of Bordeaux, the French National Center for Scientific Research, LabEx AMADEus (ANR-10-LABX-42) in the framework of IdEx Bordeaux (ANR-10-IDEX-03-02), i.e., the Investissements d'Avenir programme of the French government managed by the Agence Nationale de la Recherche, as well as the LCA Chair of the Region of Aquitaine.",,48,20,20,2,30,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",2168-0485,,,ACS SUSTAIN CHEM ENG,ACS Sustain.

In this study, we profit from a state-of-the-art dense network of GPS measurements over Europe retrieving a homogenized GPS-derived Zenith Total Delay (GPS-ZTD) data set up to 10 min of temporal resolution, to assess the seasonal sensitivity of convection-related processes and heavy precipitation modelling to atmospheric humidity corrections. For this purpose, we perform nudging experiments with the COSMO-CLM model at two spatial resolutions, 7 km (parameterized convection) and 2.8 km (explicitly resolved convection) covering the autumn period of 2012, when the Special Observation Period (SOP) 1 of the Hydrological Cycle in the Mediterranean Experiment (HyMeX) program took place in the Western Mediterranean, which is our area of interest.The benefits and disadvantages of GPS-ZTD nudging and resulting moisture corrections are disentangled. The impact on high-resolution parameterized versus convection-permitting simulations is compared. A process -understanding methodology and a local-to-regional approach are used. Our results show a beneficial impact on the seasonal scale at both model grid spacings improving the representation of the chain of processes leading to heavy precipitation, contrary to the non-systematic improvement at the event and sub-event scales. The correction of atmospheric moisture entails a reduction of about 10% in the total column water vapour and corrections on single locations up to 10 mm counteracting the model wet bias across scales. The location, structure, and amount of total precipitation are positively affected. Particularly, the combination of high -resolution atmospheric humidity observations and fine convection-permitting simulations shows great poten-tial for correction of the precipitation daily cycle, key for accurate precipitation modelling. The difference in the density of local and upstream observational networks and the lack of information on the vertical stratification of moisture are identified weaknesses, which could be determinants in obtaining more accurate corrections on seasonal to sub-seasonal scales after assimilation strategies.","[Khodayar, S.] Mediterranean Ctr Environm Studies CEAM, Valencia, Spain; [Caldas-Alvarez, A.] Karlsruhe Inst Technol KIT, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res IMK TRO, Karlsruhe, Germany; [Khodayar, S.] Mediterranean Ctr Environm Studies CEAM, Technol Pk,Charles R Darwin St 14, Paterna 46980, Valencia, Spain",Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology,"Khodayar, S (corresponding author), Mediterranean Ctr Environm Studies CEAM, Technol Pk,Charles R Darwin St 14, Paterna 46980, Valencia, Spain.",Khodayar_sam@gva.es,,,"MISTRALS projects [ANR-11-BS56-0005]; Bundesministerium fuer Bildung und Forschung (BMBF; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research) project [CIDEGENT/2018/017]; Generalitat Valenciana; project MED-EXTREME, program Generacio Talent of Generalitat Valenciana [01 LP 1901 A]; project A1-SEVERE -Scale Dependent Process Representation and Sensitivity Analysis for Most Extreme Events;  [01LN1319A]","MISTRALS projects; Bundesministerium fuer Bildung und Forschung (BMBF; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research) project(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); Generalitat Valenciana(Center for Forestry Research & Experimentation (CIEF)European Commission); project MED-EXTREME, program Generacio Talent of Generalitat Valenciana(Center for Forestry Research & Experimentation (CIEF)); project A1-SEVERE -Scale Dependent Process Representation and Sensitivity Analysis for Most Extreme Events; ","The Precipitation -CMORPH Climate Data Record (CDR) used in this study was acquired from the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP).

There are a number of key standardized stability tests established by the International Electrotechnical Commission for commercialized photovoltaic modules. Based on these procedures, the possible causes and related mechanisms of the material degradation that can arise during the test procedures are identified, which are discussed in terms of their chemical bonds. Based on the understanding of the critical causes, promising strategies for mitigating the causes to enhance the stability of perovskite solar cells are summarized.

Monte Carlo simulation is used to implement the system model with two scenarios; Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel is used in the first scenario to validate DVB-S2X system by comparing the results with ETSI standard. In the second scenario, the system is tested with Rician channel which represents the real channel for satellite transmission. Comparisons in bit and frame error rates have been made between those two models to observe the impact for Shannon channel capacity and spectral efficiency for different (MODCODs).

In particular, Copenhagen in Denmark and Oslo in Norway develop a blueprint to have 100% public transit electrification by 2030 and 2028, respectively. In this study, the lifecycle approach is applied to explore the role of electric buses in the electrification progress of the public transport system in different European countries. To better model the energy/fuel consumption, we integrate the theoretical model of human thermal comfortable temperature into our proposed framework. We take into account the effects of weather, the daily operation characteristics, and the energy mix of different European counties, and evaluate the lifecycle environmental and economic performance of electric buses. The result shows that the public transportation system with both hybrid and electric buses can be good compensation between financial and environmental needs instead of using electric buses to replace all the conventional buses. Moreover, the operational plan of the public transportation system mixed with electric and hybrid buses may be adjusted according to the seasonal temperature variation so as to maximize the environmental benefits. Considering the different economic and environmental scenarios of energy sources, some EU countries would be able to reduce or remove the incentives for electric buses.","[Lu, Chaoru] Oslo Metropolitan Univ, Fac Technol Art & Design, Dept Civil Engn & Energy Technol, Oslo, Norway; [Lu, Chaoru] Oslo Metropolitan Univ, Res Ctr Metropolitan Digitalizat & Smartizat MetS, Oslo, Norway; [Xie, Dong-Fan; Zhao, Xiao-Mei] Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Sch Traff & Transportat, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Xie, Dong-Fan; Zhao, Xiao-Mei] Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Key Lab Transport Ind Big Data Applicat Technol, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Qu, Xiaobo] Chalmers Univ Technol, Dept Architecture & Civil Engn, Gothenburg, Sweden",Oslo Metropolitan University (OsloMet); Oslo Metropolitan University (OsloMet); Beijing Jiaotong University; Beijing Jiaotong University; Chalmers University of Technology,"Lu, CR (corresponding author), Oslo Metropolitan Univ, Fac Technol Art & Design, Dept Civil Engn & Energy Technol, Oslo, Norway.",chaorulu@oslomet.no,"Qu, Xiaobo/AAG-4777-2021",,JPI Urban Europe-NSFC project named SMUrTS; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71961137008]; Research Council of Norway [299078]; Norwegian Directorate for Higher Education and Skills [UTF-2020/10115]; Swedish Energy Agency [2018-009396],JPI Urban Europe-NSFC project named SMUrTS; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway); Norwegian Directorate for Higher Education and Skills; Swedish Energy Agency(Swedish Energy AgencyMaterials & Energy Research Center (MERC)),"This research was supported by the JPI Urban Europe-NSFC project named SMUrTS.

J,"Dobbie, MF",,,,"Dobbie, Meredith Frances",,,Typing Colonial Perceptions of Carrum Carrum Swamp: The Expected and the Surprising,LAND,,,English,Article,,,,,,wetlands; colonization; nature-culture relationship; perceptual typology,AESTHETIC APPRECIATION; LANDSCAPE; VICTORIA; WETLAND,"Carrum Carrum Swamp was a vast wetland to the south-east of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, at the time that it was first sighted by white colonists in 1803. By 1878, the colonists had commenced converting the swamp to dry land for agricultural and horticultural pursuits, and 100 years later it was predominantly residential land. Shifting values in the 1970s led to environmental concerns about water quality in local creeks and Port Phillip Bay and subsequent residential development on the former swamp included the construction of stormwater treatment wetlands. Perceptions of wetlands are now diverse, including positive perceptions that support their presence in urban settings. In contrast, traditionally, wetlands have been perceived negatively, as waste lands, leading to their drainage. Nevertheless, alternative, perhaps positive, perceptions could have existed, only to be overwhelmed by the negative perceptions driving drainage. Understanding the full range of past perceptions is important to ensure that the historical record is correct and to provide historical context to contemporary perceptions of wetlands. It will better equip natural resource managers and designers and managers of constructed wetlands in urban locations to ensure that wetlands are healthy, functioning and appreciated by their local and wider communities. Thus, the perceptions of Carrum Carrum Swamp by colonists from 1803 to 1878 were examined through qualitative content analysis of historical documents, and a typology was developed. Seven different perceptions were identified: scientific, premodern, exploitative, romantic, aesthetic, medico-mythic and ecological. Most could be traced to the colonists' predominantly British heritage, but one perception arose in the colony in response to the specific environmental conditions that the colonists encountered. This ecological perception valued wetlands as places of predictable water supply in a land of unpredictable rainfall. It recognised wetlands as part of a broader hydrological system, with influences on the local climate. Its proponents promoted the need for a different approach to the management of wetlands than in Britain and Europe. Nevertheless, a dominant exploitative perception prevailed, leading to the drainage of Carrum Carrum Swamp. The typology developed in this study will be useful for exploring perceptions of other wetlands, both colonial and contemporary.","[Dobbie, Meredith Frances] Monash Univ, Monash Art Design & Architecture, Caulfield East, Melbourne, Vic 3145, Australia",Monash University,"Dobbie, MF (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Monash Art Design & Architecture, Caulfield East, Melbourne, Vic 3145, Australia.",meredith.dobbie@monash.edu,,,,,,,77,0,0,1,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-445X,,LAND-BASEL,Land,FEB,2022,2,,,,,,311,10.3390/land11020311,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land11020311,,,20,Environmental Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,ZN1VT,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000764831200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This issue is very crucial when the neural networks need to deal with signals of variable lengths, such as speech. Though various methods have been proposed in segmentation and feature extraction to deal with variable lengths of the data, the size of the input data to the neural networks still has to be fixed. A novel Self-Adjustable Neural Network (SANN) is presented in this paper, to enable the network to adjust itself according to different data input sizes. The proposed method is applied to the speech recognition of Malay vowels and TIMTT isolated words. SANN is benchmarked against the standard and state-of-the-art recogniser, Hidden Markov Model (HMM). The results showed that SANN was better than HMM in recognizing the Malay vowels. However, HMM outperformed SANN in recognising the TIMIT isolated words. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This article proposes a modified evolving granular fuzzy-rule-based model for function approximation and time-series prediction in an online context, where values may be missing. The fuzzy model is equipped with an incremental learning algorithm that simultaneously imputes missing data and adapts model parameters and structure over time. The evolving fuzzy granular predictor (eFGP) handles single and multiple missing values on data samples by developing reduced-term consequent polynomials and utilizing time-varying granules. Missing at random (MAR) and missing completely at random (MCAR) values in nonstationary data streams are approached. Experiments to predict monthly weather conditions, the number of bikes hired on a daily basis, and the sound pressure on an airfoil from incomplete data streams show the usefulness of eFGP models. Results were compared with those of state-of-the-art fuzzy and neuro-fuzzy evolving modeling methods. A statistical hypothesis test shows that eFGP outperforms other evolving intelligent methods in online MAR and MCAR settings, regardless of the application.","[Garcia, Cristiano; Leite, Daniel] Univ Fed Lavras, Dept Automat, BR-37200000 Lavras, Brazil; [Skrjanc, Igor] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Elect Engn, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia",Universidade Federal de Lavras; University of Ljubljana,"Leite, D (corresponding author), Univ Fed Lavras, Dept Automat, BR-37200000 Lavras, Brazil.",cristiano.garcia@ufla.br; daniel.leite@ufia.br; igor.skrjanc@fe.uni-lj.si,"Leite, Daniel F./E-2005-2011; Leite, Daniel F./ABD-9656-2021","Leite, Daniel F./0000-0003-3135-2933; Leite, Daniel F./0000-0003-3135-2933; Skrjanc, Igor/0000-0002-0502-5376",Slovenian Research Agency [P2-0219];  [Serra-1812-26777],Slovenian Research Agency(Slovenian Research Agency - Slovenia); ,"The work of D.

Since 2002, the program's faculty has been moving from hybrid to online learning for its graduate teaching candidates not because teaching or learning was believed to be more effective than it would be face-to-face; but a change that was necessary to prepare Career Changers who could address the learning environments of the 'digital learner' by delivering instruction that incorporated 'best practices' in ways that were more motivational and engaging. Further, the faculty wanted to afford graduate candidates the opportunity to earn a Masters' Degree at a distance due to eight hour work schedules and other commitments that might lessen their motivation to teach or reach their goal. As career changers seek teaching jobs, they will need the skills to address the demands of P-12 schools offering virtual summer schools via hybrid or online courses for credit recovery. Beyond the latter, it was based on the belief that P-12 schools seek not only effective traditional (face-to-face) teachers in classrooms, but also those who would be as effective or more effective at a distance in a virtual environment during the school day. Also, it was not unrealistic to believe that P-12 schools seek teachers with skills to expand after school programs (remediation or acceleration) and foster greater parental involvement, input and participation with greater opportunities to better meet needs for diversity and variability (students and parents). The goal was to prepare candidates for the schools that The American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education (AACTE) and the Partnership for 21st Century Skills (P21) demand to bring curricula in line with the 21st - century. The major focus of this article is a continuum for not only equipping Career Changers with teaching methodology, but also preparing them concurrently to apply the methodologies using state-of-the-art-technology. The article outlines the steps that have been taken and what must be done to reach the goal. Phase I began by identifying the faculty's technology experiences (novices to expert scale) relative to distance learning, researching practices, correlating instructional methodology (traditionally versus electronically), assessing learning, teaching styles (techniques and strategies), reviewing courses (hybrid, online or neither) and being realistic about the availability and acquisition of resources (human, material and funding). Phase II focused on candidates (career background, degree area, learning communities, desire and readiness, learning climate and environment). In the first two Phases, there was not any naivety to fears, barriers, interactions, myths, computer phobia, resistance, and other human related factors. Phase III is not the final phase, but focused on the Computer Management System to deliver the instruction at a distance. The training needs of faculty meant moving from a seemly email only comfort level for some to a delivery system that the College changed three times from 2004 to 2010 while it simultaneously implemented an electronic assessment system. Thus far 'success' has been moving courses from 25% to 75% hybrid to 100% online while some traditionally remain face-to-face. The realization is that we have been deliberate, but cautious in the undertaking and growing as a higher education faculty in the 21st century.","[Brooks, Constance E.] Bowie State Univ, Coll Educ, Dept Teaching Learning & Profess, Bowie, MD USA",University System of Maryland; Bowie State University,,cebrooks@bowiestate.edu,,,,,,,4,0,0,1,6,IATED-INT ASSOC TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION & DEVELOPMENT,VALENICA,"LAURI VOLPI 6, VALENICA, BURJASSOT 46100, SPAIN",2340-1117,,978-84-695-3491-5,EDULEARN PROC,,,2012,,,,,2970,2974,,,,,,5,Education & Educational Research,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Education & Educational Research,BHP41,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000326239303005,View Full Record in Web of Science

We take advantage of the TF-IDF voting scheme to give more weights to more discriminative facial features. First, features are extracted from facial components instead of the whole face which preserves more informative and person-specific features. Then, an adjacent patch-based comparison is performed to preserve more discriminative features at patch-level while scoring candidate face images. Finally, a weighting approach is implemented to give even more discrimination to different features from different face components. Experimental results on 1,000 face images from LFW (Labeled Faces in the Wild) indicate the superiority of proposed approach by means of higher mean average precision (mAP).","[Banaeeyan, R.; Lye, M.

Their association with aerobic reactors provides great removal of carbonaceous matter with lower energy consumption and sludge production, although it does not allow the reduction in the concentration of total nitrogen. An alternative that could provide nitrogen removal without the construction of new reactors would be the nitrified effluent recirculation to the anaerobic reactor, in which denitrification would take place. Therefore, in this study, we sought to perform the nitrified effluent recirculation to the packed bed reactor (PBR) and UASB and concluded the following: (a) due to the presence of filling material, PBR tended to present a better performance in denitrification and removal of organic matter and suspended solids than the UASB reactor; (b) when performing the nitrified effluent recirculation to anaerobic reactors, the COD/NO3--N ratio must not be less than 6; (c) the concentration of N2O in the biogas of both reactors remained below the detection limit, minimizing the production of greenhouse gases; and (d) the limitation of organic matter promoted partial denitrification, creating conditions for the emergence of anammox bacteria in the sludge.","[Duarte, Natalia Cangussu; Barbosa, Ariane Correa; Magalhaes, Taina Martins; Montagner, Cassiana Carolina; de Oliveira Cruz, Luana Mattos; Tonetti, Adriano Luiz] UNICAMP Univ Campinas, FEC, Sch Civil Engn Architecture & Urban Planning, Ave Albert Einstein,951,Cidade Univ Zeferino Vaz, BR-13083852 Campinas, SP, Brazil",,"Tonetti, AL (corresponding author), UNICAMP Univ Campinas, FEC, Sch Civil Engn Architecture & Urban Planning, Ave Albert Einstein,951,Cidade Univ Zeferino Vaz, BR-13083852 Campinas, SP, Brazil.",tonetti@unicamp.br,"Tonetti, Adriano Luiz AL/F-2408-2012; de Oliveira Cruz, Luana Mattos/AAR-8617-2021","Tonetti, Adriano Luiz AL/0000-0003-0910-401X; de Oliveira Cruz, Luana Mattos/0000-0003-3795-9111",CNPq (National Council for Scientific and Technological Development) [311275/2015-0]; FAPESP (Sao Paulo Research Foundation) [2017/07490-4],CNPq (National Council for Scientific and Technological Development)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); FAPESP (Sao Paulo Research Foundation)(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)),"The authors would like to thank CNPq (National Council for Scientific and Technological Development, process number 311275/2015-0) and FAPESP (Sao Paulo Research Foundation, process number 2017/07490-4) for financing this study.",,37,4,5,5,11,SPRINGER INT PUBL AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",0049-6979,1573-2932,,WATER AIR SOIL POLL,Water Air Soil Pollut.,3-Feb,2021,2,,,,,,54,10.1007/s11270-021-05009-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-021-05009-2,,,11,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences; Water Resources,QF2GZ,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000616718900002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Positive electrode (cathode) materials within such batteries are rich in critical metals-particularly lithium, cobalt, and nickel. The large-scale mining of such metals, to meet increasing battery demands, poses concerns surrounding material exhaustion in addition to further environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues. In particular, unethical mining practices and political instability within the Democratic Republic of the Congo (the world's largest cobalt producer) have prompted research into cobalt-low and cobalt-free alternatives. This review aims to provide a holistic view of lithium-ion cathode development and inform advancements by highlighting the interdependencies across mining, material development, and end-of-life management. While material sustainability is reported through supply and demand projections, the potential socioenvironmental impacts of lithium-ion battery technology represent a hugely underresearched area among the aforementioned themes. Notably, the lack of attention paid toward future implications of increased nickel use across material management and development disciplines is also discussed.","[Murdock, Beth E.; Toghill, Kathryn E.; Tapia-Ruiz, Nuria] Univ Lancaster, Dept Chem, Lancaster LA1 4YB, England; [Murdock, Beth E.] Univ Lancaster, Inst Mat Sci, Lancaster LA1 4YB, England; [Tapia-Ruiz, Nuria] Faraday Inst, Quad 1 Harwell Sci & Innovat Campus, Didcot OX11 0RA, Oxon, England",Lancaster University; Lancaster University,"Tapia-Ruiz, N (corresponding author), Univ Lancaster, Dept Chem, Lancaster LA1 4YB, England.",n.tapiaruiz@lancaster.ac.uk,,"Tapia Ruiz, Nuria/0000-0002-5005-7043",Leverhulme Doctoral Scholarships Programme in Material Social Futures [DS-2017-036]; Faraday Institution [FIRG017],Leverhulme Doctoral Scholarships Programme in Material Social Futures; Faraday Institution,K.E.T. and N.T.-R. gratefully acknowledge the support of the Leverhulme Doctoral Scholarships Programme in Material Social Futures (grant number DS-2017-036) for the provision of a PhD studentship to B.E.M.

Are some students high achieving because they attend School A, while others struggle because they attend School B, as critical discourse on schools argues? Alternatively, is educational inequality driven largely by social forces outside of the school, in the home and neighborhood environment, or by educational processes that are largely common across schools as much social science research argues? Analyses of school achievement, and in particular test score gains from year-to-year, suggest very small between-school differences. Yet, analyses of test score data alone may fail to reveal important school-to-school differences that affect the quality of the classroom experience and a variety of educational outcomes. Purpose/Objective: We provide evidence on the following research questions. What is the magnitude of school-to-school variation in instructional practice, as captured by multiple measures? Are some domains of instruction (e.g., behavioral management) more variable between schools than others? To what extent are school-to-school differences in instruction associated with compositional characteristics of students and teachers? Research Design: This study relies on the Measures of Effective Teaching Study data, which offer an unprecedented set of observations of teachers' instruction scored on state-of-the-art observational protocols. To examine the extent of school-to-school variation in instructional practice in elementary and middle schools, we conducted a decomposition of variance analysis using summary scores on multiple measures. We further examine behavioral climate as revealed during instruction separately from overall instructional practice. Next, we examine differences in instruction associated with compositional characteristics of students using multilevel models. Finally, we use an innovative two-stage statistical adjustment strategy to more narrowly identify the possible association between composition and teaching practice due to school-to-school teacher sorting. Findings/Results: The basic descriptive results from this study suggest a middle view of school-to-school differences in instruction. We find that substantial school-level variation in instruction exists, with 30% or more of the total variance in instruction lying between schools in these data. Behavioral climate during instruction appears to be particularly salient, and especially in elementary schools. Much of the between school variance we identify, in some cases 40% or more, is readily explained by simple measures of socio-demographic composition, including in particular the racial make-up of schools in the MET districts. Finally, some evidence from a statistical adjustment method suggests that teacher sorting, rather than measurement bias and teacher adaptation, is principally responsible for school-to-school differences in instruction. Conclusions/Recommendations: More than an academic debate, basic differences between schools in the quality of the learning environment, along with parental understandings and beliefs about school effects, are potentially important drivers of school and neighborhood sorting and segregation, and even public investment in schooling. Additionally, this question carries continued policy relevance as states adopt and revise teacher and school accountability frameworks that implicitly attribute school-to-school differences to organizational functioning, and seek to carry out instructional improvement efforts in targeted schools. The basic descriptive results from this study suggest school-level differences are not as great as suggested by critical theory and the public discourse, but neither are they as inconsequential as one might infer from some social science research or the literature on value-added differences between schools.","[Kelly, Sean] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Educ Fdn Org & Policy, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; [Mozenter, Zachary] Bates White Econ Consulting, Washington, DC USA; [Aucejo, Esteban] Arizona State Univ, WP Carey Sch Business, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Fruehwirth, Jane Cooley] Univ N Carolina, Econ, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill,"Kelly, S (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Educ Fdn Org & Policy, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.",,,,,,,,97,0,0,1,6,TEACHERS COLL OF COLUMBIA UNIV,NEW YORK,"525 W 120TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10027 USA",0161-4681,1467-9620,,TEACH COLL REC,Teach.

The study focused on improvements to the performance of HOMME which is a Fortran 90 code with a hybrid (MPIOpenMP) programming model. The article describes the changes made to the use of message passing interface (MPI) and OpenMP as well as single-core optimizations to achieve significant improvements in concurrency and overall code performance. For our optimization studies, we utilize the Cori system with an Intel Xeon Phi Knights Landing processor deployed at the National Energy Research Supercomputing Center and the `Cheyenne system with an Intel Xeon Broadwell processor installed at the NCAR. The results from the studies, using workhorse configurations performed at NCAR, show that these changes have a transformative impact on the computational performance of HOMME. Our improvements have shown that we can effectively increase potential concurrency by efficiently threading the vertical dimension. Further, we have seen a factor of two overall improvement in the computational performance of the code resulting from the single-core optimizations.

Sufficient measured sample information is the basis of remote sensing modeling and estimation of grassland production. Limited by field inventory costs, it is difficult to collect sufficient and widely distributed samples in the Mongolian Plateau, especially in transboundary areas, which affects the results of grassland production estimation. Here, considering that the measured sample points are sparse, this study took Xilingol League of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in China and Dornogovi Province in Mongolia as the study areas, introduced multiple interpolation methods for interpolation experiments, established a statistical regression model based on the above measured and interpolated samples combined with the normalized differential vegetation index, and discussed the applicability of grassland production estimation. The comparison results revealed that the point estimation biased sample hospital-based area disease estimation method and radial basis function showed the best interpolation results for grassland production in Xilingol League and Dornogovi Province, respectively. The power function model was suitable for grassland production estimation in both regions. By inversion, we obtained annual grassland production for 2010-2021 and the uneven spatial distribution of grassland production in both regions. In these two regions, the spatial change in grassland production showed a decreasing trend from northeast to southwest, and the interannual change generally showed a dynamic upward trend. The growth rate of grassland output was faster in Xilingol League than in Dornogovi Province with similar physical geography and climate conditions, indicating that the animal husbandry regulation policies play important roles beyond the influence of climate change. The study recommended grassland estimation methods for an area with sparse samples and the results can be used to support decision making for sustainable animal husbandry and grassland succession management.","[Li, Qiong; Xie, Hongquan] Jiangsu Ocean Univ, Sch Marine Technol & Geomat, Lianyungang 222005, Peoples R China; [Li, Qiong; Wang, Juanle] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, State Key Lab Resources & Environm Informat Syst, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Wang, Juanle] Jiangsu Ctr Collaborat Innovat Geog Informat Reso, Nanjing 210023, Peoples R China; [Ochir, Altansukh] Natl Univ Mongolia, Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Ulaanbaatar 14201, Mongolia; [Davaasuren, Davaadorj] Natl Univ Mongolia, Sch Art & Sci, Ulaanbaatar 14201, Mongolia","Jiangsu Ocean University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; National University of Mongolia; National University of Mongolia","Xie, HQ (corresponding author), Jiangsu Ocean Univ, Sch Marine Technol & Geomat, Lianyungang 222005, Peoples R China.;Wang, JL (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, State Key Lab Resources & Environm Informat Syst, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.;Wang, JL (corresponding author), Jiangsu Ctr Collaborat Innovat Geog Informat Reso, Nanjing 210023, Peoples R China.",liqiong@lreis.ac.cn; wangjl@igsnrr.ac.cn; xiehongquan@163.com; altansukh22@yahoo.com; davaadorj@num.edu.mn,"; , Juanle/R-8881-2016","Davaasuren, Davaadorj/0000-0001-9638-6793; Ochir, Altansukh/0000-0001-7903-8594; , Juanle/0000-0002-5641-0813","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41971385, 32161143025]; Strategic Priority Research Program (Class A) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA2003020302]; National University of Mongolia [P2020-3779]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Strategic Priority Research Program (Class A) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences; National University of Mongolia,"FundingThis research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41971385 and 32161143025), the Strategic Priority Research Program (Class A) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Grant No.: XDA2003020302), and the National University of Mongolia (Grant No: P2020-3779).",,25,2,2,7,7,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,MAR,2022,5,,,,,,3122,10.3390/su14053122,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14053122,,,16,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,ZT1NP,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000768922500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Researchers are still unclear, however, which climatic/environmental parameter is the primary control on Pleistocene faunal delta N-15 values. Through extensive nitrogen isotope analysis of Late Pleistocene reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) collagen we investigated whether permafrost development during the Late Pleistocene coincided with changes in delta N-15 values. After 45 ka BP reindeer delta N-15 declined, with lowest delta N-15 values observed after the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), between 15 and 11 ka BP. The decline in delta N-15 appears to be of a greater magnitude in more northern regions than in the South of France, a pattern similar to that previously observed for horse. On a global scale, ecosystem delta N-15 is controlled by the relative openness of the nitrogen cycle, which in turn is controlled by climate. Low soil and plant delta N-15 are observed in cold and/or wet regions and high delta N-15 are seen in hot and/or and areas. The regional pattern in reindeer delta N-15 decline mimics the pattern of climatic deterioration in Europe culminating at the LGM, with climate cooling being more intense in northern Europe than in southern Europe. However, the lowest reindeer delta N-15 values are observed after temperatures started to rise. This may have been due to a lag in the response of the nitrogen cycle to increasing temperatures. Alternatively it may have been linked to the influence of permafrost degradation on soil and plant delta N-15 and thus faunal delta N-15. The renewed climatic cooling during the Younger Dryas did not see a fall in reindeer delta N-15. Limited data does, however, suggest a post Younger Dryas depletion in reindeer delta N-15 values.

Climate determines the limits of where a parasite species can survive the external environment and weather determines the transmission pattern within the climatic bounds [Levine, N.D., 1963. Adv. Vet. Sci. 8, 215-261]. Arid areas have a more limited exposure potential to important parasites but the level of exposure can nonetheless lead to disease. It must be remembered that, even in arid areas, it does rain and irrigation, overflow from water troughs, dew dripping off buildings and on the vegetation can also provide the medium to allow escape of larval cyathostomes from feces to forage. How horses earn their living is most important in determining the level of exposure to cyathostomes. Recreational grazing, which surely does more for the soul of the owner than for the nutrition of the horse, almost absolutely insures that horses will encounter larvae. To be certain, in arid areas there may be an opportunity for horses to spatially separate grazing and dunging areas but not all horses are so disposed, and even if they are they may not he able to do so.

As part of the overall measurement strategy, a network of 13 flux 'super sites' (Level-3) has been established, covering European forest, arable, grassland and wetland sites, with the objective of quantifying the N budget at a high spatial resolution and temporal frequency for 4.5 years, and to estimate greenhouse gas budgets (N2O, CH4 and CO2). These sites are supported by a network of low-cost flux measurements (Level-2, 9 sites) and a network to infer reactive N fluxes at 58 sites (Level-1), for comparison with carbon (C) flux measurements. Measurements at the Level-3 sites include high resolution N2O, NO (also CH4, CO2) fluxes, wet and dry N deposition, leaching of N and C and N transformations in plant, litter and soil. Results for the first 11 months (1.8.2006 to 30.6.2007) suggest that the grasslands are the largest source of N2O, that forests are the largest source of NO and sink of CH4 and that N deposition rates influence NO and N2O fluxes in non-agricultural ecosystems. The NO and N2O emission ratio is influenced by soil type and precipitation. First budgets of reactive N entering and leaving the ecosystem and of net greenhouse gas exchange are outlined. Further information on rates of denitrification to N-2 and biological N-2 fixation is required to complete the N budgets for some sites. The quantitative roles played by CO2, N2O and CH4 in defining net greenhouse gas exchange differ widely between ecosystems depending on the interactions of climate, soil type, land use and management.

Women and URM students in four-year construction education programs are more likely to change majors or drop out when they are unable to develop a sense of belonging in their degree program, exacerbating the lack of diversity and labor shortages in the construction industry. Students' physical learning environment on campus can convey nonverbal messages regarding belonging, and can therefore influence student retention and persistence. This study systematically evaluated 140 physical artifacts (art, signs, photographs, etc.) on display in three construction education programs at US land-grant universities. Utilizing an existing visual anthropological taxonomy designed to interpret equity messages communicated by artifacts, researchers explored nonverbal messages relating to the question of who is valued and who belongs' in construction education. White men were regularly named and represented in positions of power and leadership in the evaluated artifacts. In contrast, women and URMs were typically underrepresented and unnamed, with people of color overly portrayed in construction manual labor roles. Results suggest that construction education programs can foster more inclusive student learning environments by diversifying and updating physical artifacts on display within department public spaces and classrooms.

It is increasingly used as a model species for Eco-Evo-Devo. Therefore, it is important to have an embryonic development table based on high quality images that will allow for standardized sampling by the scientific community. Results Here we provide high-resolution time-lapse videos to accompany a detailed description of embryonic development in A ocellaris. We describe a series of developmental stages and we define six broad periods of embryogenesis: zygote, cleavage, blastula, gastrula, segmentation, and organogenesis that we further subdivide into 32 stages. These periods highlight the changing spectrum of major developmental processes that occur during embryonic development. Conclusions We provide an easy system for the determination of embryonic stages, enabling the development of A ocellaris as a coral reef fish model species. This work will facilitate evolutionary development studies, in particular studies of the relationship between climate change and developmental trajectories in the context of coral reefs. Thanks to its lifestyle, complex behavior, and ecology, A ocellaris will undoubtedly become a very attractive model in a wide range of biological fields.","[Salis, Pauline; Roux, Natacha] Sorbonne Univ Paris, Observ Oceanol Banyuls Sur Mer, CNRS, UMR 7232,BIOM, Banyuls Sur Mer, France; [Salis, Pauline; Lecchini, David] PSL Univ, UPVD, CNRS, EPHE,USR 3278,CRIOBE, Moorea, French Polynesi, France; [Lee, Shu-hua; Laudet, Vincent] Acad Sinica, Inst Cellular & Organism Biol, Marine Res Stn, Lab Marine Ecoevodevo, Taipei, Taiwan; [Laudet, Vincent] Okinawa Inst Sci & Technol, Marine Ecoevodevo Unit, Onna, Okinawa, Japan",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Biology (INSB); UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); UDICE-French Research Universities; PSL Research University Paris; Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes (EPHE); Academia Sinica - Taiwan; Okinawa Institute of Science & Technology Graduate University,"Laudet, V (corresponding author), Acad Sinica, Inst Cellular & Organism Biol, Marine Res Stn, Lab Marine Ecoevodevo, Taipei, Taiwan.",vincent.laudet@oist.jp,,"Salis, Pauline/0000-0002-5690-3714; Laudet, Vincent/0000-0003-4022-4175","Agence Nationale de la Recherche [ANR-19-CE14-0010-SENSO, ANR-19-CE34-0006-Manini]",Agence Nationale de la Recherche(French National Research Agency (ANR)),"Agence Nationale de la Recherche, Grant/Award Numbers: ANR-19-CE14-0010-SENSO, ANR-19-CE34-0006-Manini",,56,1,1,1,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1058-8388,1097-0177,,DEV DYNAM,Dev.

However, the score performs poorly on small-sized datasets and low-identity protein sequences. Based on current in silico method, secondary structure can be predicted from local folds or local protein structure. In biology, the evolution of secondary structure produces local protein structure with different lengths. To precisely predict secondary structures, we propose a derivative feature vector, DPS that utilizes the optimal length of the local protein structure. DPS is the unification of amino acid propensity score and dihedral angle score. This new feature vector is further normalized to level the edges. Prediction is performed by support vector machines (SVM) over the DPS feature vectors with class labels generated by secondary structure assignment method (SSAM) and secondary structure prediction method (SSPM). All experiments are carried out on RS126 sequences. The results from this proposed method also highlight the overall accuracy of our method compared to other state-of-the-art methods. The performance of our method was acceptable specifically in dealing with low number and low identity sequences. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

One component of the PEM electrolyzer is the bipolar plate (BPP), which serves as a multifunction component during PEM water electrolysis. Titanium is typically regarded as the state-of-the-art material. Mechanically it could potentially be replace by lower-cost materials such as stainless steel, but under the harsh environmental conditions present in PEM water electrolysis, stainless steel is not corrosion-resistant and metal ions can dissolve. In this case metal ions would poison the catalyst and membrane, which leads to a reduction in the cell performance [1]. We have tested several coatings such as Au and TiN in PEM water electrolysis environments of varying severity for the application as a protective layer of bipolar plates. In order to determine possible candidates for a long-term test under real simulated PEM water electrolysis conditions, an experiment to determine pH value in PEM water electrolysis operation was developed to obtain the required pH value for the ex-situ testing of various coating materials.

The system consists of the Regional Atmospheric Mesoscale Modeling System (RAMS) coupled to a simple carbon flux scheme which is run in a coupled fashion on relatively high resolution (10 km). Using an Ensemble Kalman filter approach we try to estimate spatiotemporal carbon exchange patterns from atmospheric CO(2) mole fractions over the Netherlands for a two week period in spring 2008. The focus of this work is the different strategies that can be employed to turn first-guess fluxes into optimal ones, which is known as a fundamental design choice that can affect the outcome of an inversion significantly. Different state-of-the-art approaches with respect to the estimation of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) are compared quantitatively: (1) where NEE is scaled by one linear multiplication factor per land-use type, (2) where the same is done for photosynthesis (GPP) and respiration (R) separately with varying assumptions for the correlation structure, (3) where we solve for those same multiplication factors but now for each grid box, and (4) where we optimize physical parameters of the underlying biosphere model for each land-use type. The pattern to be retrieved in this pseudo-data experiment is different in nearly all aspects from the first-guess fluxes, including the structure of the underlying flux model, reflecting the difference between the modeled fluxes and the fluxes in the real world. This makes our study a stringent test of the performance of these methods, which are currently widely used in carbon cycle inverse studies. Our results show that all methods struggle to retrieve the spatiotemporal NEE distribution, and none of them succeeds in finding accurate domain averaged NEE with correct spatial and temporal behavior. The main cause is the difference between the structures of the first-guess and true CO(2) flux models used. Most methods display overconfidence in their estimate as a result. A commonly used daytime-only sampling scheme in the transport model leads to compensating biases in separate GPP and R scaling factors that are readily visible in the nighttime mixing ratio predictions of these systems. Overall, we recommend that the estimate of NEE scaling factors should not be used in this regional setup, while estimating bias factors for GPP and R for every grid box works relatively well. The biosphere parameter inversion performs good compared to the other inversions at simultaneously producing space and time patterns of fluxes and CO(2) mixing ratios, but non-linearity may significantly reduce the information content in the inversion if true parameter values are far from the prior estimate. Our results suggest that a carefully designed biosphere model parameter inversion or a pixel inversion of the respiration and GPP multiplication factors are from the tested inversions the most promising tools to optimize spatiotemporal patterns of NEE.","[Tolk, L.

Located in Vardo, Norway, The Steilneset Memorial, consisting of a Memory Hall and an installation entitled The Damned, The Possessed and The Beloved, is a collaboration between Swiss architect Peter Zumthor and the late French artist Louise Bourgeois. Vardo is the only town in Europe situated within the arctic climate zone, and the locale of the most severe 17th-century European witch-hunt. Witchcraft and accusations thereof are complex social and cultural phenomena. Some argue that they occur as a result of religious zeal and as attempts to rest economic and social control of regions. This paper will elaborate on these points by showing that spaces of witchcraft are fundamentally gendered spaces, as well as spaces of envy and of violence against women. Furthermore, it will argue that the isolated geographical setting of Vardo, its lack of plant life, chronic seasons and harsh conditions, its exposure to the north, and its genius loci, were implicit in the devastating account of the witch hunt. This case has been selected for two reasons: firstly, in reaction to current critiques of the architectural discipline that question its prioritisation of the visual sense. In which regard this paper hopes to illustrate The Steilneset Memorial as a suggestive and participatory environment, where evocative atmospheres have been concretised; secondly, to highlight nuanced and responsive architectural approaches on a site of female persecution and trauma.","[Jordaan, June] Cape Peninsula Univ Technol, Dept Architectural Technol, Cape Town, South Africa",Cape Peninsula University of Technology,"Jordaan, J (corresponding author), Cape Peninsula Univ Technol, Dept Architectural Technol, Cape Town, South Africa.",June.jordaan@gmail.com,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,0,ART HISTORICAL WORK GROUP SOUTH AFRICA-AHWG,PRETORIA,"ART HISTORICAL WORK GROUP SOUTH AFRICA-AHWG, PRETORIA, 00000, SOUTH AFRICA",0258-3542,,,SOUTH AFR J ART HIST,South Afr.

Coupled with the constraints derived from the deposit's paleoclimatic proxies, OSL dating places the accumulation of this terrace in MIS 5a, and radiocarbon dates from the overlying breccia cum alluvium (sub-complex AS1) fall in the middle part of MIS 3; the intervening hiatus relates to valley incision and attendant erosion. The two intervals represented remain largely unknown in Iberia, where the archeology of the early-to-middle Upper Pleistocene is almost entirely derived from karst sites; Cueva Anton shows that this dearth of data, often interpreted in demographic terms, has depositional underpinnings ultimately determined by past climate variation. In early MIS 5a, the paleobotanical evidence indicates climate conditions similar to present, albeit wetter, followed by progressive cooling, reflected in the replacement of Aleppo pine by black pine and, at the very end, juniper dominated landscapes the latter characterizing also mid-MIS 3 times. The variation in sedimentary facies and composition of the mollusk assemblages reflects the changing position of the river channel relative to the back wall of the cave. Such changes represented the major constraint for the occupation of the site most of the time inaccessible to terrestrial mammals, it was used throughout by the eagle-owl, explaining the abundance of rabbit bones. Human occupation occurred during a few, short windows of availability, and is reflected in well-preserved living floors defined by hearths, artefact scatters, and the remains of hunted herbivores. The stone tool assemblages are Middle Paleolithic, which, in Europe, implies a Neandertal identity for their makers and, hence, that Neandertals persisted in the region until GI 8. Cueva Anton's high-resolution record provides unique, critical information on the paleoenvironments and adaptations of humans in two short windows of time during which wetter conditions existed in SE Iberia, where arid or semi-arid climates prevailed through most of the Upper Pleistocene and the Holocene.

Design of suitable counter-measures requires detailed knowledge of the internal structures of rock glaciers, which can be obtained using geophysical methods. We examine benefits and limitations of diffusive electromagnetics, geoelectrics, seismics and ground-penetrating radar (georadar) for determining the depth and lateral variability of the active layer, the distributions of ice and water, the occurrence of shear horizons and the bedrock topography. In particular, we highlight new developments in data acquisition and data analysis that allow 2-D or even 3-D structures within rock glaciers to be imaged. After describing peculiarities associated with acquiring appropriate geophysical datasets across rock glaciers and emphasizing the importance of state-of-the-art tomographic inversion algorithms, we demonstrate the applicability of 2-D imaging techniques using two case studies of rock glaciers in the eastern Swiss Alps. We present joint interpretations of geoelectric, seismic and georadar data, appropriately constrained by information extracted from boreholes. A key conclusion of our study is that the different geophysical images are largely complementary, with each image resolving a different suite of subsurface features. Based on our results, we propose a general template for the cost-effective and reliable geophysical characterization of mountain permafrost.","ETH Honggerberg, Inst Geog, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; Univ Karlsruhe, Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, D-76021 Karlsruhe, Germany",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology,"Maurer, H (corresponding author), ETH Honggerberg, Inst Geog, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland.",maurer@aug.ig.erdw.ethz.ch,"Maurer, Hansruedi/A-6102-2012","Hauck, Christian/0000-0003-4488-6475; Maurer, Hansruedi/0000-0003-0131-1006",,,,,50,82,83,2,18,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0022-1430,1727-5652,,J GLACIOL,J.

Nonetheless, the more widespread environmental and climatic impacts of this large eruption are not well known because the eruption magnitude and date are not well constrained. In this multifaceted study we have resolved the date of the eruption to 431 +/- 2 CE by identifying the ash layer in a well-dated, high-resolution Greenland ice-core record that is >7,000 km from Ilopango; and calculated that between 37 and 82 km(3) of magma was dispersed from an eruption coignimbrite column that rose to similar to 45 km by modeling the deposit thickness using state-of-the-art tephra dispersal methods. Sulfate records from an array of ice cores suggest stratospheric injection of 14 +/- 2 Tg S associated with the TBJ eruption, exceeding those of the historic eruption of Pinatubo in 1991. Based on these estimates it is likely that the TBJ eruption produced a cooling of around 0.5 degrees C for a few years after the eruption. The modeled dispersal and higher sulfate concentrations recorded in Antarctic ice cores imply that the cooling would have been more pronounced in the Southern Hemisphere. The new date confirms the eruption occurred within the Early Classic phase when Maya expanded across Central America.","[Smith, Victoria C.; Miles, Dan; Sunye-Puchol, Ivan] Univ Oxford, Sch Archaeol, Res Lab Archaeol & Hist Art, Oxford OX1 3TG, England; [Costa, Antonio] Ist Nazl Geofis & Vulcanol, Sez Bologna, I-40128 Bologna, Italy; [Aguirre-Diaz, Gerardo; Sunye-Puchol, Ivan] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Ctr Geociencias, Queretaro 76230, Mexico; [Pedrazzi, Dario] Inst Earth Sci Jaume Almera, Grp Volcanol, Lab Geol Proc Simulat SIMGEO UB CSIC, Lluis Sole i Sabaris S-N, Barcelona 08028, Spain; [Scifo, Andrea; Dee, Michael W.] Univ Groningen, Ctr Isotope Res, NL-9747 AG Groningen, Netherlands; [Plunkett, Gill; Pilcher, Jonathan R.] Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Nat & Built Environm, Archaeol & Palaeoecol, Belfast BT7 1NN, Antrim, North Ireland; [Poret, Mattieu] Univ Clermont Auvergne, CNRS, Inst Rech Dev, Lab Magmas & Volcans, F-63170 Clermont Ferrand, France; [Tournigand, Pierre-Yves] Univ Padua, Dipartimento Geosci, I-35131 Padua, Italy; [McConnell, Joseph R.; Chellman, Nathan] Desert Res Inst, Div Hydrol Sci, Reno, NV 89512 USA; [Harris, Pablo Davila] Inst Potosino Invest Cient & Tecnol, Div Geociencias Aplicadas, San Luis Potosi 78216, San Luis Potosi, Mexico; [Sigl, Michael] Univ Bern, Phys, Climate & Environm Phys, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Sigl, Michael] Univ Bern, Oeschger Ctr Climate Change Res, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Gutierrez, Eduardo] Minist Medio Ambiente & Recursos Nat, Gerencia Geol Observ Ambiental, San Salvador 76230, El Salvador",University of Oxford; Istituto Nazionale Geofisica e Vulcanologia (INGV); Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Geociencias Barcelona (GEO3BCN); University of Groningen; Queens University Belfast; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite Clermont Auvergne (UCA); University of Padua; Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); Desert Research Institute NSHE; Instituto Potosino Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica; University of Bern; University of Bern,"Smith, VC (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Sch Archaeol, Res Lab Archaeol & Hist Art, Oxford OX1 3TG, England.;Costa, A (corresponding author), Ist Nazl Geofis & Vulcanol, Sez Bologna, I-40128 Bologna, Italy.",victoria.smith@arch.ox.ac.uk; antonio.costa@ingv.it,"Dee, Michael/ABA-4786-2020; Dee, M.W./AAU-3258-2020; Plunkett, Gill/F-3311-2010; Smith, Victoria/AAA-4152-2021; Costa, Antonio/D-2410-2009; Davila Harris, Pablo/C-7891-2013","Dee, Michael/0000-0002-3116-453X; Smith, Victoria/0000-0003-0878-5060; Costa, Antonio/0000-0002-4987-6471; Davila Harris, Pablo/0000-0002-0620-5459; Tournigand, Pierre-Yves/0000-0003-0803-9797; Sunye-Puchol, Ivan/0000-0002-1838-3666; Sigl, Michael/0000-0002-9028-9703; Plunkett, Gill/0000-0003-1014-3454; Scifo, Andrea/0000-0002-7174-3966",CONACYT-CB Grant [240447]; Natural Environment ResearchCouncil (NERC) [NE/5009035/1]; European Research Council (ERC) (ECHOES) [714679]; ERC European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [820047]; Juande la Cierva Grant [IJC-201630482]; NSF Division of Polar Programs [1204176]; NERC [NE/S009035/1] Funding Source: UKRI,CONACYT-CB Grant; Natural Environment ResearchCouncil (NERC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); European Research Council (ERC) (ECHOES)(European Research Council (ERC)); ERC European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme; Juande la Cierva Grant; NSF Division of Polar Programs(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"Fieldwork in El Salvador was funded by a grant awarded to G.A.-D.

This study was devoted to determining the bioclimatic conditions in the Klodzko region (SW Poland), where meteorological measurements have been discontinuous since 2006. Four stations with continuous measurements were analyzed. These localities are situated at Klodzko and its health resorts. Bioclimatic conditions were determined using the Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI). The study of variability in UTCI was performed in different circulation epochs. Additionally, a non-linear model for SW Poland was used to reconstruct the long-term trend of air temperature in the Klodzko region. Verification of this model was performed on the basis of own air temperature measurements in the period from April 2017 to March 2022. Analysis of thermal conditions in circulation phases showed higher air temperatures and UTCI values in epoch W (1989-present) compared to epoch E (1966-1988) at all analyzed stations. The non-linear model of meteorological data showed its applicability for data reconstruction in the region with an accuracy of about 67%. Further modification of the model may serve to increase its applicability to other locations in Europe or North America.","[Glogowski, Arkadiusz; Brys, Krystyna] Wroclaw Univ Environm & Life Sci, Dept Environm Protect & Dev, UPWR, PL-50375 Wroclaw, Poland; [Perona, Paolo] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, ENAC, IIC, Hydraul Platform LCH, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Perona, Paolo] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Engn, Inst Infrastruct & Environm, Edinburgh EH8 9YL, Midlothian, Scotland; [Brys, Tadeusz] Polish Geophys Soc, PL-50363 Wroclaw, Poland",Wroclaw University of Environmental & Life Sciences; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne; University of Edinburgh,"Glogowski, A (corresponding author), Wroclaw Univ Environm & Life Sci, Dept Environm Protect & Dev, UPWR, PL-50375 Wroclaw, Poland.",arkadiusz.glogowski@upwr.edu.pl; paolo.perona@epfl.ch; tbrys@tlen.pl; krystyna.brys@upwr.edu.pl,,"Perona, Paolo/0000-0002-5445-1451; Glogowski, Arkadiusz/0000-0002-7587-8892","Department of Environmental Protection and Development, Wroclaw University of Environmental and Life Science","Department of Environmental Protection and Development, Wroclaw University of Environmental and Life Science","This research was funded under the Leading Research Groups support project from the subsidy increased for the period 2020-2025 in the amount of 2% of the subsidy referred to Art. 387 (3) of the Law of 20 July 2018 on Higher Education and Science, obtained in 2019 and APC was funded by the internal funds of Department of Environmental Protection and Development, Wroclaw University of Environmental and Life Science.",,76,0,0,1,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JUN,2022,11,,,,,,6770,10.3390/su14116770,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14116770,,,17,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,1Z8WU,,"Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000809098200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The conservation, research organization and the diffusion of knowledge of a cave inaccessible to the public",CONSERVATION OF SUBTERRANEAN CULTURAL HERITAGE,,,English,Article; Book Chapter,,,,,,,,"The decorated cave of Vallon-Pont-d'Arc, in Ardeche, known as Chauvet Cave, discovered on 18 December1994 by Jean-Marie Chauvet and his companions in the Gorges de l'Ardeche, has been under study since 1988. From the beginning of this research, in response to a call for proposals by the Ministry of Culture and Communication for the scientific study of the Chauvet-Pont d'Arc Cave, certain principles were defined, inspiring the research and conservation actions that would be undertaken. This is the first time in the world that a multidisciplinary research team as diverse as this was conceived and composed for the study of a major rock art site. This would not have been possible without the motivation and financial support of the Ministry of Culture and Communication. Since then, several teams following a similar model have been formed elsewhere, particularly in the United States, South Africa and Australia. Diverse conditions must be meet for this type of teamwork to function. This vast cavern is a still active karstic system located under the high part of the cliffs of the Ardeche Gorges. The entrance was abruptly closed off from the outside by a rock fall around 22,000 years ago, tightly sealing and protecting the archaeological contents inside. From the moment of its discovery, this site was thus recognized for the exceptionally good preservation of the drawings and engravings on its walls, as well as of the paleontological remains and traces of human and animal presence on the floors and walls. This cave, occupied between 36,000 and 29,000 years ago was immediately protected and the decision was made not to open it to the public due to the fragility of its art works, its confined space, and its inaccessibility at the time of the discovery. Much thought was given to determining how the entrance would be modified and what types of equipment would be allowed inside. A raised metallic path was installed in the areas where the discoverers had walked on the ground. The research itself was first organized in function of these paths and when possible was extended into areas that are accessible without risk; these are zones that are covered with a thick layer of hard calcite on which a secondary system of removable paths can be installed. In parallel with these first modifications, climatic and biological studies of the cavity were undertaken. These studies led to the definition of a set of rules that has since been applied to all visits, including those associated with research activities. In addition to the climatic regulation of this cave system, variations in CO2 and Radon levels are today the most restricting parameters determining the conditions for human presence in the cave. Due to the remarkable preservation of the ground surfaces-on which we find many traces and remains of human and animal presence-our foremost priority must be to ensure the preservation of this cave, including its walls, climate and floors. The ultimate goal is to enable to pass on a cavern that is fully intact, where all types of future research will still be possible. The question of how to transmit and share knowledge is fundamental at this site, unique in the history of the development of modern human thought. Some answers have been found in the creation of an ambitious cave replica and learning center, as well as in a strict policy permitting only exceptional visits in the original cavern.","[Geneste, Jean-Michel] Ctr Natl Prehist, Sous Direct Archeol, Perigoux, France; [Bardisa, Marie] Direct Reg Affaires Culturelles DRAC Rhone Alpes, Chauvet Pont Arc Cave, Lyon, France",,"Geneste, JM (corresponding author), Ctr Natl Prehist, Sous Direct Archeol, Perigoux, France.",,,,,,,,4,2,2,0,2,CRC PRESS-TAYLOR & FRANCIS GROUP,BOCA RATON,"6000 BROKEN SOUND PARKWAY NW, STE 300, BOCA RATON, FL 33487-2742 USA",,,978-1-315-73997-7; 978-1-138-02694-0,,,,2014,,,,,173,183,,,,10.1201/b17570,,11,Archaeology,Book Citation Index – Social Sciences & Humanities (BKCI-SSH),Archaeology,BC3ZE,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000352104800021,View Full Record in Web of Science

For all three species, we assessed two minimal irrigation treatments and one rain-fed treatment to resemble Mediterranean climate conditions analyzing the thermal and hydrological performance of all three species and their substrates through an evaluation of green cover, mortality, and biomass. The most influential factors registered for all three species are the relationship between air and water in the substrate and the interaction between green cover and substrate, respectively, for summer and winter seasons. In particular, D. margaretae preserved more water in its substrate than the other species both in summer and winter and after each rainfall event. F. laevis registered the highest level of variation in terms of substrate water content and of rainwater retention. I. lutescens achieved low hydrological performance, a limited amount of green cover, and slow growth.

This study investigated the integration of smart factory technologies with urban manufacturing as a solution for the aforementioned megatrends. A literature review on related fields, mass personalization, sustainable manufacturing, urban factory, and smart factory was conducted to analyze the benefits, challenges, and correlations. In addition, applications of smart factory technologies in urban production with several case studies are summarized from the literature review. The integration of smart factory technologies and urban manufacturing is proposed as the urban smart factory which has three major characteristics, human-centric, sustainable, and resilient. To the best of the author's knowledge, no such definition has been proposed before.

The long-term integration of state-of the art models provides reliable statistics, missing in usual event studies, of air-sea coupling processes controlling tropical cyclone (TC) intensity. The coupling effect is analyzed through comparison of the coupled model with a companion forced experiment. Cyclogenesis patterns in the coupled model are closer to observations with reduced cyclogenesis in the Coral Sea. This provides novel evidence of air-sea coupling impacting not only intensity but also spatial cyclogenesis distribution. Storm-induced cooling and consequent negative feedback is stronger for regions of shallow mixed layers and thin or absent barrier layers as in the Coral Sea. The statistical effect of oceanic mesoscale eddies on TC intensity (crossing over them 20 % of the time) is also evidenced. Anticyclonic eddies provide an insulating effect againststorm-induced upwelling and mixing and appear to reduce sea surface temperature (SST) cooling. Cyclonic eddies on the contrary tend to promote strong cooling, particularly through storm-induced upwelling. Air-sea coupling is shown to have a significant role on the intensification process but the sensitivity of TCs to SST cooling is nonlinear and generally lower than predicted by thermodynamic theories: about 15 rather than over 30 hPa degrees C-1 and only for strong cooling. The reason is that the cooling effect is not instantaneous but accumulated over time within the TC inner-core. These results thus contradict the classical evaporation-wind feedback process as being essential to intensification and rather emphasize the role of macro-scale dynamics.","[Jullien, Swen; Marchesiello, Patrick; Lefevre, Jerome; Samson, Guillaume] Univ Toulouse, Lab Etud Geophys & Oceanog Spatiales, CNRS, IRD, F-31400 Toulouse, France; [Menkes, Christophe E.; Lengaigne, Matthieu] Univ Paris 06, CNRS, Univ Sorbonne, IRD,MNHN,LOCEAN Lab,IPSL, Paris, France; [Menkes, Christophe E.; Lefevre, Jerome] IRD, Noumea, New Caledonia; [Jourdain, Nicolas C.] Univ New S Wales, CIimate Change Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Jourdain, Nicolas C.] Univ Grenoble, CNRS, Lab Glaciol & Geophys Environm, Grenoble, France; [Lengaigne, Matthieu] NIO, IISc NIO IITM IRD Joint Int Lab, Indofrench Cell Water Sci, Vasco Da Gama, Goa, India",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Laboratoire d'Etudes en Geophysique et oceanographie spatiales; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle (MNHN); UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Universite Paris Cite; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); University of New South Wales Sydney; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA),"Jullien, S (corresponding author), Univ Toulouse, Lab Etud Geophys & Oceanog Spatiales, CNRS, IRD, 14 Ave Edouard Belin, F-31400 Toulouse, France.",swen.jullien@gmail.com,"Jullien, Swen/L-5610-2015; Jourdain, Nicolas/B-6899-2015; menkes, christophe/X-6073-2019; Samson, Guillaume/F-5795-2019; LEFEVRE, Jérôme/L-8569-2015; menkes, christophe/H-9085-2016; Lengaigne, Matthieu/K-4345-2013; Samson, Guillaume/B-7434-2009","Jullien, Swen/0000-0002-5389-0532; Jourdain, Nicolas/0000-0002-1372-2235; menkes, christophe/0000-0002-1457-9696; Samson, Guillaume/0000-0001-7481-6369; menkes, christophe/0000-0002-1457-9696; Lengaigne, Matthieu/0000-0002-0044-036X; Samson, Guillaume/0000-0001-7481-6369; Marchesiello, Patrick/0000-0002-1374-5701","Computing Center of Region Midi-Pyrenees (CALMIP, Toulouse, France) [1044]","Computing Center of Region Midi-Pyrenees (CALMIP, Toulouse, France)","The simulations of this study were conducted with HPC resources from the Computing Center of Region Midi-Pyrenees (CALMIP, Toulouse, France; Grants 2011, 2012, 2013-Project 1044).

For the electricity distribution industry, this has contributed to a growing need to understand how these network monopolies should adapt their role, activities, and responsibilities for a redesigned electricity market, given the growth of distributed generation, and the increased control and monitoring capabilities. Considering this, a foresight study on business model innovation, technological adaptation, and market design policy alternatives is presented. A Policy Delphi method was applied, involving two iterative survey rounds and 207 European experts, which assessed 57 policy alternatives. The results highlight adaptation challenges for implementing new technologies and business practices. Experts support innovation and transition to new roles, and innovative services, while warranting that core electricity distribution activities are secured. This shift in roles is expected to be achieved through research and development (R&D) support policies, innovation friendly regulatory frameworks, and concerted actions at the EU and Member States level. The results provide policy-adaptation guidelines for electricity distribution industry stakeholders.","[Pereira, Guillermo Ivan; da Silva, Patricia Pereira] Univ Coimbra, MIT Portugal Program Sustainable Energy Syst, Energy Sustainabil Initiat, Rua Luis Reis Santos, P-3030788 Coimbra, Portugal; [Pereira, Guillermo Ivan; da Silva, Patricia Pereira] Inst Syst Engn & Comp Coimbra, INESC Coimbra, Rua Silvio Lima Polo II, P-3030290 Coimbra, Portugal; [da Silva, Patricia Pereira] Univ Coimbra, Fac Econ, Ctr Business & Econ Res, CeBER, Av Dias da Silva 165, P-3004512 Coimbra, Portugal; [Pereira, Guillermo Ivan; Soule, Deborah] MIT, 77 Massachusetts Ave,E94, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Universidade de Coimbra; INESC Coimbra; Universidade de Coimbra; Universidade de Coimbra; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Pereira, GI (corresponding author), Univ Coimbra, MIT Portugal Program Sustainable Energy Syst, Energy Sustainabil Initiat, Rua Luis Reis Santos, P-3030788 Coimbra, Portugal.;Pereira, GI (corresponding author), Inst Syst Engn & Comp Coimbra, INESC Coimbra, Rua Silvio Lima Polo II, P-3030290 Coimbra, Portugal.;Pereira, GI (corresponding author), MIT, 77 Massachusetts Ave,E94, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",gpereira@student.dem.uc.pt; patsilva@fe.uc.pt; dsoule@dba2003.hbs.edu,"Pereira da Silva, Patricia/T-8544-2017; Ivan Pereira, Guillermo/U-3053-2017","Pereira da Silva, Patricia/0000-0002-5862-1278; Ivan Pereira, Guillermo/0000-0002-0576-4697","Portuguese National Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT) through POPH/FSE [PD/BD/105841/2014]; FCT [UID/MULTI/00308/2013, SAICTPAC/0004/2015-POCI-01-0145-FEDER-016434]; Energy for Sustainability Initiative of the University of Coimbra",Portuguese National Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT) through POPH/FSE; FCT(Portuguese Foundation for Science and TechnologyEuropean Commission); Energy for Sustainability Initiative of the University of Coimbra,"The authors acknowledge the Portuguese National Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT) for supporting this work through the Doctoral Grant PD/BD/105841/2014, awarded under the framework of the MIT Portugal Program funded through the POPH/FSE.

The fabrication of such SS316L/Nb composites using scalable and automatable powder metallurgical techniques as tape casting, screen-printing and field assisted sintering technology/spark plasma sintering (FAST/SPS) was described. Sintering behaviour and the interdiffusion at the SS316L/Nb interface were investigated. Powder metallurgical techniques such as screen-printing are the preferred method to achieve a porous Nb coating, while FAST/SPS is the preferred method for a better control of the SS316L/Nb interface by lowered interdiffusion. First electrochemical performance tests with SS316L/Nb composites demonstrate they have potential to replace the state-of-the-art titanium-based PTLs. The use of SS316L is expected to decrease manufacturing costs of PTLs, while the addition of niobium layer, due to its excellent corrosion resistance in acid environment, aims to improve PEMECs lifetime and performance.","[Daudt, N.

Choosing effective strategies is especially important for earthen heritage sites located in dryland regions, as many are experiencing rapid environmentally-driven deterioration. We use a newly developed cellular automaton model (ViSTA-HD), to evaluate the environmental deterioration risk, over a 100-year period, under a range of potential climate and conservation scenarios. Results show increased wind velocities could substantially increase the overall deterioration risk, implying the need for wind-reducing conservation strategies. In contrast, predicted increases in rainfall are not likely to increase the overall deterioration risk, despite greater risk of rain-driven deterioration features. Of the four conservation strategies tested in our model, deterioration risk under all climatic scenarios was best reduced by increasing the coverage of natural, randomly-distributed vegetation to 80%. We suggest this approach could be an appropriate long-term conservation strategy for other earthen sites in dryland regions.","[Richards, Jenny; Bailey, Richard; Mayaud, Jerome; Viles, Heather] Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, Oxford OX1 3QF, England; [Guo, Qinglin] Dunhuang Acad, Dunhuang 736200, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xudong] Palace Museum, Beijing 100009, Peoples R China",University of Oxford,"Richards, J (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, Oxford OX1 3QF, England.",Jennifer.richards@ouce.ox.ac.uk,,,"UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [EP/L016036/1]; Getty Conservation Institute; Science and technology department of Gansu province, China through the Dunhuang Academy [18YF1WA003, 18ZD2FA001]","UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Getty Conservation Institute; Science and technology department of Gansu province, China through the Dunhuang Academy","This research was funded by UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) grant for the Centre for Doctoral Training Science, Engineering in Art, Heritage and Archaeology (EP/L016036/1) in association with the Getty Conservation Institute.

Active citizenship encompasses a wide range of behaviors, one of them being pro-environmental behaviors. Few studies focused on the developmental factors that may predict these behaviors in adults, despite their crucial role in counteracting the current climate crisis. However, prior research showed that attitudes were typically major predictors of behaviors. This study thus tested a model that posited participation in organized activities in adolescence as a predictor of pro-environmental attitudes in emerging adulthood and these attitudes as a predictor of pro-environmental behaviors in adulthood. Methods Three hundred twenty-one participants (61% girls) from Quebec (Canada) completed all time points across a 17-year period. Participants self-reported their participation in organized activities (sports, cultural, prosocial) from ages 14 to 17, pro-environmental attitudes, from ages 18 to 22, and pro-environmental behaviors, at age 30. Results Results revealed that pro-environmental attitudes mediate the relationship between adolescent participation in cultural activities and pro-environmental behaviors in adulthood. Practicing sporting or prosocial activities in adolescence did not predict stronger pro-environmental attitudes or behaviors. Interestingly, pro-environmental attitudes consistently predicted pro-environmental behaviors later in life. Conclusions These findings and prior research suggest that participation in cultural activities may provide a space to discuss, imagine change, and cultivate sensitivity towards nature. This may contribute to the development of pro-environmental attitudes and behaviors later in life.","[Davignon, Lisa-Marie; Poulin, Francois] Univ Quebec Montreal, Dept Psychol, 100 Sherbrooke St W, Montreal, PQ H2X 2P3, Canada; [Denault, Anne-Sophie] Univ Laval, Dept Fondements & Prat Educ, Quebec City, PQ, Canada",University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal; Laval University,"Poulin, F (corresponding author), Univ Quebec Montreal, Dept Psychol, 100 Sherbrooke St W, Montreal, PQ H2X 2P3, Canada.",poulin.francois@uqam.ca,,"Davignon, Lisa-Marie/0000-0002-3015-5383; Denault, Anne-Sophie/0000-0002-0325-7472; poulin, Francois/0000-0002-6345-8233",,,,,79,0,0,5,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0140-1971,1095-9254,,J ADOLESCENCE,J.

Our data are drawn from new field research within the Trang AnWorld Heritage property on the edge of the Red River Delta, northern Vietnam. Key findings from this study include 1) that limestone forest formations were resilient to the large- scale landscape transformation of the Sunda continent at the end of the last glaciation; 2) that prehistoric human groups were probably present in this habitat through-out MIS-2; and 3) that the forested, insular, karst of Trang An provided foragers with a stable resource-base in a wider changing landscape during the late Pleistocene and into the Holocene.

We report a high level of fidelity between modern bone assemblages and living populations based on a 40-year study of the Amboseli ecosystem in southern Kenya. Relative abundance of 15 herbivorous species recorded in the bone assemblage accurately tracks the living populations through major changes in community composition and habitat over intervals as short as 5 years. The aggregated bone sample provides an accurate record of community structure time-averaged over four decades. These results lay the groundwork for integrating paleobiological and contemporary ecological studies across evolutionary and ecological time scales.

Among the different directives of IMO, currently especially the sulphur emission regulations pose challenges for the shipping industry. Related to this are the established Sulphur Emission Control Areas (SECAs) and the introduced global sulphur cap. To comply with the sulphur restrictions, according to the present technological state of the art, ship-owners have three options for their existing fleet: the installation of emission abatement technologies, the switch to low sulphur fuels, or retrofitting for the usage of alternative fuels. Regardless which option is favoured, most often selected solutions still depend on fossil fuels. The reasons for this can be traced back to the fact that supply of biofuels is not ensured in ports and generally seen as no profitable solution. This paper develops and examines an innovative business model with a special focus on liquefied biogas (LBG). The study bases on collected qualitative and quantitative data, which was used by applying the Business Model Canvas. The results will highlight that the business model bears the potential to promote LBG supply. Next to this, the research will show that blockchain and smart contracts are able to foster the implementation of the business model and optimisation of value chain operations. Lastly, economic advantages were highlighted within a case study that refers to the seaport Karlskrona in Sweden and the RoPax ferries from Stena Line that travel back and forth to Gdynia seaport in Poland.","[Philipp, Robert] Hsch Wismar, Univ Appl Sci Technol Business & Design, Wismar Business Sch, Philipp Muller Str 14, D-23966 Wismar, Germany; [Philipp, Robert] Tallinn Univ Technol, Sch Business & Governance, Dept Business Adm, Ehitajate Tee 5, EE-12616 Tallinn, Estonia",Tallinn University of Technology,"Philipp, R (corresponding author), Hsch Wismar, Univ Appl Sci Technol Business & Design, Wismar Business Sch, Philipp Muller Str 14, D-23966 Wismar, Germany.;Philipp, R (corresponding author), Tallinn Univ Technol, Sch Business & Governance, Dept Business Adm, Ehitajate Tee 5, EE-12616 Tallinn, Estonia.",robert.philipp@hs-wismar.de,"Philipp, Robert/ABG-1404-2020","Philipp, Robert/0000-0001-7649-0235",European Regional Development Fund - ERDF (INTERREG V B: Baltic Sea Region programme & INTERREG V A: South Baltic programme),European Regional Development Fund - ERDF (INTERREG V B: Baltic Sea Region programme & INTERREG V A: South Baltic programme),This work has been supported by the European Regional Development Fund - ERDF (INTERREG V B: Baltic Sea Region programme & INTERREG V A: South Baltic programme) within the projects GoLNG and Connect2SmallPorts.,,67,4,4,8,27,SCIENDO,WARSAW,"BOGUMILA ZUGA 32A, WARSAW, MAZOVIA, POLAND",1691-5208,2255-8837,,ENVIRON CLIM TECHNOL,Environ.

The Malawi Earlier-Middle Stone Age Project has re-examined the site using new mapping and chronometric tools in order to reinterpret the site's significance within the context of current debates surrounding human origins and the potential role the environment played in shaping human behavior. The new data do not support the previous hypothesis that the site was an elephant butchery location (contra Clark & Haynes, ; Clark etal., ; Kaufulu, ). Instead, the evidence shows successive colonization of riparian corridors by MSA hunter-gatherers focused on exploiting localized resources during periods of generally humid climates while other lakes desiccated across Africa. We challenge the hypothesis that stable and intermediately high lake levels within the African Rift Valley System (sensu Trauth etal., ) catalyzed the evolution of regional interaction networks between 42 and 22 ka. Instead, we interpret the evidence to suggest that regional variants of technology persist into the late MSA as foragers focused on exploiting resources from local catchments.

Other adjustable parameters were the relative humidity (RH=50, 70 or 100%) and the concentration of SO2 (0, 0.1 or 1.1 ppm) in the weathering chamber. The dust, which was collected near all atmospheric test site of the UN/ECE ICP-materials project, was applied to the surface of the glass samples prior to the weathering experiment. Scanning electron microscopy in combination with energy dispersive microanalysis (SEM/EDX) showed that even after an exposure of 48 h a greater degree of higher weathering in the form of crystalline weathering products could be observed on those samples treated with dust compared to those without particulates on the glass surfaces. From the chemical point of view, the main Products of weathering were sulphates (mostly syngenite K2SO4 center dot CaSO4 center dot H2O, but also gypsum CaSO4 center dot 2H(2)O and arcanite K2SO4), even on those samples, which were exposed to atmospheres that did not contain SO2. The low background SO2-concentration in the laboratory as well as the sulphur content (sulphates, sulphites or organic compounds) in the dust seem to be sufficient for the production of sulphate products. At a relative humidity below 70% the corrosion rate seems to slow down significantly. The high degree of weathering oil the samples with particulates is probably due to deliquescent constituents in the dust. Hence, dust in the atmospheres of our cities seems to pose a significant risk for these glasses which are present in objects of our cultural heritage.","[Melcher, M.; Schreiner, M.] Acad Fine Arts, Inst Sci & Technol Art, A-1010 Vienna, Austria; [Melcher, M.; Schreiner, M.] Vienna Univ Technol, Inst Chem Technol & Analyt, A-1060 Vienna, Austria; [Kreislova, K.] SVUOM Ltd, Prague 170000, Czech Republic",Technische Universitat Wien; SVUOM s.r.o.,"Melcher, M (corresponding author), Acad Fine Arts, Inst Sci & Technol Art, Schillerpl 3, A-1010 Vienna, Austria.",michael.melcher@akbild.ac.at,"Kreislová, Kateřina/AAL-6360-2020; Melcher, Michael/W-4633-2017","Melcher, Michael/0000-0003-0633-9964",European Union [EVK4-CT-200100044],European Union(European Commission),The authors gratefully thank all partners in the MULTI-ASSESS project (Contract No. EVK4-CT-200100044) for the fruitful cooperation throughout the last years and the European Union for the financial support.,,56,20,20,0,13,SOC GLASS TECHNOLOGY,SHEFFIELD,"9 CHURCHILL WAY, SHEFFIELD S35 2PY, CHAPELTOWN, ENGLAND",1753-3562,,,PHYS CHEM GLASSES-B,Phys.

Complex vector-virus-host interactions lead to unpredictable epidemiological patterns. Difficulties in accurate surveillance including imperfect diagnostic tools impair effective response to outbreaks. With arboviral infections causing a wide spectrum of disease severity, from asymptomatic infection to fatal neuroinvasive and haemorrhagic fevers, the potential impact on blood safety is significant. Asymptomatic or presymptomatic individuals may introduce virus into the blood supply by donation, while recipients can potentially suffer severe consequences. Dengue, West Nile and chikungunya outbreaks have led to responses by blood transfusion services which can inform future planning. Reports of transfusion-associated transmission demonstrate the potentially fatal consequences of lack of haemovigilance. South-East Asia remains vulnerable to arboviruses with permissive climate and high levels of endemic transmission as well as the potential for emerging and re-emerging arboviral diseases. Resource limitations constrain the use of expensive technologies for donor screening. Continued surveillance and research will be required to manage the arboviral threat to the blood supply.","[Gan, V. C.

These WSNs allow real time monitoring, enabling intelligent decision-making to maximize yields and minimize cost. Designing and deploying a WSN is a challenging and multivariate task, dependent on the considered environment. For example, a need for network synchronization arises in such networks to correlate acquired measurements. This work focuses on the design and installation of a WSN that is capable of facilitating the sensing aspects of smart and precision agriculture applications. A system is designed and implemented to address specific design requirements that are brought about by the considered environment. A simple synchronization scheme is described to provide time-correlated measurements using the sink node's clock as reference. The proposed system was installed on an olive grove to assess its effectiveness in providing a low-cost system, capable of acquiring synchronized measurements. The obtained results indicate the system's overall effectiveness, revealing a small but expected difference in the acquired measurements' time correlation, caused mostly by serial transmission delays, while yielding a plethora of relevant environmental conditions.","[Zervopoulos, Alexandros; Tsipis, Athanasios; Alvanou, Aikaterini Georgia; Bezas, Konstantinos; Papamichail, Asterios; Vergis, Spiridon; Stylidou, Andreana; Koufoudakis, George; Oikonomou, Konstantinos] Ionian Univ, Dept Informat, GR-49100 Corfu, Greece; [Tsoumanis, Georgios] Univ Ioannina, Dept Informat & Telecommun, GR-47100 Arta, Greece; [Komianos, Vasileios] Ionian Univ, Dept Audio & Visual Arts, GR-49100 Corfu, Greece",Ionian University; University of Ioannina; Ionian University,"Zervopoulos, A (corresponding author), Ionian Univ, Dept Informat, GR-49100 Corfu, Greece.",azervop@ionio.gr; atsipis@ionio.gr; akorina@ionio.gr; kbezas@ionio.gr; aspapa@ionio.gr; svergis@ionio.gr; astylidou@ionio.gr; gtsoum@uoi.gr; vkomianos@ionio.gr; gkoufoud@ionio.gr; okon@ionio.gr,"Komianos, Vasileios/AAB-3329-2019; Oikonomou, Konstantinos/AAI-6188-2020; Koufoudakis, George/AIB-7969-2022; Tsipis, Athanasios/AAJ-4517-2021","Komianos, Vasileios/0000-0002-1955-6135; Oikonomou, Konstantinos/0000-0001-7279-9710; Koufoudakis, George/0000-0003-4214-5729; Tsipis, Athanasios/0000-0001-5069-3376; Tsoumanis, Georgios/0000-0001-9010-3422; Alvanou, Aikaterini Georgia/0000-0001-5605-5308; Vergis, Spiridon/0000-0002-7642-1392; Stylidou, Andreana/0000-0001-7816-9859; Papamichail, Asterios/0000-0002-5729-4017; Bezas, Konstantinos/0000-0003-4386-0353; Zervopoulos, Alexandros/0000-0003-1951-6149",project A PilotWireless Sensor Networks System for Synchronized Monitoring of Climate and Soil Parameters in Olive Groves - European and National Greek Funds (ESPA) under the Regional Operational Programme Ionian Islands 2014-2020 [MIS 5007309],project A PilotWireless Sensor Networks System for Synchronized Monitoring of Climate and Soil Parameters in Olive Groves - European and National Greek Funds (ESPA) under the Regional Operational Programme Ionian Islands 2014-2020,"This work was supported in part by project A PilotWireless Sensor Networks System for Synchronized Monitoring of Climate and Soil Parameters in Olive Groves (MIS 5007309), which is partially funded by European and National Greek Funds (ESPA) under the Regional Operational Programme Ionian Islands 2014-2020.",,104,20,20,3,15,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2077-0472,,AGRICULTURE-BASEL,Agriculture-Basel,MAR,2020,3,,,,,,89,10.3390/agriculture10030089,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture10030089,,,20,Agronomy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,LB1TJ,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000524417700035,View Full Record in Web of Science

Their technical indicators are changing rapidly since these technologies are in the initial stages of development. Determining the technical and policy targets for achieving the low-carbon transition is critical for regulators and power system planners. This paper defines this problem as a backcasting problem, whose concept is derived from environmental science research. We introduce it into the power system planning field and innovatively model it as a bi-level optimization problem. According to the characteristics of the backcasting problem, an improved barrier method is proposed to solve it efficiently. The effectiveness of the proposed model and algorithm are verified through case studies on a modified Garver's 6-bus system and a realistic Northwest China power system, and they are compared with state-of-the-art solution techniques. The results of the backcasting problem provide a new perspective on the economic impacts of the low-carbon transition and are helpful in energy policy formulation for power systems.","[Zhuo, Zhenyu; Zhang, Ning; Hou, Qingchun; Kang, Chongqing] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Elect Engn, State Key Lab Power Syst, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Du, Ershun] Tsinghua Univ, Inst Climate Change & Sustainable Dev, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China",Tsinghua University; Tsinghua University,"Zhang, N (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Dept Elect Engn, State Key Lab Power Syst, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",zhuozy17@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn; ningzhang@tsinghua.edu.cn; hqc16@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn; duershun@tsinghua.edu.cn; cqkang@tsinghua.edu.cn,"; Zhang, Ning/A-3217-2016","Zhuo, Zhenyu/0000-0002-1040-8611; Hou, Qingchun/0000-0001-8334-9897; Zhang, Ning/0000-0003-0366-4657","Science and Technology Project of State Grid Corporation of China [1300-202156423A-0-0-00, TPWRS-01474-2021]",Science and Technology Project of State Grid Corporation of China,This work was supported in part by the Science and Technology Project of State Grid Corporation of China: Evaluation technology of reasonable renewable energy Accommodation rate under energy transition.

Chullpas, however, were rarer on the coast, with the dead often buried individually in closed tombs. This article documents conditions under which these closed tombs were used at the site of Quilcapampa on the coastal plain of southern Peru, allowing an exploration into the ways that funerary traditions were employed to both reflect and generate community affiliation, ideals about sociopolitical organization, and land rights. After a long hiatus, the site was reoccupied and quickly expanded through local population aggregation and highland migrations. An ayllu organization that made ancestral claims to specific resources was poorly suited to these conditions, and the site's inhabitants instead seem to have organized themselves around the ruins of Quilcapampa's earlier occupation. In describing what happened in Quilcapampa, we highlight the need for a better understanding of the myriad ways that Andean peoples used mortuary customs to structure the lives of the living during a period of population movements and climate change.","[Jennings, Justin; Yepez Alvarez, Willy] Royal Ontario Museum, Dept Art & Culture, 100 Queens Pk, Toronto M65 2C6, ON, Canada; [Bautista, Stefanie L.] Univ Rochester, Dept Relig & Class, Rush Rhees Lib, POB 270074, Rochester, NY 14627 USA; [Scaffidi, Beth K.] Univ Calif, Dept Anthropol & Heritage Stud, 5200 North Lake Rd, Merced, CA 95343 USA; [Tung, Tiffiny A.] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Anthropol, VU Stn B 356050, Nashville, TN 37235 USA; [Alaica, Aleksa K.; Berquist, Stephen; Rizzuto, Branden] Univ Toronto, Dept Anthropol, 19 Ursula Franklin St, Toronto, ON M5S 2S2, Canada; [Gonzalez La Rosa, Luis Manuel] Univ Toronto, Archaeol Ctr, 19 Ursula Franklin St, Toronto M5S 2S2, ON, Canada",Royal Ontario Museum; University of Rochester; University of California System; University of California Merced; Vanderbilt University; University of Toronto; University of Toronto,"Jennings, J (corresponding author), Royal Ontario Museum, Dept Art & Culture, 100 Queens Pk, Toronto M65 2C6, ON, Canada.",justinj@rom.on.ca,,"Alaica, Aleksa/0000-0003-1142-9040; Scaffidi, Cassandra/0000-0002-0852-2829","Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [43150212]; National Geographic Society [9730015]; Royal Ontario Museum (Kircheis Family, Louise Hawley Stone Charitable Trust, and New World Archaeology grants); University of Toronto Archaeology Centre; Peru's Ministry of Culture","Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); National Geographic Society(National Geographic Society); Royal Ontario Museum (Kircheis Family, Louise Hawley Stone Charitable Trust, and New World Archaeology grants); University of Toronto Archaeology Centre; Peru's Ministry of Culture","This work was funded by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada Grant #43150212), the National Geographic Society (Grant #9730015), the Royal Ontario Museum (Kircheis Family, Louise Hawley Stone Charitable Trust, and New World Archaeology grants), and the University of Toronto Archaeology Centre.

A greater understanding of the spatiotemporal dynamics of these objects as they drift with ocean currents is critical for understanding historical changes in fishing power, spatial management, and examining the effect of ambient dFAD density on catch and effort. Here, dFAD dynamics were estimated for all floating object sets made by purse seiners in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean during 2016 and 2017. The drift trajectories of these floating objects prior to the observed fishing events were estimated by seeding virtual Lagrangian particles within a state-of-the-art hydrodynamics model, and simulating their movements backwards in time. Resulting trajectory distributions are similar to observed dFAD trajectories from the same period. The approach provides spatial density estimates in areas where observed dFAD data are incomplete, particularly in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of Howland and Baker Islands, and certain high seas areas. We provide estimates of inter-EEZ connectivity of dFADs, which highlight the fact that dFADs set upon in small EEZs such as Nauru and Howland and Baker Islands are likely to have drifted from neighbouring EEZs less than one month prior to fishing. dFADs typically transited multiple EEZs, with a median of 4 and a maximum of 14, when assuming a drift-time of six months. Moreover, between 4 and 22% of dFAD sets made in the WCPO were estimated to have originated from the Eastern Pacific Ocean, depending on drift-time. We examine our results in the context of the improved management and assessment of dFAD fisheries, providing a methodology to estimated relative dFAD density over historical periods to support analyses of catch and effort. The sensitivity of these estimates to hydrodynamic models, including the proposed SKIM doppler radar altimetry method, is discussed.","[Scutt Phillips, J.; van Sebille, E.] Univ Utrecht, Inst Marine & Atmospher Res, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Scutt Phillips, J.; Escalle, L.; Pilling, G.] Pacific Community SPC, Ocean Fisheries Programme, Noumea, New Caledonia; [Scutt Phillips, J.; Sen Gupta, A.] Univ New South Wales, Climate Change Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Scutt Phillips, J.; Sen Gupta, A.] Univ New South Wales, ARC Ctr Excellence Climate Extremes, Sydney, NSW, Australia",Utrecht University; University of New South Wales Sydney; University of New South Wales Sydney,"Phillips, JS (corresponding author), Univ Utrecht, Inst Marine & Atmospher Res, Utrecht, Netherlands.;Phillips, JS (corresponding author), Pacific Community SPC, Ocean Fisheries Programme, Noumea, New Caledonia.;Phillips, JS (corresponding author), Univ New South Wales, Climate Change Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW, Australia.;Phillips, JS (corresponding author), Univ New South Wales, ARC Ctr Excellence Climate Extremes, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",joes@spc.int,"Gupta, Alexander R Sen/B-7995-2011","Gupta, Alexander R Sen/0000-0001-5226-871X; van Sebille, Erik/0000-0003-2041-0704; Scutt Phillips, Joe/0000-0002-2884-4390",European Space Agency (ESA) through the Sea surface KInematics Multiscale monitoring (SKIM) Mission Science (SciSoc) Study [4000124734/18/NL/CT/gp]; Australian Research Council [LP140100327]; Pew Charitable Trust; SURF Cooperative [16371]; PNA office,European Space Agency (ESA) through the Sea surface KInematics Multiscale monitoring (SKIM) Mission Science (SciSoc) Study; Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Pew Charitable Trust; SURF Cooperative; PNA office,"This work was funded by the European Space Agency (ESA) through the Sea surface KInematics Multiscale monitoring (SKIM) Mission Science (SciSoc) Study (Contract 4000124734/18/NL/CT/gp).

The urban heat effect is where the condition the temperature in urban areas higher than rural. It becomes highly essential subject areas due to continues urban growth to fulfill the demand of the migration population from rural areas to urban areas. In general, prior work is limited to a subset of urban green space in mitigation of urban heat island. Hence, the effect of water bodies has not studied extensively, particularly in the tropical rainforest climate. Thus, understanding this is a key to uncover the origin of the influence land use/land cover in water bodies' effects on urban heat effect. For this study, the following critical data from Landsat 5 TM in the year 1988 and Landsat 8 TIR OLI. The first step this studied applied pre-processing, namely geometric correction, radiometric correction, and atmosphere correction. The second stage generates the land surface temperature (LST) for the year 1988 and 2019. The third stage performs 200 samplings, which 100 samplings to north and 100 to the south from Sarawak river. The measurement of LST takes from water bodies following next every 100 meters until it reached 1000 meters. The result did not demonstrate a direct correlation between distance water bodies and LST. The land use and land cover type of active influence on the LST pattern than the distance waterbody effect. However, the distance for water below 200 meters shows a strong relationship between LST. It notable that a close correlation exists between the LST distance of water bodies at this below 200 meters. The effect of the waterbody in reducing the LST at urban heat was active at a distance of 200 meters and below. There were clear benefits to be seen in the mitigation of urban heat islands.

A reasonable simulation of a tornado event in Beijing, China, on 21 July 2012 is obtained. The simulation reveals the evolution of a descending reflectivity core (DRC) that has commonalities with radar observations, which retracts upward right before tornadogenesis. Tornadogenesis can be divided into three steps: the downward development of mesocyclone vortex, the upward development of tornado vortex, and the eventual downward development of condensation funnel cloud. This bottom-up development provides a numerical evidence for the growing support for a bottom-up, rapid tornadogenesis process as revealed by the state-of-the-art mobile X-band phase-array radar observations. The evolution of the simulated tornado features two replacement processes of three near-surface vortices coupled with the same midlevel updraft. The first replacement occurs during the intensification of the tornado before its maturity. The second replacement occurs during the tornado's demise, when the connection between the midlevel mesocyclone and the near-surface vortex is cut off by a strong downdraft.

One approach is to evaluate the niche differences of populations of the same species that occupy regions that are geographically disconnected. Here, we assess niche conservatism along thermal gradients for 26 plant species with a disjunct distribution between the Alps and the Arctic. Location European Alps and Norwegian Finnmark. Methods We collected a comprehensive dataset of 26 arctic-alpine plant occurrences in two regions. We assessed niche conservatism through a multispecies comparison and analysed species rankings at cold and warm thermal limits along two distinct gradients corresponding to (1) air temperatures at 2 m above ground level and (2) elevation distances to the tree line (TLD) for the two regions. We assessed whether observed relationships were close to those predicted under thermal limit conservatism. Results We found a weak similarity in species ranking at the warm thermal limits. The range of warm thermal limits for the 26 species was much larger in the Alps than in Finnmark. We found a stronger similarity in species ranking and correspondence at the cold thermal limit along the gradients of 2-m temperature and TLD. Yet along the 2-m temperature gradient the cold thermal limits of species in the Alps were lower on average than those in Finnmark. Main conclusion We found low conservatism of the warm thermal limits but a stronger conservatism of the cold thermal limits. We suggest that biotic interactions at the warm thermal limit are likely to modulate species responses more strongly than at the cold limit. The differing biotic context between the two regions is probably responsible for the observed differences in realized niches.","[Pellissier, Loic; Vittoz, Pascal; Dubuis, Anne; Randin, Christophe F.; Guisan, Antoine] Univ Lausanne, Dept Ecol & Evolut, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Brathen, Kari Anne; Yoccoz, Nigel G.] Univ Tromso, Dept Arctic & Marine Biol, N-9037 Tromso, Norway; [Vittoz, Pascal; Guisan, Antoine] Univ Lausanne, Fac Geosci & Environm, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Meier, Eliane S.; Zimmermann, Niklaus E.] Swiss Fed Res Inst WSL, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Thuiller, Wilfried] Univ Grenoble 1, UMR CNRS 5553, Lab Ecol Alpine, F-38041 Grenoble 9, France; [Meier, Eliane S.] Res Stn Agroscope Reckenholz Taenikon ART, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland; [Garraud, Luc; Van Es, Jeremie] Conservatoire Bot Natl Alpin, F-05000 Domaine De Charance, Gap, France","University of Lausanne; UiT The Arctic University of Tromso; University of Lausanne; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape Research; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); UDICE-French Research Universities; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Universite de Savoie; Swiss Federal Research Station Agroscope","Guisan, A (corresponding author), Univ Lausanne, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Batiment Biophore, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",antoine.guisan@unil.ch,"Zimmermann, Niklaus E./A-4276-2008; Pellissier, Loïc/AAG-1013-2020; Pellissier, Loïc/J-2563-2015; Randin, Christophe F/K-6969-2016; Thuiller, Wilfried/G-3283-2010; Meier, Eliane S/D-5214-2012; Guisan, Antoine/A-1057-2011; Bråthen, Kari Anne/AAN-4666-2020; Yoccoz, Nigel/C-8561-2014","Zimmermann, Niklaus E./0000-0003-3099-9604; Pellissier, Loïc/0000-0002-2289-8259; Pellissier, Loïc/0000-0002-2289-8259; Randin, Christophe F/0000-0002-4171-0178; Thuiller, Wilfried/0000-0002-5388-5274; Meier, Eliane S/0000-0002-9545-1167; Guisan, Antoine/0000-0002-3998-4815; Bråthen, Kari Anne/0000-0003-0942-1074; Yoccoz, Nigel/0000-0003-2192-1039; Vittoz, Pascal/0000-0003-4218-4517",NSF [31003A-125145]; European Commission; European Research Council under European 80 Community [281422]; Danish Council for Independent Research [12-126430],NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre); European Research Council under European 80 Community; Danish Council for Independent Research(Det Frie Forskningsrad (DFF)),"We would like to thank those who helped with the field work, the Swiss Biodiversity Monitoring programme and Torbjorn Alm at Tromso University Museum for data and Sophie Cotting for help with the GIS.

Between user-driven Instagramming our everyday audio-visual experiences and professionally curated sound installations, there is an emergent space and a global audience for listening to 'soundmaps' of local and global environments. Sometimes interlinked and sometimes disparate, these communities connect to wider communities of practice and (environmental) activism in the context of social media, new media production and participatory cultures. There are also growing research initiatives that take up soundmapping as a way of inquiring into pressing spatial, geo-political and cultural issues primarily in cities and also in the endangered wilds. Interest in sound in a variety of interdisciplinary fields has grown exponentially over the last few decades. This article will externalize and analyse the frames of several emergent communities and their organizing themes as nascent in new media culture, and social networks specifically, as they intersect with phonography, creative soundmaking and 'citizen science. By pointing out normative logics embedded in the practice of soundmapping, I then work towards a language of critical soundmapping by way of three examples that I suggest function as alternative forms of representation of and communication about sound environments: (1) the curated initiative Cities and Memory, (2) the creative research project London Sound Survey and (3) the climate change project Biosphere Soundscapes.","[Droumeva, Milena] Simon Fraser Univ, Commun, Burnaby, BC, Canada",Simon Fraser University,"Droumeva, M (corresponding author), Simon Fraser Univ, Sch Commun, Fac Commun Art & Technol, 8888 Univ Dr, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada.",mvdroume@sfu.ca,,,,,,,40,7,7,0,12,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",2057-0473,2057-0481,,COMMUN PUBLIC,Commun.

Study areas differ with regard to climate and salinity: the boreal Curonian Lagoon (Lithuania) is oligohaline while the Mediterranean Sacca di Goro (Italy) is mesohaline. In each lagoon two sites were chosen representing areas impacted by river plume discharge and areas impacted by high organic matter deposition. Benthic fluxes of dissolved oxygen, inorganic phosphorus (DIP), iron (Fe2+) and manganese (Mn2+) were measured by dark intact core incubations in oxic and anoxic conditions. The latter were induced by incubation prolonged by up to 40 h depending on oxygen consumption rates. Solid phase P pools and pore water profiles of DIP, Fe2+, Mn2+ and sulfides were also measured before and after the induction of anoxia. Although incubation temperature and organic matter content were similar in plume and organic impacted areas of the two estuaries, higher benthic oxygen consumption rates were observed in Sacca di Goro, suggesting higher reactivity of the organic pool. Short-term anoxia had a significant effect on benthic fluxes of DIP (sulfide and Fe2+) only at the organic-rich and saline site of Sacca di Goro while internal buffers prevented inorganic P regeneration at the remaining sites. However, the analysis of pore water and solid phase pools revealed large variations during the transition and provided insights on the mechanisms controlling P dynamics. Both stations influenced by river plume deposition had high total inorganic P content (but most of it was refractory) and high reactive Mn pools, continuously regenerated by ventilation and irrigation of sediments by macrofauna. In these sites, oxygen depletion resulted in large accumulation of reduced Mn in the pore water but high fluxes of Mn2+ were also measured in the oxic part of the incubation suggesting the relevance of this respiration process. Thus Mn reduction preserved oxidized Fe pool and ultimately prevent P mobilization. Our results suggest that fluxes of DIP across the sediment water interface are controlled by an array of different and site-specific mechanisms. These biogeochemical buffers are effective and contrast massive P release to the water column in highly productive systems as coastal lagoons, where episodes of transient oxygen shortage are frequent.

Among the technologies, Molten Carbonate Cells (MCC) Operating in Electrolysis Mode (MCEC) represents a promising facility to valorize CO2-rich waste streams, which are typically available in industrial plants, by their conversion into a high-value H-2/CO syngas. These gaseous products can be reintegrated in a plant or reused in different applications. This study analyzes the integration of a system of the MCEC unit under different operating conditions in terms of composition, current density, and the utilization of fuels in a steam-reforming process of an Italian oil refinery via a mixed experimental-simulative approach. The aim of the current study is to assess the improvement in the overall product yield and further impacts of the MCEC unit on the plant efficiency. The results have shown that it is possible to obtain an electrochemical Specific Energy Consumption for the production of H-2 of 3.24 kWh/NmH23 using the MCEC, whereby the possible integration of a 1-MWe module with a reformer of the proposed plant not only increases the hydrogen yield but also decreases the amount of fuel needed to assist the reforming reaction and separates a CO2 stream after additional purification via an oxy-fuel combustor, consequently determining lower greenhouse gases emissions.","[Ferrario, Andrea Monforti; Santoni, Francesca; Della Pietra, Massimiliano; Simonetti, Luca] ENEA CR Casaccia, Lab Energy Storage Battery & Hydrogen Technol, Dept Energy Technol & Renewable Sources, Rome, Italy; [Ferrario, Andrea Monforti; Rossi, Mose; Piacente, Nicola; Comodi, Gabriele] Marche Poytech Univ, Dept Ind Engn & Math Sci, Ancona, Italy",Italian National Agency New Technical Energy & Sustainable Economics Development,"Della Pietra, M (corresponding author), ENEA CR Casaccia, Lab Energy Storage Battery & Hydrogen Technol, Dept Energy Technol & Renewable Sources, Rome, Italy.",massimiliano.dellapietra@enea.it,"Rossi, Mosè/AAN-1278-2020","Rossi, Mosè/0000-0002-2926-7580; MONFORTI FERRARIO, ANDREA/0000-0002-6449-9651",,,,,50,3,3,0,6,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",2296-598X,,,FRONT ENERGY RES,Front.

It is thus desirable to develop carbon electrodes that can exceed the performance of ACs benchmarks. In this work, nitrogen-doped mesostructured carbon nanocrystals (NMCs) have been developed by direct carbonization of highly ordered mesostructured polymers. Due to their mesoporous structure, high N content and large surface area, NMCs exhibit a maximum SAC of 20.63 mg g(-1). This state-of-the-art carbon electrode largely surpasses common ACs.

The improvement of thermally controlled construction materials can potentially result in lower energy homes/reduced emissions, and lowering the thermal conductivity of insulation materials improves home energy efficiency. Nanoporous insulation foams impart a drastic decrease in thermal conductivity but many polymer properties must be assessed to produce these materials. Passive phase-change materials also represent another key energy-saving device to control heat flux within a living space. Research into unique polymeric systems provides a novel means of encapsulation or creating polymeric cross-linked matrices to prevent leakage and improve mechanical robustness. These two areas of polymer research in architecture represent key advancements for construction materials aimed toward energy savings and energy-related emissions control.","[Heifferon, Katherine V.; Long, Timothy E.] Virginia Tech, Dept Chem, MII, 1075 Life Sci Circle, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA",Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University,"Long, TE (corresponding author), Virginia Tech, Dept Chem, MII, 1075 Life Sci Circle, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",telong@vt.edu,,"Heifferon, Katherine/0000-0003-2601-0509",,,,,92,3,3,4,57,WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH,WEINHEIM,"POSTFACH 101161, 69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY",1022-1336,1521-3927,,MACROMOL RAPID COMM,Macromol.

An attempt was made to explain the phenomenon of the development of Gothic elements in the construction of houses of worship in the late 20th - early 21st centuries, a chronological period that coincided with the collapse of the Soviet Union and Ukraine's independence. The connection and role of architecture with the dogmatic foundations of the doctrine of the SDA church have been established. The study partially refers to the methodological approaches proposed by Erwin Panofsky in his work Gothic Architecture and Scholasticism. The architecture of houses of worship largely depended on the political system and religious climate in the state. It is indicated that until 1917, before the Bolshevik coup, new Protestant movements, including the Seventh Day Adventist Church, had almost no opportunity to build houses of prayer and were persecuted, since there was a specific system of state-confessional relations in the Russian Empire. After the Bolshevik coup of 1917, the position of those churches that were based on the teachings brought from Western Europe and the United States succumbed to exceptional obstruction, and their clergy were repressed. Therefore, all the existing houses of worship had the appearance of barracks, not standing out among residential and industrial buildings. This situation largely persisted until the collapse of the USSR. Based on the analysis of the architectural features of the three main church buildings in the city of Kyiv, it is demonstrated that with the acquisition of Ukraine's Independence, architects, during the reconstruction and construction of houses of worship, are turning to borrow Gothic elements. This appeal is due to the fact that in their image, Gothic buildings, along with aesthetics, are able to embody important theological ideas and serve as visual preaching. The Seventh-day Adventist Church is open in its activities and is oriented towards the evangelization of society, and therefore it is important for it not only to declare its dogma but also to show an organic connection with the early history of the Christian church. Together with the high aesthetic content, the Gothic appearance of the buildings allowed the new churches to become attractive spiritual centers and important architectural dominants of the city.","[Kotliarov, Petro] Taras Shevchenko Natl Univ Kyiv, Dept Art Hist, Kiev, Ukraine",Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; Taras Shevchenko National University Kiev,"Kotliarov, P (corresponding author), Taras Shevchenko Natl Univ Kyiv, Dept Art Hist, Kiev, Ukraine.",pkotl.univ@gmail.com,"Kotliarov, Petro/X-4500-2018",,,,,,18,0,0,0,0,CHRISTIANS ASSOC RELATIONSHIPS EASTERN EUROPE,ELKHART,"C/O ASOC MENNONITE BIBLICAL SEMINARY, 3003 BENHAM AVE, ELKHART, IN 46517 USA",,1069-4781,,OCCAS PAP RELIG E EU,Occas.

The post-test analysis results of SOFCs are described after operation with different concentrations of phenol. The tests with pure syngas and up to 2 g/Nm(3) of phenol show a relatively stable performance in a short-term period of 500 h, but the test with 8 g/Nm(3) phenol shows drastic degradation. The microstructural changes of anode and support layers, phase changes, and carbon deposition were analyzed and discussed based on performance degradation and post-test analysis. No structural changes were found after tests with pure syngas. On the other hand, the addition of phenol causes macro- and micro-scale structural changes in the support, spreading from the fuel inlet. The support shows an erosion pattern and both Ni and YSZ were found as dust after the test. In these eroded areas, carbon fibers were observed by SEM and it was more pronounced with higher phenol content. There was no material phase transformation related to syngas or phenol, but surface carbon deposition was confirmed by Raman spectroscopy in the support and anode layers.

Three state-of-the-art deep learning models, including long short-term memory (LSTM), one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (1D-CNN), and convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM), were tested to forecast ETo on a daily time scale for seven days period. Daily air temperature (maximum, minimum and mean values), solar radiation, relative humidity, and wind speed data were collected for the 2011-2017 period from three weather stations (Harrington, North Cape, and Saint Peters) across Prince Edward Island (PEI), Canada. The relative importance method was used to determine the best-suited input variables for the models. The deep learning models were evaluated with the walk-forward validation technique using statistical measures of root mean square error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination (R-2). The FAO Penman-Monteith modified equation (FAO-56) was used as the reference method for comparison purposes. For calibration and validation evaluation in annually daily ETo forecasts, the hybrid ConvLSTM model recorded lower errors than CNN and LSTM with the lowest calibration and validation daily RMSE of 0.64 and 0.62, 0.81 and 0.81, and 0.81 and 0.70 mm/day for Harrington, North Cape, and Saint Peters weather stations, respectively.

The model system COSMO-ART (Consortium for Small-Scale Modelling-Aerosols and Reactive Trace gases) in which the emission and transport of mineral dust as well as the radiation feedback are taken into account, was used. The emission of mineral dust between 9 and 14 September 2006 occurred in association with the relatively strong monsoon flow and northeasterly trade winds, with gust fronts of convective systems over land, and with the Atlantic inflow. Additionally, increased surface wind speed was linked to orographical effects at the Algerian Mountains, Atlas Mountains, and the Hoggar. The dust, as part of the Saharan air layer, is transported at low levels by the monsoon flow, the Harmattan, the northeasterly trade winds, and the monsoon trough, and is transported upward in the convergence zone between Harmattan and monsoon flow, in the baroclinic zone along the West African coastline, and by convection. At around 700 hPa the dust is transported by the African easterly jet. Dry and dust-free air is found to the north-northwest of the developing tropical depression due to descent in an anticyclone. Based on the model data, it was possible to distinguish between dry (from the anticyclone), dry and dusty (from the Harmattan and northeasterly trade winds), and dusty and moist air (from the monsoon flow and in the tropical depression due to convection).","[Schwendike, Juliane; Jones, Sarah C.; Vogel, Bernhard; Vogel, Heike] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res IMK TRO, Karlsruhe, Germany; [Schwendike, Juliane] Monash Univ, Sch Earth Atmosphere & Environm, Clayton, Vic, Australia; [Schwendike, Juliane] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Jones, Sarah C.] Deutsch Wetterdienst, Frankfurter Str 135, Offenbach, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; Monash University; University of Leeds; Deutscher Wetterdienst,"Schwendike, J (corresponding author), Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res IMK TRO, Karlsruhe, Germany.",j.schwendike@leeds.ac.uk,"Vogel, Bernhard/A-9558-2013","Vogel, Bernhard/0000-0002-8894-0165",European Union Integrated Project AMMA; European Community's Sixth Framework Research Programme; Feasibility Study of Young Scientists of the Karlsruher Institut fur Technologie (KIT),European Union Integrated Project AMMA; European Community's Sixth Framework Research Programme; Feasibility Study of Young Scientists of the Karlsruher Institut fur Technologie (KIT),"This study was funded primarily through the European Union Integrated Project AMMA.

As buildings are one of the largest energy consumers, it is crucial that their thermal load can be inspected on a large scale and at the highest resolution possible. The proposed method is performed in two stages. First, the LiDAR data and buildings' metadata are preprocessed to generate high-resolution 3D building models that are represented by a triangle mesh. Thermal load of buildings throughout the year is then calculated per-triangle in a parallelised manner, while considering local micro-climate and shadowing from surroundings. Parallel design of the estimation enables significant speed-up of large-scale workloads, while maintaining accurate shadowing estimation. In experiments, the method was applied over a part of the city of Maribor, where heating and cooling loads were inspected in addition to other factors of thermal load estimation. Yearly thermal load calculation with an hourly time-step for 4,817 buildings with over 9.17 million triangles took about 8 min on a modern GPU. When comparing the run-times using a GPU and a modern CPU, the GPU was more than 60-times faster than a CPU for a million triangles. The speed-up grew with the number of triangles.

CO2 capture and storage has been identified as a promising short- to midterm solution, yet the underground storage of CO2 faces often severe public resistance. In this regard, the conversion of the CO2 captured into useful chemicals or fuels is an attractive alternative. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a process that directly integrates CO2 utilization into CO2 capture allowing for the full conversion of the CO2 captured and the selective production of a synthesis gas. The process is attractive both economically and from a process operation point of view as the coupled reactions are performed in a single reactor. The concentration of (unreacted) CO2 in the off-gas is below 0.08%, demonstrating the almost full conversion of the CO2 captured in a single, integrated step. Importantly, the process is demonstrated using a nonprecious metal catalyst and an inexpensive naturally occurring CO2 sorbent, viz., limestone.","[Kim, Sung Min; Abdala, Paula M.; Broda, Marcin; Hosseini, Davood; Mueller, Christoph] ETH, Dept Mech & Proc Engn, Leonhardstr 21, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Coperet, Christophe] ETH, Dept Chem & Appl Sci, Vladimir Prelog Weg 1-5, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Muller, C (corresponding author), ETH, Dept Mech & Proc Engn, Leonhardstr 21, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",muelchri@ethz.ch,"Abdala, Paula/D-8777-2015; Coperet, Christophe/F-1448-2018; Kim, Sungmin/M-3579-2016; Müller, Christoph R/J-6025-2016","Abdala, Paula/0000-0002-2011-1707; Coperet, Christophe/0000-0001-9660-3890; Kim, Sungmin/0000-0001-6602-1320; Müller, Christoph R/0000-0003-2234-6902",ETH Zurich; Swiss National Funding (SNF); ETH Research grant [ETH 57 12-2],ETH Zurich(ETH Zurich); Swiss National Funding (SNF); ETH Research grant,This research was funded by ETH Zurich and the Swiss National Funding (SNF).

Building adaptation, retrofitting and preserving optimal environments for artwork and exhibit preservation are inherently complex, multifaceted tasks. However, indoor microclimates do not only affect collections; occupants and visitors must also be considered. The aim of this research is to explore whether artwork preservation constraints in reused historic building affect patrons. The authors thereby promote a more comprehensive approach, combining the objectives of exhibit conservation, preservation of heritage buildings and adequate indoor conditions, particularly thermal comfort. Data was gathered using the Post-Occupancy Evaluation process applied to a case study where a combination of micro climate monitoring and questionnaire surveys was carried out over a 12-month period. Results demonstrate that: i) the existing microclimate did not always provide visitors with adequate thermal conditions, showing dissatisfaction during the cooling season (July-September), with average TSV values ranging from -1.03 to -1.13; ii) TSV and PMV values were significantly divergent throughout the year, with TSV mainly included within the ( -1, 0, +1) band and PMV mainly within the (0, -2) band; and iii) questionnaires show that visitor choice of clothing is made according to outdoor conditions, with some gender-related variations in the do level (higher for women), not ensuring thermal comfort inside the museum during the warm season. Results of this research highlight the limitations of Fanger's model when applied to such typology of buildings, emphasising the need for more research in this field.","[Martinez-Molina, Antonio] Univ Politecn Valencia, Camino Vera S-N, E-46022 Valencia, Spain; [Boarin, Paola] Univ Auckland, Fac Creat Arts & Ind CAI, Sch Architecture & Planning, 26 Symonds St, Auckland 1010, New Zealand; [Tort-Ausina, Isabel] Univ Politecn Valencia, Dept Appl Phys, Camino Vera S-N, E-46022 Valencia, Spain; Univ Politecn Valencia, Dept Engn Projects, Camino Vera S-N, E-46022 Valencia, Spain",Universitat Politecnica de Valencia; University of Auckland; Universitat Politecnica de Valencia; Universitat Politecnica de Valencia,"Martinez-Molina, A (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Valencia, Camino Vera S-N, E-46022 Valencia, Spain.",anmarmo4@doctor.upv.es,"Martinez-Molina, Antonio/I-3294-2019; Tort-Ausina, Isabel/Q-5976-2018","Martinez-Molina, Antonio/0000-0002-3937-7329; Vivancos, Jose-Luis/0000-0002-8524-5466; Tort-Ausina, Isabel/0000-0002-1900-914X; Boarin, Paola/0000-0003-3252-5699","Performance-Based Research Fund (PBRF) of the School of Architecture and Planning, The University of Auckland [A1707]","Performance-Based Research Fund (PBRF) of the School of Architecture and Planning, The University of Auckland","This research has been supported by the Performance-Based Research Fund (PBRF), year 2017, round 1 (Project n.

Only slight topographic modifications remain, typically associated with middens. Nonetheless, surface scatters, as well as the soil characteristics they produce, can serve as quantifiable indicators of an archaeological site, detectable by analyzing remote sensing imagery. A variety of pre-processed, very diverse data sets went through a process of image registration, with the intention to combine multispectral bands to feed two different semi-automatic direct detection algorithms: a posterior probability, and a frequentist approach. Two 5 x 5 km(2) areas in the northwestern Dominican Republic with diverse environments, having sufficient imagery coverage, and a representative number of known indigenous site locations, served each for one approach. Buffers around the locations of known sites, as well as areas with no likely archaeological evidence were used as samples. The resulting maps offer quantifiable statistical outcomes of locations with similar pixel value combinations as the identified sites, indicating higher probability of archaeological evidence. These still very experimental and rather unvalidated trials, as they have not been subsequently groundtruthed, show variable potential of this method in diverse environments.","[Sonnemann, Till F.] Otto Friedrich Univ Bamberg, Inst Archaeol Heritage Sci & Art Hist IADK, Kranen 14, D-96047 Bamberg, Germany; [Comer, Douglas C.] CSRM, 2113 St Paul St, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Patsolic, Jesse L.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Ctr Imaging Sci, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Megarry, William P.] Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Nat & Built Environm, Belfast BT7 1NN, Antrim, North Ireland; [Malatesta, Eduardo Herrera; Hofman, Corinne L.] Leiden Univ, Fac Archaeol, Einsteinweg 2, NL-2333 CC Leiden, Netherlands",Otto Friedrich University Bamberg; Johns Hopkins University; Queens University Belfast; Leiden University; Leiden University - Excl LUMC,"Sonnemann, TF (corresponding author), Otto Friedrich Univ Bamberg, Inst Archaeol Heritage Sci & Art Hist IADK, Kranen 14, D-96047 Bamberg, Germany.",till.sonnemann@uni-bamberg.de; dcomer@culturalsite.com; jpatso11@jhu.edu; W.Megarry@qub.ac.uk; malatesta@arch.leidenuniv.nl; c.l.hofman@arch.leidenuniv.nl,"Herrera-Malatesta, Eduardo/AAX-3507-2020","Herrera-Malatesta, Eduardo/0000-0001-5265-6296",European Research Council under the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7)/ERC grant [319209]; Digital Globe Foundation,European Research Council under the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7)/ERC grant(European Research Council (ERC)); Digital Globe Foundation,"The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Research Council under the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013)/ERC grant agreement no319209.

This demands redesign of everyday environments. However, the ways in which our material world shape our behaviors are still understudied and underappreciated. Not much is known about how collective behaviors are facilitated through infrastructural or material interventions. Here, we draw upon 15 years of experience at RAAAF, an Amsterdam-based collective for visual art and architecture, to introduce ten practical lessons for developing strategic design interventions for affordance-based behavior change in urban environments. Affordances are the possibilities for action provided by the environment. Strategic design interventions aim to set collective social change in motion by developing sustainable affordances and dismantling unsustainable behavioral constraints. Strategic design interventions seek to inspire policies and public imagination. Whereas scientific studies aim to describe reality as it is, RAAAF's material interventions help imagine how the shared urban environment could be in the future.","[Kaaronen, Roope Oskari] Univ Helsinki, Fac Biol & Environm Sci, Helsinki, Finland; [Kaaronen, Roope Oskari] Univ Helsinki, Helsinki Inst Sustainabil Sci, Helsinki, Finland; [Kaaronen, Roope Oskari; Rietveld, Erik] Univ Amsterdam, Acad Med Ctr, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Rietveld, Erik] RAAAF, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Rietveld, Erik] Univ Amsterdam, Dept Philosophy ILLC, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Rietveld, Erik] Univ Twente, Dept Philosophy, Enschede, Netherlands",University of Helsinki; University of Helsinki; University of Amsterdam; Academic Medical Center Amsterdam; University of Amsterdam; University of Twente,"Kaaronen, RO (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Fac Biol & Environm Sci, Helsinki, Finland.;Kaaronen, RO (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Helsinki Inst Sustainabil Sci, Helsinki, Finland.;Kaaronen, RO (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, Acad Med Ctr, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",roope.kaaronen@helsinki.fi,,"Kaaronen, Roope Oskari/0000-0002-2414-6974","Doctoral Program in Social Sciences at the University of Helsinki; Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO, VIDI grant) [276-20-019]; European Research Council (ERC Starting Grant) [679190]","Doctoral Program in Social Sciences at the University of Helsinki; Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO, VIDI grant)(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)); European Research Council (ERC Starting Grant)(European Research Council (ERC))","We are grateful to the people at RAAAF, especially Ronald Rietveld and David Habets, for sharing their expertise in their work.

However, growing concern over the embodied energy and carbon as well as resource depletion, is beginning to impact on the design and implementation of existing and novel building envelope technologies. Biomimicry is proposed as one approach to create buildings which are resilient to a changing climate, embedded in wider ecological systems, energy efficient and waste free. However, the diversity of form and function in biological organisms and therefore potential applications for biomimicry, requires a holistic approach spanning biology, materials science and architecture. It is considered timely to re-examine opportunities to learn from nature, including in the light of recent understanding of how plant form and function are determined at the cellular levels. In this article, we call for a systemic approach for the development of innovative biological and living budding envelopes. Plant cell walls are compared to building envelopes.

The latter reproduced realistic sea ice characteristics under the same external conditions. All three sea ice models employ a viscous-plastic constitutive law to describe the variation in internal ice stress in the momentum balance. The individual thermodynamic formulations were unified to provide consistent reference versions for this investigation. The sea ice models are compared under various conditions to detect first-order discrepancies. Finally, the treatment of the sea ice component in global OGCMs is discussed in a more general context, illustrating the effect of some simplifications commonly used in OGCMs. We focus on the Southern Ocean, where sea ice plays a critical role in bottom water formation. Our studies show that sea ice in present-day global OGCMs can be formulated with the same quality as stand-alone sea ice models designed for specific regional studies, without the sacrifice of notable extra computation time. A standardization of both the dynamic and the thermodynamic part of an OGCM sea ice component turns out to be necessary to prevent unrealistic upper boundary conditions in forced OGCM simulations and distorted sensitivities in coupled simulations.","MAX PLANCK INST METEOROL, DEUTSCH KLIMARECHENZENTRUM, D-20146 HAMBURG, GERMANY",Max Planck Society,"Stossel, A (corresponding author), TEXAS A&M UNIV, DEPT OCEANOG, TEXAS CTR CLIMATE STUDIES, COLLEGE STN, TX 77843 USA.",,,,,,,,70,6,6,0,0,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",2169-9275,2169-9291,,J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS,J.

In recent years, several multiscale and rotated box-based deep neural networks (DNNs) have been proposed and have achieved promising results. In this article, a new method for designing loss function, called adaptive saliency biased loss (ASBL), is proposed for training DNN object detectors to achieve improved performance. ASBL can be implemented at the image level, which is called image-based ASBL, or at the anchor level, which is called anchor-based ASBL. The method computes saliency information of input images and anchors generated by DNN object detectors, weights of different training examples, and anchors differently based on their corresponding saliency measurements. It gives complex images and difficult targets more weights during training. In our experiments using two of the largest public benchmark data sets of aerial images, DOTA and NWPU VHR-10, the existing RetinaNet was trained using ASBL to generate an one-stage detector, ASBL-RetinaNet. ASBL-RetinaNet significantly outperformed the original RetinaNet by 3.61 and 12.5 mean average precision (mAP), respectively, on the two data sets.

Recently, a machine learning method, graph neural networks (GNNs), has shown promising results for the prediction of structure-property relationships. GNNs utilize a graph representation of molecules, where atoms correspond to nodes and bonds to edges containing information about the molecular structure. More specifically, GNNs learn physicochemical properties as a function of the molecular graph in a supervised learning setup using a backpropagation algorithm. This end-to-end learning approach eliminates the need for selection of molecular descriptors or structural groups, as it learns optimal fingerprints through graph convolutions and maps the fingerprints to the physicochemical properties by deep learning. We develop GNN models for predicting three fuel ignition quality indicators, i.e., the derived cetane number (DCN), the research octane number (RON), and the motor octane number (MON), of oxygenated and nonoxygenated hydrocarbons. In light of limited experimental data in the order of hundreds, we propose a combination of multitask learning, transfer learning, and ensemble learning. The results show competitive performance of the proposed GNN approach compared to state-of-the-art QSPR models, making it a promising field for future research.

Since the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami, there have been significant advancements in warning methodology, pre-disaster preparedness and basic understanding of related phenomena. Yet, the trail of destruction of the 2011 Japan tsunami, broadcast live to a stunned world audience, underscored the difficulties of implementing advances in applied hazard mitigation. We describe state of the art methodologies, standards for warnings and summarize recent advances in basic understanding, and identify cross-disciplinary challenges. The stage is set to bridge science, engineering and society to help build up coastal resilience and reduce losses.","[Kanoglu, U.] Middle E Tech Univ, Dept Engn Sci, TR-06531 Ankara, Turkey; [Titov, V.; Bernard, E.] NOAA, Pacific Marine Environm Lab, Seattle, WA 98115 USA; [Synolakis, C.] Univ So Calif, Viterbi Sch Engn, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Synolakis, C.] Tech Univ Crete, Sch Environm Engn, Khania, Greece",Middle East Technical University; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Southern California; Technical University of Crete,"Synolakis, C (corresponding author), Univ So Calif, Viterbi Sch Engn, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",costas@usc.edu,"Titov, Vasily V/P-9579-2017; Kânoğlu, Utku/F-9037-2012","Titov, Vasily V/0000-0002-1630-3829; Kânoğlu, Utku/0000-0002-5952-0954; Bernard, Eddie/0000-0003-0054-2582","project ASTARTE-Assessment, STrategy And Risk Reduction for Tsunamis in Europe [603839]; project ASTARTE-Assessment, STrategy And Risk Reduction for Tsunamis in Europe, 7th FP [ENV.2013.6.4-3 ENV.2013.6.4-3]; US National Science Foundation [CMMI-1538624]; NOAA's Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory (PMEL) [4369]","project ASTARTE-Assessment, STrategy And Risk Reduction for Tsunamis in Europe; project ASTARTE-Assessment, STrategy And Risk Reduction for Tsunamis in Europe, 7th FP; US National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NOAA's Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory (PMEL)","This writing was partially supported by the project ASTARTE-Assessment, STrategy And Risk Reduction for Tsunamis in Europe.
